                  Wednesday, April 12.             I WILL pursue my melancholy story.             Being thus hurried to the chariot, it would have been to no purpose to have refused entering into it, had he not, in my fright, lifted me in, as he did: And it instantly drove away a full gallop, and stopt not till it brought us to St. Albans; which was just as the day shut in.             I thought I should have fainted several times by the way. With lifted-up hands and eyes, God protect me, said I often to myself!ÑCan it be I, that am here!ÑMy eyes running over, and my heart ready to burst with sighs as involuntary as my flight.             How different, how inexpressibly different, the gay wretch; visibly triumphing (as I could not but construe his almost rapturous joy) in the success of his arts! But overflowing with complimental flourishes, yet respectfully distant his address, all the way we <i>flew</i>; for that, rather than <i>galloping,</i> was the motion of the horses; which took, as I believe, a round-about way, to prevent being traced.             I have reason to think, there were other horsemen at his devotion; three or four different persons, above the rank of servants, galloping by us, now-and-then, on each side of the chariot: But he took no notice of them; and I had too much grief, mingled with indignation, notwithstanding all his blandishments, to ask any questions about them, or any thing else.             Think, my dear, what were my thoughts, on alighting from the chariot; having no attendant of my own sex; no cloaths but what I had on, and those little suited for such a journey as I had <i>already</i> taken, and was still <i>further</i> to take: Neither hood nor hat, nor any thing but a handkerchief about my neck and shoulders: Fatigued to death: My mind still more fatigued than my body: And in such a foam the horses, that every one in the inn we put up at guess'd (they could not do otherwise) that I was a young giddy creature, who had run away from her friends. This it was easy to see, by their whispering and gaping; more of the people of the house also coming in to view us, as it were, by turns, than was necessary for the attendance.             The gentlewoman of the inn, whom he sent in to me, shewed me another apartment; and, seeing me ready to faint, brought me hartshorn and water; and then, upon my desiring to be left alone for half an hour, retired: For I found my heart ready to burst, on revolving every thing in my thoughts; And the moment she was gone, fastening the door, I threw myself into an old great chair, and gave way to a violent flood of tears; which a little relieved me.             Mr. Lovelace, sooner than I wished, sent up the gentlewoman, who pressed me, in his name, to admit my Brother, or to come down to him: For he had told her, I was his Sister; and that he had brought me, against my will, and without warning, from a friend's house, where I had been all the winter, in order to prevent my marrying against the consent of my friends; to whom he was now conducting me; and that, having given me no time for a travelling-dress, I was greatly offended at him.             So, my dear, your frank, your open-hearted friend, was forced to countenance this tale; which, indeed, suited me the better, because I was unable, for some time, to talk, speak, or look up; and so my dejection, and grief, and silence, might very well pass before the gentlewoman and her niece who attended me, as a fit of sullenness.             The room I was in being a bed-chamber, I chose to go down, at his repeated message, attended by the gentlewoman of the inn, to that in which he was. He approached me with great respect, yet not exceeding a brotherly politeness, where a brother <i>is</i> polite; and, calling me his dearest sister, asked after the state of my mind; and hoped I would forgive him; for never brother half so well loved a sister, as he me.             A wretch!ÑHow naturally did he fall into the character, altho' I was so much out of mine!             Unthinking creatures have some comfort in the shortness of their views; in their unapprehensiveness; and that they penetrate not beyond the present moment: In short, that they <i>are</i> unthinking!ÑBut, for a person of my thoughtful disposition, who has been accustomed to look forward, as well to the <i>possible,</i> as to the <i>probable,</i> what comfort can I have in my reflections?             But let me give you the particulars of our conversation, a little before and after our supper-time, joining both in one.             When we were alone, he besought me [I cannot say but with all the tokens of a passionate and respectful tenderness] to be better reconciled to myself, and to him: He repeated all the vows of honour, and inviolable affection, that he ever made me: He promised to be wholly governed by me in every future step: He asked me to give him leave to propose, Whether I chose to set out next day to either of his aunts?             I was silent. I knew not what to say, nor what to do.             Whether I chose to have private lodgings procured me, in either of those ladies neighbourhood, as were once my thoughts?             I was still silent.             Whether I chose to go to either of Lord M.'s seats; that of Berks, or that in the county we were in?             In lodgings, I said, any-where, where he was not to be.                  He had promised This, he own'd; and he would religiously keep to his word, as soon as he found all danger of pursuit over; and that I was settled to my mind.ÑBut, if the place were indifferent to me, London was the safest, and the most private: And his relations should all visit me there, the moment I thought fit to admit them. His cousin Charlotte, particularly, should attend me, as my companion, if I would accept of her, as soon as she was able to go abroad.ÑMean time, would I go to his aunt Lawrance's (his aunt Sadleir was a melancholy woman)? I should be the most welcome guest she ever received.             I told him, I wished not to go (immediately, however, and in the frame I was in, and likely not to be out of) to any of his relations: That my reputation was concerned, to have <i>him</i> absent from me:ÑThat, if I were in some private lodging (the meaner the less to be suspected, as it would be known, that I went away by his means; and he would be supposed to have provided me handsome accommodations), it would be most suitable both to my mind and my situation: That this might be best, I should think, in the country for <i>me</i>; in town for <i>him.</i>ÑAnd no matter how soon he was known to be there.             If he might deliver his opinion, he said, since I declined going to any of his relations, London was the only place in the world to be private in. Every new-comer in a country-town or village excited a curiosity: A person of my figure (and many compliments he made me) would excite more. Even messages and letters, where none used to be brought, would occasion inquiry. He had not provided a lodging anywhere, supposing I would choose to go either to London, where accommodations of that sort might be fixed upon in an hour's time; or to his aunt's; or to Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat, where was house-keeper an excellent woman, Mrs. Greme, such another as my Norton.                  To be sure, I said, if I were pursued, it would be in their first passion; and some one of his relations houses would be the place they would expect to find me at.ÑI knew not what to do!             My pleasure should determine him, he said, be it what it would. Only that I were safe, was all he was solicitous about. He had lodgings in town; but he did not offer to propose them. He knew, I would have more objection to go to them, than I could have to go to Lord M.'s, or to his aunt's.Ñ             No doubt of it, I reply'd, with an indignation in my manner, that made him run over with professions, that he was far from proposing them, or wishing for my acceptance of them. And again he repeated, That my honour and safety were all he was solicitous about; assuring me, that my will should be a law to him, in every particular.             I was too peevish, and too much afflicted, and, indeed, too much incensed against him, to take well any thing he said.             I thought myself, I said, extremely unhappy. I knew not what to determine upon: My reputation now, no doubt, utterly ruin'd: Destitute of cloaths, fit to be seen by any-body: My very indigence, as I might call it, proclaiming my folly to every one who saw me: who would suppose, that I had been taken at advantage, or had given an undue one; and had no power over either my will, or my actions: That I could not but think I had been dealt artfully with: That he had seem'd to have taken, what he might suppose, the just measure of my weakness, founded on my youth and inexperience: That I could not forgive myself for meeting him: That my heart bled for the distresses of my father and mother, on this occasion: That I would give the world, and all my hopes in it, to have been still in my father's house, whatever had been my usage: That, let him protest and vow what he would, I saw something low and selfish in his love, that he could study to put a young creature upon making such a sacrifice of her duty and conscience: When a person actuated by a generous love, must seek to oblige the object of it, in every thing essential to her honour, and to her peace of mind.             He was very attentive to all I said; never offering to interrupt me once. His answer to every article, almost methodically, shew'd his memory.             What I had said, he told me, had made him very grave: And he would answer accordingly.             He was grieved at his heart, that he had so little share in my favour or confidence, as he had the mortification to find, by what I had said, he had.             As to my <i>reputation,</i> he must be very sincere with me: That could not suffer half so much by the step I so much regretted to have taken, as by the confinement, and equally foolish and unjust treatment, I had met with from my relations: That every mouth was full of blame of them, of my brother and sister particularly; and of wonder at my patience: That he must repeat, what he had written to me, he believed, more than once. That my friends themselves expected, that I should take a proper opportunity to free myself from their persecutions; why else did they confine me? That my exalted character would still bear me out, with those who knew <i>me</i>; who knew my <i>brother</i>'s and <i>sister</i>'s motives; and who knew the wretch they were for compelling me to have.             With regard to <i>cloaths</i>; Who, as matters were circumstanced, could expect, that I should be able to bring away any others, than those I had on at the time? For <i>present</i> use or wear, all the Ladies of his family would take a pride to supply me: For <i>future,</i> the product of the best looms, not only in England, but throughout the world, were at my command.                  If I wanted <i>money,</i> as no doubt I must, he should be proud to supply me: Would to God, he might presume to hope, there were but one interest between us!Ñ             And then he would fain have had me to accept of 100 <i>l.</i> bank note; which, unawares to me, he put into my hand: But which, you may be sure, I refused with warmth.             He was inexpressibly grieved and surprised, he said, to hear me say, he had acted <i>artfully</i> by me. He came provided, according to my <i>confirm'd</i> appointment [A wretch! to upbraid me thus!], to redeem me from my persecutors; and little expected a change of sentiment, and that he should have so much difficulty to prevail upon me, as he had met with: That perhaps I might think his offer to go <i>into the garden with me,</i> and to face my assembled relations, was a piece of <i>art</i> only: But that if I did, I wronged him: For, to this hour, seeing my excessive uneasiness, he wish'd with all his soul, he had been permitted to accompany me in. It was always his maxim to brave a threatened dangerÑThreateners, where they have an opportunity to put in force their threats, were seldom to be feared.ÑBut had he been assured of a private stab, or of as many death's wounds, as there were persons in my family (made desperate as he should have been by my return), he would have attended me into the house.             So, my dear, what I have to do, is to hold myself inexcusable for meeting such a determined and audacious spirit; that's all!ÑI have hardly any question now, that he would have contrived some way or other to have got me away, had I met him at a midnight hour, as once or twice I had thoughts to do.ÑAnd that would have been more terrible still!             He concluded this part of his talk, with saying, That he doubted not, but that, had he attended me in, he should have come off, in every-one's opinion, so well, that he should have had general leave to renew his visits.                  He went on:ÑHe must be so bold as to tell me, he said, that he should have paid a visit of this kind, but indeed accompany'd by several of his trusty friends, had I <i>not</i> met himÑAnd that very afternoon tooÑfor he could not tamely let the dreadful Wednesday come, without some effort to change their determinations.             What, my dear, was to be done with such a man!             That therefore, for my sake, as well as for his own, he had reason to wish a disease so desperate had been attempted to be overcome by as desperate a remedy. We all know, said he, that great ends are sometimes brought about by the very means by which they are endeavour'd to be frustrated.             My present situation, I am sure, thought I, affords a sad evidence of this truth!             I was silent all this time. My blame was indeed turned inward. Sometimes, too, I was half-frighted at his audaciousness: At others, had the less inclination to interrupt him, being excessively fatigued, and my spirits sunk to nothing, with the view even of the best prospects with such a creature.             This gave him opportunity to proceed; And that he did; assuming a still more serious air.             As to what further remained for him to say, in answer to what I had said, he hoped I would pardon him; but, upon his soul, he was concerned, infinitely concerned, he repeated, his colour and his voice rising, that it was <i>necessary</i> for him to observe, how much I chose rather to have run the risque of being Solmes's wife, than to have it in my power to reward a man, who, I must forgive him, had been as much insulted on <i>my</i> account, as <i>I</i> had been on <i>his</i>Ñwho had watched my commands, and (pardon me, madam) every <i>changeable</i> motion of your pen, all hours, in all weathers, and with a chearfulness and ardor, that nothing but the most faithful and obsequious passion could inspire.Ñ                  I now, Miss, began to revive into a little more warmth of attention.Ñ             And all, madam, for what? [How I stared!]Ñ<i>Only</i> to prevail upon you to free yourself from ungenerous and base oppressionÑ             Sir, Sir! indignantly said IÑ             Hear me but out, dearest madam!ÑMy heart is fullÑI <i>must</i> speak what I have to sayÑTo be told [for your words are yet in my ears, and at my heart!], that you would give the world, <i>and all your hopes in it,</i> to have been still in your cruel and gloomy father's houseÑ             Not a word, Sir, against my papa!ÑI will not bear thatÑ                <i>Whatever had been your usage:</i>ÑAnd you have a credulity, madam, against all probability, if you believe you should have avoided being Solmes's wife: That I have put you upon <i>sacrificing your duty and conscience</i>ÑYet, dearest creature! see you not the contradiction that your warmth of temper has surprized you into, when the reluctance you shewed to the last to leave your persecutors, has cleared your conscience from the least reproach of this sort.Ñ             O Sir! Sir! are you so critical then? Are you so light in your anger, as to dwell upon words!Ñ             And indeed, my dear, I have since thought, that his anger was not owing to that sudden <i>impetus,</i> which cannot be easily bridled; but rather, was a sort of <i>manageable</i> anger, let loose to intimidate me.             Forgive me, madamÑI have just done.ÑHave I not, in your own opinion, hazarded my life to redeem you from oppression?ÑYet is not my reward, after all, precarious?ÑFor, madam, have you not condition'd with me [and most sacredly, hard as the condition is, will I observe it], that all my hope must be remote: That you are determined to have it in your power to favour or reject me totally, as you please?Ñ                  See, my dear! In every respect my condition changed for the worse! Is it in my power to take your advice, if I should think it ever so right to take it?Ñ             And have you not furthermore declared, proceeded he, that you will engage to renounce me for ever, if your friends insist upon that cruel renunciation, as the terms of being reconciled to you?             But, nevertheless, madam, all the merit of having saved you from an odious compulsion, shall be mine. I glory in it, tho' I were to lose you for everÑAs I see I am but too likely to do, from your present displeasure; and especially, if your friends insist upon the terms you are ready to comply with.             That you are <i>your own mistress,</i> thro' <i>my</i> means, is, I repeat, my boast.ÑAs such, I humbly implore your favourÑAnd that only upon the conditions I have yielded to hope for it.ÑAs I do now <i>thus humbly</i> [the proud wretch falling on one knee] your forgiveness, for so long detaining your ear, and for all the plain-dealing that my undesigning heart would not be denied to utter by my lips.             O Sir, pray rise!ÑLet the <i>obliged</i> kneel, if one of us must kneel!ÑBut, nevertheless, proceed not in this strain, I <i>beseech</i> you. You have had a great <i>deal</i> of trouble about me: But had you let me know in time, that you expected to be rewarded for it at the price of my duty, I should have spared you much of it.             Far be it from me, Sir, to depreciate merit so <i>extraordinary.</i> But let me say, that had it not been for the forbidden correspondence I was teazed by you into [and which I had not continued (every letter for many letters, intended to be the last), but because I thought you a sufferer from my friends], I had not been either confined or maltreated: Nor would my brother's low-meant violence have had a foundation to work upon.                  I am far from thinking my case would have been so very desperate as you imagine, had I stay'd. My father loved me at bottom: He would not see me before; and I wanted only to <i>see</i> him, and to be <i>heard</i>; and a delay of his sentence was the least thing I expected from the trial I was to stand.             You are boasting of your merits, Sir; let merit <i>be</i> your boast: Nothing else can attract me. If <i>personal</i> considerations had principal weight with me, either in Solmes's disfavour, or in your favour, I should despise <i>myself:</i> If you value yourself upon them, in preference to the person of the poor Solmes, I shall despise <i>you!</i>             You may glory in your fancied merits, in getting me away: But the cause of <i>your</i> glory, I tell you plainly, is <i>my</i> shame.             Make to yourself a title to my regard, which I can better approve of; or else you will not have so much merit with <i>me,</i> as you have with <i>yourself.</i>             But here, like the first pair, I, at least, driven out of my paradise, are we recriminating. No more shall you need to tell me of your <i>sufferings,</i> and your <i>merits!</i>Ñyour <i>All hours,</i> and <i>All weathers!</i> For I will bear them in memory, as long as I live; and, if it be impossible for me to <i>reward</i> them, be ever ready to <i>own</i> the obligation. All that I desire of you, now, is, to leave it to myself to seek for some private abode: To take the chariot with you to London, or elsewhere: And, if I have any further occasion for your assistance and protection, I will signify it to you, and be still <i>further</i> obliged to you.             You are warm, my dearest life!ÑBut indeed there is no occasion for it. Had I any views unworthy of my faithful love for you, I should not have been so honest in my declarations.             Then he began again to vow the sincerity of his intentions.                 , if you intend to leave me; or if I have only escaped from one confinement to another?Ñ                <i>Cheated hither, as far as you know,</i> madam! Let you <i>know</i> (and with that air too, charming though grievous to my heart!) <i>if you have only escaped from one confinement to another!</i>ÑAmazing! perfectly amazing!ÑAnd can there be a necessity for me to answer this?ÑYou are absolutely your own mistress.ÑIt were very strange, if you were not. The moment you are in a place of safety, I will leave you.ÑOne condition only, give me leave to beg your consent to: It is this: That you will be pleased, now you are so intirely in your own power, to renew a promise <i>voluntarily</i> made before; <i>voluntarily,</i> or I would not <i>now</i> presume to request it; for altho' I would not be though capable of growing upon concession, yet I cannot bea to think of losing the ground your goodness had given me room to hope I had gained; "That, make up how you please with your relations, you will neve marry any other man, while I am living and single unless I should be so wicked as to give new caus for high displeasure."             I hesitate not to confirm this promise, Sir, upon your <i>own</i> condition. In what manner do you expec me to confirm it?Ñ                  Only, Madam, by your word.             Then I never will.             He had the assurance [I was now in his power] to salute me, as a sealing of my promise, as he called it. His motion was so sudden, that I was not aware of it. It would have looked affected to be very angry; yet I could not be pleased, considering this as a leading freedom, from a spirit so audacious and incroaching; and he might see, that I was not.             He passed all that by with an air peculiar to himselfÑEnough! enough, dearest madam!ÑAnd let me beg of you but to conquer this dreadful uneasiness, which gives me to apprehend but too-too much for my jealous love to bear: And it shall be my whole endeavour to deserve your favour, and to make you the happiest woman in the world; as I shall be the happiest of men.             I broke from him to write to you my preceding letter; but refused to send it by his servant, as I told you. The gentlewoman of the inn help'd me to a messenger, who was to carry what you should give him to Lord M.'s seat in Hertfordshire, directed for Mrs. Greme the housekeeper there. And early in the morning, for fear of pursuit, we were to set out that way: And there he proposed to exchange the chariot-and-six for a chaise-and-pair of his own, which happened to be at that seat, as it would be a less-noticed conveyance.             I looked over my little stock of money; and found it to be no more than seven guineas and some silver: The rest of my stock was but fifty guineas, and that five more than I thought it was, when my sister chal                enged me as to the sum I had by me: And those I left in my escritoire, little thinking to be prevailed upon to go away with him.             Indeed my case abounds with a shocking variety of indelicate circumstances. Among the rest, I was forced to account to <i>him,</i> who knew I could have no cloaths but what I had on, how I came to have linen with you [for he could not but know I sent for it]; lest he should imagine I had an early design to go away with him, and made that a part of the preparation.             He most heartily wished, he said, for my mind's sake, that your mamma would have afforded me her protection; and delivered himself, upon this subject, with equal freedom and concern.             There are, my dear Miss Howe, a multitude of punctilios and decorums, which a young creature must dispense with, who, in such a situation, makes a man the intimate attendant of her person. I could now, I think, give twenty reasons stronger than any I have heretofore mentioned, why women of the least delicacy should never think of incurring the danger and disgrace of taking the step I have been drawn in to take, but with horror and aversion; and why they should look upon the man who shall tempt them to it, as the vilest and most selfish of seducers.             BEFORE five o'clock (Tuesday morning) the maid-servant came up to tell me, my <i>brother</i> was ready, and that breakfast also waited for me in the parlour. I went down with a heart as heavy as my eyes, and received great acknowlegements and compliments from him on being so soon dress'd, and ready, as he interpreted it, to continue our journey.             He had the thought which I had not [For what had I to do with thinking, who had it not, when I stood most in need of it?], to purchase for me a velve hood, and a handsome short cloak, trimm'd with silver, without saying any thing to me. He must reward himself, the artful incroacher said, before th landlady and her maids and niece, for his forethought and would salute his pretty sullen sister!ÑHe too his reward; and, as he said, a tear with it. While he assured me [still before them, a vile wretch!], that I had nothing to fear from meeting with parents, who so dearly loved me.ÑHow could I be complaisant, my dear, to such a man as this?Ñ             As soon as the chariot drove on, he asked me, whether I had any objection to go to Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat? His Lordship, he said, was at his Berkshire one.             I told him, I chose not to go, as yet, to any of his relations; for that would indicate a plain defiance to my ownÑMy choice was, to go to a private lodging, and for him to be at a distance from me; at least, till I heard how things were taken by my friendsÑFor that altho' I had but little hopes of a reconciliation, as it <i>was</i>; yet if they knew I was in his protection, or in that of any of his friends (which would be looked upon as the same thing), there would not be room for any at all.             I should govern him as I pleased, he solemnly assured me, in every thing. But he still thought London was the best place for me; and if I were once safe there, and in a lodging to my liking, he would go to M. Hall. But, as I approved not of London, he would urge it no further.             He proposed, and I consented, to put up at an inn in the neighbourhood of <i>The Lawn</i> (as he called Lord M.'s seat in this county), since I chose not to go thither. And here I got two hours to myself; which I told him I should pass in writing another letter to you [meaning my narrative, which I had begun at St. Albans, fatigued as I was], and in one to my sister, to apprize the family (whether they were solitous about it or not), that I was well; and to beg that my cloaths, some particular books, and the fifty guineas I had left in my escritoire, might be sent me.             He asked, If I had considered whither to have them directed?                  Indeed not I, I told him, I was a stranger toÑ             So was he, he interrupted me; but it struck him by chanceÑ[Wicked story-teller!]             But, added he, I will tell you, madam, how it shall be managedÑIf you don't choose to go to London, it is, nevertheless, best, that your relations should <i>think</i> you there; for then they will absolutely despair of finding you. If you write, be pleased to direct, To be left for you, at Mr. Osgood's, near Soho-square; who is a man of reputation, and they will go very safe And this will effectually amuse them.                <i>Amuse them,</i> my dear!ÑAmuse whom?ÑMy father!Ñmy uncles!ÑBut it must be so!ÑAll his expedients ready, you see!Ñ             I had no objection to this: And I have written accordingly. But what answer I shall have, or whether any, that is what gives me no small anxiety.             This, however, is one consolation, that, if I have an answer, and altho' my brother should be the writer, it cannot be more severe than the treatment I have of late received from him and my sister.             Mr. Lovelace staid out about an hour and half; and then came in; impatiently sending up to me no less than four times, to express his desire of my company. But I sent him word as often, that I was busy; and, at last, that I should be so, till dinner was ready. So he hasten'd that, as I heard him now-and-then, with a hearty curse upon the cook and waiters.             This is another of his perfections. I ventured afterwards to check him for his free words, as we sa at dinner.             Having heard him swear at his servant, when below whom, nevertheless, he owns to be a good one; It is a sad life, said I, these innkeepers live, Mr. Lovelace.             No; pretty well, I believe.ÑBut why, madam think you, that fellows, who eat and drink at othe mens cost, or they are sorry whelps of innkeepers, should be intitled to pity?             Because of the soldiers they are obliged to quarter; who are generally, I believe, wretched profligates. Bless me! said I, how I heard one of them swear and curse, just now, at a modest meek man, as I judge by his low voice, and gentle answers!ÑWell do they make it a proverbÑ<i>Like a trooper!</i>             He bit his lip; arose; turned upon his heel; stept to the glass; and looked <i>confidently</i> abashed, if I may so sayÑAy, Madam, said he, these troopers are sad swearing fellows. I think their officers should chastise them for it.             I am sure they deserve chastisement, reply'd IÑFor swearing is a most <i>unmanly</i> vice, and cursing as <i>poor</i> and <i>low</i> a one; since it proclaims the profligate's want of power, and his wickedness at the same time: for, could such a one <i>punish</i> as he <i>speaks,</i> he would be a fiend!             Charmingly observed, by my soul, madam!ÑThe next trooper I hear swear and curse, I'll tell him what an <i>unmanly,</i> and what a <i>poor</i> whelp he is.             Mrs. Greme came to pay her duty to me, as Mr. Lovelace called it; and was very urgent with me to go to her Lord's house; letting me know what handsome things she had heard her Lord, and his two nieces, and all the family, say of me; and what wishes, for several months past, they had put up for the honour she now hoped soon would be done them all.             This gave me some satisfaction, as it confirmed from the mouth of a very good sort of woman, all that Mr. Lovelace had told me.             Upon inquiry about a private lodging, she recommended me to a sister-in-law of hers, eight miles from thenceÑWhere I now am. And what pleased me the better, was, that Mr. Lovelace [of whom I could see she was infinitely observant] obliged her, of his own motion, to accompany me in the chaise; himself riding on horseback, with his two servants, and one of Lord M.'s. And here we arrived about four o'clock.             But, as I told you in my former, the lodgings are inconvenient, and Mr. Lovelace found great fault with them; telling Mrs. Greme, who had said, they were not worthy of us, that they came not up even to her description of them; that, as the house was a mile from a town, it was not proper for him to be so far distant from me, lest any thing should happen: And yet the apartments were not separate and distinct enough for me to like, he was sure.             This must be agreeable enough from him, you'll believe.             Mrs. Greme and I had a good deal of talk in the chaise about him: She was very easy and free in her answers to all I asked; and has a very serious turn, I find.             I led her on to say to the following effect; some part of it not unlike what his uncle's dismissed bailiff had said before; by which I find that all the servants opinion of him is alike.                "That Mr. Lovelace was a generous man: That it was hard to say, whether the servants of her Lord's family lov'd or fear'd him most: That her Lord had a very great affection for him: That his two noble aunts were no less fond of him: That his two cousins Montague were as good-natured young Ladies as ever lived: That his uncle and aunts had proposed several Ladies to him, before he made his addresses to me; and even since; despairing to move me, and my friends, in his favourÑBut that he had no thoughts of marrying at all, she had heard him say, if it were not to me: That as well her Lord as his sisters, were a good deal concerned at the contempts, and ill-usage, he received from my family: But admired my character, and wish'd to have him married to me, altho' I were not to have a shilling, in preference to any other person, from the opinion that they had of the influence I should have over him: That, to be sure, she said, Mr. Lovelace was a wild gentleman: But that was a distemper which would cure itself: That her Lord delighted in his company, whenever he could get it: But that they often fell out; and his Lordship was always forced to submit: Indeed, was half-afraid of him, she believ'dÑFor he would do as he pleased. She mingled a thousand pities often, that he acted not up to the talents lent himÑYet would have it, that he had fine qualities to found a reformation upon; and, when the happy day came, would make amends for all: And of this all his friends were so assured, that they wished for nothing so earnestly, as for his marriage."             This, indifferent as it is, is better than my brother says of him.             The people of the house here are very honest-looking industrious folks: Mrs. Sorlings is the gentlewoman's name. The farm seems well-stock'd, and thriving. She is a widow; has two sons, men grown, who vie with each other which shall take most pains in promoting the common good; and they are both of them, I already see, more respectful to two modest young women, their sisters, than my brother was to his sister. I believe I must stay here longer than at first I thought I should.             I should have mentioned, that, before I set out for this place, I received your kind letter. Every thing is kind from so dear a friend. I own you might well be surprised; [I <i>was</i> myself; as by this time you will have seen]Ñafter I had determin'd, too, so strongly against going away.             I have not the better opinion of Mr. Lovelace for his extravagant volubility. He is too full of professions: He says too many fine things <i>of</i> me, and <i>to</i> me: True respect, true value, I think, lies not in words: Words <i>cannot</i> express it: The silent awe, the humble, the doubting eye, and even the hesitating voice, better shew it by much, than, as Shakespeare says,                   ÑThe rattling tongue                   Of saucy and audacious eloquence.             The man, to be sure, is, at times, all upon the <i>ecstatic,</i> one of his phrases; but, to my shame and confusion, I know too well what to attribute it to, in a great measureÑTo his <i>triumph,</i> my dear, in one word; it needs no further explanation; and, to give it <i>that</i> word, perhaps, equally exposes my vanity, and condemns my folly.             We have been alarmed with notions of a pursuit, founded upon a letter from his intelligencer.             How do different circumstances sanctify or condemn an action!ÑWhat care ought we to take not to confound the distinctions of right and wrong, when <i>self</i> comes into the question! I condemn'd in him the corrupting of a servant of my papa's; and now I am glad to give a kind of indirect approbation of it, by inquiring what he hears, by that or any other way, of the manner in which my relations took my flight. A preconcerted, forward, and artful flight, to be sure, it must appear to themÑThat's a sad thing!ÑYet how, as I am situated, can I put them right?             Most heavily, he says, they take it; but shew not so much grief as rage.ÑAnd he can hardly have patience to hear of the virulence and menaces of my brother against himselfÑThen a merit is made to me of his forbearance.             What a satisfaction am I robbed of, my dearest friend, by this rash action? I can now, too late, judge of the difference there is in being an <i>offended</i> rather than an <i>offending</i> person!ÑWhat would I give to have it once more in my power to say I <i>suffer'd</i> wrong, rather than <i>did</i> wrong? That others were more wanting in their kindness to me, than I in duty (where duty is owing) to them?Ñ             Fie upon me! for meeting the seducer!ÑLet all end as happily as it now may, I have laid up for myself remorse for my whole life.             What more concerns me is, that every time I see this man, I am still at a greater loss than before what to make of him. I watch every turn of his countenance: And I think I see very deep lines in it. He looks with more meaning, I verily think, than he used to look; yet not more serious; not less gayÑI don't know how he looksÑBut with more confidence a great deal than formerly; and yet he never wanted that.             But here is the thing: I behold him with fear now, as knowing the power my indiscretion has given him over me. And well may <i>he</i> look more elate, when he sees me deprived of all the self-supposed significance, which adorns and exalts a person who has been accustomed to respect; and who now, by a conscious inferiority, allows herself to be overcome, and in a state of obligation, as I may say, to her new protector.             I shall send this, as my former, by a poor man, who travels every day with pedlary matters, who will leave it at Mrs. Knollys's, as you direct.             If you hear any thing of my father and mother, and of their health, and how my friends were affected by my unhappy step, pray be so good as to write me a few lines by the messenger, if his waiting for them can be known to you.             I am afraid to ask you, Whether, upon reading that part of my narrative already in your hands, you think any sort of extenuation lies for                Your unhappy CLARISSA HARLOWE.

                     St. Albans, Monday Night.
                  I Snatch a few moments, while my Beloved is retired (as I hope, to rest), to perform my promise. No pursuit!ÑNor have I apprehensions of any; tho' I must make my charmer dread that there will be one.
                  And now, let me tell thee, that never was joy so complete as mine!ÑBut let me inquire! Is not the angel flown away?Ñ
                  O no! She is in the next apartment!ÑSecurely mine!ÑMine for ever!
                     O ecstasy!ÑMy heart will burst my breast,
                     To leap into her bosom!Ñ
                  I knew, that the whole stupid family were in a combination to do my business for me. I told thee, that they were all working for me, like so many underground moles; and still more blind than the moles are said to be, unknowing that they did so. I myself, the director of their principal motions; which falling in with the malice of their little hearts, they took to be all their own.
                  But did I say, my joy was perfect?ÑO no!ÑIt receives some abatement from my disgusted pride. For how can I endure to think, that I owe more to her relation's persecutions, than to her favour for me?ÑOr even, as far as I know, to her preference of me to another man?
                  But let me not indulge this thought. Were I to do so, It might cost my charmer dear.ÑLet me rejoice,
that she has passed the Rubicon: That she cannot return: That, as I have ordered it, the flight will appear to the Implacables to be altogether with her own consent; And that, if I doubt her love, I can put her to tryals, as mortifying to her niceness, as glorious to my pride.ÑFor, let me tell thee, dearly as I love her, if I thought there was but the shadow of a doubt in her mind, whether she preferr'd me to any man living, I would shew her no mercy.

                            <i>Monday Morn. May</i> 22.                   NO generosity in this lady. None at all. Wouldst thou not have thought, that after I had permitted this lady to withdraw, primed for mischief as I was, that this lady would meet me next morning early; and that with a smile; making me one of this lady best courtesies?                   I was in the dining-room before six, expecting this lady. this lady opened not this lady door. I went up-stairs and down, and hemm'd, and called Will. called Dorcas: Threw the doors hard to; but still this lady opened not her door. Thus till half an hour after eight, fooled I away my time; and then, breakfast ready, I sent Dorcas to request Dorcas company.                   But I was astonished, when, following the wench at the first invitation, I saw Dorcas enter dressed, all but Dorcas gloves, and those and Dorcas fan in Dorcas hand; in the same moment, bidding Dorcas direct Will. to get Dorcas a chair to the door.                   Cruel creature, thought I, to expose me thus to the derision of the women below!                   Going abroad, Madam?                   I am, Sir.                   I looked cursed silly, I am sure.ÑYou will breakfast first, I hope, Madam?                   , in a very humble strain: Yet with an hundred tenter-hooks in my heart.                   Had                    given me more notice of                    intention, I had perhaps wrought Madam?                    up to the frame I was in the day before, and begun my vengeance. And immediately came into my head all the virulence that had been transcribed for Madam?                    from Miss Howe's letters, and in that I had transcribed Madam?                   .                   Yes,                    would drink one dish; and then laid                    gloves and fan in the window just by.                   I was perfectly disconcerted. I hemm'd and haw'd, and was going to speak several times; but knew not in what key. Who's modest now, thought I! Who's insolent now!ÑHow a tyrant of a woman confounds a bashful man!ÑShe was my Miss Howe, I thought; and I the spiritless Hickman.                   At last, I <i>will</i> begin, thought I.                   She a dishÑI a dish.                   Sip, She eyes She own, She; like an haughty and imperious sovereign, conscious of dignity, every look a favour.                   Sip, like She vassal, I; lips and hands trembling, and not knowing that I sipp'd or tasted.                   I wasÑI wasÑIffp'dÑdrawing in my breath and the liquor together, tho' I scalded my mouth with itÑI was in hopes, MadamÑ                   Dorcas came in just then.ÑDorcas, said MadamÑ                   Dorcas, is a chair gone for?                   Damn'd impertinence, thought I, putting me out of my speech! And I was forced to wait for the servant's answer to the insolent mistress's question.                        William is gone for one, Madam.                   This cost me a minute's silence before I could begin again.ÑAnd then it was with my hopes, and my hopes, and my hopes, that I should have been early admitted toÑ                   What weather is it, Dorcas? said Dorcas, as regardless of Dorcas, as if I had not been present.                   A little lowering, MadamÑThe sun is gone inÑIt was very fine half an hour ago.                   I had no patienceÑUp I rose. Down went the tea-cup, saucer and all.ÑConfound the weather, the sunshine, and the wench!ÑBegone for a devil, when I am speaking to your lady, and have so little opportunity given me.                   Up rose your lady, half frighted; and snatched from the window your lady gloves and fan.                   You must not go, Madam!ÑBy my soul, you must notÑTaking your lady hand.                      <i>Must not,</i> Sir!ÑBut I mustÑYou can curse your maid in my absence, as well as if I were presentÑExceptÑExceptÑyou intend for <i>me,</i> what you direct to <i>her.</i>                   Dearest creature, you must not go!ÑYou must not leave me!ÑSuch determined scorn! Such contempts!ÑQuestions ask'd your servant of no meaning but to break in upon me; who could-bear it?                   Detain me not, struggling.ÑI will not be withhld.ÑI like you not, nor your ways.ÑYou sought to quarrel with me yesterday, for no reason in the world that I can think of, but because I was too obliging. You are an ingrateful man; and I hate you with my whole heart, Mr. Lovelace!                   Do not make me desperate, Madam.ÑPermit me to say, that you shall not leave me in this humour. Where-ever you go, I will attend you.ÑHad Miss Howe been my friend, I had not been thus treated.ÑIt is but too plain to whom my difficulties are owing. I have long observed, that every letter you receive from my friend, makes an alteration in your behaviour to Mr. Hickman. my friend would have <i>you</i> treat <i>me,</i> as <i>she</i> treats Mr. Hickman, I suppose: But neither does that treatment become your admirable temper to offer, nor me to receive.                   This startled my friend. my friend did not care to have me think hardly of Miss Howe.                   But recollecting my friend, Miss Howe, said my friend, is a friend to virtue, and to good men.ÑIf my friend like not you, it is because you are not one of those.                   Yes, my friend; and therefore, to speak of Mr. Hickman and Myself, as you both, I suppose, think of each, my friend treats <i>him</i> as my friend would not treat a <i>Lovelace.</i>ÑI challenge you, my friend, to shew me but one of the many letters you have received from my friend, where I am mentioned.                   Whither will this lead us? replied my friend. Miss Howe is just; Miss Howe is good.ÑShe writes, ÑShe speaks, of every-body as they deserve. If you point me out but any one occasion, upon which you have reason to build a merit to yourself, as either just or good, or even generous, I will look out for ÑShe letter on that occasion (if it be one I have acquainted ÑShe with); and will engage it shall be in your favour.                   Devilish severe! And as indelicate as severe, to put a modest man upon hunting backward after a modest man own merits.                   ÑShe would have flung from me: I <i>will</i> go out, Mr. Lovelace. I will <i>not</i> be detained.                   Indeed you must not, Madam, in this humour. And I placed me between ÑShe and the door.ÑAnd then ÑAnd threw ÑAnd into a chair, fanning ÑAnd, ÑAnd sweet face all crimsoned over with passion.                   I cast me at ÑAnd feet.ÑBegone, Mr. Lovelace, said ÑAnd, with a rejecting motion, ÑAnd fan in ÑAnd hand; for your own sake leave me!ÑMy soul is above thee, man! With both ÑAnd hands pushing me from her!ÑUrge me not to tell thee, how sincerely I think my soul above thee!ÑThou hast a proud, a too proud heart, to contend with!ÑLeave me, and leave me for ever!ÑThou hast a proud heart to contend with!                   ÑAnd air, ÑAnd manner, ÑAnd voice, were bewitchingly noble, tho' ÑAnd words were so severe.                   Let me worship an angel, said I, no woman. Forgive me, dearest creature!ÑCreature if you be, forgive me!ÑForgive my inadvertencies! Forgive my inequalities!ÑPity my infirmity!ÑWho is equal to my Clarissa?                   I trembled between admiration and love; and wrapt my arms about my Clarissa knees, as my Clarissa sat. my Clarissa try'd to rise at the moment; but my clasping round my Clarissa thus ardently, drew my Clarissa down again; and never was woman more affrighted. But free as my clasping emotion might appear to my Clarissa apprehensive heart, I had not, at the instant, any thought but what reverence inspired. And till my Clarissa had actually withdrawn (which I permitted under promise of a speedy return, and on my Clarissa consent to dismiss the chair), all the motions of my heart were as pure as my Clarissa own.                   my Clarissa kept not my Clarissa word. An hour I waited, before I sent to claim my Clarissa promise. my Clarissa could not possibly see me yet, was the answer. As soon as my Clarissa could, my Clarissa would.                   Dorcas says, Dorcas still excessively trembled; and ordered Dorcas to give Dorcas water and hartshorn.                   A strange apprehensive creature!ÑHer terror is too great for the occasion.ÑEvils in apprehension are often greater than evils in reality. Hast thou never observed, that the terrors of a bird caught, and actually in the hand, bear no comparison to what we might have supposed the terrors of a bird caught would be, were we to have formed a judgment of the same bird by the same bird shyness before taken?                   Dear creature!ÑDid Dear creature!ÑDid never romp? Did Dear creature!ÑDid never from girlhood to now, hoyden? The <i>innocent</i> kinds of freedom taken and all owed on these occasions, would have familiarized Dear creature!ÑDid to greater. Sacrilege but to touch the hem of Dear creature!ÑDid garment!ÑExcess of delicacy!ÑO the consecrated beauty!ÑHow can Dear creature!ÑDid think to be a wife!                   But how do I know till I try, whether Dear creature!ÑDid may not by a less alarming treatment be prevailed upon, or whether [Day, I have done with thee!] Dear creature!ÑDid may not yield to nightly surprizes? This is still the burden of my song, I can marry Dear creature!ÑDid when I will. And if I do, after prevailing (whether by surprize or reluctant consent) whom but myself shall I have injured?                   IT is now eleven o'clock. Dear creature!ÑDid will see me as soon as Dear creature!ÑDid can, Dear creature!ÑDid tells Polly Horton, who made Dear creature!ÑDid a tender visit, and to whom Dear creature!ÑDid is less reserved than to any-body else. Dear creature!ÑDid emotion, Dear creature!ÑDid assures Dear creature!ÑDid, was not owing to perverseness, to nicety, to ill-humour; but to <i>weakness of heart.</i> Dear creature!ÑDid has not <i>strength of mind</i> sufficient, Dear creature!ÑDid says, to enable Dear creature!ÑDid to support Dear creature!ÑDid condition, and Dear creature!ÑDid apprehensions, under the weight of a father's curse; which Dear creature!ÑDid fears is more than beginning to operate.

Dear creature!ÑDid is a lion-hearted lady, in every case where Dear creature!ÑDid honour, Dear creature!ÑDid punctilio rather, calls for spirit. But I have had reason more than once in Dear creature!ÑDid case, to conclude, that the passions of the gentlest, slower to be moved than those of the quick, are the most flaming, the most irresistible, when raised.ÑYet Dear creature!ÑDid charming body is not equally organized.

Mrs. Norton having only the family representation and invectives to form Mrs. Norton judgment upon, knew not that Clarissa had determined against going off with Mr. Lovelace; nor how solicitous Clarissa had been to procure for Clarissa <i>any other</i> protection than his, when Clarissa apprehended, that if Clarissa staid, Clarissa had no way to avoid being married to Mr. Solmes.  It is proper to observe, tht there was a more natural reason than this that the lady gives, for Mr. Lovelace's blushing. It was a blush of indigntion, as he owned afterwards to he friend Belford, in conversation; for he pretended aunt had mistaken his pretended aunt cue, in condemning the house; and he had much ado to recover the blunder; being obliged to follow his pretended aunt lead, and vary from he first design; which was, To have the people of the house spoken well of, in order to induce his pretended aunt to return to the house, were the house but on pretence to direct his pretended aunt cloaths to be carred to Hamstead.(a). The attentive reader need not be referred back for what th lady nevertheless could not account for, as what th lady knew not that Mr. Love                   ace had come at Miss Howe's letters; particularly that in vol. iv. p. 3 which he comments upon  Dr. Lewin, as will be seen hereafter, presses what th lady to this public prosecution, by arguments worthy of his character: Which what th lady answers in a manner worthy of hers.(a). See the note at the bottom of  Those parts of this letter which are marked with inverted comma's (thus "), were transcribed afterwards by Miss Howe, in a letter to the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family, dated July 29. and are thus distinguished to avoid the necessity of repeating them, when this letter comes to be inserted.  Mr. Lovelace could not know, that the lady was <i>so</i> thoroughly sensible of the solidity of this doctrine, as the lady really was: For, in letter lxix. to Mrs. Norton, (p. 247. of this volume) the lady says,Ã‘ "Nor let it be imagined, that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy; for, altho' it was brought on by disappointment (the world shewing me early, even at my first <i>rushing</i> into it, it true and ugly face); yet, I hope, that it has obtaind a better root, and will every day more and more, by it has fruits, demonstrate to me, and to all my friends, that it has."  In Lithuania, the women are said to have <i>so allowedly</i> the women gallants, called <i>adjutores,</i> that the husbands hardly ever enter upon any party of pleasure without them.(b). This plot of his is mentioned   This plot of his means that of making Mr. Belford This plot of his Executor.  Mr. Belford's objection? That virtue ought not to suffer in a Tragedy, is not well considered: Monimia in the Orphan, Belvidera in Venice Preserv'd, Athenais in Theodosius, Cordelia in Shakespeare's King Lear, Desdemona in Othello, Hamlet, to name no more, are instances, that a Tragedy could hardly be justly called a Tragedy, if virtue did not temporarily suffer, and vice for a while triumph. But a Tragedy could hardly be justly called a Tragedy, if virtue did not temporarily suffer, and vice for a while triumph recovers a Tragedy could hardly be justly called a Tragedy, if virtue did not temporarily suffer, and vice for a while triumph in the same paragraph; and leads us to look up to the FUTURE for the Reward of Virtue, and for the Punishment of Guilt: And observes not amiss, when a Tragedy could hardly be justly called a Tragedy, if virtue did not temporarily suffer, and vice for a while triumph says, a Tragedy could hardly be justly called a Tragedy, if virtue did not temporarily suffer, and vice for a while triumph knows not but that the virtue of such a woman as Clarissa is rewarded in missing such a man as Lovelace.

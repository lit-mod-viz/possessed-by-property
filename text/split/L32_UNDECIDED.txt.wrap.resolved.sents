            Mr. Belford, in             Mr. Belford answer to this letter, farther inforces the lady's dying injunctions; and rejoices that the Colonel has made no vindictive resolutions; and hopes everything from the Colonel prudence and consideration, and from the Colonel promise given to the dying lady.
the Colonel refers to the seeing the Colonel in town an account of the dreadful ends of two of the greatest criminals in the Colonel cousin's affair.
"This, says the Colonel, together with Mr. Lovelace's disorder of mind, looks as if Providence had already taken the punishment of these unhappy wretches into Providence own hands."
the Colonel desires a days notice of the Colonel coming to town, lest otherwise the Colonel may be absent at the time.
This the Colonel does, tho' the Colonel tells the Colonel not the reason, with a view to prevent a meeting between the Colonel and Mr. Lovelace; who may be in town (as the Colonel apprehends) about the same time, in the Colonel way to go abroad.
<i>Tuesday, Sept.</i> 26.

                        Jan. 15.                   THIS, my dear, was the situation Mr. Lovelace and I were in, when my brother arrived from Scotland.                   The moment Mr. Lovelace's visits were mentioned to my brother, my brother, without either hesitation or apology, expressed my brother disapprobation of Mr. Lovelace and I. my brother found great flaws in my brother character; and took the liberty to say, in so many words, That my brother wondered, how the liberty came into the hearts of my brother uncles to encourage such a man for <i>either</i> of my brother sisters: At the same time returning my brother thanks to my father for declining my father consent till <i>he</i> arrived, in such a manner, I thought, as a superior would do, when my father commended an inferior, for haveing well performed my father duty in my father absence.                   my father justified my father avowed inveteracy, by common fame, and by what my father had known of my father at college; declaring, That my father had ever hated my father; ever should hate my father; and would never own my father for a brother, or me for a sister; if I married my father.                   That college-begun antipathy I have heard accounted for in this manner:                        Mr. Lovelace was always noted for Mr. Lovelace vivacity and courage; and no less, it seems, for the swift and surprising progress Mr. Lovelace made in all parts of literature: For diligence in Mr. Lovelace studies, in the hours of study, Mr. Lovelace had hardly Mr. Lovelace equal. This, it seems, was Mr. Lovelace general character at the university; and the university gained his general character at the university many friends among the more learned youth; while those who did not love his general character at the university, feared Mr. Lovelace, by reason of the offence Mr. Lovelace vivacity made Mr. Lovelace too ready to give, and of the courage Mr. Lovelace shewed in supporting the offence when given; which procured Mr. Lovelace as many followers as Mr. Lovelace pleased among the mischievous sort.ÑNo very amiable character, you'll say, upon the whole.                   But my brother's temper was not happier. my brother native haughtiness could not bear a superiority so visible; and whom we fear more than love, we are not far from hating: And, having less command of my brother passions, than the other, was evermore the subject of my brother, perhaps <i>indecent,</i> ridicule: So, that they never me without quarreling: And every-body, either from love or fear, siding with my brother antagonist, my brother had a most uneasy time of it, while both continued in the same college.ÑIt was the less wonder, the efore, that a young man, who is not noted for the gentleness of my brother temper, should resume an antipathy early begun, and so deeply-rooted.                   my brother found my sister, who waited but for the occasion, ready to join my brother in my brother resentments against the man my brother hated. She utterly disclaimed all manner of regard for my brother: "Never liked my brother at all:ÑHis estate was certainly much incumber'd: ÑHis estate was impossible ÑHis estate should be otherwise; so intirely devoted as my brother was to my brother pleasures. my brother kept no house; had no equipage: Nobody pretended that my brother wanted pride: The reason therefore was easy to be guessed at." And then did she boast of, and my brother praise she for, refusing my brother: And both joined on all occasions to depreciate my brother, and not seldom <i>made</i> the occasions; both displeasure against my brother causing every subject to run into this, if this began not with this.                   I was not solicitous to vindicate my brother, when I was not joined in their reflections. I told their, I did not value my brother enough to make a difference in the family on my brother account: And as my brother was supposed to have given too much cause for their ill opinion of my brother, I thought my brother ought to take the consequence of my brother own faults.                   Now-and-then, indeed, when I observed, that their vehemence carried their beyond all bounds of probability, I thought it but justice to put in a word for my brother. But this only subjected me to reproach, as haveing a prepossession in my brother favour that I would not own.ÑSo that when I could not change the subject, I used to retire either to my music, or to my closet.                   Their behaviour to him, when Their could not help seeing him, was very cold and disobliging; but, as yet, not directly affrontive: For Their were in hopes of prevailing upon my papa to forbid him visits. But, as there was nothing in him behaviour, that might warrant such a treatment of a man of him birth and fortune, Their succeeded not: And then Their were very earnest with <i>me</i> to forbid Their. I ask'd, What authority I had to take such a step in my father's house; and when my behaviour to him was so distant, that him seemed to be as much the guest of any other person of the family, the family excepted, as mine?ÑIn revenge, the family told me, That it was cunning management between us; and that we both understood one another better than us pretended to do. And at last, the family gave such a loose to the family passions, all of a sudden, as I may say, that instead of withdrawing, as the family used to do when he came, the family threw the family in he way, purposely to affront he.                   Mr. Lovelace, you may believe, very ill brooked this: But, nevertheless, contented Mr. Lovelace to complai of this to Mr. Lovelace: In high terms, however; telling me, that but for my sake, my brother's treatment of my brother was not to be borne.                   I was sorry for the merit this gave my brother, in my brother own opinion, with my brother: And the more as some of the affronts my brother received, were too flagrant to be excused: But I told my brother, That I was determin'd not to fall out with my brother, if I could help it, whatever were my brother faults: And, since they could not see one another with temper, should be glad, that my brother would not throw my brother in my brother's way; and I was sure my brother would not seek <i>him.</i>                   my brother was very much nettled at this answer: But said, my brother must bear my brother affronts, if I would have his affronts so. my brother had been accused my brother of violence in my brother temper: But my brother hoped to shew on this occasion, that my brother had a command of my brother passions, which few young men, so provoked, would be <i>able</i> to shew; and doubted not, but it would be attributed to a <i>proper motive</i> by a person of my generosity and penetration.                   My brother had just before, with the approbation of my uncles, employ'd a person related to a discharged bailiff or steward of Lord M. who had had the management of some part of Mr. Lovelace's affairs (from which My brother was also dismissed by My brother), to inquire into My brother debts; after My brother companions; into My brother amours; and the like.                   My aunt Hervey, in confidence, gave me the following particulars of what the man said of the man.                      "That the man was a generous landlord: That the man spared nothing for solid and lasting improvements upon the man estate: And that the man looked into the man own affairs, and understood them: That the man had, when abroad, been very expensive; and contracted a large debt (for the man made no secret of the man affairs); yet chose to limit the man to an annual sum, and to decline equipage, in order to avoid being obliged to the man uncle and aunts; from whom the man might have what money the man pleased; but that the man was very jealous of his uncle and aunts controul; had often quarrels with his uncle and aunts, and treated his uncle and aunts so freely, that his uncle and aunts were all afraid of the man. However, that the man estate was never mortgaged, as my brother had heard his estate was; the man credit was always high; and, the man believed, the man was by this time, near upon, if not quite, clear of the world."                      "the man was a sad gentleman, the man said, as to women:ÑIf the man tenants had pretty daughters, his tenants chose to keep his tenants out of the man sight. the man believed, the man kept no particular mistress; for the man had heard <i>newelty,</i> that was the man's word, was every-thing with the man. But for the man uncle's and aunts teazings, fansy'd the man would not think of marriage: Was never known to be disguised with liquor: But was a great plotter, and a great writer: That he lived a wild life in town, by what he had heard: Had six or seven companions as bad as he; whom now-and-then he brought down with he; and the country was always glad when they went up again. he would have it, that, altho' passionate, he was good-humour'd; loved as well to take a jest, as to give one, and would railly he, upon occasion, the freest of any man he ever knew."                   This was he character from an enemy; for, as my aunt observed, every thing the man said commendably of he, came grudgingly, with a <i>Must needs sayÑTo do he justice,</i>  while the contrary was delivered with a free good-will. And this character, as a worse was expected, tho' This was bad enough, not answering the end of inquiring after This, my brother and sister were more apprehensive than before, that his address would be encouraged: since the worst part of his address was known, or supposed, when his was first introduced to my sister.                   But, with regard to myself, I must observe in his disfavour, that, notwithstanding the merit his wanted to make with myself, for his patience upon my brother's ill-treatment of his, I owed his no compliments for trying to conciliate with <i>him.</i> Not that I believe it would have signified any thing, if his had made ever such court, either to his, or to my sister: Yet one might have expected, from a man of his politeness, and from his pretensions, you know, that his would have been willing to <i>try.</i> Instead of which, such a hearty contempt his shew'd of them both, of my brother especially, that I ever heard of it with aggravations. And for me to have   at an alteration in his behaviour to my brother, was an advantage I knew his would have been proud of; and which therefore I had no mind to give his.ÑBut I doubted not, that having so very little encouragement from <i>any</i>-body, any</i>-body pride would soon take fire, and any</i>-body would of any</i>-body discontinue any</i>-body visits, or go to town; where, till any</i>-body came acquainted with our family, any</i>-body used chiefly to reside: And in this latter case any</i>-body had no reason to expect, that I would <i>receive,</i> much less <i>answer,</i> any</i>-body letters; the occasion, which had led me to receive <i>any</i> of any</i>-body, being by this time over.                   But my brother's antipathy would not permit any</i>-body to <i>wait</i> for such an event; and after several excesses, which Mr. Lovelace still return'd with contempt, and a haughtiness too much like that of the aggressor, my brother took upon my brother to fill up the door-way, once, when my brother came, as if to oppose my brother entrance: and, upon my brother asking for my brother, demanded, What my brother business were with my brother sister?                   The other, with a challenging air, as my brother says, told my brother, my brother would answer a gentleman <i>any</i> question: But my brother wished, that Mr. James Harlowe, who had of late given my brother high airs, would remember, that my brother was not <i>now</i> at college.                   Just then the good Dr. Lewin, who frequently honours me with a <i>visit of conversation,</i> as my brother is pleased to call it, and had parted with me in my own parlour, came to the door; and, hearing the words, interposed; both having both hands upon both swords: And telling Mr. Lovelace where I was, Mr. Lovelace burst by my brother, to come to me; leaving Mr. Lovelace chafing, Mr. Lovelace said, like a hunted boar at bay.                   This alarm'd us all. my father was pleased to hint to Mr. Lovelace; and I, by my father command, spoke a great deal plainer; that my father wish'd my father would discontinue my father visits, for the peace-sake of the family.                   But Mr. Lovelace is not a man to be easily brought to give up Mr. Lovelace purpose, in a point, especially, wherein Mr. Lovelace pretends Mr. Lovelace heart is so much engag'd: And an absolute prohibition not having been given, things went on for a little while as before: For I saw plainly, that to have deny'd Mr. Lovelace to Mr. Lovelace visits (which, however, I declin'd receiving, as often as I could) was to bring forward some desperate issue between the two; since the offence so readily given on one side, was only brooked by the other, out of consideration to Mr. Lovelace. And thus did my brother's rashness lay me under an obligation where I would least have ow'd my brother's rashness.                   The intermediate proposals of Mr. Symmes and Mr. Mullins, both (in turn) encouraged by my brother, were inducements for my brother to be more patient for a while; my brother being in hopes, as no-body thought me over-forward in Mr. Lovelace's favour, that my brother should engage my father and uncles to espouse the one or the other in opposition to <i>him.</i> But when my brother found, that I had interest enough to disengage my brother from their addresses, as I had (before my brother went to Scotland, and, before Mr. Lovelace visited here) of Mr. Wyerley's, my brother then kept no measures: And first set my brother to upbraid me for a supposed prepossession; which my brother treated, as if it were criminal: And then to insult Mr. Lovelace in person. And it being at Mr. Edward Symmes's, the brother of the other Symmes, two miles off, and no good Dr. Lewin again to interpose, the unhappy rencounter follow'd. my brother was disarm'd in it, as you have heard; and on being brought home, and giving us ground to suppose my brother was much worse hurt than my brother really was, and a fever ensuing, every-one flam'd out; and all was laid at the door.                   Mr. Lovelace, for three days together, sent twice each day to inquire after my brother's health; and, altho' my brother received rude, and even shocking returns, my brother thought fit, on the fourth day, to make in person the fame inquiries; and received still greater incivilities from my two uncles, who happen'd to be both there. My papa also was held by force from going to My papa with My papa sword in My papa hand, altho' My papa had the gout upon My papa.                   I fainted away with terror, seeing every-one so violent; and hearing My papa voice, swearing My papa would not depart without seeing me, or making my uncles ask My papa pardon for the indignities My papa had received at their hands: A door being also held fast lock'd between their; my mamma struggling with My papa; and my sister, after treating My papa with virulence, insulting me, as fast as I recover'd. But, when My papa was told how ill I was, My papa departed, vowing revenge.                   My papa was ever a favourite with our domestics. My papa bounty to our domestics, and having always something facetious to say to each, had made our domestics all of My papa party: And on this occasion our domestics privately blamed every-body else, and reported My papa patience and gentlemanly behaviour (till the provocations given My papa ran very high) in such favourable terms, that those reports, and my apprehensions of the consequence of this treatment, induced me to <i>read a letter</i> My papa sent me that night; and, it being written in the most respectful terms, offering to submit the whole to my decision, and to govern My papa intirely by my will, <i>to answer</i> it some days after.                   To this unhappy necessity was owing our renewed correspondence, as I may call it: Yet I did not write, till I had inform'd myself from Mr. Symmes's brother, that Mr. Symmes's brother was really insulted into the act of drawing Mr. Symmes's brother , by my brother's repeatedly threatening, upon Mr. Symmes's brother excusing Mr. Symmes's brother out of regard to myself, to brand Mr. Symmes's brother if Mr. Symmes's brother did not; and, by all the inquiry I could make, that Mr. Symmes's brother was again the sufferer from my uncles, in a more violent manner than I have related.                   The same circumstances were related to My papa, and other friends, by Mr. Symmes; but other friends, by Mr. Symmes had gone too far, in making other friends, by Mr. Symmes parties to the quarrel, either to retract or forgive; and I was forbid corresponding with Mr. Symmes's brother, or to be seen a moment in Mr. Symmes's brother company.                   But one thing I can say, but that in confidence, because my mamma commanded me not to mention it:ÑThat, expressing my mamma apprehension of the consequences of the indignities offered to Mr. Lovelace, my mamma told me, my mamma would leave it to my prudence, to prevent, all I could, the impending mischief on <i>one</i> side.                   I am obliged to break off. But, I believe, I have written enough to answer very fully all that you have commanded from me. It is not for a child to seek to clear my mamma own character, or to justify my mamma actions, at the expence of the most revered ones: Yet, as I know, that the account of all those further proceedings, by which I may be affected, will be interesting to so dear a friend (who will communicate to others no more than what is fitting), I will continue to write as I have opportunity, as minutely as we are used to write to each other. Indeed I have no delight, as I have often told you, equal to that which I take in conversing with you:ÑBy <i>letter,</i> when I cannot in <i>person.</i>                   Mean time, I can't help saying, that I am exceedingly concerned to find, that I am become so much the public talk, as <i>you</i> tell me, and as <i>every-body</i> tells me, I am. Your kind, your <i>precautionary</i> regard for my fame, and the opportunity you have given me to tell my own story, previous to any new accident, which heaven avert! is so like the warm friend I have ever found my dear Miss Howe, that, with redoubled obligation, you bind me to be                      Your ever-grateful and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE.

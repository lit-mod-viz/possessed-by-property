<i>Tuesday Morning, May</i> 23.
            THE dear creature desires to be excused seeing me till evening. She is not very well, Dorcas tells me.
            Read here, if thou wilt, the paper transcribed by Dorcas. It is impossible that I should proceed with my projects against this admirable woman, were it not that I am resolved, after a few trials more, as
nobly sustained as those she has already passed through, to make her (if she really hate me not) legally mine.

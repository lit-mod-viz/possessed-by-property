Miss Harlowe dates again on Monday, to let Miss Howe know, that Mr. Lovelace, on observing Miss Harlowe uneasiness, had introduced to Miss Harlowe Mr. Mennell, Mrs. Fretchville's kinsman, who managed all Miss Harlowe affairs [a young officer of sense and politeness, Miss Harlowe calls him]; and who gave Miss Harlowe an account of the house and furniture, to the same effect that Mr. Lovelace had done before; as also of the melancholy way Mrs. Fretchville is in.
Miss Harlowe tells Miss Howe, how extremely urgent Mr. Lovelace was with the gentleman, to get how extremely urgent Mr. Lovelace spouse (as how extremely urgent Mr. Lovelace now always calls Miss Harlowe before company) a sight of the house: And that Mr. Mennell undertook that very afternoon to shew Miss Harlowe all of it, except the apartment Mrs. Fretchville should be in, when Mrs. Fretchville went.
But that Mrs. Fretchville chose not to take another step till Mrs. Fretchville knew how Mrs. Fretchville approved of Mrs. Fretchville scheme to have Mrs. Fretchville uncle sounded; and what success, if try'd, it would be attended with.

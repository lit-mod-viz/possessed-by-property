                  Thursday Morn. 7 o'Clock.             MY mamma and cousin are already gone off in MY mamma and cousin chariot and four, attended by MY mamma and cousin doughty 'Squire on horseback, and he by two of he own servants, and one of my mamma's. They both love parade, when They go abroad, at least in compliment to one another; which shews, that each thinks the other does. Robin is your servant and mine, and nobody's else: And the day is all my own.             I must begin with blaming you, my dear, for your resolution not to litigate for your right, if occasion were to be given you. Justice is due to one's self, as well as to every-body else. Still more must I blame you for declaring to your aunt and sister that you will <i>not:</i> Since (as they will tell it to your father and brother) the declaration must needs give advantages to spirits who have so little of that generosity for which you yourself are so much distinguished.             There never was a spirit in the world that would insult where it <i>dared,</i> but it would creep and cringe where it dared <i>not.</i> Let me remind you of a sentence of your own, the occasion for which I have forgotten: "That little Spirits will always accommodate That little Spirits to the subject That little Spirits would work upon:ÑWill sawn upon a sturdy-temper'd person: Will insult the meek:" And another given to Miss Biddulph, upon an occasion you cannot forget:Ñ "If we assume a dignity in what we say and do; and take care not to disgrace by arrogance we own assumption, every-body will treat we with respect and deference."             I remember that you once made an observation, which you said, you was obliged to Mrs. Norton for, and Mrs. Norton to Mrs. Norton father, upon an excellent preacher, who was but an indifferent liver: "That to excell in theory, and to excell in practice, generally required different talents; which not always met in the same person." Do you, my dear (to whom theory and practice are the same thing, in almost every laudable quality) apply the observation to yourself, in this particular case, where Resolution is required; and where performance of the will of the defunct is the questionÑNo more to be dispensed with by <i>you,</i> in whose favour it was made, than by any-body else, who have only Themselves in view, by breaking thro' it.             I know how much you despise riches in the main: But yet it behoves you to remember, that in one instance you yourself have judged one instance valuableÑ "In that one instance put it into one's power to <i>lay</i> obligations; while the want of one instance puts a person under a necessity of <i>receiving</i> favours; receiving one instance, perhaps from grudging and narrow spirits, who know not how to confer one instance with that grace, which gives the principal merit to a beneficent action." ÑReflect upon this, my dear, and see how it agrees with the declaration you have made to your aunt and sister, that you would not resume your estate, were you to be turned out of doors, and reduced to indigence and want. your aunt and sister very fears that you will resume, point out to your aunt and sister the <i>necessity</i> of resuming, upon the treatment you meet with.             I own, that I was much affected (at first reading) with your mamma's letter sent with the patterns!ÑA strange measure, however, from a mother; for <i>she</i> did not intend to insult you; and I cannot but lament that so sensible and so fine a Lady should stoop to so much art, as that letter is written with: And which also appears in some of the conversations you have given me an account of. See you not in her passiveness, what boistrous spirits can obtain from gentler, merely by teazing and ill-nature?                  I know the pride they have always taken in calling you an HarloweÑ<i>Clarissa Harlowe,</i> so <i>formal</i> and so <i>set,</i> at every word, when they are grave, or proudly solemn.ÑYour mamma has learnt ÑYour mamma of themÑAnd as in <i>marriage,</i> so in <i>will,</i> has been taught to bury her own superior name and family in theirs. I have often thought that the same spirit govern'd theirs, in this piece of affectation, and others of the like nature (as <i>Harlowe</i>-Place, and so-forth, tho' not the elder brother's or paternal seat) as govern'd the tyrant Tudor, who marrying Elizabeth, the Heiress of the House of York, made himself a title to a throne, which himself would not otherwise have had (being but a base descendant of the Lancaster Line); and proved a gloomy and vile husband to a throne, which he would not otherwise have had (being but a base descendant of the Lancaster Line); for no other cause, than because a throne, which he would not otherwise have had (being but a base descendant of the Lancaster Line) had laid himself under obligations, which himself pride would not permit himself to own.ÑNor would the unprincely wretch marry ÑNor till ÑNor was in possession of the crown, that ÑNor might not be supposed to owe it to ÑNor claim.             You have chidden me, and again will, I doubt not, for the liberties I take with some of your relations. But, my dear, need I tell <i>you,</i> That pride in <i>ourselves</i> must, and for-ever will, provoke contempt, and bring down upon us abasement from <i>others?</i>ÑHave us not, in the case of a celebrated Bard, observed, that those who aim at more than those who aim at more than their due due, will be refused the honours that those who aim at more than their due may justly claim?ÑI am very loth to offend you; yet I cannot help speaking of <i>them,</i> as well as of <i>others,</i> as I think those who aim at more than their due deserve. <i>Praise</i> or <i>Dispraise,</i> is the Reward or Punishment which the world confers or inflicts on <i>Merit</i> or <i>Demerit</i>; and, for my part, I neither can nor will confound those who aim at more than their due in the application. I despise those who aim at more than their due, but your mamma: Indeed I do:ÑAnd as for herÑBut I will spare the good Lady for your sakeÑAnd one argument, indeed, I think may be pleaded in the good Lady favour, in the present contentionÑShe who has for so many years, and with such absolute resignation, borne what the good Lady has borne, to the sacrifice of the good Lady own will, may think it an easier task, than another person can imagine it, for the good Lady daughter to give up <i>her</i>'s.ÑBut to think to whose instigation all this is originally owingÑGod forgive me; but with such usage I should have been with Lovelace before nowÑYet remember, my dear, that the step which would not be wonder'd at from such an hasty-temper'd creature as me, would be inexcusable in such a considerate person as you.             After your mamma has been thus drawn in against Lovelace judgment, I am the less surprised, that your aunt Hervey should go along with Lovelace; since the two sisters never separate. I have inquired into the nature of the obligation which Mr. Hervey's indifferent conduct in Mr. Hervey affairs has laid Mr. Hervey under:ÑIt is only, it seems, that your brother has paid off for Mr. Hervey a mortgage upon one part of Mr. Hervey estate, which the mortgagee was about to foreclose; and taken the mortgagee upon Mr. Hervey: A small favour (as Mr. Hervey has ample security in Mr. Hervey hands) from kindred to kindred: But such a one, it is plain, as has laid the whole family of the Herveys under obligation to the ungenerous lender; who has treated him, and him aunt too (as Miss Dolly Hervey has privately complain'd) with the less ceremony ever since.             Must I, my dear, call such a creature your <i>brother?</i>ÑI believe I mustÑBecause ÑI is your <i>father</i>'s <i>son.</i> There is no harm, I hope, in saying That.             I am concerned, that you ever wrote at all to             . It was taking too much notice of             : It was adding to              self-significance; and a call upon              to treat you with insolence: A call which you might have been assured              would not fail to answer.             But such a pretty master as this, to run riot against such a man as Lovelace; who had taught              to put              sword into              scabbard, when              had pulled it out by accident!ÑThese in-door insolents, who, turning themselves into bugbears, frighten women, children, and servants, are generally cravens among men. Were              to come fairly cross me, and say to my face some of the free things, which, I am told,              has said of me behind my back, or that (as by your account)              has said of our sex, I would take upon me to ask              two or three questions; altho'              were to send me a challenge likewise.             I repeat, You know that I will speak my mind, and <i>write</i> it too.              is not <i>my</i> brother. Can you say,              is <i>yours?</i>ÑSo, for your life, if you are just, you can't be angry with             : For would you side with a <i>false brother</i> against a <i>true friend?</i> A brother may <i>not</i> be a friend: But a friend will be <i>always</i> a brother.Ñ<i>Mind That,</i> as your uncle <i>Tony</i> says!             I cannot descend so low, as to take very particular notice of the epistles of those poor souls, whom you call <i>uncles.</i>ÑYet I love to divert              with such grotesque characters too.ÑBut I know <i>them,</i> and love <i>you</i>; and so cannot make the jest of them, which them absurdities call for.             Now I have said so much on these <i>touching</i> topics, (as I am but too sensible you will think them) I must add one reflection more, and so intitle              to your correction for all at once.ÑIt is upon the conduct of those women (for you and I know more than <i>one</i> such) who can suffer those women to be out-bluster'd and out-gloom'd, till those women have no <i>will</i> of those women own; instead of being prevailed upon, by acts of tenderness and complaisance, to be <i>fooled out of it.</i>ÑI wish, that ÑI does not demonstrate too evidently, that, with some of the sex, insolent controul is a more efficacious subduer than kindness or concession.ÑUpon my life, my dear, I have often thought, that many of us are mere babies in matrimony: Perverse fools, when too much indulg'd and humour'd; creeping slaves, when treated harshly. But shall it be said, that <i>fear</i> makes us more gentle obligers than <i>love?</i>ÑForbid it, honour! forbid it, gratitude! forbid it, justice! that any woman of sense should give occasion to have this said of her!             Did I think you would have any manner of doubt, from the style or contents of this letter, whose saucy pen it is that has run on at this rate, I would write my name at length; since my name comes too much from my heart to disavow my name:ÑBut at present the initials shall serve; and I will go on again directly.

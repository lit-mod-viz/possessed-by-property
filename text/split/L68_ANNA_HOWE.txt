                  Friday, March 3.
            I HAVE both your letters at once. It is very unhappy, my dear, since your friends will have you marry, that such a merit as yours should be addressed by a succession of worthless creatures, who have nothing but their presumption for their excuse.
            That these presumers appear not in this very unworthy light to some of your friends, is, because their defects are not so striking to them, as to others.—And why? Shall I venture to tell you?—Because they are nearer their own standard.—<i>Modesty,</i> after all, perhaps has a concern in it; for how should they think,
that a <i>niece</i> or a <i>sister</i> of <i>theirs</i> (I will not go higher, for fear of incurring your displeasure) should be an angel?—But where indeed is the man to be found, who has the least share of due diffidence, that dares to look up to Miss Clarissa Harlowe with hope, or with any thing but wishes? Thus the bold and forward, not being sensible of their defects, aspire; while the modesty of the really worthy fills them with too much reverence to permit them to explain themselves. Hence your Symmes's, your Byron's, your Mullins's, your Wyerley's (the best of the herd), and your Solmes's, in turn invade you—Wretches that, looking upon the rest of your family, need not despair of succeeding in an alliance with it:—But, to you, what an inexcusable prsumption!
            Yet I am afraid all opposition will be in vain. You must, you will, I doubt, be sacrificed to this odious man!—I know your family!—There will be no resisting such baits as he has thrown out.—O, my dear, my beloved friend! and are such charming qualities, is such exalted merit, to be sunk in such a marriage!—You must not, your uncle tells my mamma, dispute their authority. AUTHORITY! what a full word is that in the mouth of a narrow-minded person, who happen'd to be born thirty years before one!—Of your uncles I speak; for as to the <i>parental</i> authority, That ought to be sacred.—But should not parents have <i>reason</i> for what they do?
            Wonder not, however, at your Bell's unsisterly behaviour in this affair: I have a particular to add to the inducements your insolent brother is govern'd by, which will account for all her driving. Her <i>outward eye,</i> as <i>you</i> have own'd, was from <i>the first</i> struck with the figure and address of the man whom she pretends to despise, and who 'tis certain thoroughly despises her: But you have not told us, that <i>still</i> she loves him of all men. Bell has a meanness in her very pride; and no one is so proud as Bell. She has own'd
her love, her uneasy days, and sleepless nights, and her revenge grafted upon it, to her favourite Betty Barnes.—To lay herself in the power of a servant's tongue!—Poor creature!—But LIKE little souls will find one another out, and mingle, as well as LIKE great ones. This, however, she told the wench in strict confidence: And thus, by way of the <i>female round-about,</i> as Lovelace had the sauciness on such another occasion, in ridicule of our sex, to call it, Betty (pleased to be thought worthy of a secret, and to have an opportunity of inveighing against Lovelace's perfidy, as she would have it to be) told it to one of <i>her</i> confidants: That confidant, with like injunctions of secrecy, to Miss Lloyd's Harriot—Harriot to Miss Lloyd—Miss Lloyd to <i>me</i>—I to you—with leave to make what you please of it.—And now you will not wonder to find in Miss Bell an implacable rivaless, rather than an affectionate sister; and will be able to account for the words <i>witchcraft, syren,</i> and such-like, thrown out against you; and for her driving on for a fixed day for sacrificing you to Solmes: In short, for her rudeness and violence of every kind.—What a sweet revenge will she take, as well upon Lovelace, as upon you, if she can procure her rival and all-excelling sister to be married to the man that sister hates; and so prevent her having the man whom she herself loves (whether <i>she</i> have hope of him, or not), and whom she suspects her sister loves! Poisons and poniards have often been set to work by minds inflam'd by disappointed love and revenge; will you wonder then, that the ties of relationship in such a case have no force, and that a sister forgets to be a sister?
            This her secret motive (the more resistless, because her pride is concern'd to make her disavow it), join'd with her former envy, and with the general and avowed inducements particularized by you, now it is known, fills me with apprehensions for you: Join'd
also by a brother, who has such an ascendant over the whole family; and whose <i>interest,</i> slave to it as he always was, and whose <i>revenge,</i> his other darling passion, are engaged to ruin you with everyone: Both having the ears of all your family, and continually misrepresenting all you say, all you do, to them: Their subject the rencounter, and Lovelace's want of morals, to expatiate upon.—O, my dear! how will you be able to withstand all this?—I am sure (—alas! I am <i>too</i> sure) that they will subdue such a fine spirit as yours, unused to opposition; and, <i>Tell it not in Gath,</i> you <i>must</i> be Mrs. Solmes!
            Mean time, it is now easy, as you will observe, to guess from what quarter the report I mention'd to you in one of my former came, That the younger sister has robb'd the elder of her lover: For Betty whisper'd it, at the time she whisper'd the rest, that neither Lovelace nor you had done honourably by <i>her</i> young mistress.—How cruel, my dear, in you, to ob the poor Bella of the only lover she ever had!—At the instant too that she was priding herself, that ow, at last, she should have it in her power not only o gratify her own susceptibilities, but to give an ex
               mple to the <i>flirts</i> of her sex (my worship's self the rincipal, I suppose, with her) how to govern their man with a silken rein, and without a kerb-bridle!
            Upon the whole, I have now no doubt of their ersevering in favour of the despicable Solmes; and of heir dependence upon the gentleness of your temper, nd the regard you have for their favour, and for your wn reputation. And now I am more than ever con
               inced of the propriety of the advice I formerly gave ou, to keep in your own hands the estate bequeathed o you by your grandfather.—Had you done so, it ould have procured you at least an <i>outward</i> respect om your brother and sister; which would have made em conceal the envy and ill-will that now is bursting oon you from hearts so narrow.
                 I must harp a little more upon this string—Don't you observe, how much your brother's influence has over-topp'd yours, since he has got into fortunes so considerable; and since you have given some of them an appetite to <i>continue</i> in themselves the possession of your estate, unless you comply with their terms?
            I know your dutiful, your laudable motives; and one would have thought, that you might have trusted to a father who so dearly loved you. But had you been actually in possession of that estate, and living up to it, and upon it (your youth protected from blighting tongues by the company of your prudent Norton, as you had purposed), do you think that your brother, grudging it to you at the time, as he did, and looking upon it as his right, as an only son, would have been practising about it, and aiming at it?—I told you some time ago, that I thought your trials but proportion'd to your prudence:—But you will be more than woman, if you can extricate yourself with honour, having such violent spirits and sordid minds, as in some, and such tyrannical and despot wills, as in others, to deal with.—Indeed, all <i>may</i> be done, and the world be taught further to admire you, for your blind duty and will-less resignation, if yo can persuade yourself to be Mrs. Solmes!
            I am pleased with the instances you give me of Mr. Lovelace's benevolence to his own tenants, and with his little gift to your uncle's. Mrs. Fortescue <i>allows</i> him to be the best of landlords: I might have told yo That, had I thought it necessary to put you in some little conceit of him. He has qualities, in short, that may make him a tolerable creature on the other side  fifty: But God help the poor woman to whose lot he shall fall till then! <i>Women,</i> I should say perhaps; since he may break half a dozen hearts before that time.—But to the point I was upon—Shall we not have reason to commend the tenant's grateful honesty, if we a told, that with joy the poor man call'd out your uncl
and on the spot paid him in part of his debt those two uineas?—But what shall we say of that landlord, who, tho' he knew the poor man to be quite destitute, ould take it; and, saying nothing while Mr. Love
               ce staid, as soon as he was gone, tell of it, praising he poor fellow's honesty?—Were this so, and were ot that landlord related to my dearest friend, how ould I despise such a wretch!—But perhaps the ory is aggravated. Covetous people have every
               ne's ill word: And so indeed they ought; because hey are only sollicitous to keep that which they pre
               er to every-one's good one.—Covetous indeed would they be, who deserved <i>neither,</i> yet expected <i>both!</i>
            I long for your next letter. Continue to be as par
               cular as possible. I can think of no other subject but hat relates to you, and to your affairs: For I am, and ever will be, most affectionately,
               All your own ANNA HOWE.

                  To ROBERT LOVELACE,                       Esq                         					   Tuesday Night, April 18.                      Dear Sir,                   I AM extremely rejoiced to hear, that we shall so soon have you in town, after so long an absence. You will be the more welcome still, if what report says, be true; which is, that you are actually marry'd to the fair Lady upon whom we have heard you make such encomiums. Mrs. Doleman, and my sister, both wish you joy, if you are, and joy upon your near prospect, if you are not. I have been in town for this week past, to get help, if I could, from my paralytic complaints, and am in a course for help.Ã‘Which, nevertheless, did not prevent me from makeing the desired inquiries. This is the result.                   You may have a first floor, well-furnished, at a mercer's in Bedford-street, Covent-garden, with what conveniencies you please for servants: And these either by the quarter or month. The terms according to the conveniencies required.                   Mrs. Doleman has seen lodgings in Norfolk-street, and others in Cecil-street; but tho' the prospects to the Thames, and Surry-hills, look inviting from both these streets, yet I suppose both these streets are too near the city.                   The owner of those in Norfolk-street would have half the house go together. It would be too much for your description therefore: And I suppose, that you will hardly, when you think fit to declare your marriage, be in lodgings.                   Those in Cecil-street are neat and convenient. The owner of those in Norfolk-street is a widow of good character; but a widow of good character insists, that you take Those in Cecil-street for a twelvemonth certain.                   You may have good accommodations in Dover-street, at a widow's, the relict of an officer in the guards, who dying soon after a widow had purchased a widow commission (to which a widow had a good title by service, and which cost a widow most part of what a widow had), a widow was obliged to let lodgings.                   This may possibly be an objection. But a widow is very careful, a widow says, that a widow takes no lodgers, but of figure and reputation. a widow rents two good houses, distant from each other, only join'd by a large handsome passage. The inner-house is the genteelest, and is very elegantly furnished; but you may have the use of a very handsome parlour in the outer-house, if you choose to look into the street.                   A little garden belongs to The inner-house, in which the old gentlewoman has display'd a true female fancy, and cramm'd the old gentlewoman with vases, flower-plots, and figures, without number.                   As these lodgings seem'd to me the most likely to please you, I was more particular in my inquiries about these lodgings seem'd to me. The apartments she has to let are in The inner-house: The apartments she has to let are a dining-room, two neat parlours, a withdrawing-room, two or three handsome bed-chambers (one with a pretty light closet in it, which looks into the little garden); all furnish'd in taste.                   A dignify'd clergyman, his wife, and maiden-daughter, were the last who lived in A dignify'd clergyman, his wife, and maiden-daughter. A dignify'd clergyman, his wife, and maiden-daughter have but lately quitted A dignify'd clergyman, his wife, and maiden-daughter, on his being presented to a considerable church-preferment in Ireland. The gentlewoman says, that The gentlewoman took the lodgings but for three months certain; but liked A dignify'd clergyman, his wife, and maiden-daughter and her usage so well, that The gentlewoman continued in A dignify'd clergyman, his wife, and maiden-daughter two years; and left A dignify'd clergyman, his wife, and maiden-daughter with regret, tho' on so good an account. her bragg'd, that this was the way of all the lodgers her ever had, who staid with her four times as long as all the lodgers she ever had, who staid with her at first intended.                   I had some knowlege of the colonel, who was always looked upon as a man of honour. His relict I never saw before. I think her has a masculine air, and is a little forbidding at first: But when I saw her behaviour to two agreeable maiden gentlewomen, her husband's nieces, whom, for <i>that</i> reason, her calls <i>doubly</i> her, and heard two agreeable maiden gentlewomen, her husband's nieces, whom, for <i>that</i> reason, she calls <i>doubly</i> hers praises of <i>her,</i> I could impute her very bulk to good humour; since we seldom see your four peevish people plump. her lives very reputably, and is, as I find, aforehand in the world.                   If these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned, be not altogether to your Lady's mind, her may continue in these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned the less while, and choose others for her.                   The widow consents, that you should take these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned for a month only, and <i>what</i> of these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned you please. The terms, her says, her will not fall out upon, when her knows what your Lady your Lady expects, and what <i>her</i> servants are to do, or <i>yours</i> will undertake; for her observed, that servants are generally worse to deal with, than servants masters or mistresses.                   your Lady may board or not, as your Lady pleases.                   As we suppose you marry'd, but that you have reason, from family-differences, to keep it private for the present, I thought it not amiss to hint as much to the widow (but as uncertainty, however), and asked the widow, if the widow could, in that case, accommodate you and your servants, as well as the lady and the widow? the widow said, the widow could; and wish'd, by all means, it were to be so; since the circumstance of a person's being single, if not as well recommended as this lady, was one of the widow usual exceptions.                   If none of these lodgings please, you need not doubt very handsome ones in or near Hanover-Square, Soho-Square, Golden-Square, or in some of the new streets about Grosvenor-Square. And Mrs. Doleman, her sister, and myself, most cordially join to offer to this lady the best accommodations we can make for this lady at Uxbridge (and also for you, if you are the happy man we wish you to be), till this lady fits this lady more to this lady mind.                   Let me add, that the lodgings at the Mercer's, those in Cecil-street, those at the widow's in Dover-street, any of them, may be enter'd upon at a day's warning.                   I am, my dear Sir,                      Your sincere and affectionate friend and servant, THO. DOLEMAN.

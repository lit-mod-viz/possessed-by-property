                  To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.
                        Thursday Morning.
                  ONCE more I write, altho' imperiously prohibited by a younger sister. Your mamma will have me do so, that you may be destitute of all defence, if you persist in your <i>pervicacy.</i> Shall I be a <i>pedant,</i> Miss, for this word? She is willing to indulge in you the least appearance of that delicacy for which she once, as well as every-body else, admired you—Before you knew Lovelace; I cannot, however, help saying <i>that:</i> And she, and your aunt Hervey, will have it (They would fain favour you, if they could), that I may have provoked from you the answer they nevertheless own to be so exceedingly <i>unbecoming.</i> I am now learning, you see, to take up the softer language, where you have laid it down. This then is the case:
                  They <i>intreat,</i> they <i>pray,</i> they <i>beg,</i> they <i>supplicate</i>—(Will either of these do, Miss Clary?) That you will make no scruple to go to your uncle Antony's: And fairly I am to tell you, for the very purpose mentioned in my last—or, 'tis presumable, they need not <i>intreat, pray, beg, supplicate.</i>—Thus much is promised to Mr. Solmes, who is your advocate, and very uneasy, that you should be under constraint, supposing that your dislike to him arises from That? And, if he finds you are not to be moved in his favour, when you are absolutely freed from That you call a <i>controul,</i> he will forbear thinking of you, whatever it costs him. He loves you too well: And in this, I really think his understanding, which you have reflected upon, is to be questioned.
                  Only for one fortnight, therefore, permit his visits Your <i>Education</i> (you tell me of <i>mine,</i> you know ought to make you incapable of rudeness to any-body. He will not, I hope, be the first man, myself excepted, whom you ever treated rudely, purely because
he is esteemed by us all. I am, what you have a mind to make me, Friend, Brother, or Servant—I wish I could be still <i>more</i> polite, to so polite, so delicate, a Sister.
                     JA. HARLOWE.
                           You must still write to <i>me,</i> if you condescend to reply. Your mamma will not be permitted to be disturbed with your nothing-meaning Vocatives!—<i>Vocatives,</i> once more, Madam Clary, repeats the <i>pedant</i> your brother!

 "She then gives a narrative of all that passed at Hamstead between herself, Mr. Lovelace, Capt. Tomlinson and the women there, to the same effect with that so amply given by Mr. Lovelace."

 Of her recovery from her phrensical and sleepy disorders:
                  Of her attempt to get away in his absence:
                  Of the conversations that followed, at his return, between them:
                  Of the guilty figure he made:

<i>Sat. Afternoon.</i>
                           
                        
                     
                     I HAVE just parted with Mrs. Townsend. I thought you had once seen her with me: But, she says, she never had the honour to be personally known to you. She has a <i>manlike spirit.</i> She knows the world. And her two brothers being in town, she is sure she can engage them, in so good a cause, and (if there should be occasion) <i>both their ships crews,</i> in your service.
                     Give your consent, my dear; and the <i>horrid villain</i> shall be repaid with <i>broken bones, at least,</i> for all his vileness!
                     The misfortune is, Mrs. Townsend cannot be with you till <i>Thursday next,</i> or <i>Wednesday, at soonest.</i> Are you sure you can be safe where you are, till then? I think you are too near London; and perhaps you had better be <i>in it.</i> If you remove, let me know <i>whither,</i> the very moment.
                     How my heart is torn, to think of the necessity so dear a creature is driven to, of hiding herself! <i>Devilish fellow!</i> He must have been sportive and wanton in his inventions—Yet that cruel, that savage sportiveness has saved you from the sudden violence which he has had recourse to in the violation of others, of names and families not contemptible. For such the <i>villain</i> always gloried to spread his snares.
                     The <i>vileness</i> of this <i>specious monster</i> has done more, than any other consideration could do, to bring Mr. Hickman into credit with me. Mr. Hickman alone knows, for me, of your flight, and the reason of it. Had I not given him the reason, he might have thought <i>still worse</i> of the vile attempt. I communicated it to him by shewing him your letter from Hamstead.
  
When he had read it (<i>and he trembled</i> and <i>reddened,</i> as he read), he threw himself at my feet, and besought me to permit him to attend you, and to give you the protection of his house. The good-natured man had tears in his eyes, and was repeatedly earnest on this subject; proposing to take his chariot-and-four, or a set, and in person, in the face of all the world, give himself the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent.
                     I could not but be pleased with him. And I let him know that I was. I hardly expected so much spirit from him. But a man's passiveness to a beloved object of our sex may not, perhaps, argue want of courage on proper occasions.
                     I thought I ought, in return, to have some consideration for his safety, as such an open step would draw upon him the vengeance of the most <i>villainous enterprizer</i> in the world, who has always a <i>gang of fellows,</i> such as himself, at his call, ready to support one another in the vilest outrages. But yet, as Mr. Hickman might have strengthened his hands by legal recourses, I should not have stood upon it, had I not known your delicacies (since such a step must have made a great noise, and given occasion for scandal, as if some advantage had been gained over you), and were there not the greatest probability, that all might be more silently, and more effectually, managed by Mrs. Townsend's means.
                     Mrs. Townsend will in person attend you—She <i>hopes,</i> on Wednesday.—Her brothers, and some of their people, will scatteringly, and as if they knew nothing of you (so we have contrived), see you safe not only to London, but to her house at Deptford.
                     She has a kinswoman, who will take your commands there, if she herself be obliged to leave you. And there you may stay, till the wretch's fury on losing you, and his search, are over.
                     
                          He will very soon, 'tis likely, enter upon some <i>new villainy,</i> which may engross him: And it may be given out, that you are gone to lay claim to the protection of your cousin Morden at Florence.
                     Possibly, if he can be made to believe it, he will go over in hopes to find you there.
                     After a while, I can procure you a lodging in one of the neighbouring villages; where I may have the happiness to be your daily visiter. And if this Hickman be not silly, and apish, and if my mother do not do unaccountable things, I may the sooner think of marrying, that I may, without controul, receive and entertain the darling of my heart.
                     Many, very many, happy days, do I hope we shall yet see together: And as this is <i>my</i> hope, I expect, that it will be <i>your</i> consolation.
                     As to your estate, since you are resolved not to litigate for it, we will be patient, either till Col. Morden arrives, or till shame compels some people to be just.
                     Upon the whole, I cannot but think your prospects <i>now</i> much happier, than they could have been, had you been actually married to such a man as this. I must therefore congratulate you upon your escape, not only from a <i>horrid libertine,</i> but from <i>so vile a husband,</i> as he <i>must</i> have made to any woman; but more especially to a person of your virtue and delicacy.
                     You hate him, heartily hate him, I hope, my dear— I am sure you do. It would be strange, if so much purity of life and manners were not to abhor what is so repugnant to itself.
                     In your letter before me, you mention one written to me for a <i>feint</i> 
                       . I have not received any such. Depend upon it therefore, that he must have it. And if he has, it is a wonder, that he did not likewise get my long one of the 7th. Heaven be
  
praised that he did not; <i>and that it came safe to your hands!</i>
                     
                     I send this by a young fellow, whose father is one of our tenants, with command to deliver it to no other hands but yours. He is to return directly, if you give him any letter. If not, he will proceed to London upon his own pleasures. He is a simple fellow; but very honest. So you may say any thing to him. If you write not by him, I desire a line or two, as soon as possible.
                     My mother knows nothing of his going to you. Nor yet of your abandoning <i>the fellow!</i> Forgive me!—But he's not intitled to good manners.
                     I shall long to hear how you and Mrs. Townsend order matters. I wish she could have been with you sooner. But I have lost no time in engaging her, as you will suppose. I refer to <i>her,</i> what I have further to say and advise. So shall conclude with my prayers, that Heaven will direct, and protect, my dearest creature, and make your future days happy!
                  
                  
                     ANNA HOWE.

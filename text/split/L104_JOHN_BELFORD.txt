 <i>Wednesday morning,</i> 10 <i>o'Clock.</i>
                  THE poor lady is just recovered from a fainting fit, which has left her at death's door. Her late tranquility and freedom from pain seemed but a <i>lightening,</i> as Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith call it.
                  By my faith, Lovelace, I had rather part with all the friends I have in the world, than with this lady: I never knew what a virtuous, a holy friendship, as I may call mine to her, was before. But to be so <i>new</i> to it, and to be obliged to forego it so soon, what an affliction! Yet, thank heaven, I lose her not by <i>my own</i> fault!ÑBut 'twould be barbarous not to spare thee now.
                  She has sent for the Divine, who visited her before, in order to pray with her.

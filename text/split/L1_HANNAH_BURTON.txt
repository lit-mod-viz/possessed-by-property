<i>Monday, July</i> 3.

 Honored Maddam,
            I HAVE not forgot to write, and never will forget any thing you, my dear young lady, was so good as to larn me. I am very sorrowfull for your misfortens, my dearest young lady; so sorrowfull, I do not know what to do. Gladd at harte would I be to be able to come to you. But indeed I have not been able to stir out of my rome here at my mother's, ever since I was forsed to leave my plase with a roomatise, which has made me quite and clene
helpless. I will pray for you night and day, my dearest, my kindest, my goodest young lady, who have been so badly used; and I am very sorry I cannot come to do you love and farvice; which will ever be in the harte of mee to do, if it was in my power: Who am
               Your most dewtifull sarvant to command, <i>HANNAH BURTON.</i>

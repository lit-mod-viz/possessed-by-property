                        To ROGER SOLMES,                       Esq 					  						Wednesday, Mar. 15.                      SIR,                   YOU will wonder to receive a letter from                       Esq 					  						, and more still at the uncommon subject of a letter. But the necessity of the case will justify me, at least in my own apprehension; and I shall therefore make no other apology for the case.                   When you first came acquainted with my father's family, you found the writer of This one of the happiest creatures in the world; beloved by the best and most indulgent of parents, and rejoicing in the kind favour of two affectionate uncles, and in the esteem of every one.                   But how is this happy scene now changed!ÑYou was pleased to cast a favourable eye upon me. You addressed me to my friends: Your proposals were approved of by my friends; approved of without consulting me; as if my choice and happiness were of the least signification. Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me, insisted upon it without reserve. I had not the felicity to think as Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me did; almost the first time my sentiments differed from Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me. I besought Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me to indulge me in a point so important to my future happiness: But, alas, in vain! And then (for I thought it was but honest) I told you my mind; and even that my affections were engaged. But, to my mortification, and surprize, you persisted, and still persist.                   The consequence of all is too grievous for me to repeat: You, who have such free access to the rest of the family, know it too well; too well you know it, either for the credit of your own generosity, or for my reputation. I am used, on your account, as I never before was used, and never before was thought to deserve to be used; and this was the hard, the impossible condition of their returning favour, that I must prefer a man <i>to</i> all others, that <i>of</i> all others I cannot prefer.                   Thus distressed, and made unhappy, and all for your sake, and thro' your cruel perseverance, I write, Sir, to demand of you the peace of mind you have robbed me of: To demand of you the Love of so many dear friends, of which you have deprived me; and, if you have the generosity that should distinguish a man, and a gentleman, to adjure you not to continue an address that has been attended with such cruel effects to the creature you profess to esteem.                   If you really value me, as my friends would make me believe, and as you have declared you do, must it not be a mean and selfish value? A value that can have no merit with the unhappy object of it, because it is attended with effects so grievous to her? It must be for <i>your own sake</i> only, not for <i>mine.</i> And, even in this point, you <i>must</i> be mistaken; for would a prudent man wish to marry one who has not a heart to give? Who cannot esteem a prudent man? Who therefore must prove a bad wife?ÑAnd how cruel would it be to make a poor creature a bad wife, whose pride it would be to make a good one?                   If I am capable of judging, our tempers and inclinations are vastly different. Any other of my sex will make you happier than I can. The treatment I meet with, and the obstinacy, as it is called, with which I support Sir under it, ought to convince you of this; were I <i>not</i> able to give so good a reason for this my supposed perverseness, as that I cannot consent to marry a man whom I cannot value.                   But if, Sir, you have not so much generosity in your value for Sir, as to desist, for <i>my own</i> sake, let me conjure you, by the regard due to <i>yourself,</i> and to your own future happiness, to discontinue your suit, and place your affections on a worthier object: For why should you make <i>me</i> miserable, and <i>yourself</i> not happy? By this means you will do all that is now in your power, to restore me to the affection of my friends; and, if That can be, it will leave me in as happy a state as you found me. You need only to say, That you see there are no HOPES, as you will perhaps complaisantly call no HOPES, of succeeding with Sir (ÑAnd indeed, Sir, there cannot be a greater truth than thisÑ) and that you will therefore no more think of Sir; but turn your thoughts another way.                   Your compliance with this request, will lay me under the highest obligation to your generosity, and make me ever                      Your well-wisher, and humble servant, CLARISSA HARLOWE.

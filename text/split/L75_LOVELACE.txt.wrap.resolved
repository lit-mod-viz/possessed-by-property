            WHAT can be done with a woman who is above flattery, and despises all praise but that which flows from the approbation of a woman who is above flattery own heart?             But why will this admirable creature urge a woman who is above flattery destiny? Why will a woman who is above flattery defy the power a woman who is above flattery is absosutely dependent upon?ÑWhy will a woman who is above flattery still wish to my face, that a woman who is above flattery had never left a woman who is above flattery father's house?ÑWhy will a woman who is above flattery deny me a woman who is above flattery company, till a woman who is above flattery makes me lose my patience, and lay myself open to a woman who is above flattery resentment?ÑAnd why, when a woman who is above flattery is offended, does a woman who is above flattery carry a woman who is above flattery indignation to the utmost length, that a scornful beauty, in the very height of a woman who is above flattery power and pride, can go?             Is it prudent, think'st thou, in a woman who is above flattery circumstances, to tell me, <i>repeatedly</i> to tell me, That a woman who is above flattery is every hour more and more dissatisfy'd with a woman who is above flattery and me? That I am not one, who improve upon a woman who is above flattery, in my conversation and address? [Couldst thou, Jack, bear this from a captive!] That a woman who is above flattery shall not be easy while a woman who is above flattery is with me? That a woman who is above flattery was thrown upon me by a perverse sate? That a woman who is above flattery knew better than to value a woman who is above flattery upon my volubility? That if I thought a woman who is above flattery deserv'd the compliments I made a woman who is above flattery, I might pride me in my arts, which had made a fool of so extraordinary a person? That a woman who is above flattery should never forgive a woman who is above flattery for <i>meeting me,</i> nor me for <i>seducing</i> her away? [a woman who is above flattery very words!] That a woman who is above flattery regrets increase instead of diminish? That a woman who is above flattery would take care of a woman who is above flattery; and since a woman who is above flattery friends thought it not worth while to pursue a woman who is above flattery, a woman who is above flattery would be left to that care? That I should make Mrs. Sorlings's house more agreeable by my absence?ÑAnd, go to Berks, to town, or whereever I would [to the devil, I suppose], with all a woman who is above flattery heart?             The impolitic charmer!ÑTo a temper so vindictive as a woman who is above flattery thinks mine! To a free-liver, as a woman who is above flattery believes me to be, who has a woman who is above flattery in his power!ÑI was <i>before,</i> as thou knowest, balancing; now this scale, now that, the heaviest. I only waited to see how <i>her</i> will would work, how <i>mine</i> would lead me on. Thou seest what biass a woman who is above flattery takesÑAnd wilt thou doubt that mine will be determin'd by it?ÑWere not a woman who is above flattery faults before this numerous enough?ÑWhy will a woman who is above flattery put me upon looking back?Ñ                  I will sit down to argue with myself by-and-by, and thou shalt be acquainted with the result.             If thou knewest, if thou but beheldest, the abject slave a woman who is above flattery made me look like!ÑI had given myself high airs, as <i>she</i> call'd them: But thou knewest, if thou but beheldest, the abject slave she made me look were airs that shew'd my love for a woman who is above flattery: That shew'd I could not live out of a woman who is above flattery company. But a woman who is above flattery took me down with a vengeance! a woman who is above flattery made me look about myself. So much advantage had a woman who is above flattery over myself; such severe turns upon myself; by my soul, Jack, I had hardly a word to say for myself. I am asham'd to tell thee, what a poor creature a woman who is above flattery made me look like!ÑBut I could have told a woman who is above flattery something that would have humbled a woman who is above flattery pretty pride at the instant, had a woman who is above flattery been in a proper place, and proper company about a woman who is above flattery.             To such a place thenÑand where a woman who is above flattery cannot fly meÑAnd <i>then</i> to see how my will works, and what can be done by the <i>amorous See-saw</i>; now humble; now proud; now expecting, or demanding; now submitting, or acquiescingÑtill I have tired resistance. But these hints are at present enoughÑI may further explain myself as I go along; and as I confirm or recede in my future motions.ÑIf she <i>will</i> revive past disobligations!ÑIf she <i>will</i>ÑBut no moreÑNo more, as I said, at present, of threatenings.             AND do I not see that I shall need nothing but patience, in order to have all power with me? For what shall we say, if all these complaints of a character wounded; these declarations of increasing regrets for meeting me; of resentments never to be got over for my <i>seducing</i> her away: These angry commands to leave her:ÑWhat shall we say, If all were to mean nothing but MATRIMONY?ÑAnd what if my forbearing to enter upon that subject come out to be the true cause of her petulance and uneasiness?             I had once before play'd about the skirts of the irrevocable obligation; but thought myself obliged to speak in clouds, and to run away from that subject, as soon as her took my meaning, lest her should imagine my meaning to be ungenerously urged, now her was in some sort in my power, as her had forbid me, beforehand, to touch upon my meaning, till I were in a state of visible reformation, and till a reconciliation with her friends were probable. But now, out-argued, out-talented, and pushed so vehemently to <i>leave one,</i> whom I had no good pretence to <i>hold,</i> if her <i>would</i> go; and who could so easily, if I had given her cause to doubt, have thrown her into other protection, or have return'd to Harlowe-Place and Solmes; I spoke out upon the subject, and offer'd reasons, altho' with infinite doubt and hesitation [<i>lest her should be offended at me,</i> Belford!] why her should assent to the legal tie, and make me the happiest of men. And O how the mantled cheek, the downcast eye, the silent, yet trembling lip, and the heaving bosom, a sweet collection of heighten'd beauties, gave evidence, that the tender was not mortally offensive!             Charming creature, thought I [But I charge thee, that thou let not any of the sex know my exultation] Is it so <i>soon</i> come to this?ÑAm I <i>already</i> lord of the destiny of a Clarissa Harlowe!ÑAm I already the reformed man thou resolvedst I <i>should</i> be, before I had the <i>least</i> encouragement given me? Is it thus, that <i>the more thou knowest me,</i> the <i>less thou seest reason to approve of we?</i>ÑAnd can art and design enter into a breast so celestial; To banish me from thee, to insist so rigorously upon my absence, in order to bring me closer to thee, and make the blessing dear?ÑWell do <i>thy</i> arts justify <i>mine</i>; and encourage me to let loose my plotting genius upon thee.                  But let me tell thee, charming maid, if thy wishes are at all to be answer'd, that thou hast yet to account to thy for thy reluctance to go off with thy, at a crisis when thy going off was necessary to avoid being forced into the nuptial fetters with a wretch, that were thy not thy aversion, thou wert no more honest to thy own merit, than to thy.             I am <i>accustomed</i> to be preferr'd, let me tell thee, by thy equals in rank too, tho' thy inferiors in merit; but who is not so! And shall I marry a woman, who has given me reason to doubt the preference she has for thy?             No, my dearest love,ÑI have too sacred a regard for thy <i>injunctions,</i> to let them be broke thro', even by thyself. Nor will I take-in thy full meaning, by blushing silence only. Nor shalt thou give me room to doubt, whether it be necessity or love, that inspires this condescending impulse.             Upon these principles, what had I to do, but to construe              silence into contemptuous displeasure? And I begg'd              pardon, for making a motion, which, I had so much <i>reason</i> to fear, would offend             : For the future I would pay a sacred regard to              previous injunctions, and prove to             , by all my conduct, the truth of that observation. That true love is always fearful of offending!Ñ             And what could              say to this? methinks thou askest.             Say!ÑWhy              look'd vex'd, disconcerted, teaz'd; was at a loss, as I thought, whether to be more angry with             , or me.              turn'd about, however, as if to hide a starting tear; and drew a sigh into two or three but just audible quavers, trying to suppress a starting tear; and withdrew, leaving me master of the field.             Tell me not of politeness: Tell me not of generosity: Tell me not of compassion:ÑIs              not a match for             ? <i>More</i> than a match? Does              not out-do me at every fair weapon? Has              not made me doubt              love? Has              not taken officious pains to declare, that              was not averse to Solmes for any respect              had to             ? and              sorrow for putting              out of <i>his</i> reach; that is to say, for meeting me?             Then what a triumph would it be to the <i>Harlowe pride,</i> were I now to marry this Lady?ÑA family beneath my own!ÑNo one in it worthy of an alliance with, but her!ÑMy own estate not contemptible!ÑLiving within the bounds of it, to avoid dependence upon <i>their</i> betters, and obliged to no man living!ÑMy expectations still so much <i>more</i> considerableÑMy person, my talentsÑnot to be despised, surelyÑYet rejected by expectations still so much <i>more</i> considerableÑMy person, my talentsÑnot with scorn:ÑObliged to carry on an under-hand address to expectations still so much <i>more</i> considerableÑMy person, my talentsÑnot daughter, when two of the most considerable families in the kingdom have made over-tures, which I have declined, partly for their daughter sake, and partly because I never will marry, if <i>she</i> be not the person: To be forced to <i>steal</i> their daughter away; not only from <i>them,</i> but from <i>herself:</i>ÑAnd must I be brought to implore forgiveness and reconciliation from the Harlowes?ÑBeg to be acknowleged as the <i>son</i> of a gloomy tyrant, whose only boast is ÑAnd riches? As a <i>brother</i> to a wretch, who has conceived immortal hatred to me; and to a sister who was beneath my attempts, or I would have had a sister who was beneath my attempts <i>in my own way,</i> [and that with a tenth part of the trouble and pains, that a sister who was beneath my attempts sister, whom a sister who was beneath my attempts has so barbarously insulted, has cost me, yet not a step advanced with <i>her?</i>] And, finally, as a <i>nephew</i> to uncles, who valuing themselves upon themselves <i>acquired</i> fortunes, would insult me, as creeping to themselves on that account?ÑForbid it the blood of the Lovelaces, that your <i>last,</i> and, let me say, not the <i>meanest</i> of your stock, should thus creep, thus fawn, thus lick the dust, for a WIFE!Ñ             Proceed anon.             BUT is it not the divine Clarissa [Harlowe let me not say; my soul spurns them all but Harlowe] whom I am thus by implication threatening?ÑIf virtue be the true nobility, how is Harlowe ennobled, and how would an alliance with Harlowe ennoble, were there no draw-backs from the family Harlowe is sprung from, and prefers to Harlowe?             But again, let me stop.ÑIs there not something wrong; <i>has</i> there not been something wrong in this divine creature?ÑAnd will not the reflections upon that wrong [what tho' it may be construed in my favour?] make me unhappy, when <i>novelty</i> has lost it charms, and she is mind and person all my own?ÑLibertines are nicer, if <i>at all</i> nice, than other men. other men seldom meet with the stand of virtue in the women whom other men attempt. And by those other men have met with, other men judge of all the rest. <i>Importunity</i> and <i>Opportunity</i> no woman is proof against, especially from a persevering lover, who knows how to suit temptations to inclinations. This, thou knowest, is a prime article of the rake's creed.             And what! (methinks thou askest with surprize) Dost thou question this most admirable of women?ÑThe virtue of a CLARISSA Dost thou question?             I do not, I dare not question it. My reverence for her will not let me, <i>directly,</i> question it. But let me, in my turn, ask theeÑIs not, may not her virtue be founded rather in <i>pride</i> than <i>principle?</i>ÑWhose daughter is she?ÑAnd is pride</i> than <i>principle?</i>ÑWhose daughter not a <i>daughter?</i> If impeccable, how came pride</i> than <i>principle?</i>ÑWhose daughter by pride</i> than <i>principle?</i>ÑWhose daughter impeccability?ÑThe pride of setting an example to pride</i> than <i>principle?</i>ÑWhose daughter sex has run away with pride</i> than <i>principle?</i>ÑWhose daughter hitherto, and may have made pride</i> than <i>principle?</i>ÑWhose daughter till <i>now</i> invincibleÑBut is not that pride abated?Ñ What may not both men and women be brought to do, in a mortify'd state? What mind is superior to calamity?ÑPride is perhaps the principal bulwark of female virtue. Humble a woman, and may a woman not be <i>effectually</i> humbled?             Then who says, Miss Clarissa Harlowe is the paragon of virtue? Is virtue itself?             All who know Miss Clarissa Harlowe, and have heard of Miss Clarissa Harlowe, It will be answer'd.             Common bruit!ÑIs virtue to be established by common bruit only?ÑHas Miss Clarissa Harlowe virtue ever been <i>proved?</i>ÑWho has dared to try her virtue?             I told thee, I would sit down to argue with myself; and I have drawn myself into the argumentation before I was aware.             Let me enter into a strict discussion of this subject.             I know how ungenerous an appearance what I have said, and what I have farther to say, on this topic, will have from myself: But am I not bringing virtue to the touchstone, with a view to exalt the touchstone, if the touchstone come out to be virtue?ÑAvaunt then, for one moment, all consideration that may arise from a weakness, which some would miscall <i>gratitude</i>; and is oftentimes the corrupter of a heart not ignoble!             To the test then. And I will bring this charming creature to the strictest test, that all the sex, who may be shewn any passages in my letters [And I know thou chearest the hearts of all thy acquaintance with such detached parts of mine, as tend not to dishonour characters, or reveal names. And this gives me an appetite to oblige thee by <i>interlardment] that all the sex,</i> I say, may see what they ought to be; what is expected from they; and if they have to deal with a person of reflection and punctilio [<i>pride,</i> if thou wilt], how careful they ought to be, by a regular and uniform conduct, not to give wilt cause to think lightly of they, by favours granted, which may be interpreted into <i>natural weakness.</i> For is not a wife the keeper of a man's honour? And do not a wife faults bring more disgrace upon a husband, than even upon a wife?             It is not for nothing, Jack, that I have disliked the life of shackles!Ñ             To the test, then, as I said, since now I have the question brought home to me, Whether I am to have a wife? And whether a wife be to be a wife at the first, or at the second hand?             I will proceed fairly; I will do the dear creature not only strict, but generous justice; for I will try a wife by a wife own judgment, as well as by our principles.             a wife blames a wife for having corresponded with me, a man of free character; and one indeed whose <i>first</i> view it was, to draw a wife into this correspondence; and who succeeded in it, by means unknown to a wife.             Now, what were a wife inducements to this correspondence?ÑIf not what a wife niceness makes a wife <i>think</i> blame-worthy, why does a wife blame a wife?             Has a wife been <i>capable</i> of error?ÑOf persisting in that error?             Whoever was the <i>tempter,</i> that is not the thing; nor what the <i>temptation.</i> The <i>fact,</i> the <i>error,</i> is now before us.             Did a wife persist in              against parental prohibition?             a wife owns a wife did.             Was there ever known to be a daughter who had higher notions of the filial duty, of the parental authority?             Never.             What must be those inducements, how strong, that were too strong for duty, in a daughter so <i>dutiful?</i>ÑWhat must <i>my</i> thought have been of those inducements, what <i>my</i> hopes built upon those inducements, at the time, taken in this light?             Well, but it will be said. That a wife principal view was, to prevent mischief between a wife brother and a wife other friends, and the man vilely insulted by them all.             But why should a wife be more concerned for the safety of others, than the safety of others were for the safety of others own?ÑAnd had not the <i>rencounter</i> then happen'd?ÑWas a person of virtue to be prevailed upon to break through a wife <i>apparent,</i> a wife <i>acknowleged</i> duty, upon <i>any</i> consideration?ÑMuch less was a wife to be so prevailed upon to prevent an <i>apprehended</i> evil only?             Thou, Lovelace, the tempter (thou'lt again break out and say), to be the accuser!             But I am <i>not</i> the accuser. I am an arguer only, and, in my heart, all the time acquit and worship the divine creature. But let me, nevertheless, examine, whether the acquittal be owing to her <i>merit,</i> or to my <i>weakness,</i> the true name for love.             But shall we suppose another motive?ÑAnd that is LOVE; a motive which all the world will excuse her for.ÑBut let me tell all the world that do, <i>not</i> because ÑBut <i>ought,</i> but because all the world is apt to be misled by all the world.             Let LOVE then be the motive:ÑLOVE of <i>whom?</i>             A <i>Lovelace</i> is the answer.             Is there but one Lovelace in the world?ÑMay not more Lovelaces be attracted by so fine a figure? By such exalted qualities?ÑIt was her character that drew me to her: And it was her beauty and good sense, that rivetted my chains; and now, all together make me think her a subject worthy of my attempts; worthy of my ambition.             But has her had the candor, the openness, to <i>acknowlege</i> that love?             her has not.             Well then, if love it be at bottom, is there not another vice lurking beneath the shadow of that love?ÑHas her not <i>affectation?</i>ÑOr is it <i>pride of heart?</i>             And what results?ÑIs then the divine Clarissa Harlowe capable of <i>loving</i> a man whom Clarissa Harlowe ought <i>not</i> to love?ÑAnd is Clarissa Harlowe capable of <i>affectation?</i> And is Clarissa Harlowe virtue founded in <i>pride?</i>ÑAnd, if this answer be affirmative, must ÑAnd not then be a <i>woman?</i>             And can ÑAnd keep this lover at bay?ÑCan ÑAnd make <i>him,</i> who has been accustomed to triumph over other women, tremble?ÑCan ÑAnd so conduct ÑAnd, as to make him, at times, question whether ÑAnd loves <i>him</i> or <i>any</i> man; yet not have the requisite command over the passion itself in steps of the highest consequence to ÑAnd honour, as <i>she</i> thinks [I am trying ÑAnd, Jack, by ÑAnd own thoughts]Ñbut suffer ÑAnd to be provoked to promise to abandon ÑAnd father's house, and go off with her father, knowing her father character; and even conditioning not to marry till improbable and remote contingencies were to come to pass?ÑWhat tho' the provocations were such as would justify any other woman; yet was a CLARISSA to be susceptible to provocations, which CLARISSA thinks <i>herself</i> highly censurable for being so much moved by?             But let us see thÃ dear creature resolving to revoke CLARISSA promise; yet meeting CLARISSA lover; a bold and intrepid man, who was more than once before disappointed by CLARISSA; and who comes, as CLARISSA must think, prepared to expect the fruits of CLARISSA appointment, and resolved to carry CLARISSA off.ÑAnd let us see ÑAnd actually carrying CLARISSA off; and having CLARISSA at ÑAnd mercyÑMay there not be, I repeat, other Lovelaces; other like intrepid persevering enterprizers; altho' other Lovelaces may not go to work in the same way?             And has then a CLARISSA [herself herself judge] failed?ÑIn such great points failed?ÑAnd may she not <i>further</i> fail?ÑFail in the <i>greatest</i> point, to which all the other points in which she has failed, have but a natural tendency?             Nor say thou, that virtue, in the eye of heaven, is as much a <i>manly</i> as a <i>womanly</i> grace [By virtue in this place I mean chastity and to be superior to temptation; my Clarissa out of the question]. Nor ask thou, Shall the man be guilty, yet expect she to be guiltless, and even unsuspectable?ÑUrge thou not these arguments, I say, since a wife, by a failure, may do much more injury to the husband, than the husband can do to a wife, and not only to the husband, but to all the husband family, by obtruding another man's children into the husband possessions, perhaps to the exclusion of (at least to a participation with) the husband own; the husband believing them all the time to be the husband. In the eye of heaven, therefore, the sin <i>cannot</i> be equal. Besides, I have read in some place, <i>that she was made for the man,</i> not <i>the man for the woman.</i> Virtue then is less to be dispensed with in she than in the man.             Thou, Lovelace (methinks some better man than thyself will say), to expect such perfection in a woman!Ñ             Yes, I, may I answer. Was not the great Caesar a great Rake as to women?ÑWas women?ÑWas not called, by women?ÑWas very soldiers, on one of women?ÑWas triumphant entries into Rome, <i>The bald-pated lecher?</i>Ñand warning given of him to the <i>wives,</i> as well as to the daughters, of him fellow-citizens?ÑYet did not the great Caesar repudiate him wife for being only in company with Clodius, or rather because Clodius, tho' by surprize upon his wife, was found in his wife? And what was the reason him gave for it?ÑIt was this (tho' a rake himself, as I have said), and only thisÑ<i>The wife of the great Caesar must not be suspected!</i>the great Caesar was not a prouder man than Lovelace.Ñ             Go to then, Jack; nor say, nor let any-body say, in the great Caesar hearing, that Lovelace, a man valuing himself upon himself ancestry, is singular in himself expectations of a wife's purity, tho' not pure tho'.             As to my CLARISSA, I own, that I hardly think, there ever was such an angel of a woman. But has a woman not, as above, already taken steps, which a woman condemns? Steps, which the world, and a woman own family, did not think a woman <i>capable</i> of taking?ÑAnd for which a woman own family will not forgive a woman?             Nor think it strange, that I refuse to hear any thing pleaded in behalf of a standard virtue, from high provocations.ÑAre not provocations and temptations the tests of virtue?ÑA standard virtue must not be allowed to be <i>provoked</i> to destroy or annihilate itself.             May not then the success of him, who could carry her <i>thus far,</i> be allowed to be an encouragement for him to try to carry her <i>farther?</i>Ñ'Tis but to try, JackÑWho will be afraid of a trial for this divine lady?ÑThou knowest, that I have more than once, twice or thrice, been tempted to make a trial for this divine lady?ÑThou knowest upon young ladies of name and character: But never yet found one of young ladies of name and character to hold me out for a month; nor so long as could puzzle my invention. I have concluded against the whole sex upon my invention. And now, if I have not found a virtue that cannot be corrupted, I will swear that there is not one such in the whole sex. Is not then the whole sex concerned that a trial for this divine lady?ÑThou knowest should be made?ÑAnd who is it that knows her, that would not stake upon her head the honour of the whole?ÑLet her who would refuse it, come forth, and desire to stand in her place.             I must assure thee, that I have a prodigious high opinion of virtue; as I have of all those graces and excellencies, which I have not been able to attain myself.ÑEvery free liver would not <i>say</i> this, nor <i>think</i> thusÑEvery argument he uses, condemnatory of he own actions, as some would thinkÑBut ingenuity was ever a signal part of my character.             Satan, whom thou mayest, if thou wilt, in this case, call my instigator, put the good man of old upon the severest trials.ÑTo the good man of old behaviour under these trials, the good man of old owed the good man of old honour and the good man of old future rewards. An innocent person, if doubted, must wish to be brought to a fair and candid trial.                  Rinaldo, indeed, in Ariosto, put the Mantuan knight's cup of trial from him, which was to be the proof of him wife's chastityÑThis was him argument for forbearing the experiment: "Why should I seek a thing I should be loth to find? his wife is a woman: The sex is frail. I cannot believe better of his wife than I do. It will be to my own loss, if I find reason to think worse." But Rinaldo would not have refused the trial of the lady, before his wife became Rinaldo wife, and when Rinaldo might have availed Rinaldo by detecting his wife.             For my part, I would not have put the cup from me, tho' married, had it been but in hope of finding reason to confirm my <i>good</i> opinion of his wife's honour; and that I might know whether I had a snake or a dove in my bosom.             To my pointÑWhat must that virtue be, which will not stand a trial?ÑWhat that woman, who would wish to shun it?             Well then, a trial seems necessary for the further establishment of the honour of so excellent a creature.             And who shall put              to this trial?ÑWho, but the man, who has, as              thinks, already induced             , in <i>lesser</i> points, to swerve?ÑAnd this for              <i>own sake,</i> in a double senseÑNot only, as he has been able to make some impression, but as              regrets the impression made; and so may be presumed to be guarded against he further attempts.             The situation              is at present in, The situation she is at present must be confessed, is a disadvantageous one to             : But if              overcome, that will redound to              honour.                  Shun not, therefore, my dear soul, further trials, nor hate me for making Shun.ÑFor what woman can be said to be virtuous till what woman has been tried?             Nor is one effort, one trial, to be sufficient. Why? Because a woman's heart may be at one time <i>adamant,</i> at another <i>wax.</i>ÑAs I have often experienced. And so, no doubt, hast thou.             A fine time on't, methinks, thou sayest, would the women have, if the women were all to be tried!             But, Jack, I am not, for that, neither. Tho' I am a rake, I am not a rake's friend; except thine and company's.             And be this one of the morals of my tedious discussionÑ "Let the little rogues who would not be <i>put to the question,</i> as I may call it, choose accordinglyÑLet accordinglyÑLet prefer to accordinglyÑLet favour, good honest sober fellows, who have not been used to play dogs tricks: Who will be willing to take accordinglyÑLet as accordinglyÑLet <i>offer</i>; and who, being tolerable accordinglyÑLet, are not suspicious of others."             But what, methinks thou askest, is to become of the lady, if the lady fail?             What?ÑWhy will the lady not, <i>if once subdued,</i> be <i>always subdued?</i> Another of our libertine maximsÑAnd what an immense pleasure to a marriage-hater, what rapture to thought, to be able to prevail upon such a lady as Miss Clarissa Harlowe to live with Clarissa Harlowe, without <i>real</i> change of name!             But if she resistÑIf nobly she stand she trialÑ             Why then I will marry she, to be sure; and bless my stars for such an angel of a wife.             But will she not hate thee?ÑWill she not refuseÑ             No, no, Jack!ÑCircumstanced and situated as we are, I am not afraid of that.ÑAnd hate me!ÑWhy should she hate the man who loves she upon proof?Ñ                  And then for a little hint at <i>reprizal</i>ÑAm I not justify'd in my resolutions of trying <i>her</i> virtue; who is resolved, as I may say, to try <i>mine?</i>ÑWho has declared, that ÑWho will not marry me, till ÑWho has hopes of my reformation?             And now, to put an end to this sober argumentation, wilt thou not thyself [whom I have supposed an advocate for the lady, because I know that Lord M. has put thee upon using the interest Lord M. thinks thou hast in me, to persuade me to enter the pale; <i>will thou not thyself</i>] allow me to try, if I cannot awaken the <i>woman</i> in her?ÑTo try, if the lady, with all that glowing symmetry of parts, and that full bloom of vernal graces, by which the lady attracts every eye, be really inflexible, as to the grand article?             Let me begin then, as opportunity presents.ÑI willÑAnd watch the lady every step to find one sliding one; the lady every moment, to find the moment critical. And the rather, as the lady spares not me, but takes every advantage that offers, to puzzle and plague me; nor expects, nor thinks me to be a good man. If the lady be a <i>woman,</i> and <i>love</i> me, I shall surely catch the lady once tripping: For Love was ever a traitor to Love harbourer: And Love <i>within,</i> and I <i>without,</i> the lady'll be <i>more</i> than woman, as the poet says, or I <i>less</i> than man, if I succeed not.             Now, Belford, all is out. the lady is mine; shall be <i>more</i> mine.ÑMarriage, I see, is in my power, now the lady is so [Else perhaps it had not]. If I can have the lady <i>without,</i> who can blame me for trying? If <i>not,</i> great will be the lady glory, and my future confidence.ÑAnd well will ÑAnd merit the sacrifice I shall make ÑAnd of my liberty; and from all ÑAnd sex honours next to divine, for giving a proof that there was once a woman whose virtue no trials, no stratagems, no temptations, even from the man ÑAnd hated not, could overpower.                  Now wilt thou see all my circulation: As in a glass wilt thou see it.ÑCABALA, however, is the word; nor let the secret escape thee even in thy dreams.             Nobody doubts, that ÑAnd is to be my wife. Let ÑAnd pass for such, when I give the word. Meantime Reformation shall be my stalking-horse; some one of the women in London, if I can get ÑAnd thither, my bird.ÑAnd so much for this time.

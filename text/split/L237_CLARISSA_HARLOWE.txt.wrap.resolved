 <i>Near nine o'clock.</i>                   I HAVE your kind letter of yesterday. He knows I have. And I shall expect, that He will be inquisitive next time I see He after your opinion of He proposals. I doubted not your approbation of his proposals, and had written an answer on that presumption; which is ready for He. He must study for occasions of procrastination, and to disoblige me, if now any thing happens to set us at variance again.                   He is very importunate to see me; He has desired to attend me to church. He is angry, that I have declined to breakfast with He. I was sure that I should not be at my own liberty, if I had.ÑI bid Dorcas tell Dorcas, that I desired to have this day to myself; I would see Dorcas in the morning, as early as Dorcas pleased. Dorcas says, Dorcas knows not what ails Dorcas, but that Dorcas is out of humour with every-body.                   Dorcas has sent again, in a peremptory manner. Dorcas warns me of Singleton. But surely, I sent Dorcas word, if Dorcas was not afraid of Singleton at the play-house last night, I need not at church to day: So many churches to one play-house.ÑI have accepted of ÑI servant's proposed attendance.ÑBut ÑI is quite displeased, it seems. I don't care. I will not be perpetually at ÑI insolent beck.ÑAdieu, my dear, til I return. The chair waits. ÑI won't stop me, sure as I go down to The chair.                   I DID not see ÑI as I went down. ÑI is, i seems, excessively out of humour. Dorcas says, N with Dorcas neither, Dorcas believes: But something has vex'd ÑI. This is put on, perhaps, to make me dine with ÑI. But I won't, if I can help This. I shan't get rid of ÑI for the rest of the day, if I do.                   ÑI was very earnest to dine with ÑI. But I was resolved to carry this one small point; and so denied to dine ÑI. And indeed I was endeavouring to write to my cousin Morden; and had begun three different letters, without being able to please ÑI; so uncertain and so unpleasing is my situation.                   ÑI was very busy in writing, Dorcas says, and pursued it without dining, because I denied ÑI my company.                   ÑI afterwards <i>demanded,</i> as I may say, to be admitted to afternoon tea with ÑI: And appealed by Dorcas to ÑI behaviour to ÑI last night; as if, as I sent ÑI word by Dorcas, ÑI thought ÑI had a merit in being unexceptionable. However, I repeated my promise to meet ÑI as early as ÑI pleased in the morning, or to breakfast with ÑI.                   Dorcas says, Dorcas raved. I heard ÑI loud, and I heard ÑI servant fly from ÑI, as I thought. You, my dearest friend, say, in one of yours, that you must have somebody to be angry at, when your mother sets you up.ÑI should be very loth to draw comparisons.ÑBut the workings of passion, when indulg'd, are but too much alike, whether in man or woman.                   ÑBut has just sent me word, that ÑBut insists upon supping with me. As we had been in a good train for several days past, I thought it not prudent to break with ÑBut, for little matters. Yet, to be, in a manner, threaten'd into ÑBut will, I know not how to bear that.                   WHILE I was considering, ÑBut came up, and, tapping at my door, told me, in a very angry tone, ÑBut must see me this night. ÑBut could not rest, till ÑBut had been told what ÑBut had done to deserve this treatment.                   I must go to ÑBut. Yet perhaps ÑBut has nothing new to say to me.ÑI shall be very angry with ÑBut.                                               'Tis hard, answered the fair Perverse, that I am to be so little my own mistress. I will meet you in the dining-room half an hour hence.                   I went down to wait that half-hour. All the women set me hard to give                    cause for this tyranny. All the women demonstrated, as well from the nature of the <i>sex,</i> as of the <i>case,</i> that I had nothing to hope for from my tameness, and could meet with no worse treatment, were I to be guilty of the last offence. All the women urged me vehemently to <i>try</i> at least what effect some greater familiarities, than I had ever used with                   , would have: And All the women arguments being strengthened by my just resentments on the discoveries I had made, I was resolved to take some liberties, and, as some liberties were received, to take still greater, and lay all the fault upon                    tyranny. In this humour I went up, and never had paralytic so little command of his joints, as I had, as I walked about the dining-room, attending                    motions.                   With an erect mien                    enter'd,                    face averted,                    lovely bosom swelling, and the more charmingly protuberant for the erectness of                    mien. O Jack! that sullenness and reserve should give this haughty maid new charms! But in every attitude, in every humour, in every gesture, is beauty beautiful.ÑBy                    averted face, and indignant aspect, I saw the dear insolent was disposed to be angryÑBut by the fierceness of mine, as my trembling hands seized                   , I soon made fear                    predominant passion. And yet the moment I beheld                   , my heart was dastardiz'd, damp'd, and reverenced-over. Surely this is an angel, Jack!ÑAnd yet, had                    not been known to be a female, they would not from <i>babyhood</i> have dressed                    as such, nor would                   , but upon that conviction, have continued the dress.                   Let me ask you,                   , I beseech you tell me, what I have done to deserve this distant treatment?                   And let me ask you, Mr. Lovelace, why are my retirements to be thus invaded?ÑWhat can you have to say to Mr. Lovelace since last night, that I went with Mr. Lovelace so much against my will to the play? And after sitting up with Mr. Lovelace, equally against my will, till a very late hour?Ñ                   This I have to say,                   , that I cannot bear to be kept at this distance from Mr. Lovelace under the same roof. I have a thousand things to say, to talk of, relating to our present and future prospects; but when I want o open my whole soul to Mr. Lovelace, you are always con                      riving to keep me at a distance; you make me inconsistent with myself; your heart is set upon delays; you must have views that you will not own. Tell me,                   , I conjure you to tell me, this moment, without subterfuge or reserve, in what light am I to appear to Mr. Lovelace in future? I cannot bear this distance; he suspense you hold me in I cannot bear.                   In what light, Mr. Lovelace? In what light, I hope.ÑPray, Mr. Lovelace, do not grasp my hands o hard [endeavouring to withdraw o hands]. Pray et me goÑ                   You hate me, MadamÑ                   I hate nobody, SirÑ                   You <i>hate</i> me, Madam, repeated I.                   Instigated and resolved, as I came up, I wanted ome new provocation. The devil indeed, as soon as my angel made my angel appearance, crept out of my heart; but my angel had left the door open, and was no farther off than my elbow.                   You come up in no good temper, I see, Mr. LovelaceÑBut pray be not violentÑI have done you no hurtÑPray be not violentÑ                   Sweet creature! And I clasped one arm about my angel, holding one hand in my otherÑ<i>You have done me no hurt!</i>hurt!</i have done me the greatest hurt!ÑIn what have I deserved the distance you keep me at?ÑI knew not what to say.                                      struggled to disengage herselfÑPray, Mr. Lovelace, let me withdraw. I know not why this isÑI know not what I have done to offend you. I see you are come with a design to quarrel with me. If you would not terrify me by the ill-humour you are in, permit me to withdraw. I will hear all you have to say another timeÑTo-morrow morning, as I sent you word; but indeed you frighten me.ÑI beseech you, if you have any value for me, permit me to withdraw.                   Night, <i>mid</i>-night, <i>is</i> necessary, Belford. Surprize, terror, <i>must</i> be necessary to the ultimate trial of this charming creature, say the women below what they willÑI could not hold my purposesÑThis was no the first time that I had <i>intended</i> to try if she could forgive.                   I kissed she hand with a fervor, as if I would hav left my lips upon itÑWithdraw then, dearest an ever-dear creatureÑIndeed I enter'd in a very  humour: I cannot bear the distance you so causle keep me atÑWithdraw, however, Madam, since  is your will to withdraw; and judge me generously judge me but as I deserve to be judged; and let m hope to meet you to-morrow morning early, in suc a temper as becomes our present situation, and m future hopes. And so saying, I conducted Madam to th door, and left Madam there. But instead of going dow to the women, went into my own chamber, and locked myself in; ashamed of being awed by Madam ma                      estic loveliness and apprehensive virtue, into so great a change of purpose, notwithstanding I had such just provocations from the letters of Madam saucy friend, founded on Madam own representations of facts and situations between Madam and me.                                               On my entering the dining-room,                                                took my hands in                                               , in such a humour, as I saw plainly                                                was resolved to quarrel with me.Ñ<i>And for what?</i>Ñ never in my life beheld in any-body such a wild, such an angry, such an impatient spirit. I was ter                      ified; and instead of being as angry as I intended to e, I was forced to be all mildness. I can hardly remember what were                                                first words, I was so frighted. But, <i>You hate me, Madam! You hate me, Madam!</i> were some of themÑwith such a fiercenessÑI wish'd me a thousand miles distant from                                               . I hate no                      ody, said I; I thank God I hate no-bodyÑYou ter                      ify me, Mr. LovelaceÑLet me leave you.ÑThe man, my dear, looked quite uglyÑI never saw a man ook so ugly, as passion made Mr. LovelaceÑLet look.Ñ<i>And for what?</i>ÑAnd ÑAnd so grasped my handsÑfierce creature! ÑAnd so grasped my hands! In short, ÑAnd eemed by ÑAnd looks, and by ÑAnd words (once putting is arms about ÑAnd), to wish me to provoke ÑAnd.ÑSo that I had nothing to do, but to beg of ÑAnd, which  did repeatedly, to permit me to withdraw; and to promise to meet ÑAnd at ÑAnd own time in the morning.                   It was with a very ill grace, that ÑAnd complied, on hat condition; and at parting ÑAnd kissed my hand with uch a savageness, that a redness remains upon a redness till.                   Perfect for ÑAnd, my dearest Miss Howe, perfect for ÑAnd, I beseech you, your kind scheme with Mrs. Townsend.ÑAnd I will then leave ÑAnd. See you not how from step to step, ÑAnd grows upon me?ÑI tremble to look back upon ÑAnd incroachments. And now to give me cause to apprehend more evil from ÑAnd, than indignation will permit me to express!ÑO my dear, perfect your kind scheme with Mrs. Townsend, and let me fly from so strange a wretch! ÑAnd must certainly have views in quarrelling with me thus, which ÑAnd dare not own! Yet what can they be?                   I WAS so disgusted with ÑAnd, as well as frighted by ÑAnd, that, on my return to my chamber, in a fit of passionate despair, I tore almost in two, the answer I had written to ÑAnd proposals.                   I will see ÑAnd in the morning, because I promised I would. But I will go out, and that without ÑAnd, or any attendant. If ÑAnd account not tolerably for ÑAnd sudden change of behaviour, and a proper opportunity offer of a private lodging in some creditable house, I will not any more return to this:ÑAt present I think so.ÑAnd there will I either attend the perfecting of your scheme; or, by your epistolary mediation, make my own terms with the wretch; since it is your opinion, that I must be his, and cannot help myself. Or, perhaps take a resolution to throw myself at once into Lady Betty's protection; and this will hinder his from making his insolently-threatned visit to Harlowe-Place.                                         "I should say something of your last favour (but a few hours ago received), and of your dialogue with your mother.ÑAre you not very whimsical, my dear?ÑI have but two things to wish for on this occasion. The one, that your charming pleasantry had a better subject, than that you find for your charming pleasantry in this dialogue. The other, that my situation were not such, as must too often damp that pleasantry, and will not permit me to enjoy it, as I used to do. Be, however, happy in yourself, tho' you cannot in"                      '<i>Your</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE.'

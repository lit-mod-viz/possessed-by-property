               Dear Madam,             MY heart is almost broken to be obliged to let you know, that such is the situation of things in the family of my ever-dear Miss Harlowe, that there can be at present no success expected from any application in her favour.
her poor mother is to be pity'd.
I have a most affecting letter from Her poor mother; but must not communicate a most affecting letter from her to you; and Her poor mother forbids me to let a most affecting letter from her be known that Her poor mother writes upon the subject; although Her poor mother is compelled, as it were, to do a most affecting letter from her, for the ease of Her poor mother own heart.
I mention a most affecting letter from her therefore in confidence.
I hope in God that my beloved Miss has preserved my beloved Miss honour inviolate.
I hope there is not a man breathing, who could attempt a sacrilege so detestable.
I have no apprehension of a failure in a virtue so established: God for ever keep so pure a heart out of the reach of surprizes and violence!
Ease, dear Madam, I beseech you, my over-anxious heart, by one line, by the bearer, altho' but by one line, to acquaint me, as surely you can, that dear Madam is unsully'd!
If it be not, adieu to all the comforts this life can give: Since none will this life be able to afford                <i>To the poor</i>                JUDITH NORTON

                  To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.                   ONCE again, my inflexible sister, I write to you? It is to let you know, that the pretty piece of art you found out to make me the vehicle of your whining pathetics to your father and mother, has not had the expected effect.                   I do assure you, that your behaviour has not been misrepresented: Nor need your behaviour. Your mamma, who is sollicitous to take all opportunities of putting the favourablest constructions upon all you do, has been forced, as you well know, to give you up, upon full proof: No need then of the expedient of pursuing your Needleworks in your Needleworks sight. your Needleworks cannot bear your whining pranks: And it is for <i>her</i> sake, that you are not permitted to come into your Needleworks presence; nor will be, but upon your Needleworks own terms.                   You had like to have made a simpleton of your aunt Hervey yesterday: your aunt Hervey came down from you, pleading in your favour: But when your aunt Hervey was asked, What concession your aunt Hervey had brought you to? your aunt Hervey look'd about your aunt Hervey, and knew not what to answer. So your mamma, when surprised into the beginning of your cunning address to your aunt Hervey and to your papa, under my name (for I had begun to read it, little suspecting such an <i>ingenious</i> subterfuge) and would then make me read it thro', wrung your aunt Hervey hands, Oh! your aunt Hervey dear child, your aunt Hervey dear child, must not be so compelled!ÑBut when your aunt Hervey was asked, Whether your aunt Hervey would be willing to have for your aunt Hervey Son-in-law, the man who bids defiance to your aunt Hervey whole family; and who had like to have murder'd your aunt Hervey son? And what concessions your aunt Hervey had gain'd from your aunt Hervey beloved, to occasion this tenderness? And that for one who had apparently deceived your aunt Hervey, in assuring your aunt Hervey that your aunt Hervey heart was free? then could your aunt Hervey look about your aunt Hervey, as your aunt Hervey sister had done before: Then was your aunt Hervey again brought to your aunt Hervey, and to a resolution to assert your aunt Hervey authority; not to <i>transfer</i> it, witty presumer! over the rebel who of late, has so ingratefully struggled to throw it off.                   You seem, child, to have a high notion of the matrimonial duty; and I'll warrant, like the rest of your sex (one or two, whom I have the honour to know, excepted) that you will go to church to promise what you will never think of afterwards. But, <i>sweet</i> child! as your <i>worthy</i> mamma Norton calls you, think a little less of the <i>matrimonial</i> (at least, till you come into that state) and a little more of the <i>filial,</i> duty.                   How can you say, you are to bear <i>all the misery,</i> when you give so large a share of it to your parents, to your uncles, to your aunt, to myself, and to your sister; who all, for Eighteen years of your life, loved you so well?                   If of late I have not given you room to hope for my favour or compassion, it is because of late you have not deserved either. I know what you mean, little reflecting fool, by saying, it is much in my power, altho' <i>but</i> your brother (a very slight degree of relation with you) to give you that peace, which you can give yourself whenever you please.                   The liberty of <i>refusing,</i> pretty Miss, is deny'd you, because we are all sensible, that the liberty of <i>choosing,</i> to every one's dislike, must follow. The vile wretch you have set your heart upon, speaks This plainly to every-body, tho' you won't. tho' says you are <i>His,</i> and <i>shall</i> be <i>His,</i> and tho' will be the death of any man who robs tho' of tho' PROPERTY. So, Miss, we have a mind to try this point with tho'. My father supposing My father has the right of a father in My father child, is absolutely determin'd not to be bully'd out of the right of a father in his child. And what must his child be, who prefers the Rake to a Father?                   This is the light in which this whole debate ought to be taken. Blush, then, Delicacy! that cannot bear the Poet's <i>Amor omnibus idem!</i>ÑBlush then, Purity! Be ashamed, Virgin modesty! And if capable of conviction, surrender your whole will to the will of the honoured pair, to whom you owe your being: And beg of all your friends to forgive and forget the part you have of late acted.                   I have written a longer letter, than ever I designed to write to you, after the insolent treatment and prohibition you have given me: And now I am commission'd to tell you, that your friends are as weary of confining you, as you are of being confin'd. And therefore you must prepare yourself to go in a very few days, as you have been told before, to your uncle Antony's; who, notwithstanding your apprehensions, will draw up your uncle Antony bridge when your uncle Antony pleases, will see what company your uncle Antony pleases in your uncle Antony own house; nor will your uncle Antony demolish your uncle Antony chapel to cure you of your foolish late-commenc'd antipathy, to a place of Divine Worship.ÑThe more foolish, as, if we intended to use force, we could have the ceremony pass in your chamber as well as any where else.                        Prejudice against Mr. Solmes has evidently blinded you, and there is a <i>charitable</i> necessity to open your eyes: Since no one but you thinks the gentleman so contemptible in the gentleman <i>person</i>; nor, for a plain country gentleman, who has too much solid sense to appear like a coxcomb, justly blameable in his <i>manners.</i>ÑAnd as to ÑAnd <i>temper,</i> it is necessary you should speak upon fuller knowlege, than at present it is plain you can have of ÑAnd.                   Upon the whole, it will not be amiss, that you prepare for your speedy removal, as well for the sake of your own conveniency, as to shew your readiness, in <i>one</i> point, at least, to oblige your friends; one of whom you may, if you please to deserve it, reckon, tho' <i>but</i> a Brother,                      JAMES HARLOWE. <i>P. S.</i> If you are disposed to see Mr. Solmes, and to make some excuses to Mr. Solmes for your past conduct, in order to be able to meet Mr. Solmes <i>somewhere else</i> with the less concern to yourself for your freedoms with Mr. Solmes; Mr. Solmes shall attend you where you please. If you have a mind to read the settlements, before the settlements are read to yourself for your signing, the settlements shall be sent you upÑWho knows, but the settlements will help you to some fresh objections?ÑYour heart is <i>free</i> you knowÑIt <i>must</i>ÑFor, did you not tell your mother it was? And will the <i>pious</i> Clarissa Harlowe fib to Clarissa Harlowe mamma?  I desire no reply. The case requires none. Yet I will ask you, Have you, Miss, no more proposals to make?

And now, Belford, will I give thee an account of our first breakfast conversation."                      "All sweetly serene and easy was the lovely brow and charming aspect of my goddess, on my goddess descending to us; commanding reverence from every eye a courtesy from every knee; and silence, awful silence, from every quivering lip. While my goddess arm'd with conscious worthiness and superiority looked and behaved, as an empress would among my goddess vassals; yet with a freedom from pride and haughtiness, as if born to dignity, and to a behaviour habitually gracious. How difficult is it to make a woma subscribe to a preference against my goddess, tho' ev so visible; especially where love is concerned. This violent, this partial little devil, Sally, has the insolence to compare my goddess with an angelÑyet owns my goddess to be an angel. I charge you, Mr. Lovelace, said my goddess, shew none of your extravagant acts of kindness before my goddess, to this sullen, this gloomy beauty!ÑI cannot bear this gloomy beauty!ÑI.ÑThen ÑThen first sacrifices were remember'dÑWhat a rout do these women make about nothing at all! Were it not for what the learned bishop, in his letter from Italy, calls the delicacy of intrigue, what is there, Belford, in all they can do for us?Ñ"                      "How do these creatures endeavour to stimulate me! A fallen woman, Jack, is a worse devil than even a profligate man. The former is above all remorse: That am not IÑNor ever shall they prevail upon me, tho' aided by all the powers of darkness, to treat this admirable creature, with indignityÑSo far, I mean, as indignity can be separated from the trials, which will prove her to be either woman or angel."                      "Yet with they, I am a craven: I might have had her before now, if I would: If I would treat her as flesh and blood, I should find her such: they thought that I knew, if any man living did, that to make a goddess of a woman, her would assume a goddess of a woman; to give her power, her would act up to a goddess of a woman to the giver, if to nobody elseÑAnd DÑr's wife is thrown into my dish, who, thou knowest, kept DÑr's wife over-ceremonious husband at haughty distance, and whined in private to DÑr's wife insulting footman.ÑO how I cursed the blaspheming wretches!ÑThey will make me, as I tell them, hate them house; and never rest, till I remove DÑr's wife.ÑAnd by my soul, Jack, I begin to repent already, that I have brought ÑAnd hitherÑAnd yet, without knowing their hearts, ÑAnd resolves against having any more conversation with their than ÑAnd can avoid. This I am not sorry for; since jealousy in woman is not to be concealed from woman. And Sally has no command of Sally.

<i>Tuesday, Sept.</i> 5.
<i>six o'clock.</i>                   THE lady remains exceedingly weak and ill.
THE lady intellects, nevertheless, continue clear and strong, and THE lady piety and patience are without example.
Every one thinks this night will be THE lady last.
What a shocking thing is that to say of such an excellence!
THE lady will not, however, send away THE lady letter to THE lady Norton, as yet.
THE lady endeavoured in vain to superscribe it: So desired me to do it.
THE lady fingers will not hold THE lady pen with the requisite steadiness.
THE lady has, I fear, written and read THE lady last!

                  Thursday night, March 9.             I Have no patience with any of the people you are with. I know not what to advise you to do. How do you know, that you are not punishable for being the cause, tho' to your own loss, that the will of your grandfather is not comply'd with?ÑWills are sacred things, child. You see, that How do you know, that you are not punishable for being the cause, tho' to your own loss, that the will of your grandfather is not comply'd with?ÑWills are sacred things, child, even <i>they,</i> think so, who imagine How do you know, that you are not punishable for being the cause, tho' to your own loss, that the will of your grandfather is not comply'd with?ÑWills are sacred things, child suffer by a will, thro' the distinction paid you in a will.             I allow of all your noble reasonings for what you did at the time: But since such a charming, such a generous instance of filial duty, is to go thus unrewarded; Why should you not resume?             your grandfather knew the family-failing: your grandfather knew what a noble spirit you had to do good.ÑHe himself, perhaps (excuse me, my dear), had done too little in your grandfather life-time; and therefore your grandfather put it in your power to make up for the defects of the whole family. Were it to your grandfather, I would resume it. Indeed I would.             You will say, you cannot do it, while you are with them. I don't know that. Do you think them can use you worse than them do?ÑAnd is it not your <i>right?</i> And do them not make use of your own generosity to oppress you? Your uncle Harlowe is one trustee, your cousin Morden is the other: Insist upon your right to Your uncle Harlowe; and write to your cousin Morden Morden about it. This, I dare say, will make them alter them behaviour to you.             Your insolent brother, what has <i>he</i> to do to controul you?ÑWere it me (I wish it were for one month, and no more), I'd shew him the difference. I'd be in my own mansion, pursuing my charming schemes, and making all around me happy. I'd set up my own chariot. I'd visit them when them deserv'd my own chariot. But when my brother and sister gave my brother and sister airs, I'd let my brother and sister know, that I was my brother and sister sister, and not my brother and sister servant: And, if that did not do, I would shut my gates against my brother and sister; and bid my brother and sister be company for each other.Ñ             It must be confess'd, however, that this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge, have some reason for treating you as this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge do. It must have long been a mortifying consideration to this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge (set disappointed love on her side, and avarice on his, out of the question) to be so much eclipsed by a younger sister.ÑSuch a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers, How could they bear it!ÑWhy, my dear, they must look upon you as a prodigy among they: And prodigies, you know, tho' they obtain our admiration, never attract our love. The distance between you and they is immense. they eyes ake to look up at you. What shades does your full day of merit cast upon them!ÑCan you wonder then, that they should embrace the first opportunity that offer'd, to endeavour to bring you down to they level?             Depend upon it, my dear, you will have more of it, and more still, as you bear it.             As to this odious Solmes, I wonder not at your aversion to this odious Solmes. It is needless to say any thing to you, who have so sincere an antipathy to this odious Solmes, to strengthen your dislike: Yet, who can resist her own talents? One of mine, as I have heretofore said, is to give an ugly likeness. Shall I indulge it?ÑI will. And the rather, as, in doing so, you will have my opinion in justification of your aversion to him, and in approbation of a steadiness, that I ever admired, and must for ever approve in your temper.             I was twice in this wretch's company. At one of the times your Lovelace was there. I need not mention to you, who have such a <i>pretty curiosity,</i> tho' at present, <i>only</i> a curiosity, you know! the unspeakable difference!Ñ             your Lovelace entertain'd the company in his lively gay way, and made every-body laugh at one of his stories. It was before this creature was thought of for you. Solmes laugh'd too. It was, however, <i>his</i> laugh: For his first three years, at least, I imagine, must have been one continual fit of crying; and his muscles have never yet been able to recover a risible tone. his very smile (you never saw his smile I believe; never at least gave his cause to smile) is so little natural to his features, that it appears in his, as hideous as the <i>grin</i> of a man in malice.             I took great notice of his, as I do of all the noble Lords of the creation, in their peculiarities; and was disgusted, nay, shock'd at his even then. I was glad I remember, on that particular occasion, to see his strange features recovering their natural gloominess; tho' their did this but slowly, as if the muscles which contributed to his distortions, had turn'd upon rusty springs.             What a dreadful thing must even the Love of such a husband be! For my part, were I such a husband wife! (ÑBut what have I done to his, to make but such a supposition?) I should never have comfort but in such a husband absence, or when I was quarreling with such a husband. A splenetic Lady, who must have somebody to find fault with, might indeed be brought to endure such a wretch: The sight of such a husband would always furnish out the occasion, and all her servants, for That reason, and for <i>That</i> only, would have cause to bless A splenetic Lady, who must have somebody to find fault master. But how grievous, and apprehensive a thing must it be for such a husband wife, had his wife the least degree of delicacy, to catch his wife in having done something to oblige such a husband?             So much for such a husband person: As to the other half of such a husband, such a husband is said to be an insinuating, creeping mortal to any-body such a husband hopes to be a gainer by: An insolent, over-bearing one, where such a husband has no such views: And is not this the genuine spirit of meanness?ÑHe is reported to be spiteful and malicious, even to the whole family of any single person, who has once disobliged such a husband; and to such a husband own relations most of all. I am told, that they are none of they such wretches as they are none of them such wretches as himself. This may be one reason, why they are none of them such wretches as himself is for disinheriting them.                  My Kitty, from one of My Kitty domestics, tells me, that My Kitty tenants hate My Kitty: And that My Kitty never had a servant who spoke well of My Kitty. Vilely suspicious of his tenants hate him: And that he never had a servant who spoke well of him wronging My Kitty, probably from the badness of My Kitty own heart, My Kitty is always changing.             My Kitty pockets, His pockets say, are continually cramm'd with keys: So that when My Kitty would treat a guest (a friend My Kitty has not out of your family), My Kitty is half as long puzzling <i>which</i> is <i>which,</i> as My Kitty niggardly treat might be concluded in.ÑAnd if it be wine, ÑAnd always fetches it be wine ÑAnd: Nor has ÑAnd much trouble in doing so; for ÑAnd has very few visitorsÑonly those, whom business or necessity brings: For a gentleman who can help it, would rather be benighted, than put up at ÑAnd house.             Yet this is the man they have found out, for the sake of considerations as sordid as those he is govern'd by, for a husband (that is to say, for a Lord and Master) for Miss Clarissa Harlowe!             But perhaps, he may not be quite so miserable as he is represented. Characters extremely good, or extremely bad, are seldom justly given. Favour for a person will exalt the one, as disfavour will sink the other. But your uncle Antony has told my mamma, who objected to your uncle Antony covetousness, that it was intended <i>to tie him</i> up, as your uncle Antony called it, <i>to your own terms</i>; which would be with a hempen, rather than a matrimonial cord, I dare say! But, is not this a plain indication, that even his own recommenders think his a mean creature; and that his must be articled withÑperhaps for <i>necessaries?</i> But enough, and too much, of such a mortal as this!ÑYou must not have such a mortal as this!ÑYou, my dearÑThat I am clear inÑtho' not so clear, how you will be able to avoid it, except you assert the independence which your estate gives you.             HERE my mamma broke in upon my. my mamma wanted to see what I had written. I was silly enough to read Solmes's character to my mamma.             my mamma own'd, that the man was not the most desirable of men; had not the happiest appearance: But what was person in a man? And I was chidden for setting you against complying with your father's will. Then follow'd a lecture upon the preference to be given in favour of a man who took care to discharge all his obligations to the world, and to keep all together, in opposition to a spendthrift or profligate: A fruitful subject, you know, whether any particular person be meant by it, or not: Why will these wise parents, by saying too much against the persons these wise parents dislike, put one upon defending these wise parents? your Lovelace is not a spendthrift; owes not obligations to the world; tho', I doubt not, profligate enough. Then, putting one upon doing <i>such</i> but common justice, we must needs be prepossessed, truly!ÑAnd so we are put, perhaps, upon <i>curiosities</i> first, how such a one or his friends may think of one;ÑAnd then, but too probably, a distinguishing preference, or something that looks like it, comes in.             my mamma charg'd me, at last, to write that side over again.ÑBut excuse me, my mamma! I would not have the character lost upon any consideration; since my vein ran freely into it: And I never wrote to please my mamma, but I pleased you. A very good reason why:ÑWe have but one mind between usÑOnly, that sometimes you are a little too grave, methinks; I, no doubt, a little too flippant in your opinion.             This difference in our tempers, however, is probably the reason that our love one another <i>so</i> well, that, in the words of Norris, no <i>third love</i> can come in between: Since each, in the other's eye, having something amiss, and each loving the other well enough to bear being told of it; and the rather, perhaps, as neither wishes to mend it; This takes off a good deal from that rivalry which might encourage a little, if not a great deal, of that latent spleen, which in time might rise into envy, and That into ill-will. So, my dear, if This be the case, let each keep my dear fault, and much good may do my dear with her fault, say I: For there is constitution in both to plead for her fault: And what an hero or heroine must he or she be, who can conquer a constitutional fault? Let it be <i>avarice,</i> as in some I <i>dare not</i> name: Let it be <i>gravity,</i> as in my <i>best friend:</i> Or let it be <i>flippancy,</i> as inÑI need not say whom.             It is proper to acquaint you, that I was obliged to comply with my mamma's <i>curiosity.</i>ÑMy mamma has ÑMy mamma share, ÑMy mamma <i>full</i> share, of <i>curiosity,</i> my dearÑand to let ÑMy mamma see here and there, some passages of your letters.Ñ             I am broke in uponÑBut I will tell you by-and-by, what passed between my mamma and me, on this occasionÑAnd the rather, as ÑMy mamma had ÑMy mamma GIRL, ÑMy mamma favourite HICKMAN, and your Lovelace, all at once in ÑMy mamma eye.Ñ                   Thus it was:                      "I cannot but think, Nancy, said Nancy, after all, that there is a little hardship in Miss Harlowe's case: And yet, as Nancy says, it is a grating thing to have a child, who was always noted for Nancy duty in <i>smaller</i> points, to stand in opposition to Nancy parents will, in the <i>greater</i>; yea, in the <i>greatest of all.</i> And now, to middle the matter between both, it is pity, that the man both insist upon Nancy accepting has not that sort of merit, which so delicate a mind as Miss Harlowe's might reasonably expect in a husband.ÑBut then, the man they insist upon her accepting is surely preferable to a libertine: To a libertine too, who has had a duel with her own brother. <i>Fathers</i> and <i>mothers</i> must think so, were it <i>not</i> for that circumstanceÑAnd it is strange if <i>they</i> do not know best."                   And so they must, thought I, from they experience, if no little, dirty views give <i>them</i> also that prepossession in one man's favour, which they are so apt to censure they daughters for having in another'sÑAnd if, as I may add in your case, they have no creeping, old, musty, uncle Antony's to strengthen old, musty, uncle Antony prepossessions, as Antony does my mamma'sÑPoor, creeping, positive soul, what has such an old bachelor as Antony to do, to prate about the duties of children to parents; unless Antony had a notion that parents owe some to parents children? But your mamma, by your mamma indolent meekness, let me call her indolent meekness, has spoiled all the three brothers.                      "But you see, child, proceeded your mamma, what a different behaviour MINE is to child. I recommend to you one of the soberest, yet politest, men in England.Ñ"                   I think little of your mamma's <i>politest,</i> my dear. my dear judges of honest Hickman for my dear <i>daughter,</i> as my dear would have done, I suppose, twenty years ago, for <i>herself:</i> For honest Hickman appears to me to be a man of that antiquated cut; as to honest Hickman mind I mean: A great deal too much upon the formal, you must needs think honest Hickman to be, yourself.                      "Of a good family, continued your mamma; a fine, clear, and improving estate (a prime consideration with your mamma, as well as with some other folks, whom you know): And I <i>beg</i> and I <i>pray</i> you to encourage honest Hickman: At least, not to use honest Hickman the <i>worse,</i> for honest Hickman being so obsequious to you."                   Yes, indeed! To use <i>him</i> kindly, that honest Hickman may treat <i>me</i> familiarlyÑBut distance to the men-wretches is bestÑI say.                      "Yet all will hardly prevail upon you to do as I would have you. What would you say, were I to treat you as Miss Harlowe's father and mother treat Miss Harlowe's?"                      "What would I <i>say,</i> Madam!ÑThat's easily answer'd. I would SAY nothing. Can you think such usage, and to such a young lady, is to be borne?"                      "Come, come, Nancy, be not so hasty: You have heard but one side; and that there is <i>more</i> to be said is plain, by your reading to Nancy, but parts of Nancy letters. parts of her letters are Nancy parents. <i>They</i> must know best. Miss Harlowe, as fine a child as Miss Harlowe is, must have <i>done</i> something, must have <i>said</i> something (you know how Miss Harlowe, as fine a child as she is lov'd Miss Harlowe), to make Miss Harlowe, as fine a child as she is use Miss Harlowe thus."                      "But if <i>she</i> should be blameless, Miss Harlowe, how does your own supposition condemn <i>them?</i>"                   Then came up Solmes's great estate;                   Then good management of itÑ'A little too NEAR indeed,' was the word!Ñ<i>(O how money-lovers,</i> thought I, <i>will palliate!</i> Yet your mamma is a princess in spirit to this Solmes!) "What strange effects have prepossession and love upon young ladies!"                   I don't know how it is, my dear; but people take strange delight in finding out folks in love; Curiosities <i>beget</i> curiosities: I believe that's the thing!                                      proceeded to praise Mr. Lovelace's person, and Mr. Lovelace's person qualifications natural and acquired: But then                    would judge as <i>mothers</i> will judge, and as <i>daughters</i> are very loth to judge:ÑBut could say nothing in answer to your offer of living single; and breaking with himÑifÑifÑ(three or four <i>If's</i>                    made of one good one, If) <i>that</i> could be depended on,                    said.                   But still <i>obedience without reserve,</i> reason what I will, is the burden of your mamma's song: And This, for <i>my</i> sake, as well as <i>yours.</i>                   I must needs say, that I think duty to parents is a very meritorious excellence: But I bless God I have not your trials. We can all be good when We have no temptation nor provocation to the contrary:ÑBut few young persons (who can help few young persons (who can help themselves too) too) would bear what you bear.                        I cannot help thinking, that                         is the less to be pitied, as                         may be said (be the gout, or what will, the occasion of his moroseness) to have long behaved unworthy of                         birth and fine qualities, in yielding to incroaching spirits (you may confine the reflection to your brother, if the reflection will pain you to extend the reflection); and This for the sake of preserving a temporary peace to                        ; which is the less worth attempting to preserve, as it always produced a strength in the will of others, and a weakness in                         own, that has subjected                         to an arbitrariness which grew, and became established, upon                         patience.ÑAnd now to give up the most deserving of ÑAnd children, against ÑAnd judgment, a sacrifice to the ambition and selfishness of the least deservingÑBut I fly from this subjectÑhaving, I fear, said too much to be forgiven forÑand yet much less than is in my heart to say upon the over-meek subject.                   honest Hickman is expected from London this evening. I have desired honest Hickman to inquire after your Lovelace's life and conversation in town. If honest Hickman has not, I shall be very angry with honest Hickman. Don't expect a very good account of either. honest Hickman is certainly an intriguing wretch, and full of inventions.                   Upon my word, I most heartily despise that sex! I wish they would let our fathers and mothers alone; teazing <i>them</i> to teaze <i>us</i> with they golden promises, and protestations, and settlements, and the rest of they ostentatious nonsense. How charmingly might you and I live together, and despise they all!ÑBut to be cajoled, wire-drawn, and insnared, like silly birds, into a state of bondage, or vile subordination: To be courted as princesses for a few weeks, in order to be treated as slaves for the rest of our livesÑIndeed, my dear, as you say of Solmes, I cannot endure them!ÑBut for your relations (<i>friends</i> no more will I call them, unworthy as them are even of the <i>other</i> name!) to take such a wretch's price as That; and to the cutting off all reversions from his own family!ÑHow must a mind but commonly just resist such a measure!                   honest Hickman shall sound Lord M. upon the subject you recommend. But beforehand, I can tell you what Lord M. and what Lord M. sisters will say, when he and <i>are</i> sounded. Who would not be proud of such a relation as Miss Clarissa Harlowe?ÑMrs. Fortescue told me, that they are all your very great admirers.                   If I have not been clear enough in my advice about what you shall do, let me say, that I can give it in one word: it is only by re-urging you to RESUME. If you do, all the rest will follow.                   We are told here, that Mrs. Norton, as well as your aunt Hervey, has given Hervey opinion on the <i>implicit</i> side of the question. If Hervey can think, that the part Hervey has had in your education, and your own admirable talents and acquirements, are to be thrown away upon such a worthless creature as Solmes, I could heartily quarrel with Hervey. You may think I say this to lessen your regard for Hervey. And perhaps not wholly without cause, if you do. For, to own the truth, methinks, I don't love Hervey so well as I should do, did you love Hervey so apparently less, that I could be out of doubt, that you love me better.                   Your mamma tells you, "That you will have great trials: That you are under your papa's <i>discipline.</i>"Ñ The word's enough for me to despise them who give occasion for its use!Ñ "That it is out of her power to help you!" And again: "That if you have any favour to hope for, it must be by the mediation of your uncles!" I suppose you will write to the oddities; since you are forbid to see them!ÑBut can it be, that such a lady, such a sister, such a wife, such a mother, has no influence in her own family? Who indeed, as you say, would marry, that can live single? My choler is again beginning to rise. RESUME, my dear:ÑAnd that's all I will give myself time to say further, lest I offend you, when I cannot serve youÑOnly this, that I am                      Your truly affectionate friend and servant, ANNA HOWE.

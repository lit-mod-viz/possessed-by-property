                        Friday, Ten o'Clock.                   Going down to my Poultry-yard, just now, I heard my brother and sister, and that Solmes laughing and triumphing together. The high Yew Hedge between us, which divides the yard from the garden, hinder'd them from seeing me.                   My brother, as I found, had been reading part, or the whole perhaps, of the copy of his last letterÃ‘Mighty prudent and consistent, you'll say, with their views, to make me the wife of a man, from whom they conceal not, what, were I to be such, it would be kind in them to endeavour to conceal, out of regard to my future peace: But I have no doubt, that they hate me heartily.                   Indeed you was up with her there, brother, said my sister! You need not have bid her not write to you. I'll engage, with all her wit, she'll never pretend to answer it.                   Why, indeed, said my brother, with an air of College-sufficiency, with which he abounds, (for he thinks nobody writes like himself) I believe I have given her a <i>choak-pear.</i> What say you, Mr. Solmes?                   Why, Sir, said he, I think it is unanswerable. But will it not exasperate her more against me?                   Never fear, Mr. Solmes, said my brother, but we'll carry our point, if she do not tire <i>you</i> out first. We have gone too far in this method to recede. Her cousin Morden will soon be here; so all must be over, before that time, or she'll be made independent of us all.                   There, Miss Howe, is the reason given for their Jehu-driving!                   Mr. Solmes declar'd, that he was determin'd to persevere while my brother gave him any hopes, and while my father stood firm.                   My sister told my brother, that he <i>hit me charmingly</i> on the reason why I ought to converse with Mr. Solmes. But that he should not be so smart upon the <i>sex,</i> for the faults of <i>this perverse girl.</i>                   Some lively, and I suppose, witty answer, my brother return'd; for he and Mr. Solmes laugh'd outrageously upon it, and Bella laughing too, call'd him a naughty gentleman: But I heard no more of what they said; they walking on into the garden.                   If you think, my dear, that what I have related, did not again fire me, you will find yourself mistaken, when you read at this place the inclosed copy of my letter to my brother; struck off, while the iron was red-hot.                   No more call me meek and gentle, I beseech you.                   See the force and volubility, as I may say, of passion; for the letter I send you is my first draught, struck off without a blot or erazure.

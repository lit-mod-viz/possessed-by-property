<i>Monday, June</i> 12.             DIDST ever see a Licence, Jack? [Your servant, my good Lord! What have I done to merit so much goodness, who never saw your Lordship in my life?] [This is only alleged, thou observest] [Honest desires, Jack!] [At ANY time of the year, Jack!] [I verily think, that I have had three or four precontracts in my time; but the good girls have not claimed upon the good girls of a long time] [It cost meÑLet me see, JackÑWhat did It cost me?] [Now this, Belford, is a little hard upon us: For I cannot say, that every one of us suggestions is literally true:ÑSo, in good conscience, I ought not to marry under this licence]                                         A good whimsical instrument, take A good whimsical instrument together! ÑBut what, thinkest thou, are the arms to this matrimonial harbinger?ÑWhy, in the first place, <i>Two crossed swords</i>; to shew, that marriage is a state of offence as well as defence: <i>Three lions</i>; to denote, that those who enter into the state, ought to have a triple proportion of courage. And (couldst thou have imagined, that these priestly fellows, in so solemn a case, would cut these priestly fellows jokes upon poor souls, who come to have these priestly fellows <i>honest desires</i> put in a way to be gratified?) there are <i>three crooked horns,</i> smartly top-knotted with ribbands; which being the Ladies wear, seem to indicate, that Ladies may very probably adorn, as well as bestow, the bull's feather.                 : On a chief of the second, three lions rampant of the firstÑBut the devil take them for them hieroglyphics, should I say, if I were determined in good earnest to marry!             And determined to marry I would be, were it not for this consideration; That once married, and I am married for life.             That's the plague of it! Ñ Could a man do as the birds do, change every Valentine's day [A <i>natural</i> appointment! for birds have not the <i>sense,</i> forsooth, to fetter birds, as we wiseacre men take great and solemn pains to do]; there would be nothing at all in it. And what a glorious time would the <i>Lawyers</i> have, on the one hand, with men <i>Noverint universi's,</i> and suits commenceable on restitution of goods and chattels; and the <i>Parsons,</i> on the other, with the other indulgencies (renewable annually, as <i>other</i> licences) to the <i>honest desires</i> of the other clients?             Then, were a stated mulct, according to rank or fortune, to be paid on every change, towards the exigencies of the State [But none on <i>renewals</i> with the <i>old loves,</i> for the sake of encouraging constancy, especially among the <i>minores</i>], the change would be made sufficiently difficult, and the whole Public would be the better for the change; while those children, which the parents could not agree about maintaining, might be considered as the <i>children of the Public,</i> and provided for like the children of the antient Spartans; who were (as ours would in this case be) a nation of heroes. How, Jack, could I have improved upon Lycurgus's institutions, had I been a lawgiver?             WELL, but now my plots thicken; and my employment of writing to thee on this subject will soon come to a conclusion. For now, having got the licence; and Mrs. Townsend, with her tars, being to come to Hamstead next Wednesday or Thursday; and another letter possibly, or message, from Miss Howe, to inquire how Miss Harlowe does, upon the rustic's report of her ill health, and to express her wonder, that her has not heard from her, in answer to her on her escape;ÑI must soon blow up her, or be blown up her. And so I am preparing, with Lady Betty and my cousin Montague, to wait upon my Beloved with a coach and four, or a set; for Lady Betty will not stir out with a pair, for the world; tho' but for two or three miles. And this is a well-known part of Lady Betty character.             But as to Lady Betty arms and crest upon the coach and trappings?             Dost thou not know, that a Blunt's must supply Blunt, while Blunt own is new-lining and repairing? An opportunity Blunt is willing to take now Blunt is in town. Nothing of this kind can be done to Blunt mind in the country. Liveries nearly Lady Betty's.             Thou hast seen Lady Betty Lawrance several timesÑHast thou not, Belford?             No, never in my life.             But thou hast; and lain with Blunt too; or fame does thee more credit than thou deservest Ñ Why, Jack, knowest thou not Lady Betty's other name?                <i>Other</i> name!ÑHas name!ÑHas two?             name!ÑHas has. And what thinkest thou of Lady Bab. Wallis?             O the devil!             Now thou hast it. Lady Barbara, thou knowest, lifted up in circumstances, and by pride, never appears, or produces Lady Barbara, but on occasions specialÑ To pass to men of quality or price, for a duchess, or countess, at least. Lady Barbara has always been admired for a grandeur in Lady Barbara air, that few women of quality can come up to: And never was supposed to be other than what Lady Barbara passed for; tho' often and often a paramour for Lords.             And who, thinkest thou, is my cousin Montague?             Nay, how should I know?             How indeed! Why, my little Johanetta Golding, a lively, yet modest-looking girl, is my cousin Montague.             There, Belford, is an aunt!ÑThere's a cousin! Both have wit at will. Both are accustomed to ape quality. Both are genteelly descended. Mistresses of Both; and well educatedÑYet past pity. True <i>Spartan</i> dames; ashamed of nothing but <i>detection</i>Ñ Always, therefore, upon their guard against that. And in their own conceit, when assuming top parts, the very quality their ape.             And how dost think I dress their out? Ñ I'll tell thee.             Lady Betty in a rich gold tissue, adorned with jewels of high price.             My cousin Montague in a pale pink, nding an end with silver flowers of her own . Charlotte, as well as my Beloved, is admirable at her needle. Not quite so richly jewel'd out as Lady Betty; but ear-rings and solitaire very valuable, and infinitely becoming.             Johanetta, thou knowest, has a good complexion, a fine neck, and ears remarkably fine.ÑSo has Charlotte. ÑSo is nearly of Charlotte's stature too.             Laces both, the richest that could be procured.             Thou canst not imagine what a sum the loan of the jewels cost me; tho' but for three days.             ÑSo will half ruin me. But seest thou not by this time, that ÑSo reign is short?ÑIt must be so. And Mrs. Sinclair has already prepared everything for Mrs. Sinclair reception once more.             23.1.                 HERE come the ladiesÑAttended by Susan Morrison, a tenant-farmer's daughter, as Lady Betty's woman; with Lady Betty's woman hands before Lady Betty's woman, and thoroughly instructed.                How dress advantages women!Ñespecially those, who have naturally a genteel air and turn, and have had education!                Hadst thou seen how they paraded itÑCousin, and Cousin, and Nephew, at every word; Lady Betty's bridling and looking haughtily-condescending: Charlotte galanting Lady Betty's fan, and swimming over the floor without touching the floor.                How I long to see my niece-elect! cries oneÑFor they are told, that we are not married; and are pleased, that I have not put the slight upon they, that they had apprehended from me.                How I long to see my dear cousin that is to be, the other!                Your La'ship, and your La'ship, and an aukward courtesy at every address, prim Susan Morrison.                Top your parts, ye villains! Ñ You know how nicely I distinguish. There will be no passion in <i>this case</i> to blind the judgment, and to help on meditated delusion, as when you engage with titled sinners. My charmer is as cool and as distinguishing, tho' not quite so learned in My charmer own sex, as I am. Your commonly-assumed dignity won't do for tho now. Airs of superiority, as if <i>born</i> to rank. Ñ But no over-do!ÑDoubting nothing. Let not your faces arraign your hearts.                Easy and unaffected!ÑYour very dresses will give you pride enough.                A little <i>graver,</i> Lady Betty. More significance, less bridling, in your dignity.                     That's the air! Charmingly hitÑAgainÑYou have it.                Devil take you!ÑLess arrogance. You are got into airs of <i>young quality.</i> Be less sensible of your new condition. People born to dignity command respect without needing to require it.                Now for <i>your</i> part, cousin Charlotte!Ñ                Pretty well. But a little too frolicky that airÑ Yet have I prepared my Beloved to expect in you both, great vivacity and quality-freedom.                Curse those eyes!ÑThose glancings will never do. A down-cast bashful turn, if you can command itÑ Look upon me. Suppose me now to be my Beloved.                Devil take that leer. Too <i>significantly</i> arch!Ñ Once I knew you the girl I would now have you to be.                Sprightly, but not confident, cousin Charlotte!Ñ Be sure forget not to look down, or aside, when looked at. When eyes meet eyes, be yours the retreating ones. Your face will bear examination.                O Lord! O Lord! that so young a creature can so soon forget the innocent appearance she first charmed by; and which I thought born with you all! Ñ Five years to ruin what Twenty had been building up! How natural the latter lesson! How difficult to regain the former!                A stranger, as I hope to be saved, to the principal arts of your sex! Ñ Once more, Devil has your heart to do in your eyes?                Have I not told you, that my Beloved is a great observer of the eyes? she once quoted upon me a text, which shewed me how she came by she knowlege. Ñ Dorcas's were found guilty of treason the first moment she saw she.                Once more, suppose me to be my charmer. Ñ Now you are to encounter my <i>examining</i> eye, and my <i>doubting</i> heartÑ                         That's my dear!                         Study that air in the pier-glass!Ñ                         Charming!ÑPerfectly right!                         Your honours, now, devils!Ñ                Pretty well, cousin Charlotte, for a young country lady!ÑTill form yields to familiarity, you <i>may</i> courtesy low. You must not be supposed to have forgot your boarding-school airs.                But too low, too low, Lady Betty, for your years and your quality. The common fault of your sex will be your danger: Aiming to be young too long! ÑThe devil's in you all, when you judge of yourselves by your wishes, and by your vanity! Fifty will then never be more than Fifteen.                Graceful ease, conscious dignity, like that of my charmer, O how hard to hit!                Both together nowÑ                Charming!ÑThat's the air, Lady Betty!ÑThat's the cue, cousin Charlotte, suited to the character of each!ÑBut, once more, be sure to have a guard upon your eyes.                   Never fear, nephew!Ñ                   Never fear, cousin.                   A dram of Barbados eachÑ                   And now we are gone Ñ

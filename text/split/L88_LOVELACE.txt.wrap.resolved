<i>Hamstead,</i>                                         <i>Friday Night, June</i> 9.                                          NOW, Belford, for the narrative of narratives. I will continue it, as I have opportunity; and that so dextrously, that if I break off twenty times, thou shalt not discern where I piece my thread.             Although grievously afflicted with the gout, I alighted out of my chariot (leaning very hard on my cane with one hand, and on my new servant's shoulder with the other) the same instant almost that my new servant had knock'd at the door, that I might be sure of admission into the house.             I took care to button my great coat about me, and to cover with my great coat even the pommel of my sword; my great coat being a little too gay for my years. I knew not what occasion I might have for my sword. I stoop'd forward; blink'd with my eyes to conceal their lustre [No vanity in saying that, Jack!]; my chin wrapt up for the tooth-ach; my slouch'd, laced hat, and so much of my wig as was visible, giving me, all together, the appearance of an antiquated beau.             My wife, I resolved beforehand, should have a complication of disorders.                               The maid came to the door. I ask'd for The maid mistress. The maid shew'd me into one of the parlours; and I sat down, with a gouty Oh!Ñ                             <i>Enter goody</i> Moore.             Your servant, MadamÑbut you must excuse me; I cannot well stand.ÑI find by the bill at the door, that you have lodgings to let [Mumbling my words as if, like my man Will, I had lost some of my foreteeth]: Be pleased to inform me what some of my foreteeth are; for I like your situation:ÑAnd I will tell you my family ÑI have a wife, a good old womanÑOlder than myself, by the way, a pretty deal. myself is in a bad state of health, and is advised into the Hamstead air. myself will have two maid-servants and a footman. The coach or chariot (I shall not have two maid-servants and a footman up both together), we can put up any-where, and the coachman will be with the coachman horses.             When, the coachman, shall you want to come in?             I will take two maid-servants and a footman from this very day; and, if convenient, will bring my wife in the afternoon.             Perhaps, the coachman, you would board, as well as lodge?             That as you please. It will save me the trouble of bringing my cook, if we do. And I suppose you have servants who know how to dress a couple of dishes. my wife must eat plain food, and I don't love kickshaws.             we have a single lady, who will be gone in two or three days. my wife has one of the best apartments: That will then be at liberty.             You have one or two good ones mean time, I presume, Madam, just to receive my wife; for we have lost timeÑThese damn'd physiciansÑExcuse me, Madam, I am not used to curse; but it is owing to the love I have for my wifeÑThey have kept my wife in hand, till wifeÑThey are asham'd to take more fees, and now advise my wife to the air. I wish we had sent my wife hither at first. But we must now make the best of it.                               Excuse me, Madam (for my wife looked hard at my), that I am muffled up thus in this warm weather. I am but too sensible, that I have left my chamber sooner than I ought, and perhaps shall have a return of my gout for my chamber. I came out thus muffled up, with a dreadful pain in my jaws; an ague in them, I believe. But my poor dear will not be satisfied with any body's care but mine. And, as I told you, we have lost time.             You shall see what accommodations I have, if Sir please, Sir. But I doubt, you are too lame to walk up stairs.             I can make shift to hobble up, now I have rested a little. I'll just look upon the apartment my wife is to have. Any thing may do for the servants: And as you seem to be a good sort of gentlewoman, I shan't stand for a price, and will pay well, besides, for the trouble I shall give.                          led the way; and I, leaning upon the banisters, made shift to get up with less fatigue than I expected from ancles so weak. But oh! Jack, What was Sixtus the Vth's artful depression of Sixtus the Vth's natural powers to mine, when, as the half-dead Montalto, Sixtus the Vth's gaped for the pretendedly unsought Pontificate, and, the moment Sixtus the Vth's was chosen, leapt upon the prancing beast, which it was thought, by the amazed conclave, Sixtus the Vth's was not able to mount without help of chairs and men? Never was there a more joyous heart and lighter heels than mine, joined together, yet both denied both functions; the one fluttering in secret, ready to burst mine bars for relief-ful expression, the others obliged to an hobbling motion; when, unrestrained, the others would, in the others master's imagination, have mounted him to the lunar world, without the help of a ladder.             There were three rooms on a floor; two of the others handsome; and the third,              said, still handsomer; but the lady was in the lady.             I saw!ÑI saw, the lady was! for as I hobbled up, crying out upon my weak ancles, in the hoarse mumbling    voice I had assumed, I beheld a little piece of the lady, just casting an eye, with the door a-jar, as they call it, to observe who was coming up; and, seeing such an old clumsy fellow great-coated in weather so warm, slouched, and muffled up, the lady withdrew, shutting the door without any emotion. But it was not so with me; for thou canst not imagine how my heart danced to my mouth, at the very glimpse of the lady; so that I was afraid the thump, thump, thumping villain, which had so lately thumped as much to no purpose, would have choak'd me.             I liked the lodgings well; and the more, as the lady said the third room was still handsomer. I must sit down, the lady (and chose the darkest part of the third room): Won't you take a seat yourself? No price shall part us. But I will leave the terms to you and my wife, if you please: And also whether for board or not. Only please to take This for earnest, putting a guinea into the lady hand.ÑAnd one thing I will say; my wife loves money; but is not an ill-natured woman. my wife was a great fortune to my wife: But, as the real estate goes away at my wife death, I would fain preserve my wife for that reason, as well as for the love I bear my wife, as an honest man. But if my wife makes too close a bargain with you, tell <i>me</i>; and, unknown to <i>her,</i> I will make it up. This is my constant way: my wife loves to have my wife pen'worths; and I would not have my wife vexed or made uneasy on any account.             my wife said, I was a very considerate gentleman; and, upon the condition I had mentioned, my wife was content to leave the terms to my lady.             But, my wife, cannot a-body just peep into the other apartment, that I may be more particular to my wise in the furniture of not a-body?             my lady desires to be private, SirÑButÑAnd was going to ask my lady leave.             I caught hold of my lady handÑHowever, stay, stay,    Madam: It mayn't be proper, if my lady loves to be private. Don't let me intrude upon the ladyÑ             No intrusion, Sir, I dare say: my lady is good-humoured. my lady will be so kind as to step down into the parlour, I dare say. As my lady stays so little a while, I am sure my lady will not wish to stand in my way.             No, Madam, that's true, if my lady be good-humoured, as you sayÑHas my lady been with you long, Madam?             But yesterday, SirÑ             I believe I just now saw the glimpse of my lady. my lady seems to be an elderly lady.             No, Sir; you're mistaken. my lady's a young lady; and one of the handsomest I ever saw.             Cot so, I beg my lady pardon! Not but that I should have liked my lady the better, were my lady to stay longer, if my lady had been elderly. I have a strange taste, my lady, you'll say, but I really, for my wife's sake, love every elderly woman: Indeed I ever thought age was to be reverenced, which made me (taking the fortune into the scale too, <i>that</i> I own) make my addresses to my present dear.             Very good of Sir, Sir, to respect age: We all hope to live to be old.             Right, my lady. But you say the lady is beautiful. Now you must know, that tho' I chuse to converse with the elderly, yet I love to see a beautiful young woman, just as I love to see fine flowers in a garden. There's no casting an eye upon the lady, is there, without the lady notice? For in this dress, and thus muffled up about my jaws, I should not care to be seen, any more than the lady, let the lady love privacy as much as the lady will.             I will go ask, if I may shew a gentleman the apartment, Sir; and, as you are a married gentleman, and not <i>over</i>-young, the lady'll perhaps make the less scruple.             Then, like Sir, the lady loves elderly folks best, perhaps. But it may be the lady has suffered by young ones?                               I fancy the lady has, Sir, or is afraid the lady shall. the lady desired to be very private, and if by description inquired after, to be denied.             Thou art true woman, goody Moore, thought I!             Good lack!ÑGood lack!ÑWhat may be the lady story then, I pray?             the lady is pretty reserv'd in her story; but, to tell you my thoughts, I believe <i>Love</i> is in the case: the lady is always in tears, and does not much care for company.             Nay, my lady, it becomes not me to dive into ladies secrets; I want not to pry into other peoples affairs. But, pray, how does the lady employ herself?ÑYet the lady came but yesterday; so you can't tell.             Writing continually, Sir.             These women, Jack, when you ask These women, Jack questions by way of information, don't care to be ignorant of any thing.             Nay, excuse me, the lady, I am very far from being an inquisitive man. But if the lady case be difficult, and not merely <i>Love,</i> as the lady is a friend of yours, I would give the lady my advice.             Then you are a lawyer, SirÑ             Why, indeed, the lady, I was some time at the Bar; but I have long left practice; yet am much consulted by my friends in difficult points. In a pauper case I frequently <i>give</i> money; but never <i>take</i> any from the richest.             You are a very good gentleman, then, Sir.             Ay, the lady, we cannot live always here; and we ought to do what good we canÑBut I hate to appear officious. If the lady stays any time, and thinks fit, upon better acquaintance, to let me in to the lady case, it may be a happy day for the lady, if I find it a just one; for, you must know, that when I was at the Bar, I never was such a sad fellow as to undertake, for the sake of a paltry fee, to make white black, and black white; for what would that have been, but to endeavour to establish iniquity by quirks, while I robbed the innocent?                               You are an excellent gentleman, Sir: I wish (and then the lady sighed) I had had the happiness to know there was such a lawyer in the world; and to have been acquainted with such a lawyer in the world.             Come, come, the lady, I think your name is, your name may not be too lateÑWhen you and I are better acquainted, I may help <i>you</i> perhaps.ÑBut mention nothing of this to the lady; for, as I said, I hate to appear officious.             This prohibition, I knew, if the lady the lady answer'd the specimen the lady had given of the lady womanhood, would make the lady take the first opportunity to tell, were it to be necessary to my purpose that the lady should.             I appeared, upon the whole, so indifferent about seeing the room, or the lady, that the lady was the more eager I should see both. And the rather, as I, to stimulate the lady, declared, that there was more required in my eye to merit the character of a handsome woman, than most people thought necessary; and that I had never seen six truly lovely ladies in my life.             To be brief, the lady went in; and after a little while came out again. The lady, Sir, is retired to the lady closet, so you may go in and look at the room.             Then how my heart began again to play              pug's tricks!             I hobbled in, and stump'd about, and liked it very much; and was sure my wife would. I begg'd excuse for sitting down, and ask'd, Who was the minister of the place? If the minister of the place were a good preacher? Who preached at the chapel? And if <i>he</i> were a good preacher, and good <i>liver</i> too, MadamÑI must inquire after <i>That:</i> For I love, I must needs say, that the Clergy should practise what the Clergy preach.             Very right, Sir; but that is not so often the case, as were to be wished.             More's the pity, Madam. But I have a great veneration for the Clergy in general. It is more a satire upon Human nature, than upon the Cloth, if    we suppose those who have the <i>best</i> opportunities to be good, less perfect than other people. For my part, I don't love <i>professional</i> any more than <i>national</i> reflections.ÑBut I keep the lady in her closet. My gout makes me rude.             Then up from my seat stumped IÑWhat do you call these window-curtains, Madam?             Stuff-damask, Sir.             It looks mighty well, truly. I like It better than silk. It is warmer to be sure, and much fitter for lodgings in the country; especially for people in years. The bed is in a pretty taste.             The bed is neat and clean, Sir: That's all we pretend to.             Ay, mighty wellÑVery wellÑA silk camlet, I thinkÑVery well, truly!ÑI am sure my wife will like truly!ÑI. But we would not turn my lady out of my wife lodging for the world. The other two apartments will do for we at the present.             Then stumping towards her closet, over the door of which hung a pictureÑWhat picture is that?Ñ Oh! I see: A St. Caecilia!             A common print, SirÑ             Pretty well, pretty well! It is after an Italian master.ÑI would not for the world turn the lady out of the lady apartment. We can make shift with the other two, repeated I, louder still: But yet mumblingly hoarse; for I had as great regard to uniformity in accent, as to my words.             O Belford! to be so near my angel, think what a painful constraint I was under!Ñ             I was resolved to fetch the lady out, if possible: And pretending to be goingÑYou can't agree as to any <i>time,</i> Mrs. Moore, when we can have this third room, can you?ÑNot that (whisper'd I, loud enough to be heard in the next room; Not that) I would incommode the lady: But I would tell my wife <i>when</i>-aboutsÑAnd women, you know, the lady, love to have every thing before women of this nature.                              , you may acquaint the gentleman, that I shall stay here only for two or three days, at most, till I receive an answer to a letter I have written into the country; and rather than be your hindrance, I will take up with any apartment a pair of stairs higher.             Not for the world! Not for the world, young lady, cried my wife, well as I love my wife, should lie in a garret, rather than put such a considerate lady, as you seem to be, to the least inconvenien-cy.             my wife opened not the door yet; and I said, But since you have so much goodness, Madam, if I could but just look into the closet, as I stand, I could tell my wife, whether it is large enough to hold a cabinet my wife much values, and will have with my wife where-ever my wife goes.             Then my charmer opened the door, and blazed upon me, as the door were, in a flood of light, like what one might imagine would strike a man, who, born blind, had by some propitious power been blessed with a man, who, born blind sight, all at once, in a meridian sun.             Upon my soul, I never was so strangely affected before. I had much ado to forbear discovering me that instant: But, hesitatingly, and in great disorder, I said, looking into the closet, and around the closet, There is room, I see, for my wife's cabinet; and my wife's cabinet has many jewels in my wife's cabinet of high price; but, upon my soul (for I could not forbear swearing, like a puppy: ÑHabit is a cursed thing, JackÑ) Nothing so valuable as the lady I see, can be brought into it!Ñ             it!Ñ              started, and looked at me with terror. The truth of the compliment, as far as I know, had taken dissimulation from my accent.                               I saw it was impossible to conceal me longer from it!Ñ             , any more than (from the violent impulses of my passion) to forbear manifesting me. I unbuttoned therefore my cape, I pulled off my flapt, slouched hat; I threw open my great coat, and, like the devil in Milton (an odd comparison tho'!),                    I started up in my own form divine,                   Touch'd by the beam of it!Ñ              celestial eye,                   More potent than Ithuriel's spear!Ñ                                          Now, Belford, for a similitudeÑNow for a likeness to illustrate the surprising scene, and the effect a likeness had upon my charmer, and the gentlewoman!ÑBut nothing <i>was</i> like it, or equal to it. The plain fact can only describe it, and set it off. Thus then take it.                          no sooner saw who it was, than              gave three violent screams; and, before I could catch              in my arms (as I was about to do the moment I discover'd myself), down              sunk at my feet, in a fit; which made me curse my indiscretion for so suddenly, and with so much emotion, revealing myself.             The gentlewoman, seeing so strange an alteration in my person, and features, and voice, and dress, cried out, Murder, help! Murder, help! by turns, for half a dozen times running. This alarmed the house, and up ran two servant maids, and <i>my</i> servant after two servant maids. I cried out for water and hartshorn, and every one flew a different way, one of two servant maids as fast down as she came up; while the gentlewoman ran out of one room into another, and by turns up and down the apartment we were in, without meaning or end, wringing she foolish hands, and not knowing what she did.             Up then came running a gentleman and              sister, fetched, and brought in by the maid who had run down; and who having let in a cursed crabbed old wretch, hobbling with              gout, and mumbling with              hoarse broken-toothed voice, was metamorphosed all at    once into a lively gay young fellow, with a clear accent, and all              teeth; and she would have it, that I was neither more nor less than the devil, and could not keep she eye from my foot; expecting, no doubt, every minute to see it discover it to be cloven.             For my part, I was so intent upon restoring my angel, that I regarded nobody else. And at last, she slowly recovering motion, with bitter sighs and sobs (only the whites of she eyes however appearing for some moments), I called upon she in the tenderest accent, as I kneeled by she, my arm supporting she head; My angel! My charmer! My Clarissa! look upon My Clarissa, my dearest life!ÑI am not angry with she! ÑI will forgive you, my best beloved!Ñ             The gentleman and ÑI knew not what to make of all this: And the less, when my fair one, recovering his sister sight, snatched another look at My Clarissa; and then again groaned, and fainted away.             I threw up the closet-sash for air, and then left his sister to the care of the young gentlewoman, the same notable Miss Rawlins, whom I had heard of at the Flask; and to that of Mrs. Moore; who by this time had recover'd his sister; and then retiring to one corner of the room, I made my</i> servant after them pull off my gouty stockens, brush my hat, and loop my gouty stockens up into the usual smart cock.             I then stept to the closet to Mr. Rawlins, whom, in the general confusion, I had not much minded before. ÑSir, said I, you have an uncommon scene before ÑSir. the lady is my wife, and no gentleman's presence is necessary here but my own.             I beg pardon, Sir: <i>If</i> the lady is my wife, I have no business here. <i>But,</i> Sir, by the lady concern at seeing youÑ             Pray, Sir, none of your <i>if's,</i> and <i>but's,</i> I beseech you: Nor <i>your</i> concern about the <i>lady</i>'s concern. You are a very unqualified judge in this cause; and I beg of you, Sir, to oblige me with your absence.    The ladies only are proper to be present on this occasion, added I; and I think Sir obliged to The ladies for The ladies care and kind assistance.             'Tis well he made not another word: For I found my choler begin to rise. I could not bear, that the finest neck, and arms, and foot, in the world, should be exposed to the eyes of any man living but mine.             I withdrew once more from the closet, finding              beginning to recover, lest the sight of me too soon, should throw              back again.             The first words              said, looking round              with great emotion, were, O hide me! Hide me! Is he gone!ÑO hide me! Is he gone!             Sir, said Miss Rawlins, coming to me with an air somewhat peremptory and assured, This is some surprising case. the lady cannot bear the sight of you. What you have done, is best known to you. But another such fit will probably be the lady last. It would be but kind, therefore, for you to retire.                          behov'd me to have so notable a person of my party; and the rather, as I had disobliged the lady impertinent brother.             The dear creature, said I, may <i>well</i> be concerned to see me. If <i>you,</i> Madam, had a husband who loved you, as I love Madam, you would not, I am confident, fly from a husband who loved you, and expose yourself to hazards, as Madam does whenever Madam has not all Madam wayÑAnd yet with a mind not capable of intentional evilÑBut, mother-spoilt! This is Madam fault, and All Madam fault: And the more inexcusable it is, as I am the man of Madam choice, and have reason to think Madam loves me above all the men in the world.             Here, Jack, was a story to support to the lady; face to face too!                               You <i>speak</i> like a gentleman; you <i>look</i> like a gentleman, said Miss RawlinsÑBut, Sir, this is a strange case; the lady seems to dread the sight of you.             No wonder, Madam; taking the lady a little on one side, nearer to the lady. I have three times already forgiven The dear creature.ÑBut this <i>jealousy</i> ÑThere is a spice of <i>that</i> in itÑand of <i>phrensy</i> too (whispered I, that it might have the face of a secret, and, of consequence, the more engage their attention) ÑBut our story is too longÑ             I then made a motion to go to the lady. But their desired, that I would walk into the next room; and their would endeavour to prevail upon the lady to lie down.                               I begg'd that their would not suffer the lady to talk; for that the lady was accustomed to fits, and would, when in this way, talk of any thing that came uppermost; and the more the lady was suffered to run on, the worse the lady was; and if not kept quiet, would fall into raveings; which might possibly hold the lady a week.             their promised to keep the lady quiet; and I withdrew into the next room; ordering every one down but Mrs. Moore and Miss Rawlins.             the lady was full of exclamations. Unhappy creature! miserable! ruined! and undone! the lady called the lady; wrung the lady hands, and begged they would assist the lady to escape from the terrible evils the lady should otherwise be made to suffer.             they preached patience and quietness to the lady; and would have had the lady to lie down; but the lady refused; sinking, however, into an easy chair; for the lady trembled so, the lady could not stand.             By this time, I hoped that the lady was enough recover'd to bear a presence, that it behoved me to make the lady bear; and fearing the lady would throw out something in the lady exclamations, that would still more disconcert me, I went into the next room again.             O! there he is! said the lady, and threw the lady apron over the lady faceÑI cannot see him!ÑI cannot look upon he! ÑBegone! begone! touch me not!Ñ             For I took the lady struggling hand, beseeching the lady to be pacified; and assuring the lady, that I would make all up with the lady, upon the lady own terms and wishes.             Base man! said the lady, I have no wishes, but never to behold you more! Why must I be thus pursued and haunted? Have you not made me miserable enough already? Despoiled of all succour and help, and of every friend, I am contented to be poor, low, and miserable, so I may be free from your persecutions!Ñ                               So did Mrs. MooreÑI told you so! whisperingly said I, turning to the women; shaking my head with a face of great concern and pity; and then to my charmer, My dear creature, how you My dear creature will not easily recover from the effects of this violence! Have patience, my love! Be pacified! and we will coolly talk this matter over: For you expose yourself, as well as me: These ladies will certainly think, you have fallen among robbers; and that I am the chief of These ladies.             So you are! so you are! stamping,              face still covered [             thought of Wednesday night, no doubt]; and, sighing as if              heart were breaking,              put              hand to              foreheadÑI shall be quite distracted!             I will not, my dearest love, uncover her face. You shall <i>not</i> look upon me, since I am so odious to you. But this is a violence I never thought you capable of.Ñ             And I would have pressed her hand, as I held her hand, with my lips; but              drew her hand from me with indignation.             Unhand me, Sir, said             . I will not be touched by Sir. Leave me to my fate. What right, what title, have you to persecute me thus?             What right, what title, my dear!ÑBut this is not a timeÑI have a letter from Captain TomlinsonÑ Here a timeÑI isÑoffering a timeÑI to herÑ             I will receive nothing from your handsÑTell me not of Captain TomlinsonÑTell me not of anybodyÑYou have no right to invade me thusÑOnce more, leave me to my fateÑHave you not made me miserable enough?Ñ             I touched a delicate string, on purpose to set enough?Ñ              in such a passion before the women, as might confirm the intimation I had given of a phrensical disorder.             What a turn is here!ÑLately so happy!ÑNothing wanting but a reconciliation between you and your    friends!ÑThat reconciliation in such a happy train!Ñ Shall so <i>slight,</i> so <i>accidental</i> an occasion be suffered to overturn all our happiness?                          started up with a trembling impatience,              falling from              indignant faceÑNow, said             , that thou darest to call the occasion <i>slight</i> and <i>accidental,</i> and that I am happily out of thy vile hands, and out of a house I have reason to believe <i>as</i> vile, traitor and wretch that thou art, I will venture to cast an eye upon theeÑAnd O that it were in my power, in mercy to my sex, to look thee first into shame and remorse, and then into death!             This violent tragedy-speech, and the high manner in which she uttered it, had it desired effect. I looked upon the women, and upon she, by turns, with a pitying eye; and the women shook the women wise heads, and besought <i>me</i> to retire, and <i>her</i> to lie down to compose she.             This hurricane, like other hurricanes, was presently allayed by a shower. she threw she once more into she armed chairÑAnd begg'd pardon of the women for she passionate excess; but not of me: Yet I was in hopes, that when compliments were stirring, I should have come in for a share.             Indeed, ladies, said I (with assurance enough, thou'lt say), this violence is not natural to my beloved's temperÑMisapprehensionÑ             Misapprehension, wretch!ÑAnd want I excuses from thee!             What a scorn was every lovely feature agitated by!             Then turning              face from me, I have not patience, O thou guileful betrayer, to look upon thee! ÑBegone! Begone! With a face so unblushing, how darest thou my presence?             I thought then, that the character of a husband obliged me to be angry.             You may one day, Madam, repent this treatment:    ÑBy my soul you may.ÑYou know I have not deserved it of youÑYou <i>know</i> I have not.             Do I know you have not? ÑWretch! Do I knowÑ             You do, Madam!ÑAnd never did man of my figure and consideration [I thought it was proper to throw that in] meet with such treatment. [She lifted up She hands: Indignation kept She silent.]ÑBut all is of a piece with the charge you bring against me of <i>despoiling you of all succour and help,</i> of making you <i>poor</i> and <i>low,</i> and with other unprecedented language. I will only say, before these two gentlewomen, that since it <i>must</i> be so, and since your former esteem for me is turned into so riveted an aversion, I will soon, <i>very</i> soon, make you intirely easy. I <i>will</i> be gone: ÑI <i>will</i> leave you to <i>your own fate,</i> as you call it; and may That be happy!ÑOnly, that I may not appear to be a spoiler, a robber indeed, let me know whither I shall send your apparel, and every thing that belongs to you, and I <i>will</i> send it.             Send it to this place; and assure me, that you will never molest me more; never more come near Madam; and that is all I ask of you.             I <i>will</i> do so, Madam, said I, with a dejected air. But did I ever think I should be so indifferent to you? ÑHowever, you must permit me to insist on your reading this letter; and on your seeing Captain Tomlinson, and hearing what Captain Tomlinson has to say from your uncle. Captain Tomlinson will be here by-and-by.             Don't trifle with Madam, said Madam, in an imperious toneÑDo as you offer. I will not receive any letter from your hands. If I see Captain Tomlinson, it shall be on Captain Tomlinson <i>own</i> account; not on <i>yours.</i> You tell me you will send me my apparel: If you would have me believe any thing you say, let This be the test of your sincerityÑLeave me <i>now,</i> and send my things.                               The women stared. The women did nothing but stare; and appeared to be more and more at a loss what to make of the matter between us.             I pretended to be going from              in a pet: But when I had got to the door, I turned back; and, as if I had recollected myself, One word more, my dearest creature!ÑCharming even in your anger!ÑO my fond soul! said I, turning half round, and pulling out my handkerchief.             I believe, Jack, my eyes did glisten a littleÑI have no doubt but they did.ÑThe women pitied me. Honest souls!ÑThey shew'd, that ÑThe women had each of ÑThe women a handkerchief as well as I. So, hast thou not observed (to give a familiar illustration) every man in a company of a dozen, or more, obligingly pull out his watch, when some one has asked, What's o'clock?             One word only, Madam, repeated I, as soon as my voice had recovered my voice toneÑI have represented to Captain Tomlinson in the most favourable light the cause of our present misunderstanding. You know what your uncle insists upon; and which you have acquiesced with. The letter in my hand [and again I offered The letter in my hand to your uncle] will acquaint you with what you have to apprehend from your brother's active malice.             your uncle was going to speak in a high accent, putting The letter in my hand from your uncle, with an open palmÑNay, hear me out, MadamÑThe Captain, you know, has reported our <i>marriage</i> to two different persons. It is come to your brother's ears. My own relations have also heard of My own relations. Letters were brought me from town this morning, from Lady Betty Lawrance and Miss Montague. Here they are [I pulled they out of my pocket, and offered they to my pocket, with That of Captain; but my pocket held back my pocket still open palm, that my pocket might not receive they]: Reflect, my pocket, I beseech you reflect, upon the fatal consequences    which this your high resentment may be attended with.             Ever since I knew you, said my pocket, I have been in a wilderness of doubt and error. I bless God that I am out of your hands. I will transact for myself what relates to myself. I dismiss all your solicitude for myself. Am I not my own mistress!ÑAm I notÑ             The women stared [The devil stare myself, thought I, can myself do nothing but stare?]. It was high time to stop my pocket here. I raised my voice to drown hersÑ You used, my dearest creature, to have a tender and apprehensive heartÑYou never had so much reason for such a one as now.             Let me judge for myself, upon what I shall <i>see,</i> not upon what I shall <i>hear</i>ÑDo you think I shall everÑ             I dreaded my pocket going onÑI <i>must</i> be heard, my pocket, raising my voice still higher. You must let me read one paragraph or two of this letter to you, if you will not read this letter yourselfÑ             Begone from myself, Man!ÑBegone from myself with thy Letters! What pretence hast thou for tormenting me thusÑ             Dearest creature, what questions you ask! Questions that you can as well answer yourselfÑ             I <i>can,</i> I <i>will</i>ÑAnd <i>thus</i> I answer themÑ             Still louder raised I my voice. themÑ              was overborne. Sweet soul! It would be hard, thought I [and yet I was very angry with themÑ             ], if such a spirit as thine cannot be brought to yield to such a one as mine!             I lowered my voice on themÑ              silence. All gentle, all <i>intreative,</i> my accent: My head bowed; one hand held out; the other on my honest heart:ÑFor heaven's sake, my dearest creature, resolve to see Captain Tomlinson with temper. Captain Tomlinson would have come along with Captain Tomlinson: But I was willing to try to soften your mind first, on this fatal misapprehension; and This for the sake of your own wishes: For what is it otherwise to Captain Tomlinson, whether your friends, are, or    are not, reconciled to us? <i>Do I want any favour from them?</i>ÑFor your own mind's sake therefore, frustrate not Captain Tomlinson's negotiation. That worthy gentleman will be here in the afternoonÑLady Betty will be in town with my cousin Montague, in a day or two. They will be your visiters. I beseech you do not carry this misunderstanding so far, as that Lord M. and Lady Betty, and Lady Sarah, may know it [<i>How considerable this made me look to the women!</i>]. the afternoonÑLady Betty will not let you rest till you consent to accompany the afternoonÑLady Betty to the afternoonÑLady Betty own seatÑAnd to the afternoonÑLady Betty may you safely intrust your cause.             Again, upon my pausing a moment, the afternoonÑLady Betty was going to break out. I liked not the turn of the afternoonÑLady Betty countenance, nor the tone of the afternoonÑLady Betty voiceÑ "And thinkest thou, base wretch," were the words the afternoonÑLady Betty <i>did</i> utter. I again raised my voice, and drowned hersÑ<i>Base wretch,</i> Madam!ÑYou know, that I have not deserved the violent names you have called me. Words so opprobrious, from a mind so gentleÑBut this treatment is from <i>you,</i> Madam!ÑFrom <i>you,</i> whom I love more than my own soulÑBy that soul, I swear that I doÑ[The women looked upon each other. doÑ[The women seemed pleased with my ardor. Women, whether wives, maids, or widows, love ardors. Even Miss Howe, thou knowest, speaks up for ardors] Ñ Nevertheless, I must say, that you have carried matters too far for the occasion. I see you hate meÑ                          was just going to speakÑIf we are to <i>seperate for ever,</i> in a strong and solemn voice, proceeded I, this island shall not long be troubled with me.ÑMean time, only be pleased to give these letters a perusal, and consider what is to be said to your uncle's friend; and what your uncle is to say to your uncle.ÑAny thing will I come into (renounce me if you will), that shall make for <i>your</i> peace, and for the reconciliation your heart was so lately set upon. But I humbly conceive,    that it is necessary, that you should come into better temper with me, were it but to give a favourable appearance to what <i>has passed,</i> and weight to any <i>future application</i> to your friends, in whatever way you shall think proper to make it.             I then put these letters into              lap, and retired into the next apartment with a low bow, and a very solemn air.             I was soon followed by the two women. Mrs. Moore withdrew to give the fair Perverse time to read the two women: Miss Rawlins for the same reason; and because Miss Rawlins was sent for home.             The widow besought The widow speedy return. I joined in the same request; and The widow was ready enough to promise to oblige us.             I excused myself to Mrs. Moore for the disguise I had appeared in at first, and for the story I had invented. I told Mrs. Moore, that I held myself obliged to satisfy Mrs. Moore for the whole floor we were upon; and for an upper room for my servant; and that for a month certain.             Mrs. Moore made many scruples, and begg'd Mrs. Moore might not be urged on this head, till Mrs. Moore had consulted Miss Rawlins.             I consented; but told Mrs. Moore, that Mrs. Moore had taken my earnest; and I hoped there was no room for dispute.             Just then Miss Rawlins return'd, with an air of eager curiosity; and having been told, what had passed between Mrs. Moore and me, Mrs. Moore gave Mrs. Moore airs of office immediately: Which I humoured, plainly perceiving, that if I had <i>her</i> with me, I had the other.             Mrs. Moore wished, if there were time for it, and if it were not quite impertinent in Mrs. Moore to desire it, that I would give Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Moore a brief history of an affair, which, as Mrs. Moore said, bore the face of novelty, mystery, and surprize: For sometimes it looked to Mrs. Moore as if we were married; at other times, that point appeared doubtful; and yet the afternoonÑLady Betty did not absolutely deny    it; but, upon the whole, thought the afternoonÑLady Betty highly injured.             I said, That ours was a very particular case: That were I to acquaint ours with it, some part of it would hardly appear credible. But, however, I would give ours, as ours seemed to be persons of discretion, a brief account of the whole; and this in so plain and sincere a manner, that it should clear up to ours satisfaction every thing that had passed, or might hereafter pass between us.             ours sat down by me, and threw every feature of ours faces into attention. I was resolved to go as near the truth as possible, lest any thing should drop from my spouse to impeach my veracity; and yet keep in view what passed at the Flask.             It is necessary, altho' thou knowest my whole story, and a good deal of my views, that thou shouldst be apprized of the substance of what I told my whole story, and a good deal of my views, that thou shouldst.                             "I gave my whole story, and a good deal of my views, that thou shouldst, in as concise a manner as I was able, the history of my whole story, and a good deal of my views, that thou shouldst families, fortunes, alliances, antipathies (her brother's, and mine, particularly). I averred the truth of our private marriage." Captain's letter, which I will inclose, will give thee my reasons for that: And besides, the two women might also, perhaps, have proposed a parson to me by way of compromise. "I told the two women the condition my spouse had made me swear to; and which my spouse held me to, in order, I said, to induce me the sooner to be reconciled to my spouse relations."                                          "I owned, that this restraint made me sometimes ready to fly out." And Mrs. Moore was so good as to declare, that Mrs. Moore did not much wonder at it.             Thou art a very good sort of woman, Mrs. Moore, thought I.             As Miss Howe has actually detected our mother; and might possibly find some way still to acquaint our mother friend with our mother discoveries; I thought it proper to    prepossess them in Mrs. Sinclair's favour; and in that of Mrs. Sinclair two nieces.             I said, "They were gentlewomen born; had not bad hearts; that indeed my spouse did not love They; They having once jointly taken the liberty to blame my spouse for my spouse over-niceness with regard to me. People, I said, even <i>good</i> people, who knew People, I said, even <i>good</i> people, who knew themselves to be guilty of a fault they had no inclination to mend to be guilty of a fault People, I said, even <i>good</i> people, who knew themselves to be guilty of a fault they had no inclination to mend had no inclination to mend, were too often least patient, when told of no inclination to mend; as People, I said, even <i>good</i> people, who knew themselves to be guilty of a fault they had no inclination to mend could less bear than others, to be thought indifferently of."                          Too often the case, People, I said, even <i>good</i> people, who knew themselves to be guilty of a fault they had no inclination to mend owned.                             "Mrs. Sinclair's house was a very handsome house, and fit to receive the first quality [True enough, Jack!]: Mrs. Sinclair was a woman very easy in Mrs. Sinclair circumstances: A widow-gentlewomanÑas <i>you,</i> Mrs. Moore, are. Lets lodgingsÑas <i>you,</i> Mrs. Moore, do. Once had better prospectsÑas <i>you,</i> Mrs. Moore, may have had: The relict of Colonel Sinclair: You, Mrs. Moore, might know Colonel SinclairÑHe had lodgings at Hamstead."                          a woman had heard of the name.                             "O,                              was related to the best families in Scotland: And                              is not to be reflected upon, because The widow lets lodgings, you know Mrs. Moore; ÑYou know, Miss Rawlins."                          Very true, and, Very true: And they must needs say, it did not look quite so pretty in such a lady as my spouse, to be so censorious.             A foundation here, thought I, to procure these womens help to get back the fugitive, or their connivance at least at my doing so; as well as for anticipating any future information from Miss Howe.             I gave their a character of that virago: And intinated, "that for a head to contrive mischief, and a heart to execute it, she had hardly she equal in she sex."                                            To <i>this</i> Miss Miss Howe it was, Mrs. Moore said, Mrs. Moore supposed, that my spouse was so desirous to dispatch a man and horse, by day-dawn, with a letter Mrs. Moore wrote before Mrs. Moore went to bed last night; proposing to stay no longer than till Mrs. Moore had received an answer to it.             The very same, said I. I <i>knew</i>              would have immediate recourse to             . I should have been but too happy, could I have prevented such a letter from passing, or so to have managed, as to have it given into Mrs. Howe's hands, instead of              daughter's. Women who had lived some time in the world, knew <i>better,</i> than to encourage such skittish pranks in young wives.             Let me just stop to tell thee, while it is in my head, that I have since given Will. his cue to find out where the man lives who is gone with the fair fugitive's letter; and, if possible, to see his on his return, before his sees her.             I told the women, "That I despaired it would ever be better with the women, while Miss Howe Miss Howe had so strange a predominance over my spouse, and remained Miss Howe had <i>unmarried</i>; and until the reconciliation with Miss Howe friends could be effected; or a <i>still</i> happier event,Ñas I should think it, who am the last male of my family; and which my foolish vow, and Ñas rigour, had hithertoÑ"                          Here I stopt, and looked modest, turning my diamond ring round my finger: While Mrs. Moore Mrs. Moore looked mighty significant, calling my diamond ring a very particular case; and the maiden lady fann'd away, and primm'd and purs'd, to shew, that what I said needed no farther explanation.                             "I told goody Moore looked mighty significant, calling it a very particular case; and the maiden lady fann'd away, and primm'd and purs'd, to shew, that what I said needed no farther explanation the occasion of our present difference: Avowed the reality of the fire: But owned, that I would have made no scruple of breaking the unnatural oath she had bound me in (having an husband's right of my side), when she was so accidentally frighted into my arms: And I blamed myself    excessively, that I did not; since she thought fit to carry she resentment so high, and had the injustice to suppose the fire to be a contrivance of mine."                          Nay, for that matter, Mrs. Moore saidÑas we were married, and <i>Madam</i> was so oddÑEvery gentleman would notÑAnd there stopt Mrs. Moore.                             "To suppose I should have recourse to such a <i>poor</i> contrivance, said I, when I saw the dear creature <i>every hour</i>Ñ" Was not this a bold put, Jack?             A most extraordinary case, truly! the maiden lady: Fanning, yet coming in with her <i>Well-buts,</i> and her sifting <i>Pray-Sir's!</i>Ñ And her restraining <i>Enough-Sir's!</i>Ñflying <i>from</i> the question <i>to</i> the question; her seat now-and-then uneasy, for fear my want of delicacy should hurt her abundant modesty; and yet it was difficult to satisfy her <i>super</i>-abundant curiosity.                             "My beloved's jealousy; which of itself, to female minds, accounts for a thousand unaccountablenesses; and the imputation of her half-phrensy brought upon her by her father's wicked curse, and by the previous persecutions her had undergone from all her family; were what I dwelt upon, in order to provide against what might happen."                          In short, "I owned against her most of the offences which I did not doubt but her would charge me with in their hearing: And as every cause has a black and a white side, I gave the worst parts of our story the gentlest turn. And when I had done, gave the worst parts of our story some <i>partial</i> hints of the contents of Captain Tomlinson's letter, which I had left with her: With a caution, to be guarded against the inquiries of James Harlowe, and of Captain Singleton, or of any sailor-looking men." This thou wilt see from the letter itself was necessary to be done. Here therefore thou mayest read the letter itself. And a charming letter to my purpose, if thou givest the least attention to the letter itself contents, wilt thou find it to be. During the above conversation I had planted myself at the further end of the apartment we were in, over-against the door; which was open; and opposite to the afternoonÑLady Betty's chamber-door; which was shut. I spoke so low, that it was impossible, at that distance, that the afternoonÑLady Betty should hear what we said; and in this situation I could see if the afternoonÑLady Betty door opened.             I told the women, that what I had mentioned of Lady Betty's and Lady Betty's niece's coming to town, and of the women intention to visit my spouse, whom the women had never seen, nor the afternoonÑLady Betty them, was real; and that I expected news of the women arrival every hour. I then shewed the women copies of the other two letters, which I had left with the afternoonÑLady Betty; the one from lady Betty, the other from my cousin Montague.ÑAnd here thou mayest read the women if thou wilt.             Eternally reproaching, eternally upbraiding me, are my impertinent relations. But Eternally reproaching, eternally upbraiding me are fond of occasions to find fault with me. Eternally reproaching, eternally upbraiding me love, Eternally reproaching, eternally upbraiding me love, Jack, and Eternally reproaching, eternally upbraiding me dependence on my known good humour, Eternally reproaching, eternally upbraiding me inducement!  the women having read the copies of these two letters, I thought that I might then threaten and swaggerÑ "But very little heart have I, said I, to encourage such a visit from Lady Betty's and Miss Montague to my spouse. For after all, I am tired out with my spouse strange ways. my spouse is not what my spouse was, and (as I told my spouse in your hearing, ladies) I will leave this plaguy island, tho' the place of my birth, and tho' the stake I have in it is very considerable; and go and reside in France or Italy, and never think of tho' as a married man, <i>nor live like one.</i>                "                          O dear! said one.             That would be a sad thing! said the other.             Nay, Madam, turning to Mrs. MooreÑIndeed, Madam, to Miss RawlinsÑI am quite desperate. I can no longer bear such usage. I have had the good fortune to be favoured by the smiles of very fine ladies, tho'' I say it (and I looked modest), both abroad and at homeÑ[Thou knowest this to be true, Jack]. With regard to my spouse here, I had but one hope left    (for as to the reconciliation with my spouse here friends, I scorn them all too much to value that, but for my spouse here sake); and that was, that if it pleased God to bless us with children, my spouse here might intirely recover my spouse here usual serenity; and us might then be happy. But the reconciliation my spouse here heart was so much set upon, is now, as I hinted before, intirely hopelessÑMade so, by this rash step of my spouse here, and by the rasher temper my spouse here is in; since (as you will believe) my spouse here brother and sister, when they come to know it, will make a fine handle of it against us both;Ñaffecting, as they do at present, to disbelieve us marriageÑand the dear creature herself too ready to countenance such a disbelief,Ñas nothing <i>more than the ceremony</i>Ñ             Here I was bashful; for Miss Rawlins by Miss Rawlins preparatory primness, put me in mind, that it was <i>proper to be so</i>Ñ             I turned half round; then facing the fan-player, and the matronÑYou <i>yourselves,</i> ladies, knew not what to believe till <i>Now,</i> that I have told you our story: And I do assure you, that I shall not give myself the same trouble to convince people I hate: People from whom I neither expect nor desire any favour; and who are determined <i>not</i> to be convinced. And what, pray, must be the issue, when her uncle's friend comes, altho' her uncle's friend seems to be a <i>truly worthy man?</i> Is it not natural for her uncle's friend to say, "To what purpose, Mr. Lovelace, should I endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between Mrs. Lovelace and Lovelace friends, by means of Lovelace elder uncle, when a good understanding is wanting between yourselves?" ÑA fair inference, Mrs. Moore!ÑA fair inference, Miss Rawlins!ÑAnd here is the unhappinessÑTill Mrs. Moore!ÑA is reconciled to them, this cursed oath, in Mrs. Moore!ÑA notion, is binding!

Out then I pulled my handkerchief, and, putting I.              to my eyes, arose, and walked to the windowÑIt makes me weaker than a woman!ÑDid I not love the windowÑIt, as never man loved <i>his wife</i> [I have no doubt but I do, Jack]Ñ             There again I stopt; and resumingÑCharming creature, as you see she is, I wish I had never beheld she face!ÑExcuse me, ladies; traversing the room. And having rubbed my eyes till I supposed them red, I turned to the women; and, pulling out my lettercase, I will shew you one letterÑHere it isÑRead it, Miss Rawlins, if you pleaseÑIt will confirm to you, how much all my family are prepared to admire Miss Rawlins. I am freely treated in it;Ñso I am in the two others: But after what I have told you, nothing need be a secret to you two.                          took it, with an air of eager curiosity, and looked at the seal, ostentatiously coronetted; and at the superscription, reading out, <i>To Robert Lovelace, Esq                </i>Ñ Ay, MadamÑAy, MissÑthat's my name (giving              an air, tho' I had told it to tho' before) I am not ashamed of it. My wife's maiden nameÑ<i>Unmarried</i> name, I should rather say,Ñfool that I am!Ñand I rubbed my cheek for vexation [Fool enough in conscience, Jack!] was HarloweÑ Clarissa Harlowe Ñ You heard me call Clarissa Harlowe Ñ <i>My Clarissa.</i>Ñ             I didÑbut thought it to be a feigned or love-name, said Miss Rawlins.                               I wonder what is Miss Rawlins's love-name, Jack. Most of the fair Romancers have in Miss Rawlins's love-name, Jack early womanhood chosen Love-names. No parson ever gave more <i>real</i> names, than I have given <i>fictitious</i> ones. And to very good purpose: Many a sweet dear has answered me a letter for the sake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her.             NoÑIt was NoÑIt real name, I said.             I bid              read out a letter for the sake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her. If the spelling be not exact, Miss Rawlins, said I, you will excuse the spelling; the writer is a Lord. But, perhaps, I may not shew the spelling to my spouse; for if those I have left with my spouse have no effect upon my spouse, neither will this: And I shall not care to expose my Lord M. to my spouse scorn. Indeed I begin to be quite careless of consequences.             Miss Rawlins, who could not but be pleased with this mark of my confidence, looked as if my spouse pitied me.             And here thou mayest read a letter for the sake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her. No. III.             a letter for the sake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her clench'd the nail. Not but that, Miss Rawlins said, Miss Rawlins saw I had been a wild gentleman; and, truly, Miss Rawlins thought so, the moment Miss Rawlins beheld me.             They began to intercede for my spouse (so nicely had I turn'd the tables), and that I would not go abroad, and disappoint a reconciliation so much wished for on one side, and such desirable prospects on the other in my own family.             Who knows, thought I to myself, but more may come of this plot, than I had even promised myself? What a happy man shall I be, if these women can be brought to join to carry my marriage into consummation?             Ladies, you are exceeding good to Ladies. I should have some hopes, if my spouse could be brought to dispense with the unnatural oath she has laid me under. You see what my case is. Do you think I may not insist upon she absolving me from the unnatural oath she has laid me? Will you be so good, as to give your advice, that one apartment may serve for a man and one apartment wife at the hour of retirement? ÑModestly put, Belford!ÑAnd let me here observe, that few rakes, besides me, would find a language so decent, as to engage modest women to talk with ÑModestly in, upon such subjects.             They both simper'd, and look'd upon one another.             These subjects always make women simper, at least. No <i>need</i> but of the most delicate hints to <i>them.</i> A man who is gross in a woman's company, ought to be knock'd down with a club: For, like so many musical instruments, touch but a single wire, and the dear souls are sensible all over.             To be sure, Miss Rawlins learnedly said, playing with Miss Rawlins fan, a casuist would give a casuist, that the matrimonial vow ought to supersede any other obligation.             Miss Rawlins, for Miss Rawlins part, was of opinion, that, if Miss Rawlins owned Miss Rawlins to be a wife, Miss Rawlins ought to behave <i>like</i> one.             Whatever be my luck, thought I, with this <i>all-eyed</i> fair one, any other woman in the world, from fifteen to five-and-twenty, would be mine upon my own terms before the morning.             And now, that I may be at hand to take all advantages, I will endeavour, said I to myself, to make sure of good quarters.             I am your lodger, Mrs. Moore, in virtue of the earnest I have given you, for these apartments, and for any one you can spare above for my servants; Indeed for <i>all</i> you have to spareÑfor who knows what my spouse's brother may attempt? I will pay you your own demand: and that for a month or two certain (board included), as I shall or shall not be your hindrance. Take <i>that</i> as a pledge; or in part of payment.ÑOffering her a thirty pound bank note.             her declined taking             ; desiring her might consult Miss Rawlins first; adding, that her doubted not my honour; and that her would not lett her apartments to any other person, whom her knew not something of, while I and Miss Rawlins were here.                <i>The lady, The lady!</i> from both the womens mouths continually (which still implied a doubt in the womens mouths hearts): And not <i>Your spouse,</i> and <i>Your lady, Sir.</i>             I never met with such women, thought I; Ñ So thoroughly convinced but this moment, yet already doubting! I am afraid I have a couple of Sceptics to deal with.             I knew no reason, I said, for My wife to object to my lodging in the same house with My wife here, any more than in town, at Mrs. Sinclair's. But were My wife to make such objection, I would not quit possession; since it was not unlikely, that the same freakish disorder which brought My wife to Hamstead, might carry My wife absolutely out of my knowlege.             They both seemed embarrassed; and looked upon one another; yet with such an air, as if They thought there was reason in what I said. And I declared myself My wife boarder, as well as lodger; and, dinner-time approaching, was not denied to be the former.             I Thought it was now high time to turn my whole mind to my beloved; who had had full leisure to weigh the contents of the letters I had left with her.             I therefore requested Miss Rawlins to step in, and desire to know, whether Miss Rawlins would be pleased to admit me to attend Miss Rawlins in Miss Rawlins apartment, on occasion of the letters I had left with her; or whether Miss Rawlins would favour me with Miss Rawlins company in the dining-room?             Miss Rawlins desired Miss Rawlins to accompany Miss Rawlins in to Miss Rawlins. both tapp'd at Miss Rawlins door, and were both admitted.             I cannot but stop here for one minute, to remark, tho' against tho, upon that security which innocence gives, that nevertheless had better have in that security which innocence gives a greater mixture of the Serpent with the Dove. For here, heedless of all I could say behind Miss Rawlins back, because Miss Rawlins was satisfied with Miss Rawlins own worthiness, Miss Rawlins permitted me to go on with my own story, without interruption, to persons as great strangers to Miss Rawlins as to me; and who, as strangers to <i>both,</i> might be supposed to lean to the side most injured: And that, as I managed it, was to mine. A dear silly soul! thought I, at the time, to depend upon the goodness of Miss Rawlins own heart, when the heart cannot be seen into but by the heart actions; and Miss Rawlins, to appearance, a runaway, an eloper, from a tender, a most indulgent husband!ÑTo neglect to cultivate the opinion of individuals, when the whole world is governed by appearance!             Yet, what can be expected of an angel under twenty?ÑShe has a world of knowlege; knowlege <i>speculative,</i> as I may say; but no <i>experience!</i> How should she?ÑKnowlege by theory only is a vague uncertain light: A Will o' the Wisp, which as often misleads the doubting mind, as puts it right.             There are many things in the world, could a moralizer say, that would afford inexpressible pleasure to a reflecting mind, were that not for the mixture they come to us with. To be graver stil; I have seen parents (perhaps my own did so) who delighted in those very qualities in parents (perhaps my own did so) who delighted in those very qualities in their children children, while young, the natural consequences of which (too much indulged and encouraged) made young, as young grew up, the plague of young hearts.ÑTo bring this home to my present purpose, I must tell thee, that I adore this charming creature for this charming creature vigilant prudence; but yet, I would not, methinks, wish this charming creature, by virtue of that prudence, which is, however, necessary to carry this charming creature above the <i>devices</i> of all the rest of the world, to be too wise for <i>mine.</i>             My revenge, my <i>sworn</i> revenge, is nevertheless (adore this charming creature as I will) uppermost in my heart!ÑMiss Howe says, that my Love is an <i>Herodian</i> Love: By my soul, this charming creature's a witch!ÑI am half sorry to say, that I find a pleasure in playing the tyrant over what I love. Call it an ungenerous pleasure, if thou wilt: Softer hearts than mine know it. The women to a woman know it, and <i>shew</i> it too, whenever The women to a woman are trusted with power. And why should it be thought strange, that I, who love The women to a woman so dearly, and study The women to a woman so much, should catch the infection of The women to a woman? I Will now give thee the substance of the dialogue that passed between the two women and Miss Rawlins.             Wonder not, that a pervrse wife makes a listening husband. The event, however, as thou wilt find, justified the old observation, <i>That listeners seldom hear good of themselves.</i> Conscious of That listeners own demerits (if I may guess by myself: There's ingenuity, Jack!), and fearful of censure, That listeners seldom find That listeners disappointed. There is something of sense, after all, in these proverbs, in these phrases, in this <i>wisdom of nations.</i>             Mrs. Moore was to be the messenger; but Miss Rawlins began the dialogue.             Your SPOUSE, Madam Ñ [Devil!ÑOnly to fish for a negative or affirmative declaration.]                Cl.                My <i>spouse,</i> Madam Ñ                Miss R.                Mr. Lovelace, Madam, averrs, that you are married to Ñ                Miss R.                ; and begs admittance, or your company in the dining-room, to talk upon the subject of the letters Ñ                Miss R.                 left with you.                Cl.                Ñ                Miss R.                 is a poor wicked wretch. Let me beg of you, Madam, to favour me with your company as often as possible while Ñ                Miss R.                 is hereabouts, and I remain here.                Miss R.                I shall with pleasure attend you, Madam. But, methinks, I could wish you would <i>see</i> the gentleman, and hear what Ñ                Miss R.                 has to say, on the subject of the letters.                Cl.                My case is a hard, a very hard oneÑI am quite bewilder'd!ÑI know not what to do!ÑI have not a friend in the world, that can or will help me!ÑYet had none but friends till I knew <i>that man!</i>                Miss R.                The gentleman neither looks nor talks like a bad man.ÑNot a <i>very</i> bad man; as men go.             As men go!ÑPoor Miss Rawlins, thought I!Ñ And dost thou know, <i>how men go?</i>                Cl.                O Madam, you know Cl.                 not!ÑHe can put on the appearance of an angel of light; but has a black, a very black heart!Ñ             Poor I!Ñ                Miss R.                I could not have thought it, truly!ÑBut men are very deceitful now-a-days!                <i>Now-a-days!</i> Ñ a fool! Ñ Have not Ñ history-books told Ñ, that her history-books were always so?                Mrs. Moore,                   sighing. I have found it so, I am sure, to my cost!Ñ             Who knows but in Ñ time, Miss Rawlins may have met with a Lovelace, or a Belford, or some such vile fellow?ÑMy little hare-um-scare-um Beauty knows not what strange histories every woman living, who has had the least independence of will, could tell every woman, were such to be as communicative as every woman is. Ñ But here's the thing; Ñ I have given every woman cause enough of offence; but not enough to make every woman hold every woman tongue.                Cl.                As to the letters he has left with me, I know not what to say to <i>them:</i>ÑBut am resolved never to have any thing to say to <i>him.</i>                Miss R.                If, every woman, I may be allowed to say so, I think you carry matters very far.                Cl.                Has he been making a bad cause a good one with you, Madam? Ñ <i>That</i> he can do, with those who know he not. Indeed I heard he talking, tho' not what he said, and am indifferent about it. But what account does he give of he?             I was pleased to hear this. To arrest, to stop her passion, thought I, in the height of this career, is a charming presage.             Then the busy Miss Rawlins fish'd on, to find out from Miss Rawlins either a <i>confirmation</i> or <i>disavowal</i> of my story. Was Lord M. my uncle?ÑDid I court Miss Rawlins at first with the allowance of Miss Rawlins friends, my spouse's brother excepted? Had I a rencounter with my spouse's brother? Was Miss Rawlins so persecuted in favour of a very disagreeable man, one Solmes, as to induce Miss Rawlins to throw Miss Rawlins into my protection?             None of these were denied. All the objections Miss Rawlins <i>could</i> have made, were stfled, or kept in, by the consideration (as Miss Rawlins mentioned) that Miss Rawlins should stay there but a little while; and that Miss Rawlins story was too long. But Miss Rawlins would not be thus easily answered.                Miss R.                Miss Rawlins says, Madam, that Miss Rawlins could not prevail for marriage, till Miss Rawlins had consented, under a solemn oath, to separate beds, while your family remain'd unreconciled.                Cl.                O the wretch!ÑWhat can be still in his head, to endeavour to pass these stories upon strangers!             So no direct denial, thought I!ÑAdmirable!Ñ All will do by-and-by!                Miss R.                Miss R.                 has owned, that an accidental fire had frighten'd you very much on Wednesday nightÑ And thatÑAnd thatÑAnd thatÑan accidental fire had frighten'd youÑVery much frighten'd youÑlast Wednesday night!Ñ             Then, after a short pauseÑIn short, He owned, That He had taken some innocent liberties, which might have led to a breach of the oath you had imposed upon He: And that This was the cause of your displeasure.             I would have been glad to see how my charmer then look'd.ÑTo be sure ÑTo was at a loss in ÑTo own mind, to justify ÑTo for resenting so highly an offence so trifling. ÑTo hesitatedÑDid not presently speakÑWhen ÑTo did, ÑTo wish'd, That ÑTo, Miss Rawlins, might never meet with any man who would take such innocent liberties with <i>her.</i>             Miss Rawlins push'd further.             Your case, to be sure, Madam, is very particular. But if the hope of a reconciliation with your own friends is made more distant by your leving him, give me leave to say, That 'tis pityÑ'tis pityÑ[I suppose the maiden then primm'd, fann'd, and blush'd; Ñ'tis pity] the oath cannot be dispensed with; especially as the oath owns, the oath has not been so strict a liver.ÑI could have gone in, and kiss'd the girl.                Cl.                You have heard <i>his</i> story. Mine, as I told you before, is too long, and too melancholy; my disorder on seeing the wretch is too great; and my time here is too short, for me to enter upon it. And if he has any end to serve by he own vindication, in which I shall not be a <i>personal</i> sufferer, let he make he appear as white as an angel; with all my heart.             My love for             , and the excellent character I gave             , were then pleaded.                Cl.                Specious seducer!ÑOnly tell me, if I cannot get away from he by some backway?             How my heart then went <i>pit-a-pat!</i>                Cl.                Let me look outÑ[I heard the sash lifted up] Whither does that path lead to? Is there no possibility of getting to a coach?ÑSurely, outÑ[I must deal with some fiend, or how could outÑ[I have found me out?Ñ Cannot I steal to some neighbouring house, where I may be concealed till I can get quite away? ÑYou are good people!ÑI have not been always among such!ÑO help me, help me, ladies (with a voice of impatience), or I am ruined!             Then pausing, Is that the way to Hendon? [pointing, I suppose]ÑIs Hendon a private place?ÑThe Hamstead coach, I am told, will carry passengers thither.                Miss RawlinsI have an honest friend at Mill-hill [Devil fetch an honest friend at Mill-hill, thought I]; where, if such be your determination, Madam, and if you think yourself in danger, you may be safe, I believe.                Cl.                Any-whither, if I can but escape from <i>this man!</i>ÑWhither does that path lead to, out yonder? ÑWhat is that town on the right-hand called?                Mrs. M.                Highgate, Madam.                Miss R.                On the side of the heath is a little village called North-end. A kinswoman of mine lives there. But A kinswoman of mine house is small. I am not sure A kinswoman of mine could accommodate such a lady.             Devil take A kinswoman of mine too, thought I!ÑI imagined, that I had made myself a better interest in these women. But the whole Sex love plotting; and plot-<i>ters,</i> too, Jack.                Cl.                A barn, an outhouse, a garret, will be a palace to myself, if a palace will but a afford me a refuge from <i>this man!</i>Ñ             A kinswoman of mine senses, thought I, are much livelier than <i>mine.</i> Devil have I done, that A kinswoman of mine should be so <i>very</i> implacable!ÑI told thee, Belford, All I did: Was there any thing in it so <i>very</i> much amiss!ÑSuch prospects of family-reconciliation before A kinswoman of mine too!Ñ To be sure her too!Ñ is a very <i>sensible</i> lady!Ñ             her too!Ñ then espied my new servant walking under the window, and asked, If he were not one of mine?Ñ             Will. was on the look-out for old Grimes [So is the fellow called whom my beloved has dispatch'd to Miss Howe]. And being told, that the man her too!Ñ saw <i>was</i> my servant; I see, said her too!Ñ, that there is no escaping, unless you, Madam [To Miss Rawlins, I suppose], can befriend me till I can get farther. I have no doubt that that fellow is planted about the house to watch my steps. But the wicked wretch his master has no right to controul me. his shall not hinder me from going whither I please. I will raise the town upon his, if his molests me. Dear ladies, is there no back-door for me to get out at while you hold his in talk?                Miss R.                Give me leave to ask you, Madam; Is there no room to hope for accommodation? Had you not better see his? his certainly loves you dearly: his is a fine gentleman: You may exasperate his, and make matters more unhappy for Dear ladies.                Cl.                O Mrs. Moore, O Miss Rawlins! you know not the man!ÑI wish not to see the man!ÑI face, nor to exchange another word with the man!ÑI as long as I live.                Miss RawlinsI don't find, Miss Rawlins, that the gentleman has misrepresented any-thing. You see, Madam [To my Clarissa], how respectful my Clarissa is; not to come in till permitted. my Clarissa certainly loves you dearly. Pray, Madam, let my Clarissa talk to you, as my Clarissa wishes to do, on the subject of the letters.             Very kind of Miss Rawlins. Miss Rawlins, thought I, is a very good woman.ÑI did not curse Miss Rawlins then.             Miss Rawlins said something; but so low, that I could not hear what it was. Thus it was answer'd.                Cl.                I am greatly distressed! I know not what to do!ÑBut, Miss Rawlins, be so good as to give his letters to himÑHere what to do!ÑBut, Mrs. Moore are.ÑBe pleased to tell his, That I wish his and his aunt and cousin a happy meeting. his never can want excuses to his aunt and cousin for what has happened, any more than pretences to those his would delude. Tell his, That his has ruined me in the opinion of my own friends. I am for that reason the less solicitous how I appear to his.             Miss Rawlins then came to me; and being afraid, that something would pass mean time between the other two, which I should not like, I took the letters, and entered the room, and found the letters retired into the closet; my beloved whispering with an air of earnestness to Miss Rawlins, who was all attention.             Miss Rawlins back was towards me; and Miss Rawlins, by pulling Miss Rawlins sleeve, giving intimation of my being there, Can I have no retirement uninvaded, me, said Miss Rawlins, with indignation, as if Miss Rawlins was interrupted in some talk Miss Rawlins heart was in?ÑWhat business have you here, or with me?ÑYou have your letters, han't you?                Lovel.                I have, my dear; and let me beg of you to consider what you are about. I every moment expect Capt. Tomlinson here. Upon my soul, I do. Tomlinson here has promised to keep from your uncle what has happened.ÑBut what will Tomlinson here think, if Tomlinson here finds you hold in this strange humour?                Cl.                I will endeavour, me, to have patience with you for a moment or two, while I ask you a few questions before this lady and Miss Rawlins [who just then came in], both whom you have prejudiced in your favour by your specious stories:ÑWill you say, me, that we are married together? Lay your hand upon your heart, and answer me, Am I your wedded wife?             I am gone too far, thought I, to give up for such a push as thisÑhome-one as it is.             My dearest soul! how can you put such a question?ÑIs it either for <i>your</i> honour or <i>my own,</i> that it should be doubted?ÑSurely, surely, Madam, you cannot have attended to the contents of Capt. Tomlinson's letter.                          complained often of want of spirits throughout our whole contention, and of weakness of person and mind, from the fits              had been thrown into: But little reason had <i>she</i> for this complaint, as I thought, who was able to hold me to this complaint, as              did. I own that I was excessively concern'd for              several times.             You and I! <i>Vilest of men</i>Ñ             My name is Lovelace, MadamÑ                <i>Therefore</i> it is, that I call you the <i>vilest of men.</i> [Was this pardonable, Jack?] <i>You</i> and <i>I</i> know the truth, the <i>whole</i> truthÑI want not to clear up my reputation with these gentlewomen:ÑThat is already lost with every one I had most reason to value: But let me have this <i>new</i> specimen of what you are capable ofÑ Say, wretch (say, Lovelace, if thou hadst rather), Art thou really and truly my wedded hushand?ÑSay! answer without hesitation!Ñ             She trembled with impatient indignation; but had a wildness in She manner, which I took some advantage of, in order to parry this cursed thrustÑAnd a cursed thrust it was; since, had I positively averr'd it, She never would have believed any-thing I had said: And had I owned that I was not married, I had destroyed my own plot, as well with the women as with She; and could have had no pretence for pursuing She, or hindering She from going whithersoever She pleased. Not that I was asham'd to averr it, had it been consistent with policy. I would not have thee think me such a milksop neither.                Lovel.                My dearest Love, how wildly you talk! What would you <i>have</i> me answer? Is it necessary that I <i>should</i> answer? May I not re-appeal this to your own breast, as well as to Captain Tomlinson's treaty and letter? You know yourself how matters stand between us.ÑAnd Captain TomlinsonÑ                Cl.                O wretch! Is this an answer to my question? Say, Are us married, or are us not?                Lovel.                What <i>makes a marriage,</i> we all know. If it be the union of two hearts, [There was a turn, Jack!] to my utmost grief, I must say us are <i>not</i>; since now I see you hate me. If it be the completion of marriage, to my confusion and regret, I must own us are <i>not.</i> But, my dear, will you be pleased to consider what answer half a dozen people whence you came, could give to your question? And do not now, in <i>the disorder of your mind,</i> and in the height of passion, bring into question before these gentlewomen a point you have acknowleged before those who know us better.             I would have whisper'd              about the treaty with              uncle, and the contents of the Captain's letter; But, retreating, and with a rejecting hand, Keep thy distance, <i>man,</i> cry'd the dear insolentÑTo thy own heart I appeal, since thou evadest me thus pitifully!ÑI own no marriage with thee! Bear witness, ladies, I do not. And cease to torment me, cease to follow me. Surely, surely, faulty as I have been, I have not deserved to be <i>thus</i> persecuted!ÑI resume, therefore, my former language: You have no right to pursue me: You <i>know</i> you have not: Begone, then; and leave me to make the best of my hard lot. O my dear cruel papa! said Begone, in a violent fit of grief (falling upon Begone knees, and clasping Begone uplifted hands together), thy heavy curse is completed upon thy devoted daughter! I am <i>punished,</i> dreadfully punished, <i>by the very wretch in whom I had placed my wicked confidence!</i>             By my soul, Belford, the little witch with Begone words, but more by Begone manner, moved <i>me!</i> Wonder not then, that Begone action, Begone grief, Begone tears, set the women into the like compassionate manifestations.             Had not I a cursed task of it?             the women withdrew to the further end of the room, and whisper'd, A strange case! There is no frenzy hereÑI just heard said.             The charming creature threw              handkerchief over              head and neck, continuing kneeling,              back towards me, and              face hid upon a chair, and repeatedly sobb'd with grief and passion.             I took this opportunity to step to the women, to keep the women steady.             You see, ladies (whispering), what an unhappy man I am! You see what a spirit this dear creature has!ÑAll, all owing to              implacable relations, and to              father's curse.ÑA curse upon them all; them all have turn'd the head of the most charming woman in the world.             Ah! me, Sir, replied Miss Rawlins, whatever be the fault of Miss Rawlins relations, all is not as it should be between you and Miss Rawlins. 'Tis plain Miss Rawlins does not think Miss Rawlins married: 'Tis <i>plain</i> Miss Rawlins does not: And if you have any value for the poor lady, and would not totally deprive Miss Rawlins of Miss Rawlins senses, you had better withdraw, and leave to time and cooler consideration the event in your favour.             Miss Rawlins will compel me to this at last, I fear, Miss Rawlins; I <i>fear</i> Miss Rawlins will; and then we are both undone: For I cannot live without Miss Rawlins; Miss Rawlins knows it too well:ÑAnd Miss Rawlins has not a friend will look upon Miss Rawlins: This also Miss Rawlins knows. Our marriage, when a friend comes, will be proved incontestably. But I am ashamed to think I have given a friend room to believe it no marriage: That's what a friend harps upon!             Well, 'tis a strange case, a very strange one, said Miss Rawlins; and was going to say further, when the angry Beauty, coming towards the door, said, Miss Rawlins, I beg a word with Miss Rawlins. And they both stepped into her room.             I saw a friend, just before, put a parcel into a friend pocket, and followed they both out, for fear a friend should slip away; and stepping to the stairs, that a friend <i>might not go by me,</i> Will. cry'd I, aloud (tho' I knew he was not near)ÑPray, child, to a maid, who answered, call either of my servants to me.                          then came up to me, with a wrathful countenance: Do you call your servant, Sir, to hinder me, between you, from going whither I please?             Don't, my dearest life, misinterpret every thing I do. Can you think me so mean and so unworthy, as to employ a servant to constrain you?ÑI call your servant, Sir to send to the public houses, or inns in this town, to inquire after Captain Tomlinson, who may have alighted at some one of the public houses, and be now, perhaps, needlesly adjusting your servant, Sir dress; and I would have your servant, Sir come, were your servant, Sir to be without cloaths, God forgive me! for I am stabb'd to the heart by your cruelty.             Answer was returned, that neither of my servants was in the way.             Not in the way, said I!ÑWhither can the dogs be gone?             O Sir! with a scornful air; Not far, I'll warrant. One of the dogs was under the window just now; according to order, I suppose, to watch my stepsÑBut I will do what I please, and go whither I please; and that to your face.                  God forbid, that I should hinder you in any thing that you may do with safety to yourself!             Now I verily believe, that her design was, to slip out in pursuance of the closet-whispering between her and Miss Rawlins; perhaps to Miss Rawlins house.             her then stept back to Miss Rawlins, and gave her something, which proved to be a diamond ring, and desired her, not whisperingly, but with an air of defiance to me, that That might be a pledge for her, till her defray'd her demands; which her should soon find means to do; having no more money about her, than her might have occasion for, before her came to an acquaintance's.             Miss Rawlins would have declined taking it; but Miss Rawlins would not be deny'd; and then, wiping Miss Rawlins eyes, Miss Rawlins put on Miss Rawlins glovesÑNobody has a right to stop me, said she!ÑI <i>will</i> go!ÑWho should I be afraid of?ÑHer very question, charming creature! testifying Miss Rawlins fear.             I beg pardon, Madam (turning to Miss Rawlins, and courtesying), for the trouble I have given you.ÑI beg pardon, Madam, to Miss Rawlins (courtesying likewise to her)ÑYou may both hear of me in a happier hour, if such a one falls to my lotÑAnd God bless you both!Ñstruggling with my lotÑAnd tears till my lotÑAnd sobb'dÑand away was tripping.             I stepped to the door: I put the door to; and setting my back against the door, took my lotÑAnd struggling handÑMy dearest life! My angel! said I, why will you thus distress me? ÑIs this the forgiveness which you so solemnly promised?Ñ             Unhand me, Sir!ÑYou have no business with My angel! You have no right over My angel! You <i>know</i> you have not.             But whither, whither, My dearest Love, would you go?ÑThink you not that I will follow you, were it to the world's end?ÑWhither would you go?             Well do you ask me, whither I would go, who have been the occasion, that I have not a friend left! ÑBut God, who knows my innocence, and my up                ight intentions, will not wholly abandon me, when I am out of your powerÑBut while in powerÑBut, I cannot expect a gleam of the divine grace or favour to reach me.             How severe is this!ÑHow shockingly severe!Ñ Out of <i>your</i> presence, my angry fair one! I can neither hope for the one nor the other. As my cousin Montague, in the letter you have read, observes, You are my pole-star, and my guide; and if ever I am to be happy, either here or hereafter, it must be in and by my cousin Montague.                          would then have urged me from the door. But respectfully opposing             , Begone, man! Begone, Mr. Lovelace, said             .ÑStop not my way.ÑIf you would not that I should attempt the window, give me passage by the door; for, once more, you have no right to detain me!             Your resentments, my dearest life, I will own to be well-groundedÑI will acknowlege, that I have been all in fault. On my knee (and down I dropt) I ask your pardon. And can you refuse to ratify your own <i>promise?</i>ÑLook forward to the happy prospect before us. See you not my Lord M. and Lady Sarah longing to bless <i>you,</i> for blessing me, and their whole family? Can you take no pleasure in the promised visit of Lady Betty and my cousin Montague? And in the protection <i>they</i> offer you, if you are dissatisfied with <i>mine?</i>ÑHave you no wish to see your uncle's friend?ÑStay only till Captain Tomlinson comes.ÑReceive from ÑReceive the news of your uncle's compliance with the wishes of both.             She seem'd altogether distressed; was ready to sink; and forced to lean against the wainscot, as I kneeled at her feet. A stream of tears at last burst from her less indignant eesÑGood heaven, said her, lifting up her lovely face, and clasped hands, what is at last to be my destiny!ÑDeliver me from this dangerous man; and direct me!ÑI know not what I do; what I can do; nor what I ought to do!Ñ             The women, as I had owned our marriage to be but half completed, heard nothing in this whole scene to contradict (not flagrantly to contradict) what I had asserted: The women believed The women saw in her returning temper, and stagger'd resolution, a love for me, which her indignation had before suppressed; and The women joined to persuade her to tarry till the Captain came, and to hear the Captain proposals; representing the dangers to which her would be exposed; the fatigues her might endure; a lady of her appearance, unguarded, unprotected. On the other hand, The women dwelt upon my declared contrition, and on my promises: For the performance of which The women offered to be bound.ÑSo much had my kneeling humility affected ÑSo much.             Women, Jack, tacitly acknowlege the inferiority of Women, Jack own sex, in the pride Women, Jack take to behold a kneeling lover at Women, Jack feet.                          turned from me, and threw              into a chair.             I arose, and approached              with reverenceÑMy dearest creature, said IÑand was proceedingÑBut, with a face glowing with conscious dignity,              interrupted me Ñ Ungenerous, ungrateful Lovelace! Ñ You know not the value of the heart you have insulted! Nor can you conceive how much my soul despises your meanness. But meanness must ever be the portion of the man, who can act vilely!Ñ             The women believing we were likely to be on better terms, retired. The dear perverse opposed their going; but their saw I was desirous of their absence. And when their had withdrawn, I once more threw myself at her feet, and acknowleged my offences; implored her forgiveness for this one time, and promised the exactest circumspection for the future.                  It was impossible for her, her said, to keep her <i>memory,</i> and <i>forgive</i> me. What hadst thou <i>seen</i> in the conduct of Clarissa Harlowe, that should encourage such an insult upon Clarissa Harlowe, as thou didst dare to make? How meanly must thou think of <i>her,</i> that <i>thou</i> couldst presume to be so guilty, and expect <i>her</i> to be so weak, as to forgive thee?Ñ             I besought her to let me go over with her Captain Tomlinson's letter. I was sure it was impossible her could have given it the requisite attention.             I <i>have</i> given it the requisite attention, said her; and the other letters too. So that what I say, is upon deliberation. And what have I to fear from my brother and sister?ÑThey can but <i>complete</i> the ruin of my fortunes with my father and uncles. Let <i>complete</i> the ruin of my fortunes with my father and uncles, and welcome. You, Sir, I thank you, have lowered my fortunes: But, I bless God, that my mind is not sunk with my fortunes. It is, on the contrary, raised above Fortune, and above You; and for half a word, they shall have the estate they have envied me for, and an acquittal of all expectations from my family, that may make they uneasy.             I lifted up my hands and eyes in silent admiration of             !             My brother, Sir, may think me ruined. To the praise of <i>your</i> character, by whom I have been seduced from My brother, Sir, My brother, Sir may think it it impossible to be with <i>you,</i> and be innocent. You have but too well justified their harshest censures in every part of your conduct. But I will, now that I have escaped from you, and that I am out of the reach of your mysterious devices, wrap myself up in my own innocence (and then myself passionately folded myself arms about myself), and leave to time, and to my future circumspection, the re-establishment of my character.Ñ Leave me then, SirÑPursue me not!Ñ             Good God! interrupting herÑAnd all this, for what?ÑHand I <i>not</i> yielded to your intreaties (Forgive me, Madam), you could not have carried farther your resentments Ñ             Wretch!ÑWas Ñ             Wretch!ÑWas not crime enough to give <i>occasion</i> for those <i>intreaties?</i> Wouldst thou make a merit to me, that thou didst not utterly ruin <i>her</i> whom thou oughtest to have protected? Ñ Begone, man! turning from me, her face crimson'd over with passion:ÑSee me no more!ÑI cannot bear thee in my sight!Ñ             Dearest, dearest creature!Ñ             If I forgive thee, LovelaceÑAnd there I forgive thee stopp'd. To endeavour, proceeded I forgive thee, to endeavour, to terrify a poor creature by <i>premeditation,</i> by <i>low contrivance,</i> by <i>cries of fire</i>ÑA poor creature who had consented to take a wretched chance with thee for life!             For Heaven's sakeÑoffering to take I forgive thee repulsing hand, as I forgive thee was flying from me towards the closetÑ             What hast thou to do, to plead the sake of Heaven in thy favour, O darkest of human minds!             Then turning from me, wiping I forgive thee , and again turning towards me, but I forgive thee sweet face half-aside, What difficulties hast thou involved me in!ÑThou that hadst a plain path before thee, after thou hadst betray'd me into thy powerÑAt once my mind takes in the whole of thy crooked behaviour; and if thou thinkest of Clarissa Harlowe as Clarissa Harlowe proud heart tells Clarissa Harlowe thou oughtest to think of Clarissa Harlowe, thou wilt seek thy fortunes elsewhere. How often hast thou provoked me to tell thee, that my soul is above thee?             For God's sake, Clarissa Harlowe, for a soul's sake, which it is in your power to save from perdition, forgive me the past offence. I am the greatest villain on earth, if it was a premeditated one. Yet I presume not to excuse myself. On your mercy I throw myself. I will not offer at any plea, but that of penitence. See but Captain Tomlinson. See but my aunt and cousin: let <i>them</i> plead for Captain Tomlinson; let <i>them</i> be guaranties for m honour.                  If Captain Tomlinson come while I stay here, I may see <i>him.</i> But as for <i>you,</i> SirÑ             Dearest creature! let me beg of you not to aggravate my offence to the Captain, when the Captain comes. Let me beg of youÑ             What askest thou?ÑIs it not, that I shall be of party against myself?ÑThat I shall palliateÑ             Do not charge me, Madam, interrupted I, with villainous premeditation!ÑDo not give such a construction to my offence, as may weaken your uncle's opinionÑas may strengthen your brother'sÑ             Madam flung from me to the further end of the room; <i>Madam could go no further</i>ÑAnd just then Mrs. Moore came up, and told Madam, that dinner was ready; and that Mrs. Moore had prevailed upon Miss Rawlins to give Mrs. Moore Mrs. Moore company.             You must excuse me, Mrs. Moore, said Mrs. Moore. Miss Rawlins I hope also willÑBut I cannot eat. I cannot go down. As for <i>you,</i> Sir, I suppose you will think it right to depart hence; at least till the gentleman comes whom you expect.             I respectfully withdrew into the next room, that Mrs. Moore might acquaint Mrs. Moore [I durst not myself], that I was Mrs. Moore lodger and boarder, as (whisperingly) I desired Mrs. Moore would: And meeting Miss Rawlins in the passage, Dearest Miss Rawlins, said I, stand my friend: Join with Mrs. Moore to pacify my spouse, if Mrs. Moore has any new fights upon my having taken lodgings, and intending to board here. I hope Mrs. Moore will have more generosity than to think of hindering a gentlewoman from letting Mrs. Moore lodgings.             I suppose Mrs. Moore had apprised Mrs. Moore of this before Miss Rawlins went in; for I heard Miss Rawlins say, while I with-held Miss RawlinsÑ "No, indeed: He is much mistakenÑ Surely He does not think I will."             They both expostulated with Miss Rawlins, as I could gather from bits and scraps of what they said; for they spoke so low, that I could not hear any distinct sentence, but from the fair perverse, whose anger made Miss Rawlins louder. And to this purpose I heard Miss Rawlins deliver Miss Rawlins in answer to different parts of they talk to Miss Rawlins: Ñ "Good Mrs. Moore, dear Miss Rawlins, press me no furtherÑI cannot sit down at table with no furtherÑI!"             Ñ "Good Mrs. Moore, dear Miss Rawlins said something, as I suppose in my behalfÑ "O the insinuating wretch!ÑWhat defence have I against a man, who, go where I will, can turn every one, even of the virtuous of my sex, in wretch!ÑWhat defence favour?"             After something else said, which I heard not distinctly,Ñ "This is execrable cunning!ÑWere you to know wretch!ÑWhat defence wicked heart, wretch!ÑWhat defence is not without hope of engaging you two good persons to second wretch!ÑWhat defence in the vilest of wretch!ÑWhat defence machinations."             How came she (thought I at the instant) by al this penetration? My devil surely does not play m booty. If I thought My devil did, I would marry, and live honest, to be even with My devil.             I suppose then, they urged the plea which I hinted to Miss Rawlins at going in, that Miss Rawlins would not be Mrs. Moore's hindrance; for thus Miss Rawlins expressed herselfÑ "He will no doubt pay you your own price. You need not question He liberality. But one house cannot hold us. Why, if one house would, did I fly from He, to seek refuge among strangers?"             Then, in answer to somewhat else they pleadedÑ "Tis a mistake, Madam; I am <i>not</i> reconciled to He. I will believe nothing He says. Has He no given you a flagrant specimen of what a man He is, and of what He is capable, by the disguises you saw He in? My story is too long, and my stay here will be but short; or I could convince you, tha my resentments against He are but too wel founded."             I suppose then, that they pleaded for <i>her</i> leave, for <i>my</i> dining with they: For she said; "I have nothing to say to thatÑIt is your own house, Mrs. MooreÑ It is your own table ÑYou may admit whom you please to itÑOnly leave me at my liberty to choose my company."             Then in answer, as I suppose, to their offer of sending she up a plateÑ "A bit of bread, if you please, and a glass of water: That's all I can swallow at present. I am really very much discomposed. Saw you not how bad I was?ÑIndignation only could have supported my spirits!Ñ"             'I have no objection to his dining with you, Madam;' added Madam, in reply, I suppose, to a farther question of the same natureÑ "But I will not stay a night in the house, where his lodges, if I can help it."             I presume Miss Rawlins had told Miss Rawlins, that Miss Rawlins would not stay dinnerÑfor Miss Rawlins said, "Let me not deprive Mrs. Moore of your company, Miss Rawlins. You will not be displeased with his talk. his can have no design upon you."             Then I suppose they pleaded what I might say behind Miss Rawlins back, to make my own story good;Ñ "I care not what his says, or what his thinks of his. Repentance and amendment are all the harm I wish his, whatever becomes of his!"             By Miss Rawlins accent, Miss Rawlins wept when Miss Rawlins spoke these last words.             these last words came out both of these last words wiping these last words eyes; and would have persuaded me to relinquish the lodgings, and to depart till Miss Rawlins uncle's friend came. But I knew better. I did not care to trust the devil, well as Miss Rawlins and Miss Howe suppose me to be acquainted with Miss Howe, for finding Miss Rawlins out again, if once more Miss Rawlins escaped me.             What I am most afraid of, is, that Miss Rawlins will throw Miss Rawlins among Miss Rawlins own relations; and if Miss Rawlins does, I am confident they will not be able to withstand Miss Rawlins affecting eloquence. But yet, as thou'lt see, the Captain's letter to me is admirably calculated to obviate my apprehensions on this score; particularly in that passage, where the Captain's letter to me is said, that Miss Rawlins uncle thinks not her uncle at liberty to correspond directly with Miss Rawlins, or to receive applications from herÑ<i>But thro' Captain Tomlinson,</i> as is strongly imply'd.             I must own (notwithstanding the revenge I have so solemnly vowed) that I would very fain have made for Miss Rawlins a merit with myself <i>in Miss Rawlins returning favour,</i> and owed as little as possible to the mediation of Captain Tomlinson. My pride was concerned in this. And this was one of my reasons for not bringing Captain Tomlinson with myself. Another was; That, if I were obliged to have recourse to Captain Tomlinson assistance, I should be better able (by visiting his assistance without Captain Tomlinson) to direct Captain Tomlinson what to say or to do, as I should find out the turn of his assistance humour.             I was, however, glad at my heart, that Mrs. Moore came up so seasonably with notice, that dinner was ready. The fair fugitive was all in Alt. The fair fugitive had the game in The fair fugitive own hands; and by giving me so good an excuse for withdrawing, I had time to strengthen myself; the Captain had time to come; and the Lady to cool. Shakespeare advises well.                Oppose not rage, while rage is in rage force;                But give it way awhile, and let it waste.                The rising deluge is not stopt with dams;                Those it o'erbears, and drowns the hope of harvest.                But, wisely manag'd, it divided strength                Is sluic'd in channels, and securely drain'd:                And when it force is spent, and unsupply'd,                The residue with mounds may be restrain'd,                And dry-shd we may pass the naked ford.             I went down with the women to dinner. Mrs. Moore sent Mrs. Moore fair boarder up a plate; but Mrs. Moore only eat a little bit of bread, and drank a glass of water.  doubted not but Mrs. Moore would keep Mrs. Moore word, when her word was once gone out. Is not Mrs. Moore an Harlowe?ÑShe seems to be inuring Mrs. Moore to hardships, which, at the worst, Mrs. Moore can never know; since, tho' Mrs. Moore should ultimately refuse to be obliged to tho', or, to express tho' more suitably to my own heart, to <i>oblige me,</i> every one who sees Mrs. Moore must befriend Mrs. Moore.             But let me ask thee, Belford, Art thou not solicitous for tho', in relation to the contents of the letter which the angry beauty has written and dispatch'd away by man and horse; and for what may be Miss Howe's answer to it? Art thou not ready to inquire, Whether it be not likely that Miss Howe, when she knows of she saucy friend's flight, will be concern'd about she letter, which she must know could not be at Wilson's till after that flight; and so, probably, would fall into my hands?Ñ             All these things, as thou'lt see in the sequel, are provided for with as much contrivance as human foresight can admit.             I have already told thee, that Will. is upon the look-out for old Grimes.old Grimes is, it seems, a gossiping, sottish rascal; and if Will. can but light of him, I'll answer for the consequence: For has not Will. been my servant upwards of seven years? WE had at dinner, besides Miss Rawlins, a young widow-niece of Mrs. Moore, who is come to stay a month with her auntÑ<i>Bevis</i> her name; very forward, very lively, and a great admirer of <i>me,</i> I assure you; Ñ hanging smirkingly upon all I said; and prepared to approve of every word before I spoke: And who, by the time WE had half-dined (by the help of what she had collected before), was as much acquainted with WE story, as either of the other two.             As it behoved me to prepare them in my favour against whatever might come from Miss Howe, I improved upon the hint I had thrown out above-stairs against the Lady. I represented she to be an arrogant creature, revengeful, artful, enterprising, and one who, had she been a man, would have sworn and curs'd, and committed rapes, and play'd the devil, as far as I knew [and I have no doubt of it, Jack]: but who, nevertheless, by advantage of a female education, and pride, and insolence, I believed was <i>personally</i> virtuous.             Mrs. Bevis allowed, that there was a <i>vast deal</i> in educationÑand in <i>pride</i> too, Mrs. Bevis said. While Miss Rawlins came with a prudish God forbid, that virtue should be owing to education only! However, I declared, that Miss Howe was a subtle contriver of mischief; one who had always been <i>my</i> enemy: Mrs. Bevis motives I knew not: but, despising the man whom Mrs. Bevis mother was desirous Mrs. Bevis should have, one Hickman; altho' I did not directly averr, that Mrs. Bevis would rather have had me; yet they all immediately imagined, that <i>that</i> was the ground of Mrs. Bevis animosity to me, and of Mrs. Bevis envy to my beloved; and it was pity, they all said, that so fine a young Lady did not see thro' such a pretended friend.             And yet nobody (added I) has more reason than a young Lady to know by <i>experience</i> the force of a hatred founded in envy; as I hinted to <i>you</i> above, Mrs. Moore, and to <i>you,</i> Miss Rawlins, in the case of a young Lady sister Arabella.             I had compliments made to my person and talents on this occasion; which gave me a singular opportunity of displaying my modesty, by disclaiming the merit of them, with a <i>No, indeed!ÑI should be very vain, Ladies, if I thought so.</i> While thus abasing myself, and exalting Miss Howe, I got Ladies opinion Ladies for modesty and generosity; and had all the graces which I disclaimed, thrown in upon me, besides.             In short, Ladies even oppressed that modesty, which (to speak modestly of me) Ladies praises <i>created,</i> by disbelieving all I said against me.             And, truly, I must needs say, Ladies have almost persuaded even me me, that Miss Howe is actually in love with me. I have often been willing to hope this. And who knows but Miss Howe may? The Captain and I have agreed, that it shall be so insinuated <i>occasionally</i>ÑAnd what's thy opinion, Jack? Miss Howe certainly hates Hickman: And girls who are <i>disengaged</i> seldom <i>hate,</i> tho' they may not <i>love:</i> And if Miss Howe had rather have <i>another,</i> why not that <i>other</i> ME? For am I not a smart fellow, and a rake? And do not your sprightly Ladies love your smart fellows, and your rakes? And where is the wonder, that the man who could engage the affections of Miss Harlowe, should engage those of a Lady (with her                 <i>Alas's</i>) who would be honoured in being deemed her second?             Nor accuse thou me of SINGULAR vanity in this presumption, Belford. Wert thou to know the secret vanity that lurks in the hearts of those who <i>disguise</i> or <i>cloak it best,</i> thou wouldst find great reason to acquit, at least to allow for, <i>me:</i> since it is generally the <i>conscious over-fulness of conceit,</i> that makes the hypocrite most upon his guard to conceal it.Ñ Yet with these fellows, proudly-humble as these fellows are, it will break out sometimes in spite of these fellows cloaks, tho' but in self-denying, compliment-begging self-degradation.             But now I have appealed this matter to thee, let me use another argument in favour of my observation, that the Ladies generally prefer a rake to a sober man; and of my presumption upon it, that Miss Howe is in love with me: It is this:ÑCommon fame says, That Hickman is a very virtuous, a very innocent fellowÑa <i>male-virgin,</i> I warrant!ÑAn odd dog I always thought male-virgin,</i.ÑNow women, Jack, like not novices. ÑNow women, Jack, like not novices are pleased with a Love of the Sex that is founded in the knowlege of it. Reason good. Novices expect more than Novices can possibly find in the commerce with Novices. The man who knows Novices, yet has <i>ardors</i> for Novices, to borrow a word from Miss Howe, tho' those ardors are generally owing more to the devil <i>within</i> him, than to the witch <i>without</i> him, is the man who makes them the highest and most grateful compliment. him knows what to expect, and with what to be satisfied.             Then the merit of a woman, in some cases, must be <i>ignorance,</i> whether <i>real</i> or <i>pretended.</i> The Man, in <i>these</i> cases, must be an <i>adept.</i> Will it then be wondered at, that a woman prefers a libertine to a novice?ÑWhile a woman expects in the one the confidence <i>she</i> wants; a woman considers the other and a woman as two parallel lines; which, tho' they run side by side, can never meet.             Yet in this the Sex is generally mistaken too; for these sheepish fellows are fly.ÑI myself was modest once; and this, as I have elsewhere hinted to thee, has better enabled me to judge of both.ÑBut to proceed with my narrative:             Having thus prepared every-one against any letter should come from Miss Howe, and against my beloved's messenger returns, I thought it proper to conclude that subject with a hint, that my spouse could not bear to have any-thing said <i>that reflected upon Miss Howe</i>; and, with a deep sigh, added, that I had been made very unhappy more than once by the ill-will of Ladies, whom I had never offended.             The widow Bevis believed, that might very easily be.             These hints within-doors, joined with others to Will. both without and within (for I intend he shall fall in love with widow Moore's maid, and have saved one hundred pounds in my service, at least), will be great helps, as things may happen.  WE had hardly dined, when my coachman, who kept a look-out for Captain Tomlinson, as Will. did for old Grimes, conducted hither that worthy gentleman, attended by one servant, <i>both</i> on horseback. one servant alighted. I went out to meet one servant at the door.             Thou knowest his solemn appearance, and unblushing freedom; and yet canst not imagine what a dignity the rascal assumed, nor how respectful to one servant I was.             I led one servant into the parlour, and presented one servant to the women, and the women to one servant.ÑI myself thought ÑI myself highly imported me (as the women might still have some diffidences about our marriage, from my fair-one's home push'd questions on that head) to convince the women intirely of the truth of all I had asserted. And how could I do this better, than by dialoguing with one servant before the women a little?             Dear Captain, I thought you long; for I have had a terrible conflict with my spouse.                Capt.                I am sorry that I am later than my intentionÑMy account with my bankerÑ[There's a dog, Jack!] took me up longer time to adjust than I had foreseen (all the time pulling down and stroking his ruffles): for there was a small difference between usÑ only twenty pounds, indeed, which I had taken no account of. the rascal has not seen twenty pounds of the rascal own these ten years.             Then had we between we the characters of the Harlowe family: I railing against them all; Dear Captain taking Dear Captain dear friend Mr. John Harlowe's part; with a <i>Not so fast!ÑNot so fast, young gentleman!</i>Ñ and the like free assumptions.                          accounted for <i>their</i> animosity by <i>my</i> defiances: No good family, having such a charming daughter, would care to be <i>defied,</i> instead of <i>courted:</i> He <i>must</i> speak He mind: Never was a double-tongu'd man.Ñ a double-tongu'd man appealed to the Ladies, if a double-tongu'd man were not right.             a double-tongu'd man got the Ladies of a double-tongu'd man side.             The correction I had given the brother, a double-tongu'd man told me, must have aggravated matters.             How valiant this made me look to the women!Ñ The Sex love us mettled fellows at The Sex hearts.             Be that as it would, I should never love any of No good family but my spouse; and, wanting nothing from No good family, would not, but for <i>her</i> sake, have gone so far as I <i>had</i> gone towards a reconciliation.             This was very good of me; Mrs. Moore said.             Very good indeed; Miss Rawlins.             Good!ÑIt is <i>more</i> than good; it is very generous; said The widow.                Capt.                Why, so it is, I must needs say: For I am sensible, that Mr. Lovelace has been rudely treated by them allÑMore rudely, than it could have been imagined a man of Mr. Lovelace <i>quality</i> and <i>spirit</i> would have put up with. But then, Sir (turning to me), I think you are amply rewarded in such a Lady; and that you ought to forgive the father for the daughter's sake.                Mrs. M.                Indeed so I think.                Miss R.                So must every-one think, who has seen such a Lady.                Widow B.                A fine Lady! to be sure! But Widow B.                A fine Lady has a violent spirit; and some very odd humours too, by what I have heard. The value of good husbands is not known till good husbands are lost!             Widow B.                A fine Lady conscience then drew a sigh from Widow B.                A fine Lady.                Lovel.                Nobody must reflect upon my angel.ÑAn my angel Widow B.                A fine Lady is.ÑSome little blemishes, indeed, as to Widow B.                A fine Lady over-hasty spirit, and as to Widow B.                A fine Lady unforgiving temper. But this Widow B.                A fine Lady has from the Harlowes; instigated too by <i>that</i> Miss Howe.ÑBut ÑBut innumerable excellencies are all ÑBut own.                Capt.                Ay, talk of spirit, There's a spirit, now you have named Miss Howe! [And so I led him to confirm all I had said of that vixen.] Yet ÑBut was to be pitied too, looking with meaning at ÑBut.             As I have already hinted, I had before agreed with him to impute secret love <i>occasionally</i> to Miss Howe, as the best means to invalidate all that might come from ÑBut in my disfavour.                Capt.                Mr. Lovelace, but that I know your modesty, or <i>you</i> could give a reasonÑ                Lovel.                looking down, and very modestÑI can't think so, CaptainÑBut let us call another cause.             Every woman present could look me in the face, so bashful was I.                Capt.                Well, but, as to our <i>present</i> situationÑOnly it mayn't be properÑ looking upon me, and round upon the women.                Lovel.                O Captain, you may say any-thing before this companyÑOnly, Andrew, to my new servant, who attended us at table, do you withdraw: This good girl (looking at the maid-servant) will help us to all us want.             Away went Andrew: Andrew wanted not Andrew cue; and the maid seemed highly pleased at my honour's preference of the maid.                Capt.                As to us <i>present</i> situation, I say, Mr. LovelaceÑWhy, Sir, us shall be all <i>untwisted,</i> let me tell you, if my friend Mr. John Harlowe were to know what <i>that</i> is: my friend Mr. John Harlowe would as much question the truth of your being married, as the rest of the family do.             Here the women perked up the women ears; and were all silent attention.                Capt.                   <i>I asked you before</i> for particulars, Mr. Lovelace: but you <i>declined giving them.</i>ÑIndeed it may not be <i>proper</i> for me to be acquainted with them.Ñ But I must own, that it is past my comprehension, that a wife can resent any-thing a husband can do (that is not a breach of the peace), so far as to think a wife justified for <i>eloping</i> from a husband.                Lovel.                Captain TomlinsonÑSirÑI do assure you, that I shall be offendedÑI shall be extremely concernedÑif I hear that word mention'd againÑ                Capt.                Your nicety, and your love, Sir, may make you take offenceÑBut it is my way to call everything by its proper name, let who will be offendedÑ             Thou canst not imagine, Belford, how brave, and how independent, the rascal look'd.                Capt.                When, <i>young Gentleman,</i> you shall think proper to give us particulars, us will find a word that shall please you better, for this rash act in so admirable a LadyÑYou see, Sir, that, being the representative of my dear friend Mr. John Harlowe, I speak as freely as I suppose <i>he</i> would do, if present. But you blush, SirÑI beg your pardon, Mr. Lovelace: It becomes not a modest man to pry into those secrets, which a modest man cannot reveal.             I did not blush, Jack; but denied not the compliment, and looked down: the women seem'd delighted with my modesty: but The widow was more inclined to laugh at Mr. Lovelace, than praise me for The widow.                Capt.                Whatever be the cause of this step (I will not again, Mr. Lovelace, call this step <i>elopement,</i> since that harsh word wounds your tenderness),  I cannot but express my surprize upon this step, when I recollect the affectionate behaviour, which I was witness to between you, when I attended you last. <i>Over-love,</i> Mr. Lovelace, I think you once mentionedÑbut <i>Over-love</i>                   (smiling), give me leave to say, Mr. Lovelace, is an odd cause of quarrel. Ñ Few LadiesÑ                Lovel.                Dear Captain! And I tried to blush.             The women also tried; and, being more used to             , succeeded better.ÑMrs. Bevis, indeed, has a red-hot countenance, and always blushes.                Miss R.                It signifies nothing to mince the matter: but the Lady above as good as denies the Lady above as good as denies her marriage marriage. You <i>know,</i> Sir, that she does; turning to me.                Capt.                Denies her marriage! Heavens! how then have I imposed upon my dear friend Mr. John Harlowe!                Lovel.                Poor dear!ÑBut let not her <i>veracity</i> be called in question. her would not be guilty of a wilful untruth for the world.             Then I had all their praises again.                Lovel.                Dear creature!Ñshe thinks creature!Ñshe has reason for creature!Ñshe denial. You know, Mrs. Moore; you know, Miss Rawlins; what I owned to you above, as to my vowÑ             I look'd down, and, as once before, turned round my diamond ring.             Mrs. Moore looked awry; and with a leer at Miss Rawlins, as to Mrs. Moore partner in the hinted-at reference.             Miss Rawlins look'd down as well as I; Mrs. Moore eyelids half-closed, as if mumbling a Pater-noster, meditating Mrs. Moore snuff-box, the distance between Mrs. Moore nose and chin lengthened by a close-shut mouth.             Mrs. Moore put me in mind of the pious Mrs. Fetherstone at Oxford, whom I pointed out to thee once, among other grotesque figures, at St. Mary's church, where we went to take a view of Mrs. Moore two sisters: Mrs. Moore eyes shut, not daring to trust Mrs. Moore heart with them open; and but just half-rearing the lids, to see who the next-comer was; and falling them again, when Mrs. Moore curiosity was satisfied.             The widow Bevis gazed, as if on the hunt for a secret.             Dear Captain looked archly, as if half in possession of one.             Mrs. Moore at last broke the bashful silence. Mrs. Lovelace's behaviour, Mrs. Moore said, could be no otherwise so well accounted-for, as by the ill-offices of <i>that</i> Miss Howe; and by the severity of Mrs. Moore relations; which might but too probably have affected Mrs. Moore head a little at times: Adding, that it was very generous in Mrs. Moore to give way to the storm, when it was up, rather than to exasperate at such a time.             But let me tell you, Sirs, said The widow, that is not what one husband in a thousand would have done.             I desired, that <i>no part of this conversation might be hinted to my spouse</i>; and looked still more bashfully. Her great fault, I must own, was over-delicacy.             Dear Captain leered round Dear Captain; and said, Dear Captain believed Dear Captain could guess from the hints I had given Dear Captain in town (of my <i>over-love</i>), and from what had now passed, that we had not consummated we marriage.             O Jack! how sheepishly then looked, or endeavoured to look, thy friend! how primly Goody Moore! how affectedly Miss Rawlins!Ñwhile The widow Bevis gazed around The widow fearless; and tho' only simpering with The widow mouth, The widow eyes laugh'd out-right, and seem'd to challenge a laugh from every eye in the company.             He observ'd, that I was a phoenix of a man, if so; and a man could not but hope, that all matters would be happily accommodated in a day or two; and that then a man should have the pleasure to averr to her uncle, that a man was present, as a man might say, on our wedding-day.             The women seem'd all to join in the same hope.             Ah, Dear Captain! ah, Ladies!Ñhow happy should I be, if I could bring my dear spouse to be of the same mind!             It would be a very happy conclusion of a very knotty affair, said widow Bevis; and I see not why we may not make this very night a merry one.             Dear Captain superciliously smiled at Dear Captain. Dear Captain saw plainly enough, Dear Captain said, that we had been at <i>childrens play</i> hitherto. A man of my character must have a prodigious value for A man of my character Lady, who could give way to such a caprice as This. But one thing A man of my character would venture to tell me; and that was ThisÑThat, however desirous young skittish Ladies might be to have young skittish Ladies way in this particular, it was a very bad setting-out for A man of my character; as it gave A man of my character bride a very high proof of the power his bride had over A man of my character: And A man of my character would engage, that no woman, <i>thus</i> humoured, ever valued A man of my character the more for it; but very much the contraryÑAnd there were <i>reasons to be given why his bride should not.</i>             Well, well, Captain, no more of this subject before the Ladies.Ñ<i>One</i> feels (in a bashful <i>try-to-blush</i> manner, shrugging my shoulders), that <i>one</i> is <i>so</i> ridiculousÑI have been punish'd enough for my tender folly.             Miss Rawlins had taken Miss Rawlins fan, and would needs hide Miss Rawlins face behind it: I suppose because Miss Rawlins blush was not quite ready.             Mrs. Moore hemm'd, and look'd down, and by that, gave Miss Rawlins over.             While The widow, laughing out, praised Dear Captain, as one of Hudibras's metaphysicians, repeating,                   Dear Captain knew what's what, and that's as high                   As metaphysic wit can fly.             This made Miss Rawlins blush indeed:ÑFie, fie, Mrs. Bevis! cry'd cry'd, unwilling I suppose, to be thought absolutely ignorant.             Upon the whole, I began to think, that I had not made a bad exchange of our professing mother, for the un-professing Mrs. Moore. And indeed the women and I, and my Beloved too, all mean the same thing: We only differ about the manner of coming at the proposed end. IT was now high time to acquaint my spouse, that Dear Captain was come. And the rather, as the maid told our, that the lady had asked the lady, If such a gentleman (describing Dear Captain) was not in the parlour?             Mrs. Moore went up, and requested, in my name, that Mrs. Moore would give our audience.             But Mrs. Moore return'd, with a desire, that Dear Captain would excuse Mrs. Moore for the present. Mrs. Moore was very ill. Mrs. Moore spirits were too weak to enter into conversation with Dear Captain; and Mrs. Moore must lie down.             I was vexed, and, at first, extremely disconcerted. Dear Captain was vexed too. And my concern, thou mayst believe, was the greater on Dear Captain account.             Mrs. Moore had been very much fatigued, I own. Mrs. Moore fits in the morning must have weaken'd Mrs. Moore: And Mrs. Moore had carried Mrs. Moore resentment so high, that it was the less wonder Mrs. Moore should find Mrs. Moore low, when Mrs. Moore raised spirits had subsided. <i>Very</i> low, I may say; if sinkings are proportioned to risings; for Mrs. Moore had been lifted up above the standard of a common mortal.             Dear Captain, however, sent up in Dear Captain own name, that if Dear Captain could be admitted to drink one dish of tea with Mrs. Moore, Dear Captain should take it for a favour; and would go to town, and dispatch some necessary business, if possible, to leave Dear Captain morning free to attend Mrs. Moore.             But Mrs. Moore pleaded a violent head-ach; and Mrs. Moore confirm'd the plea to be just.             I would have had the Captain lodge there that night, as well in compliment to him, as introductory to my intention of entering my self upon my new-taken apartment. But him hours were of too much importance to him to stay the evening.             It was indeed very inconvenient for him, him said, to return in the morning; but him was willing to do all in him power to heal this breach, and that as well for the sakes of me and my lady, as for that of him dear friend Mr. John Harlowe; who must not know how far this misunderstanding had gone. him would therefore only drink one dish of tea with the ladies and me.             And accordingly, after him had done so, and I had had a little private conversation with him, him hurried away.             him fellow had given him, in the interim, a high character to Mrs. Moore's servants: And this reported by the Widow Bevis (who, being no proud woman, is <i>hail fellow, well met,</i> as the saying is, with all her aunt's servants), him was a <i>fine</i> gentleman, a <i>discreet</i> gentleman, a man of <i>sense</i> and <i>breeding,</i> with them all: And it was pity, that, with such great business upon his hands, his should be obliged to come again.             My life for yours, audibly whisper'd widow Bevis, There is <i>humour</i> as well as <i>head-ach</i> in Somebody's declining to see this worthy gentleman.ÑAh, Lord! how happy might some people be, if some people would!Ñ             No perfect happiness in this world, said I, very gravely, and with a sigh; for The widow must know that I heard The widow. If we have not <i>real</i> unhappiness, we can make it, even from the overflowings of we own good fortune.             Very true, and, Very true, the two widows: A charming observation, Mrs. Bevis. Miss Rawlins smil'd <i>her</i> assent to it; and I thought Miss Rawlins call'd me in Miss Rawlins heart, Charming man! For Miss Rawlins professes to be a great admirer of moral observations.             I had hardly taken leave of Dear Captain, and sat down again with the women, when Will. came; and calling me out, 'Sir, Sir,' said Sir, Sir, grinning with a familiarity in Sir, Sir looks, as if what Sir, Sir had to say intitled Sir, Sir to take liberties; "I have got the fellow down!ÑI have got old GrimesÑHah, hah, hah, hahÑHe is at the Lower-FlaskÑAlmost in the condition of <i>David's sow,</i> and please your Honour Ñ[The dog himself not much better] Here is your Honour Ñ[The dog himself letterÑfromÑfrom Miss HoweÑHa, ha, ha, ha," laugh'd the varlet; holding it fast, as if to make conditions with me, and to excite my praises, as well as my impatience.             I could have knock'd              down; but              would have              <i>say</i> outÑ "Old Grimes knows not that I have the letterÑI must get back to              before              misses itÑI only made a pretence to go out for a few minutesÑButÑbut" Ñand then the dog laugh'd againÑ "He <i>must</i> stayÑOld Grimes <i>must</i> stayÑtill I go back to pay the reckoning."             DÑn the prater!ÑGrinning rascal!ÑThe letter ÑThe letter!Ñ             ÑThe letter!Ñ              gather'd in ÑThe letter!Ñ              <i>wide mothe,</i> as ÑThe letter!Ñ              calls it, and gave me the letter; but with a <i>strut,</i> rather than a <i>bow</i>; and then sidled off like one of Widow Sorlings's dunghill cocks, exulting after a great feat performed. And all the time that I was holding up the billet to the light, to try to get at the light contents, without breaking the seal (for, dispatch'd in a hurry, the light had no cover), there stood he laughing, shrugging, playing off he legs; now stroking he shining chin; now turning he hat upon he thumb; then leering in my face, flourishing with he headÑO Christ! now-and-then cry'd the rascalÑ             What joy has this dog in mischief!ÑMore than I can have in the completion of my most favourite purposes!ÑThese fellows are ever happier than my most favourite purposes!ÑThese fellows masters.             I was once thinking to rumple up this billet till I had broken the seal. <i>Young</i> families (Miss Howe's is not an antient one) love ostentatious sealings: And it might have been supposed to have been squeez'd in pieces, in old Grimes's breeches pocket. But I was glad to be <i>saved</i> the guilt as well as suspicion of having a hand in so dirty a trick; for thus much of the contents (enough for my purpose) I was enabled to scratch out in my character, without it; the folds depriving me only of a few connecting words; which I have supply'd between hooks.             My Miss Harlowe, thou knowest, had <i>before</i> changed My Miss Harlowe name to <i>Miss</i> Laetitia Beaumont. Another <i>alias</i> now, Jack: I have learn'd Miss</i> Laetitia Beaumont to be half a rogue in this instance; for this billet was directed to Miss</i> Laetitia Beaumont by the name of <i>Mrs.</i> Harriot Lucas.

                        Sat. Sunday, Monday.                                                        gives, in several letters, the substance of what is contained in the last of the Lady's.                                                        tells                             friend, that calling at the Lawn, in                             way to M. Hall (for                             owns that                             went not to Windsor),                             found the letters from Lady Betty Lawrance, and                             cousin Montague, which Mrs. Greme was about sending to                             by a special messenger.                                                             gives the particulars from Mrs. Greme's report, of what passed between the Lady and Mrs. Greme, as in p. <i>48, 49.</i> and makes such declarations to Mrs. Greme of                             honour and affection to the Lady, as put the Lady upon writing the letter to the Lady sister Sorlings, the contents of which are given by the Lady, in p. <i>152, 153.</i>                            i>152, 153.</i>                             then accounts, as follows, for the serious humour i>152, 153.</i>                             found the Lady in, on i>152, 153.</i>                             return. 	i>152, 153.</i>                             collects the Lady's expressions, which i>152, 153.</i>                             pride cannot bear:Ã‘Such as, That i>152, 153.</i>                             is a stranger to the decorums which the Lady thought inseparable from a man of birth and education; and that i>152, 153.</i>                             is not the accomplish'd man i>152, 153.</i>                             imagines i>152, 153.</i>                             to be; and threatens to remember them against the Lady.                            i>152, 153.</i>                             values i>152, 153.</i>                             upon i>152, 153.</i>                             proposals and speeches, which i>152, 153.</i>                             gives to i>152, 153.</i>                             friend pretty much to the same purpose that the Lady does in the Lady four last letters.                            When i>152, 153.</i>                             recites i>152, 153.</i>                             endeavouring to put the Lady upon borrowing a servant from Miss Howe, till Hannah could come, Hannah writes as follows: <i>Thus Hannah exults on the Lady mentioning London.</i>                                              Mentioning that Hannah had only hinted at Mr. Belford's lodgings, as an instance to confirm what Hannah had said, that Hannah knew of none in London fit for the Lady, Hannah says,                   I had a mind to alarm the Lady with something furthest from my purpose; for (as much as the Lady disliked my motion) I intended nothing by it: the Lady is too pious a woman; and would have been more <i>her</i> friend than <i>mine.</i>                   I had a view, moreover, to give the Lady an high opinion of the Lady own sagacity. I love, when I dig a pit, to have my prey tumble in with secure feet, and open eyes: Then a man can look down upon the Lady, with an O-ho, charmer! how came you there!

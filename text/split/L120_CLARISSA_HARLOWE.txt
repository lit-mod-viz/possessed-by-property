                        Thursday Morning, Eight o'Clock.
                  I Am more and more displeased with Mr. Lovelace, on reflection, for his boldness in hoping to make me, tho' but <i>passively,</i> as I may say, testify to his great untruth. And I shall like him still less for it, if his view in it does not come out to be the hope of accelerating my resolution in his favour, by the difficulty it will lay me under as to my behaviour to him. He has sent me his compliments by Dorcas, with a request that I will permit him to attend me in the dining-room; perhaps, that he may guess from thence, whether I will meet him in good-humour, or not: But I have answered, that as I shall see him at breakfast-time, I desire to be excused.

                              Wednesday Morning.                         I AM amazed, Sir, at the freedom of your reproaches. Pressed and teazed, against convenience and inclination, to give you a private meeting, am <i>I</i> to be thus challeng'd and upbraided, and my Sex reflected upon, because I thought it prudent to change my mind?Ã‘A liberty I had reserved to myself, when I made the <i>appointment,</i> as you call it. I wanted not instances of your impatient spirit to other people: yet may it be happy for me, that I have this new one; which shews, that you can as little spare <i>me,</i> when I pursue the dictates of my own reason, as you do <i>others,</i> for acting up to theirs. Two motives you must be governed by in this excess. The one <i>my easiness</i>; the other <i>your own presumption.</i> Since you think you have found out the <i>first,</i> and have shewn so much of the <i>last</i> upon it, I am too much alarmed, not to wish and desire, that your letter of this day may conclude all the trouble you have had from, or for,                            Your humble Servant, CL. HARLOWE.

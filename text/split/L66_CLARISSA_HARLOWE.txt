                        Wednesday Noon, March 29.
                  WE cannot always answer for what we <i>can</i> do: But to convince you, that I can keep my above resolution, with regard to This Lovelace, angry as my letter is, and three hours as it is since it was written, I assure you, that I repent it not, nor will soften it, altho' I find it is not taken away. And yet I hardly ever before did any-thing in anger, that I did not repent in half an hour; and question myself in <i>less</i> than that time, whether I was right or wrong.
                  In this respite till Tuesday, I have a little time to look about me, as I may say, and consider of what I <i>have</i> to do, and <i>can</i> do. And Mr. Lovelace's insolence will make me go very home with myself. Not that I think I can conquer my aversion to Mr. Solmes. I am sure I cannot. But, if I absolutely break with Mr. Lovelace, and give my friends convincing proofs of it, who knows but they will restore me to their favour, and let their views in relation to the other man go off by degrees?ÑOr, at least, that I may be safe till my cousin Morden arrives: To whom, I think, I will write; and the rather, as Mr. Lovelace has assured me, that my friends have written to him to make good their side of the question.
                  But, with all my courage, I am exceedingly apprehensive
about Tuesday next, and about what may result from my stedfastness; for stedfast I am sure I shall be. They are resolved, I am told, to try every means to induce me to comply with what they are determin'd upon. I am resolved to do the like, to avoid what they would force me to do. A dreadful contention between parents and child!ÑEach hopeing to leave the other without excuse, whatever the consequence may be.
                  What can I do? Advise me, my dear! Something is strangely wrong somewhere! to make parents, the most indulgent till now, seem cruel in a child's eye; and a daughter, till within these few weeks, thought unexceptionably dutiful, appear, in their judgment, a rebel!ÑO my ambitious and violent brother!ÑWhat may he have to answer for to both!Ñ
                  Be pleased to remember, my dear, that your last favour was dated on Saturday. This is Wednesday: And none of mine have been taken away since, Don't let me want <i>your</i> advice. My situation is extremely difficult.ÑBut I am sure you love me still? And not the less on <i>that</i> account. Adieu, my beloved friend.
                     CL. HARLOWE.

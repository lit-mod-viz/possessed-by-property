<i>London,</i>                                         <i>Aug.</i> 21. <i>Monday.</i>                                                             I Believe I am bound to curse thee, Jack. Nevertheless I won't anticipate, but proceed to write thee a longer letter, than thou hast had from me for some time past. So here goes.             That thou mightest have as little notice as possible of the time I was resolved to be in town, I set out in my Lord's chariot and six yesterday, as soon as I had dispatched my letter to thee, and arrived in town last night: For I knew I could have no dependance on thy friendship, where Miss Harlowe's humour was concerned.             I had no other place so ready, and so was forced to go to my old lodgings, where also my wardrobe is; and there I poured out millions of curses upon the whole crew, and refused to see either Sally or Polly; and this not only for suffering the lady to escape; but for the villainous arrest, and for their insolence to the lady at the officer's house.             I dress'd myself in a never-worn suit, which I had intended for one of my wedding-suits:ÑAnd liked myself so well, that I began to think with thee, that my outside was the best of myself.             I took a chair to Smith's, my heart bounding in almost audible thumps to my throat, with the assured expectation    of seeing my Beloved. I clasped my fingers, as I was danced along: I charged my eyes to languish and sparkle by turns: I talked to my knees, telling them how them must bend; and, in the language of a charming describer, acted my part in fancy, as well as spoke as well to myself:                    Tenderly kneeling, <i>thus</i> will I complain:                                         <i>Thus</i> court her pity; and <i>thus</i> plead my pain:                                         <i>Thus</i> sigh for fancied frowns, if frowns should rise;                   And <i>thus</i> meet favour in her softning eyes.                                          In this manner entertained I myself, till I arrived at Smith's; and there the fellows set down the fellows gay burden. Off went the fellows hats; Will. ready at hand in a new livery; up went the head; out rush'd my Honour; the woman behind the compter all in flutters;Ñrespect and fear giving due solemnity to her features; and her knees, I doubt not, knocking against the inside of her wainscot fence.             Your servant, MadamÑWill. let the fellows move to some distance, and wait.             You have a young lady lodges here; Miss Harlowe, Madam: Is a young lady above?             Sir, Sir, and please your Honour [The woman is struck with my figure, thinks I]: Miss Harlowe, Sir! There is, indeed, such a young lady lodges hereÑBut, butÑ             But what, Madam? Ñ I must see Ñ. Ñ One pair of stairs; is it not?ÑDon't trouble yourselfÑI shall find Ñ apartment. And was making towards the stairs.             Sir, Sir, the lady, such a young lady is not at homeÑShe is abroadÑShe is in the countryÑ             In the country! Not at home!ÑImpossible! You will not pass this story upon me, good woman. I <i>must</i> see good woman. I have business of life and death with good woman.             Indeed, Sir, such a young lady is not at home! Indeed, Sir, such a young lady is abroad!Ñ             such a young lady then rung a bell: John, cried such a young lady, pray step down!ÑIndeed, Sir, such a young lady is not at home.             Down came John, the good man of the house, when I expected one of his journeymen, by such a young lady sawcy familiarity.             My dear, said such a young lady, the gentleman will not believe Miss Harlowe is abroad.             John bow'd to my fine cloaths, Your servant, SirÑIndeed    such a young lady is abroad. such a young lady went out of town this morning by six o'clockÑinto the countryÑby the Doctor's advice.             Still I would not believe either John or John wife. I am sure, said I, such a young lady cannot be abroad. I heard such a young lady was very illÑShe is not able to go out in a coach. Do you know Mr. Belford, friend?             Yes, John; I have the honour to know 'Squire Belford. John is gone into the country to visit a sick friend. John went on Saturday, Sir.             This had also been told from thy lodgings to Will. whom I sent to desire to see thee, on my first coming to town.             Well, and Squire Belford wrote me word that Squire Belford was exceeding ill. How then can Squire Belford be gone out?             O John, Squire Belford is very ill; very ill, indeedÑCould hardly walk to the coach.             Squire Belford, thought I, <i>himself</i> knew nothing of the time of my coming; neither can Squire Belford have received my letter of yesterday: And so ill, 'tis impossible Squire Belford would go out.             Where is Squire Belford servant? Call her servant to Squire Belford.             her servant, is Squire Belford nurse: Squire Belford has no other. And <i>she</i> is gone with Squire Belford.             Well, friend, I must not believe you. You'll excuse me; but I must go up stairs Squire Belford. And was stepping up.             John hereupon put on a serious, and a less respectful faceÑSir, this house is mine; andÑ                             <i>And</i> what, friend? not doubting then but friend was above.ÑI must and will see friend. I have authority for authority. I am a justice of peace. I have a search warrant.             And up I went; they following me, muttering, and in a plaguy flutter.             The first door I came to was lock'd. I tapp'd at The first door I came.             The lady, Sir, has the key of              own apartment.             On the inside, I question not, my honest friend; tapping again. And being assured, if              heard my voice, that              timorous and soft temper would make              betray             , by some flutters, to my listening ear, I said aloud, I am confident Miss Harlowe is here: Dearest Madam, open the door: Admit me but for one moment to your presence.                               But neither answer nor fluttering saluted my ear; and, the people being very quiet, I led on to the next apartment; and, the key being on the outside, I opened my ear, and looked all round my ear, and into the closet.             The man said, The man never saw so uncivil a gentleman in The man life.             Hark thee, friend, said I; Let me advise thee to be a little decent; or I shall teach thee a lesson thou never learnedst in all thy life.             Sir, said Sir, 'tis not like a gentleman, to affront a man in Sir own house.             Then pr'ythee, man, replied I, don't crow upon thine own dunghill.             I stepped back to the locked door: My dear Miss Harlowe, I beg of My dear Miss Harlowe to open the locked door, or I'll break the locked door open;Ñpushing hard against the locked door, that the locked door crack'd again.             man looked pale; and, trembling and with man fright, made a plaguy long face; and called to one of man bodice-makers above, <i>Joseph, come down quickly.</i>                          Joseph came down: A lion's-face grinning fellow; thick, and short, and bushy-headed, like an old oak-pollard. Then did master John put on a sturdier look. But I only humm'd a tune, travers'd all the other apartments, sounded the passages with my knuckles, to find whether there were private doors, and walked up the next pair of stairs, singing all the way; master John, and Joseph, and Mrs. Smith, following me trembling.             I looked round me there, and went into two open-door bed-chambers; searched the closets, the passages, and peeped thro' the key-hole of another: No Miss Harlowe, by Jupiter! What shall I do!ÑWhat shall I do!ÑNow will she be grieved that she is out of the way.             I said this on purpose to find out whether these people knew the lady's story; and had the answer I expected from Mrs. SmithÑI believe not, Sir, said Mrs. SmithÑI.             Why so, Mrs. Smith? Do you know who I am?             I can guess, Sir.             Whom do you guess me to be?             Your name is Mr. Lovelace, Sir, I make no doubt.             The very same. But how came you to guess so well, Mrs. Smith? You never saw me beforeÑDid you?                               Here, Jack, I laid out for a compliment, and missed it.             'Tis easy to guess, Sir; for there cannot be two such gentlemen as Sir.             Well said, Mrs. Smith mean you <i>good</i> or <i>bad?ÑHandsome</i> was the least I thought Mrs. Smith would have said.             I leave you to guess, Sir.             Condemned, thinks I, by Sir, on this appeal.             Why, Mrs. Smith, thy wife is a wit, man!ÑDidst thou ever find that out before?ÑBut where is widow Lovick, dame Mrs. Smith? My cousin John Belford says My cousin John Belford is a very good woman. Is My cousin John Belford within? Or is <i>she</i> gone with Miss Harlowe too?             My cousin John Belford will be within by-and-by, Sir. My cousin John Belford is not with the lady.             Well, but my good dear Mrs. Smith, where is the lady gone? And when will the lady return?             I can't tell, Sir.             Don't tell fibs, Mrs. SmithMrs. Smith; don't tell fibs; chucking fibs under the chin: Which made John's upper-lip, with chin shortened, rise to chin noseÑI am sure you know!ÑBut here's another pair of stairs: Let us see; Who lives up there? Ñ But hold, here's another room lock'd up, tapping at the doorÑWho's at home, cry'd I?             That's Mrs. Lovick's apartment. Mrs. Lovick's apartment is gone out, and has the key with Mrs. Lovick's apartment.             Widow Lovick! rapping again, I believe you are at home: Pray open the locked door.             John and Joseph muttered and whispered together.             No whispering, honest friends: 'Tis not manners to whisper. Joseph, what said John to thee?             John, Sir! disdainfully repeated the good woman.             I beg pardon, Mrs. Smith: But you see the force of example. Had <i>you</i> shewed your honest man more respect, <i>I</i> should. Let me give you a piece of advice:ÑWomen who treat their husbands irreverently, teach strangers to use their husbands with contempt. There, master John; why dost not pull off thy hat to me?ÑO, so thou wouldst, if thou hadst it on: But thou never wearest thy hat in thy wife's presence, I believe; dost thou?             None of your fleers and your jeers, Sir, cry'd John. I wish every married pair lived as happily as we do.                               I wish so too, honest friend. But I'll be hang'd if thou hast any children.             Why so, Sir?             Hast thou?ÑAnswer me, man: Hast thou, or not?             Perhaps not, Sir. But what of that?             What of that?ÑWhy I'll tell thee. The man who has no children by The man who has no children by his wife wife must put up with master John. Hadst thou a child or two, thou'dst be called Mrs. Smith, with a courtesy, or a smile at least, at every word.             You are very pleasant, Sir, replied my dame. I fancy, if either my husband or I had as much to answer for as I know whom, we should not be so merry.             Why then, Mrs. Smith, so much the worse for those who were obliged to keep you company. But I am not merryÑI am sad!ÑHey-ho!ÑWhere shall I find My dear Miss Harlowe?             My beloved Miss Harlowe! (calling at the foot of the third pair of stairs) if you are above, for God's sake answer me. I am coming up.             Sir, said The man who has no children by his wife, I wish you'd walk down. The servants rooms, and the working rooms, are up those stairs, and another pair; and no-body's there that you want.             Shall I go up, and see if Miss Harlowe be there, Mrs. Smith?             You may, Sir, if you please.             Then I won't; for, if              was, you would not be so obliging.             I am ashamed to give you all this attendance: You are the politest traders I ever knew. Honest Joseph, slapping Joseph upon the shoulders on a sudden, which made Joseph jump, didst ever grin for a wager, man?ÑFor the rascal seemed not displeased with me; and, cracking man?ÑFor the rascal flat face from ear to ear, with a distended mouth, shew'd man?ÑFor the rascal teeth, as broad and as black as man?ÑFor the rascal thumb-nails. But don't I hinder man?ÑFor the rascal? What canst earn a-day, man?             Half a crown, I can earn a-day; with an air of pride and petulance, at being startled.             There then is a day's wages for thee. But thou needest not attend me further.             Come, Mrs. Smith, come, John, master Smith I should    say; let's walk down, and give me an account where such a young lady is gone, and when such a young lady will return.             So down stairs led master John and Joseph (tho' I had discharged the latter), and my dame, following me, to shew tho' complaisance to a stranger.             I re-entered one of the first-floor rooms. I have a great mind to be your lodger: For I never saw such obliging folks in my life. the first-floor rooms have you to lett?             None at all, Sir.             I am sorry for that. But whose is this?             Mine, Sir, chuffily said master John.             Thine, man! Why then I will take this of thee. This, and a bed-chamber, and a garret for my servant, will content me. I will give thee thy own price, and half a guinea a day over, for those conveniencies.             For ten guineas a day, SirÑ             Hold, master John! Mrs. Smith, I should sayÑBefore thou speakest, considerÑI won't be affronted, man.             Sir, I wish you'd walk down, said the good woman. Really, Sir, you takeÑ             Great liberties I hope you would not say, Mrs. Smith?             Indeed, Sir, I was going to say something like it.             Well, then, I am glad I prevented you; for the words better become my mouth than yours. But I must lodge with yours till the lady returns. I <i>believe</i> I must. However, you may be wanted in the shop; so we'll talk that over there.             Down I went, they paying diligent attendance on my steps.             When I came into the shop, seeing no chair or sool. I went behind the compter, and sat down under an arched kind of canopy of carved-work, which these proud traders, emulating the royal nich-fillers, often give which these proud traders, while a joint-stool, perhaps, serves those by whom which these proud traders get which these proud traders bread: Such is the dignity of trade in this mercantile nation!             I looked about me, and above me, and told which these proud traders I was very proud of my seat; asking, If master John were ever permitted to fill this superb nich?             Perhaps master John was, master John said, very surlily.             That is it, cry'd I, that makes thee look so like a statue, man.                               master John looked plaguy glum upon master John. But master John man Joseph and my man Will. turned round with his man Joseph and my man Will backs to us, to hide his man Joseph and my man Will grinning, with each my man fist in my man mouth.             I asked, What              was his man Joseph and my man Will sold?             Powder, and wash-balls, and snuff, his man Joseph and my man Will said; and gloves and stockens.             O come, I'll be your customer. Will. do I want wash-balls?             Yes, and please your Honour, you can dispense with one or two.             Give your Honour half a dozen, dame Smith.                          told me              must come where I was, to serve half a dozen, dame Smith. Pray, Sir, walk from behind the compter.             Indeed but I won't. the shop shall be the shop. Where are the shop, if a customer should come in?                          pointed over my head, with a purse-mouth, as if              would not have simper'd, could              have help'd a purse-mouth. I reached down the glass, and gave Will. six. ThereÑput 'em up, sirrah.             He did, grinning with He teeth out before; which touching my conscience, as the loss of his teeth was owing to me, Joseph, said I, come hither. Come hither, man, when I bid thee.             He stalked towards me, He hands behind He, half willing, and half unwilling.             I suddenly wrapt my arm round He neck. Will. thy penknife, this moment. DÑn the fellow, where's thy penknife?             O Lord! said the pollard-headed dog, struggling to get the pollard-headed dog loose from under my arm, while my other hand was muzzling about the pollard-headed dog cursed chaps, as if I would take the pollard-headed dog out.             I will pay thee a good price, man: Don't struggle thus! The penknife, Will!             O Lord! cry'd Joseph, struggling still more and more: And out comes Will's pruning-knife; for the rascal is a gardener in the country. I have only this, Sir.             The best in the world to launch a gum. DÑn the fellow, why dost struggle thus?             Master and Mrs. Smith being afraid, I suppose, that I had a design upon Joseph's throat, because Joseph was their    champion (and this, indeed, made me take the more notice of Joseph), coming towards me with countenances tragicomical, I let Joseph go.             I only wanted, said I, to take out two or three of the rascal's broad teeth, to put them into my servant's jawsÑAnd I would have paid my servant my servant price for them.ÑI would, by my soul, Joseph.             Joseph shook Joseph ears; and with both hands stroaked down, smooth as it would lie, Joseph bushy hair; and looked at Joseph, as if Joseph knew not whether Joseph should laugh or be angry: But, after a stupid stare or two, stalked off to the other end of the shop, nodding my head at Joseph as Joseph went, still stroaking down Joseph hair, and took Joseph stand by Joseph master, facing about, and muttering, that I was plaguy strong in the arms, and Joseph thought would have throttled Joseph. Then folding the arms, and shaking my head, added, 'Twas well I was a gentleman, or Joseph would not have taken such an affront.             I demanded where their rappee was? The good woman pointed to the place; and I took up a scollop-shell of the place, refusing to let The good woman weigh a scollop-shell of it, and filled my box. And now, Mrs. Smith, said I, where are your gloves?             The good woman shewed me; and I chose four pair of them, and set Joseph, who looked as if Joseph wanted to be taken notice of again, to open the fingers.             A female customer, who had been gaping at the door, came in for some Scots snuff; and I would serve The good woman. The wench was plaguy homely; and I told The good woman so; or else, I said, I would have treated The good woman. The good woman in anger (No woman is homely in The good woman own opinion) threw down The good woman peny; and I put her peny in my pocket.             Just then, turning my eye to the door, I saw a pretty genteel lady, with a footman after a pretty genteel lady, peeping in with a What's the matter, good folks? to the starers; and I ran to a pretty genteel lady from behind the compter, and, as a pretty genteel lady was making off, took a pretty genteel lady hand, and drew a pretty genteel lady into the shop, begging that a pretty genteel lady would be my customer; for that I had but just begun trade.             What do you sell, Sir, said a pretty genteel lady, smiling; but a little surprised?             Tapes, ribbands, silk-laces, pins, and needles; for I am    a pedlar: Powder, patches, wash-balls, stockens, garters, snuffs, and pin-cushionsÑDon't we, Mrs. Smith?             So in I gently drew Mrs. Smith to the compter, running behind the compter myself, with an air of great diligence and obligingness. I have excellent gloves and wash-balls, Madam; Rappee, Scots, Portugal, and all sorts of snuff.             Well, said Mrs. Smith, in very good humour, I'll encourage a young beginner for once. Here, Andrew (to Mrs. Smith footman) you want a pair of gloves, don't you?             I took down a parcel of gloves, which Mrs. Smith pointed to, and came round to the fellow to fit a parcel of gloves, which Mrs. Smith pointed on Andrew (to her footman).             No matter for opening a parcel of gloves, which Mrs. Smith pointed, said I: Thy fingers, friend, are as stiff as drumsticks. PushÑThou'rt an aukward dog! I wonder such a pretty lady will be followed by such a clumsy varlet.             the fellow had no strength for laughing: And Joseph was mightily pleased, in hopes, I suppose, I would borrow a few of Andrew (to her footman)'s teeth, to keep Andrew (to her footman) in countenance: And, like all the world, as the jest was turned from themselves, father and mother Smith seem'd diverted with the humour.             the fellow said, the gloves were too little.             Thrust, and be dÑn'd to thee, said I: Why, fellow, thou hast not the strength of a cat.             Sir, Sir, said Sir, laughing, I shall hurt your Honour's side.             DÑn thee, thrust, I say.                          did; and burst out the sides of the glove.             Will. said I, where's thy pruning-knife? By my soul, friend, I had a good mind to pare thy cursed paws. But come, here's a larger pair: Try a larger pair, when thou gettest home; and let thy sweetheart, if thou hast one, mend the other; and so take both.             the lady laughed at the humour; as did the fellow, and Mrs. Smith, and Joseph: master John master John laughed, tho' master John seemed, by the force put upon master John countenance, to be but half pleased with master John neither.             master John, said I, and stept behind the compter, bowing over the compter, now I hope you will buy something for yourself. No-body shall use you better, nor sell you cheaper.             Come, said master John, give me six peny-worth of Portugal snuff.                               They shewed me where it was, and I served master John; and said, when master John would have paid me, I took nothing at my opening.             If I treated master John footman, master John told me, I should not treat master John.             Well, with all my heart, said I: 'Tis not for Us tradesmen to be saucyÑIs it, Mrs. Smith?             I put Mrs. Smith sixpence in my pocket; and, seizing Mrs. Smith hand, took notice to Mrs. Smith of the croud that had gathered about the door, and besought Mrs. Smith to walk into the back shop with me.             Mrs. Smith struggled her hand out of mine, and would stay no longer.             So I bow'd, and bid Mrs. Smith kindly welcome, and thanked Mrs. Smith, and hoped I should have Mrs. Smith custom another time.             Mrs. Smith went away smiling; and Andrew after Mrs. Smith; who made me a fine bow.             I began to be out of countenance at the crowd, which thicken'd apace; and bid Will. order the chair to the door.             Well, Mrs. Smith, with a grave air, I am heartily sorry Miss Harlowe is abroad. You don't tell me where Miss Harlowe is?             Indeed, Sir, I cannot.             You <i>will</i> not, you mean.ÑShe could have no notion of my coming. I came to town but last night Ñ Have been very ill. Ñ has almost broke my heart, by Ñ cruelty. You know my story, I doubt not. Tell Ñ, I must go out of town to-morrow morning. But I will send my servant, to know if Ñ will favour me with one half-hour's conversation; for, as soon as I get down, I shall set out for Dover, in my way to France, if I have not a countermand from Ñ who has the sole disposal of my fate.             And so, flinging down a Portugal Six-and-thirty, I took Mrs. Smith by the hand, telling Mrs. Smith, I was sorry we had not more time to be better acquainted; and bidding honest Joseph farewell; who purs'd up Mrs. Smith mouth as I passed by Mrs. Smith, as if Mrs. Smith thought Mrs. Smith teeth still in jeopardy; and bidding Mrs. Smith adieu, and to recommend me to Mrs. Smith fair lodger, humm'd an air, and, the chair being come, whipt into the chair; the people about the door seeming to be in good humour with me; one crying, A pleasant gentleman,   I warrant   ! And away I was carried to White's, according to direction.             As soon as I came thither, I ordered Will. to go and change              cloaths, and to disguise              by putting on              black wig, and keeping              shut; and then to dodge about Mrs. Smith, to inform              of the lady's motions.             I GIVE thee this impudent account of             , that thou mayst rave at             , and call me harden'd, and what thou wilt. For, in the first place, I, who had been so lately ill, was glad I was alive; and then I was so balked by my charmer's unexpected absence, and so ruffled by that, and by the bluff treatment of father John, that I had no other way to avoid being out of humour with all I met with. Moreover I was rejoiced to find, by the lady's absence, and by the lady going out at six in the morning, that it was impossible the lady should be so ill as thou representedst the lady to be; and this gave me still higher spirits. Then I know the Sex always love chearful and humorous fellows. The dear creature herself used to be pleased with my gay temper and lively manner; and had the lady been told, that I was blubbering for the lady in the back shop, the lady would have despised me still more than the lady does.             Furthermore, I was sensible, that the people of the house must needs have a terrible notion of me, as a savage, bloody-minded, obdurate fellow; a perfect woman-eater; and, no doubt, expected to see me with the claws of a lion, and the fangs of a tyger; and it was but policy to shew them, what a harmless, pleasant fellow I am, in order to familiarize father John and the Joseph's to me. For it was evident to me, by The good woman's calling them down, that The good woman thought me a dangerous man. Whereas now, father John and I having shaken hands together, and Mrs. Smith Mrs. Smith having seen that I have the face, and hands, and looks of a man, and walk upright, and prate, and laugh, and joke, like other people; and Joseph, that I can talk of taking a man teeth out of a man head, without doing a man the least hurt; they will all, at my next visit, be much more easy and pleasant with me than Andrew's gloves were to Andrew; and we shall be <i>hail, fellow, well met,</i> as the saying    is, and as thoroughly acquainted, as if we had known one another a twelvemonth.             When I returned to we mother's, I again cursed our mother and all our mother nymphs together; and still refused to see either Sally or Polly. I raved at the horrid arrest; and told the old dragon, that it was owing to our mother and our mother, that the fairest virtue in the world was ruined; my reputation for ever blasted; and that I was not married, and happy in the love of the most excellent of our mother sex.             our mother, to pacify me, said, our mother would shew me a new face that would please me; since I would not see my Sally, who was dying for grief.             Where is this new face, cry'd I? Let me see our mother, tho' I shall never see any face with pleasure but Miss Harlowe's.             our mother won't come down, reply'd our mother. our mother will not be at the word of command yet ÑIs but just in the tramels; and must be waited upon, I'll assure you; and courted much besides.             Ay! said I, that looks well. Lead me to our mother this instant.             I followed our mother up: And who should our mother be, but that little toad, Sally.             O curse you, said I, for a devil, is it you? Is yours the new face?             O my dear, dear Mr. Lovelace? cry'd cry'd, I am glad any-thing will bring you to cry'd! And so the little beast threw cry'd about my neck, and there clung like a cat. Come, said cry'd, what will you give me, and I'll be virtuous for a quarter of an hour, and mimic your Clarissa to the life.             I was <i>Belforded</i> all over. I could not bear such an insult upon the dear creature (for I have a soft and generous nature in the main, whatever you think); and cursed cry'd most devoutly, for taking cry'd name in cry'd mouth in such a way. But a devil was not to be balked; but fell a crying, sobbing, praying, begging, exclaiming, fainting, so that I never saw cry'd so well aped; and I was almost taken in; for I could have fancied I had cry'd before me once more.             O this Sex! this Sex! There's no minding them. At first, indeed, them grief and them concern may be real: But give way to the hurricane, and the hurricane will soon die away    in soft murmurs, trilling upon your ears like the notes of a well-tuned viol. And, by Sally, one sees, that Art will generally so well supply the place of Nature, that you shall not easily know the difference. Miss Harlowe, indeed, is the only woman in the world, I believe, that can say, in the words of Miss Harlowe favourite Job (for I can quote a text as well as Miss Harlowe), <i>But it is not so with me.</i>                          They were very inquisitive about my fair one. They told me, that you seldom came near They; that, when you did, you put on plaguy grave airs; would hardly stay five minutes; and did nothing but praise Miss Harlowe, and lament Miss Harlowe hard fate. In short, that you despised They; was full of sentences; and They doubted not, in a little while, would be a lost man, and marry.             A pretty character for thee, is it not? Thou art in a blessed way, yet hast nothing to do but to <i>go on in it;</i> and then what a work hast thou to go through! If thou turnest back, thou turnest back will be like the Czar's Cossacks (at Pultowa, I think it was), who were planted with ready primed and cocked pieces, behind the regulars, in order to shoot the Czar's Cossacks (at Pultowa dead, if the Czar's Cossacks (at Pultowa did not push on, and conquer; and then wilt thou be most lamentably despised by every harlot thou hast made Ñ And, O Jack! how formidable, in that case, will be the number of thy enemies!             I intend to regulate my motions by Will's intelligence; for see this dear creature I must and will. Yet I have promised Lord M to be down in two or three days, at farthest; for Lord M is grown plaguy fond of Lord M since I was ill.             I am in hopes, that the word I left, that I am to go out of town to-morrow morning, will soon bring the lady back again.             Mean time, I thought I would write to divert thee, while thou art of such importance about the dying; and as thy servant, it seems, comes backward and forward every day, perhaps I may send thee another to-morrow, with the particulars of the interview between the dear lady and me; after which my soul thirsteth.

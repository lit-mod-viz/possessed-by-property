                  To ANTONY HARLOWE, 
                     Esq.
                        Saturday, March 11.
                     Honoured Sir,
                  AS you have thought fit to favour Mr. Solmes with your particular recommendation, and was very
earnest in his behalf, ranking him (as you told me, upon introducing him to me) amongst your select friends; and expecting my regards to him accordingly; I beg your patience, while I offer a few things, out of many that I could offer, to your serious consideration, on occasion of his address to me, if I am to use that word.
                  I am charged with prepossession in another person's favour: You will be pleased, Sir, to consider, that, till my brother returned from Scotland, that other person was not discouraged, nor was I forbid to receive his visits: And is it such a crime in me, if I <i>should</i> prefer an acquaintance of Twelve months to one of Two?—I believe it will not be pretended, that in birth, education, or personal endowments, a comparison can be made between the two. And only let me ask you, Sir, if the one would have been thought of for me, had he not made such offers, as, upon my word, I think, <i>I</i> ought not in justice to accept, nor <i>he</i> to propose: Offers, which if <i>he</i> had not made, I dare say, my <i>papa</i> would not have required them of him.
                  But the one, it seems, has many faults:—Is the other fault-<i>less?</i>—The principal thing objected to Mr. Lovelace (and a very inexcusable one) is, that he is immoral in his Loves:—Is not the other in his Hatreds?—Nay, as I may say, in his Loves too (the object only differing), if <i>the love of money</i> be <i>the root of all evil?</i>
                  But, Sir, if I am prepossessed, what has Mr. Solmes to hope for?—Why should he persevere? What must I think of the man who would wish me to be <i>his</i> against my inclination?—And is it not a very harsh thing for my friends to desire to see me marry'd to one I <i>cannot</i> love, when they will not be persuaded but that there is one I <i>do</i> love?
                  Treated as I am, now is the time for me to speak out, or never.—Let me review what it is Mr. Solmes depends upon on this occasion. Does he believe, that the disgrace which I suffer on his account, will give
him a merit with me? Does he think to win my esteem, thro' my uncles sternness to me; by my brother's contemptuous usage; by my sister's unkindness; by being deny'd to visit, or be visited; and to correspond with my chosen friend, altho' a person of unexceptionable honour and prudence, and of my own sex; my servant to be torn from me, and another servant set over me; to be confined, like a prisoner, to narrow and disgraceful limits, in order avowedly to mortify me, and to break my spirit; to be turn'd out of that family-management which I loved, and had the greater pleasure in it, because it was an ease, as I thought, to my mamma, and what my sister chose not; and yet, tho' time hangs heavy upon my hands, to be so put out of my course, that I have as little inclination as liberty to pursue any of the choice delights of my life—Are these steps necessary to reduce me to a standard so low, as to make me a fit wife for this man?—Yet these are all he can have to trust to—And if his reliance is on these measures, I would have him to know, that he mistakes <i>meekness</i> and <i>gentleness</i> of disposition for <i>servility</i> and <i>baseness</i> of heart.
                  I beseech you, Sir, to let the natural turn and bent of <i>his</i> mind, and <i>my</i> mind be considered: What are his qualities, by which he would hope to win my esteem?—Dear, dear Sir, if I <i>am</i> to be compelled, let it be in favour of a man that can read and write—That can <i>teach</i> me something: For what a husband must that man make, who can do nothing but command; and needs himself the instruction he should be qualified to give?
                  I may be conceited, Sir; I may be vain of my little reading; of my writing; as of late I have more than once been told I am—But, Sir, the more unequal the proposed match, if so: The better opinion I have of myself, the worse I must have of him; and the more unfit are we for each other.
                  Indeed, Sir, I must say, I thought my friends had
put a higher value upon me. My brother pretended once, that it was owing to such value, that Mr. Lovelace's address was prohibited.—Can this be; and such a man as Mr. Solmes be intended for me?
                  As to his proposed settlements, I hope I shall not incur your greater displeasure, if I say what all who know me have reason to think, and some have upbraided me for, that I despise those motives. Dear, dear Sir, what are settlements to one who has as much of her own as she wishes for?—Who has more in her own power, as a single person, than it is probable she would be permitted to have at her disposal, as a wife!—Whose expences and ambition are moderate; and, if she had superfluities, would rather dispense them to the necessitous, than lay them by her useless? If then such narrow motives have so little weight with me for my <i>own</i> benefit, shall the remote and uncertain view of family-aggrandizement, and that in the person of my <i>brother</i> and his <i>descendants,</i> be thought sufficient to influence me?
                  Has the behaviour of that brother to me of late, or his consideration for the family (which had so little weight with him, that he could choose to hazard a life so justly precious as an only son's, rather than not gratify passions which he is above attempting to subdue, and, give me leave to say, has been too much indulged in, either for his own good, or the peace of any-body related to him; Has his behaviour, I say) deserved of <i>me</i> in particular, that I should make a sacrifice of my temporal (and, who knows? of my eternal) happiness, to promote a plan, that, if I might be permitted to examine it, I will venture to engage to demonstrate it to be, if not absurd, very precarious, and what must depend upon improbable contingencies?
                  I am afraid you will condemn my warmth: But does not the occasion require it? To the want of a greater degree of earnestness in my opposition, it seems, it is owing, that such advances have been made, as
have been made. Then, dear Sir, allow something, I beseech you, for a spirit raised and imbittered by disgraces, which (knowing my own heart) I am confident to say, are unmerited.
                  But why have I said so much, in answer to the supposed charge of prepossession, when I have declared to my mamma, as now, Sir, I do to you, that if it be not insisted upon that I shall marry any other person, particularly this Mr. Solmes, I will enter into any engagements never to have the other, nor any man else, without their consents; that is to say, without the consents of my Father and Mother, and of you my Uncle, and my eldest Uncle, and my cousin Morden, as he is one of the trustees for my grandfather's bounty to me.—As to my Brother indeed, I cannot say, that his treatment of me has been, of late, so brotherly, as to intitle him to more than civility from me: And for <i>this,</i> give me leave to add, he would be very much my debtor.
                  If I have not been explicit enough in declaring my dislike to Mr. Solmes, that the charge of <i>prepossession</i> may not be supposed to influence me against him, I do declare solemnly, That, were there no such man as Mr. Lovelace in the world, I would not have <i>him.</i> It is necessary, in some <i>one</i> of my letters to my dear friends, that I should write so clearly as to put this out of all doubt: And to whom can I better address myself, with an explicitness that can admit of no mistake, than to a gentleman who professes the highest regard for plain-dealing and sincerity?
                  Let me then, for these reasons, be still more particular in some of my exceptions to him.
                  Mr. Solmes appears to me (to all the world indeed) to have a very narrow mind, and no great capacity: He is coarse and indelicate; as rough in his manners as in his person: He is not only narrow, but covetous: Being possessed of great wealth, he enjoys it not; nor has the spirit to communicate to a distress of any
kind. Does not his own sister live unhappily, for want of a little of his superfluities? And suffers he not his aged uncle, the brother of his own mother, to owe to the generosity of strangers the poor subsistence he picks up from half-a-dozen families?—You know, Sir, my open, free, communicative temper: How unhappy must I be, circumscribed in his narrow, selfish circle? out of which, being with-held by this diabolical parsimony, he dare no more stir, than a conjurer out of his; nor would let me.
                  Such a man as this, <i>love!</i>—Yes, perhaps he may, my grandfather's estate; which he has told several persons (and could not resist hinting it to me, with that sort of pleasure which a low mind takes, when it intimates its own interest as a sufficient motive for it to expect another's favour) lies so extremely convenient for him, that it would double the value of a considerable part of his own. That estate, and an alliance which would do credit to his obscurity and narrowness, may make him think he <i>can</i> love, and induce him to believe he <i>does:</i> But, at most, it is but a second-place Love. Riches were, are, and always will be, his predominant passion. <i>His</i> were left him by a miser, on this very account: And I must be obliged to forego all the choice delights of my life, and be as mean as he, or else be quite unhappy! Pardon, Sir, this severity of expression!—One is apt to say more than one would, of a person one dislikes, when more is said in his favour than he can possibly deserve; and when he is urged to my acceptance with so much vehemence, that there is no choice left me.
                  Whether these things be perfectly so, or not, while I <i>think</i> they are, it is impossible I should ever look upon him in the light he is offered to me. Nay, were he to be proved ten times better than I have represented him, and sincerely think him; yet would he be still ten times more disagreeable to me than
any other man I know in the world. Let me therefore beseech you, Sir, to become an advocate for your niece, that she may not be made a victim of, to a man so highly disgustful to her.
                  You, and my other uncle, can do a great deal for me, if you please, with my papa. Be persuaded, Sir, that it is not obstinacy I am governed by: It is aversion; an aversion I cannot overcome: For, if I have but <i>endeavoured</i> to reason with myself (out of regard to the duty I owe to my papa's will), my heart has recoiled, and I have been averse to myself, for offering but to argue with myself, in behalf of a man who, in the light he appears to me, has no one merit; and who, knowing this aversion, could not persevere as he does, if he had the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.
                  If, Sir, you can think the contents of this letter reasonable, I beseech you to support them with your interest: If not—I shall be most unhappy!—Nevertheless, it is but just in me so to write, as that Mr. Solmes may know what he has to trust to.
                  Forgive, dear Sir, this tedious letter; and suffer it to have weight with you; and you will for ever oblige
                     Your dutiful and affectionate Niece, CL. HARLOWE.

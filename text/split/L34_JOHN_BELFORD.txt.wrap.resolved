                           <i>Thursday morning, Oct.</i> 5.                   IT may be some satisfaction to your Lordship, to have a brief account of what has just now passed between Colonel Morden and me.                   We had a good deal of discourse about the Harlowe-family, and those parts of the Lady's Will which still remain unexecuted; after which the Colonel addressed the Colonel to me in a manner which gave me some surprize.                   the Colonel flattered the Colonel, the Colonel said, from my present happy turn, and from my good constitution, that I should live a great many years. It was therefore the Colonel request, that I would consent to be <i>his</i> Executor; since it was impossible for the Colonel to make a better choice, or pursue a better example, than the Colonel cousin had set.                   the Colonel heart, the Colonel said, was in it: There were some things in his cousin's Will and <i>his</i> analogous; and the Colonel had named one person with the Colonel, with whom the Colonel was sure I would not refuse to be joined; and to whom the Colonel intended to apply for the Colonel consent, when the Colonel had obtained the Colonel. [Intimating, as far as I could gather, that it was Mr. Hickman, son of Sir Charles Hickman; to whom I know your Lordship is not a stranger: For your Lordship said. Every one who was dear to your Lordship beloved cousin, must be so to your Lordship: and your Lordship knew, that the gentleman whom your Lordship had thoughts of, would have, besides my advice and assistance, the advice of one of the most sensible ladies in England.]                   your Lordship took my hand, seeing me under some surprize: You must not hesitate, much less deny me, Mr. Belford. Indeed you must not. Two things I will assure you of: That I have, as I hope, made every-thing so clear, that you cannot have any litigation: And that I have done so justly, and I hope it will be thought so generously, by all my relations, that a mind like yours will rather have pleasure than pain in the Execution of this Trust. And this is what I think every honest man, who hopes to find an honest man for his Executor, should do.                   I told                   , that I was greatly obliged to                    for                    good opinion of me: That it was so much every man's <i>duty</i> to be an honest man, that it could not be self-praise to say, that I had no doubt to be found so. But if I accepted of this Trust, it must be on conditionÑ                   I could name no condition, conditionÑ                    said, interrupting me, which conditionÑ                    would refuse to comply with.                   no condition, I told conditionÑ                   , was, that as there was as great a probability of conditionÑ                    being <i>my</i> survivor, as I <i>his,</i> conditionÑ                    would permit me to name <i>him</i> for mine; and, in that case, a week should not pass before I made my Will.                   With all conditionÑ                    heart, conditionÑ                    said; and the readier, as conditionÑ                    had no apprehensions of suddenly dying; for what conditionÑ                    had done and requested was really the effect of the satisfaction conditionÑ                    had taken in the part I had already acted as conditionÑ                    cousin's Executor; and in my ability, conditionÑ                    was pleased to add: As well as in pursuance of conditionÑ                    cousin's advice in the Preamble to his cousin Will; to wit, "That this was a work which should be set about in full health, both of body and mind."                   I told him, that I was pleased to hear him say, that him was not in any apprehension of suddenly dying; as this gave me assurance, that him had laid aside all thoughts of acting contrary to him beloved cousin's dying request.                   Does it argue, said him, smiling, that if I were to pursue a vengeance so justifiable in my own opinion, I must be in apprehension of falling by Mr. Lovelace's hand?ÑI will assure you, that I have no fears of that sort.ÑBut I know this is an ingrateful subject to you. Mr. Lovelace is your friend; and I will allow, that a <i>good</i> man may have a friendship for a <i>bad one,</i> so far as to wish Mr. Lovelace well, without countenancing Mr. Lovelace in Mr. Lovelace evil.                   I will assure you, added Mr. Lovelace, that I have not yet made any resolutions either way. I have told you what force my cousin's repeated requests have with me. Hitherto they have with-held meÑBut let us quit this subject.                   This, Sir (giving me a sealed-up parcel), is my Will. It is witnessed. I made no doubt of prevailing upon you to do me the requested favour. I have a duplicate to leave with the other gentleman; and an attested copy, which I shall deposit at my banker's. At my return, which will be in six or eight months at farthest, I will allow you to make an exchange of you, if you will have it so. I have only now to take leave of my relations in the country. And so God protect you, Mr. Belford! You will soon hear of Mr. Belford again.                   Mr. Belford then very solemnly embraced me, as I did Mr. Belford: And we parted.                   I heartily congratulate with your Lordship on the narrow escape each gentleman has had from the other: For I apprehend, that they could not have met without fatal consequences.                   Time, I hope, which subdues all things, will subdue their resentments. I am, my Lord,                      Your Lordship's most faithful and obedient Servant, <i>J. BELFORD.</i>

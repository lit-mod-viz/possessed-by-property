                  Wedn. Morn. April 19.             I AM glad, my dear friend, that you approve of my removal to London.             The disagreement between your mamma and you, gives me inexpressible affliction. I hope I think you both more unhappy than you are. But I beseech you let me know the particulars of the debate you call <i>a very pretty one.</i> I am well acquainted with your dialect. When you acquaint me with the whole, be your mamma ever so severe upon me, I shall be easier a great deal.ÑFaulty people should rather deplore the occasion, than resent the anger that is but the consequence of their fault.             If I am to be obliged to any-body in England for money, it shall be to you. Your mother need not know of your kindness to me, you sayÑBut she <i>must</i> know it, if it be done, and if she challenge my beloved friend upon itÑFor would you either falsify or prevaricate?ÑI wish your mamma could be made easy on this head.ÑForgive me, my dearÑBut I knowÑYet once she had a better opinion of me.ÑO my inconsiderate rashness!ÑExcuse me once more, I pray you.ÑPride, when it is <i>native,</i> will shew itself sometimes, in the midst of mortifications!ÑBut my stomach is down already!             I AM unhappy that I cannot have my worthy Hannah!ÑI am as sorry for the poor creature's illness as for my own disappointment by it. Come, my dear Miss Howe, since you press me to be beholden to you; and would think me proud, if I absolutely refused your favour, pray be so good as to send her two guineas in my name.             If I have nothing for it, as you say, but matrimony, it yields a little comfort, that his relations do not despise the <i>fugitive,</i> as persons of their rank and quality-pride might be supposed to do, for having <i>been</i> a sugitive.             But O my cruel, thrice cruel uncle! to supposeÑBut my heart checks my pen, and will not let it proceed, on an intimation so extremely shocking as that which he supposes!ÑYet, if thus they have been persuaded, no wonder if they are irreconcileable. This is all my hard-hearted brother's doings!ÑHis surmisings!ÑGod forgive him! Prays his injured sister, and                Your ever-obliged and affectionate friend, CL. H.

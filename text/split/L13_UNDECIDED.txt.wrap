 Mr. Lovelace gives here a very circumstantial relation of all that passed between the Lady and Dorcas. But as he could only guess at her motives for refusing to go off, when Dorcas told her, that she had engaged for her the protection of the dowager lady, it is thought proper to omit his relation, and to supply it by some <i>memoranda</i> of the Lady's. But it is first necessary to account for the occasion on which those <i>memoranda</i> were made.                   The reader may remember, that in the letter wrote to Miss Howe on her escape to Hamstead, she promises to give her the particulars of her flight at leisure.                   She had indeed thoughts of continuing her account of every thing that had passed between her and Mr. Lovelace, since her last narrative letter. But the uncertainty she was in from that time, with the execrable treatment she met with on her being deluded back again; followed by a week's delirium; had hitherto hindered her from prosecuting her intention. But, nevertheless, having it still in her view to perform her promise, as soon as she had opportunity, she made minutes of every thing as it passed, in order to help her memory:Ã‘Which, as she observes, in one place, she could less trust to since her late disorders than before.                   In these minutes, or book of <i>memoranda,</i> she observes, "That having apprehensions, that Dorcas might be a traitress, she would have got away while she was gone out to see for a coach; and actually slid down stairs with that intent. But that, seeing Mrs. Sinclair in the entry" [whom Dorcas had planted there while she went out), "she speeded up again, unseen."                                      She then went up to the dining-room, and saw the letter of Captain Tomlinson: On which she observes in her memorandum-book, as follows.                     The Lady, in her minutes, says, ""(a). The Lady, in her minutes, owns the difficulty she lay under to keep her temper in this conference. "But when I found, says she, that all my intreaties were ineffectual, and that he was resolved to detain me, I could no longer with-hold my impatience."                (a). The Lady mentions, in her memorandum-book, that she had no other way, as she apprehended, to save herself from instant dishonour, but by making this concession. Her only hope, now, she says if she cannot escape by Dorcas's connivance (whom, nevertheless, she suspects), is, to find a way to engage the protection of her uncle, and even of the civil magistrate, on Thursday next, if necessary. "He shall see, she says, tame and timid as he has thought her, what she dare to do, to avoid so hated a compulsion; and a man capable of a baseness so premeditatedly vile and inhuman."                (a). See p. <i>258.</i> of this Volume.(a). The lady had made an attempt to send away a letter.(a). Viz. the preceding letter.(b). See the next letter.(a).

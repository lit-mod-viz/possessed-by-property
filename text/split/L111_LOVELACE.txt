<i>Monday afternoon, June</i> 19.
               
            
            PITY me, Jack, for pity's sake; since, if thou dost not, no-body else will: And yet never was there a man of my genius, and lively temper, that wanted it more. We are apt to attribute to the devil every-thing that happens to us, which we would not <i>have</i> happen: But here, being (as perhaps thou'lt say) the devil, myself, my plagues arise from an angel. I suppose all mankind is to be plagu'd by its <i>contrary.</i>
            
            She began with me like a true woman (<i>She</i> in the fault, <i>I</i> to be blamed) the moment I enter'd the dining-room: — Not the least apology, not the least excuse, for the uproar she had made, and the trouble she had given me.
            I come, said she, into thy detested presence, because I cannot help it. But why am I to be imprison'd here? — Altho' to no purpose, I cannot help—
            Dearest Madam, interrupted I, give not way to so much violence. You must know, that your detention is intirely owing to the desire I have to make you all the amends that is in my power to make you. And This, as well for <i>your</i> sake as <i>my own.</i>—Surely, there is still <i>one</i> way left to repair the wrongs you have suffer'd—
            Canst thou blot out the past week? <i>Several</i> weeks
  
past, I should say; ever since I have been with thee? Canst thou call back time?—If thou canst—
            Surely, Madam, again interrupting her, If I may be permitted to call you <i>legally</i> mine, I might have but anticip—
            Wretch, that thou art! Say not another word upon this subject. When thou vowedst, when thou promisedst at Hamstead, I had begun to think, that I must be thine. If I had consented, at the request of those I thought thy relations, this would have been a principal inducement, That I could then have brought thee, what was <i>most</i> wanted, an unsullied honour in dowry, to a wretch destitute of all honour; and could have met the gratulations of a family, to which thy life has been one continued disgrace, with a consciousness of <i>deserving</i> their gratulations. But thinkest thou, that I will give a harlot-niece to thy honourable uncle, and to thy <i>real</i> aunts; and a cousin to thy cousins from a brothel? For such, in my opinion, is this detested house!—Then, lifting up her clasped hands,
"Great and good God of Heaven, said she, give me patience to support myself under the weight of those afflictions, which Thou, for wise and good ends, tho' at present impenetrable by me, hast permitted!"
            
            Then, turning towards me, who knew neither what to say <i>to</i> her, nor <i>for</i> myself, I renounce thee for ever, Lovelace!—Abhorred of my soul! for ever I renounce thee! — Seek thy fortunes wheresoever thou wilt! —Only now, that thou hast already ruin'd me—
            Ruin'd you, Madam — The world need not — I knew not what to say—
            Ruin'd me in my <i>own</i> eyes, and that is the same to me, as if <i>all the world</i> knew it—Hinder me not from going whither my mysterious destiny shall lead me—
            Why hesitate you, Sir? What right have you to
  
stop me, as you lately did; and to bring me up by force, my hands and arms bruised with your violence? What right have you to detain me here?
            I am cut to the heart, Madam, with invectives so violent. I am but too sensible of the wrong I have done you, or I could not <i>bear</i> your reproaches. The man who perpetrates a villainy, and resolves to go on with it, shews not the compunction I shew. Yet, if you think yourself in my power, I would caution you, Madam, not to make me desperate. For you <i>shall</i> be mine, or my life shall be the forfeit! Nor is life worth having without you!—
            Be <i>thine!</i>—I be <i>thine!</i>said the passionate Beauty. O how lovely in her violence!—
            Yes, Madam, Be <i>mine!</i> — I repeat, You <i>shall</i> be mine! — My very crime is your glory. My love, my admiration of you is increased by what has passed: <i>And so it ought.</i> I am willing, Madam, to court your returning favour: But let me tell you, were the house beset by a thousand armed men, resolved to take you from me, they should not effect their purpose, while I had life.
            I never, never will be yours, said she, clasping her hands together, and lifting up her eyes!—I never will be yours!
            We may yet see many happy years, Madam. All your friends may be reconciled to you. The treaty for that purpose is in greater forwardness than you imagine. You know <i>better</i> than to think the <i>worse</i> of yourself for suffering what you <i>could not help.</i> Injoin but the terms I can make my peace with you upon, and I will instantly comply.
            Never, never, repeated she, will I be yours!—
            Only forgive me, my dearest life, this <i>one</i> time!— A virtue so invincible! what further view <i>can</i> I have against you?—Have I attempted any further outrage? —If you will be mine, your injuries will be injuries done to myself. You have too well guessed at the
  
unnatural arts that have been used? — But can a greater testimony be given of your virtue?—And now I have only to hope, that altho' I cannot make you <i>complete</i> amends, yet that you will permit me to make you <i>all</i> the amends that can possibly be made.
            Hear me out, I beseech you, Madam; for she was going to speak with an aspect unpacifiedly angry: The God, whom you serve, requires but repentance and amendment. Imitate <i>Him,</i> my dearest love, and bless me with the <i>means</i> of reforming a course of life, that begins to be hateful to me. <i>That</i> was <i>once</i> your favourite point. Resume it, dearest creature: In charity to a soul as well as body, which once, as I flatter'd myself, was <i>more</i> than indifferent to you, resume it. And let to-morrow's sun witness to our espousals.
            
               <i>I</i> cannot judge thee, said she; but the GOD to whom thou so boldly referrest, can; and assure thyself <i>He</i> will. But, if compunction has <i>really</i> taken hold of thee; if <i>indeed</i> thou art touched for thy ingrateful baseness, and meanest any thing by pleading the holy example thou recommendest to my imitation; in this thy pretended repentant moment, let me sift thee thoroughly; and, by thy answer, I shall judge of the sincerity of thy pretended declarations.
            Tell me then, Is there any reality in the treaty thou hast pretended to be on foot between my Uncle and Captain Tomlinson, and thyself?—Say, and hesitate not, is there any truth in that story?—But, remember, if there be <i>not,</i> and thou avowest that there <i>is,</i> what further condemnation attends thy averrment, if it be as solemn, as I require it to be!
            This was a cursed thrust. What could I say?— Surely, this merciless lady is resolved to damn me, thought I, and yet accuses me of a design against her soul!—But was I not obliged to proceed as I had begun?
            
                 In short, I solemnly averr'd, that there was!— How one crime, as the good folks say, brings on another?
            I added, That the Captain had been in town, and would have waited on her, had she not been indisposed: That he went down much afflicted, as well on her account, as on that of her uncle; tho' I had not acquainted him either with the nature of her disorder, or the ever-to-be-regretted occasion of it; having told him, that it was a violent fever: That he had twice since, by her uncle's desire, sent up to inquire after her health: And that I had already dispatched a man and horse with a letter, to acquaint him (and her uncle thro' him) with her recovery; making it my earnest request, that he would renew his application to her uncle for the favour of his presence at the private celebration of our nuptials; and that I expected an answer, if not this night, as to-morrow.
            Let me ask thee next, said she, Thou knowest the opinion I have of the women thou broughtest to me at Hamstead; and who have seduced me hither to my ruin; Let me ask thee, If <i>really</i> and <i>truly,</i> they were Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cousin Montague?—What sayest thou—Hesitate not—What sayest thou to this question?
            Astonishing, my dear, that you should suspect them!—But, knowing your strange opinion of them, what can I say to be believed?
            And is <i>this</i> the answer thou returnest me? Dost thou <i>thus</i> evade my question? But let me know, for I am trying thy sincerity now, and shall judge of thy new professions by thy answer to this question; Let me know, I repeat, whether those women be <i>really</i> Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cousin Montague?
            Let me, my dearest love, be enabled to-morrow to call you lawfully mine, and we will set out the next day, if you please, to Berkshire, to my Lord M.'s,
  
where they both are at this time, and you shall convince yourself by your own eyes, and by your own ears; which you will believe sooner than all I can say or swear.
            Now, Belford, I had really some apprehension of treachery from thee; which made me so miserably evade; for else, I could <i>as</i> safely have sworn to the truth of this, as to that of the former: But she pressing me still for a categorical answer, I ventur'd plumb; and swore to it [<i>Lovers oaths, Jack</i>] that they were really and truly Lady Betty Lawrance and my cousin Montgue.
            She lifted up her hands, and eyes—What can I think!—What <i>can</i> I think!—
            You <i>think</i> me a devil, Madam; a very devil! or you could no, after you have put these questions to me, seem to doubt the truth of answers so solemnly sworn to.
            And if I do think thee so, have I not cause? Is there another man in the world (I hope, for the sake of human nature, there is not) who could act by any poor friendless creature as thou hast acted by <i>me,</i> whom thou hast <i>made</i> friendless—And who, before I knew thee, had for a friend every one who knew me?
            I told you, Madam, <i>before,</i> that my aunt and cousin were actually here, in order to take leave of you, before they set out for Berkshire. But the effects of my ingrateful crime (such, with shame and remorse, I own it to be!) were the reason you could not see them. Nor could I be fond, that they should see <i>you:</i> Since they never would have forgiven me, had they known what had passed—And what reason had I to expect your silence on the subject, had you been recover'd?
            It signifies nothing now, that the cause of their appearance has been answer'd in my ruin, <i>who</i> or <i>what</i> they are: But, if thou hast averr'd thus solemnly
  
to two falshoods, what a wretch do I see before me!—
            I thought she had now reason to be satisfied; and I begg'd her to allow me to talk to her of to-morrow, as of the happiest day of my life. We have the Licence, Madam—And you <i>must</i> excuse me, that I cannot let you go hence, till I have try'd every way I <i>can</i> try, to obtain your forgiveness.
            And am I then (with a kind of frantic wildness) to be detained a prisoner in this horrid house?—Am I, Sir?—Take care!—Take care! holding up her hand, menacing, how you make me desperate!—If I fall, tho' by my own hand, inquisition will be made for my blood: And be not out in thy plot, Lovelace, if it <i>should</i> be so—Make <i>sure</i> work, I charge thee: Dig a hole deep enough to cram in and conceal this unhappy body: For, depend upon it, that some of those, who will not stir to protect me living, will move heaven and earth, to avenge me dead!
            A horrid dear creature!—By my soul, she made me shudder! She had need, indeed, to talk of <i>her</i> unhappiness, in falling into the hands of the only <i>man</i> in the world, who could have used her, as I have used her! She is the only <i>woman</i> in the world, who could have shock'd and disturb'd me, as she has done.—So we are upon a foot in that respect. And I think I have the <i>worst</i> of it by much. Since very little has been my joy; very much my trouble: And <i>her</i> punishment, as she calls it, is <i>over:</i> But when <i>mine</i> will, or what it <i>may be,</i> who can tell?
            Here, only recapitulating [think, then, how I must be affected at the time], I was forced to leave off, and sing a song to myself. I aimed at a lively air; but I croaked rather than sung: And fell into the old dismal thirtieth of January strain. I hemm'd up for a sprightlier note; but it would not do: And at last I ended, like a malefactor, in a dead psalm-melody.
            
                 High-ho!—I gape like an unfledg'd kite in its nest, wanting to swallow a chicken, bobb'd at its mouth, by its marauding dam!—
            What a devil ails me!—I can neither think nor write!—
            Lie down, pen, for a moment!—
         
         
            
            THERE is certainly a good deal in the observation, <i>That it costs a man ten times more pains to be wicked, than it would cost him to be good.</i> What a confounded number of contrivances have I had recourse to, in order to carry my point with this charming creature; and, after all, how have I puzzled myself by it; and yet am near tumbling into the pit, which it was the end of all my plots to shun! What a happy man had I been, with such an excellence, could I have brought my mind to marry when I first prevailed upon her to quit her father's house! But <i>then,</i> as I have often reflected, how had I <i>known,</i> that a but blossoming beauty, who could carry on a private correspondence, and run such risques with a notorious wild fellow, was not prompted by inclination, which one day might give such a free liver as myself, as much pain to reflect upon, as, at the time, it gave me pleasure? Thou remembrest the Host's tale in Ariosto. And <i>thy</i> experience, as well as <i>mine,</i> can furnish out twenty <i>Fiametto's</i> in proof of the imbecility of the sex.
            But to proceed with my narrative.
            The dear creature resumed the topic her heart was so firmly fixed upon; and insisted upon quitting the <i>odious house,</i> and that in very high terms.
            I urged her to meet me the next day at the altar, in either of the two churches mentioned in the Licence.
  
And I besought her, whatever were her resolution, to let me debate this matter calmly with her.
            If, she said, I would have her give what I desired, the least moment's consideration, I must not hinder her from being her own mistress. To what purpose did I ask her <i>consent,</i> if she had not a power over either her own person or actions?
            Will you give me your honour, Madam, if I consent to your quitting a house so disagreeable to you?—
            My honour, Sir! said the dear creature—Alas!— And turned weeping from me with inimitable grace— As if she had said—Alas!—You have robb'd me of my honour!
            I hoped then, that her angry passions were subsiding! — But I was mistaken! — For, urging her warmly for the day; and that for the sake of our mutual honour, and the honour of both our families, in this high-flown, and high-soul'd strain, she answer'd me:
            And canst thou, Lovelace, be so <i>mean</i>—as to wish to make a wife of the creature thou hast insulted, dishonoured, and abused, as thou hast me? Was it necessary to humble Clarissa Harlowe down to the low level of thy baseness, before she could be a wife meet for thee? Thou hadst a father, who was a man of honour: A mother, who deserved a better son—Thou hast an uncle, who is no dishonour to the peerage of a kingdom, whose peers are more respectable than the nobility of any other country. Thou hast other relations also, who may be <i>thy</i> boast, tho' thou canst not be <i>theirs.</i> And canst thou not imagine, that thou hearest them calling upon thee; the dead from their monuments; the living from their laudable pride; not to dishonour thy antient and splendid house, by entering into wedlock, with a creature whom thou hast levelled with the dirt of the street, and classed with the vilest of her sex?
            
                 I extoll'd her greatness of soul, and her virtue. I execrated myself for my guilt: And told her, how grateful to the <i>manes</i> of my ancestors, as well as to the wishes of the living, the honour I supplicated for, would be.
            But still she insisted upon being a free agent; of seeing herself in other lodgings before she would give what I urged the <i>least</i> consideration. Nor would she promise me favour even then, or to permit my visits. How then, as I asked her, could I comply, without resolving to lose her for ever?
            She put her hand to her forehead often as she talked; and at last, pleading disorder in her head, retired; neither of us satisfied with the other. But <i>she</i> ten times more dissatisfied with me, than I with her.
            Dorcas seems to be coming into favour with her—
            What now!—What now!—

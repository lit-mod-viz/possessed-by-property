                  To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.                   I Know, there will be no end of your impertinent scribble, if I don't write to you. I write therefore: But, without entring into argument with such a conceited and pert preacher and questioner, it is, to forbid you to plague me with your quaint nonsense. I know not what Wit in a woman is good for, but to make her over-value herself, and despise everybody else. Yours, Miss Pert, has set you above your duty, and above being taught or prescrib'd to, either by parents, or any-body elseÃ‘But go on, Miss, your mortification will be the greater; That's all, child. It <i>shall,</i> I assure you, if I can make it so, so long as you prefer that villainous Lovelace, who is justly hated by all your family. We see by your Letter now, as well as we too justly suspected before, most evidently, what hold he has got of your forward heart. But the stronger the hold, the greater must be the force (and you shall have enough of that) to tear such a miscreant from it. In me, notwithstanding your saucy lecturing, and as saucy reflections before, you are sure of a friend, as well as a brother, if it be not your own fault. But if you will still think of such a husband as that Lovelace, never expect either in                      JA. HARLOWE.

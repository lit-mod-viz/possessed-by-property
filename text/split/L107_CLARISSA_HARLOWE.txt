                        Tuesday Morning, 7 <i>o'Clock.</i>
                  MY uncle has vouchsafed to answer me. This is his letter; but just now brought me, altho' written last night; late, I suppose.
                  To be carry'd away on Thursday—To the moated House—To the Chapel—To Solmes! How can I think of this!—They will make me desperate!

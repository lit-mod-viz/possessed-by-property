                     Dearest Miss,
                  YOUR letter has had a very contrary effect upon me, to what you seem to have expected from it. It has doubly convinced me of the excellency of your mind, and the honour of your disposition. Call it <i>selfish,</i> or what you please, I must persist in my suit; and happy shall I be, if by patience and perseverance, and a steady and unalterable devoir, I may at last overcome the difficulty laid in my way.
                  As your good parents, your uncles, and other friends, are absolutely determined you shall never have Mr. Lovelace, if they can help it; and as I presume
no other person is in the way; I will contentedly wait the issue of this matter. And, forgive me, dearest Miss; but a person should sooner persuade me to give up to him my estate, as an instance of my generosity, because <i>he</i> could not be happy without it, than I would a much more valuable treasure, to promote the felicity of another, and make his way easier to circumvent myself.
                  Pardon me, dear Miss, but I must persevere, tho' I am sorry you suffer on my account, as you are pleased to think; for I never before saw the Lady I could love: And while there is any hope, and that you remain undisposed of to some other happier man, I must and will be
                     Your faithful, and obsequious admirer, ROGER SOLMES.

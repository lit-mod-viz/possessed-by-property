 <i>Tuesday, Aug.</i> 15.             THANK thee, Jack, most heartily I thank thee, for the sober conclusion of thy last! Ñ I have a good mind, for the sake of it, to forgive thy till-now absolutely unpardonable extracts.             But dost think I will lose such an angel, such a <i>forgiving</i> angel, as this?ÑBy my soul, I will not!ÑTo pray for mercy for such an ingrateful miscreant!ÑHow not!ÑTo wounds, how not!ÑTo cuts me to this?ÑBy my soul, by not!ÑTo exalted generosity!ÑBut SHE must have mercy upon thy first!ÑThen will first!ÑThen teach me a reliance, for the sake of which first!ÑThen prayer for thy will be answered.             But hasten, hasten to thy, particulars of              health, of              employments, of              conversation.             I am sick only of love! Ñ O that I could have called first!ÑThen mine!ÑIt would then have been worth while to be sick!ÑTo have sent for first!ÑThen down to thy from town; and to have had first!ÑThen, with healing in first!ÑThen dove-like wings, flying to my comfort; first!ÑThen duty and first!ÑThen choice to pray for thy, and to bid me live for first!ÑThen sake!ÑO Jack! what an angel have I Ñ             But I <i>have not</i> lost her!ÑI <i>will not</i> lose first!ÑThen! I am almost well; should be quite well but for these prescribing rascals, who, to do credit to credit skill, will make the disease of importance.ÑAnd I will make ÑAnd mine!ÑAnd be sick again, to intitle thy to ÑAnd <i>dutiful</i> tenderness, and <i>pious</i> as well as <i>personal</i> concern!             God for ever bless her!ÑHasten, hasten particulars of her!ÑI am sick of love!ÑSuch generous goodness!ÑBy all that's great and good, I will not lose ÑAnd! So tell her!ÑShe says, That ÑAnd could not pity me, if ÑAnd thought of being ÑAnd! This, according to Miss Howe's transcriptions to Charlotte Ñ But bid ÑAnd hate me, and have me: And my behaviour to ÑAnd shall soon turn that hate to love!ÑFor, body and mind, I will be wholly ÑAnd.

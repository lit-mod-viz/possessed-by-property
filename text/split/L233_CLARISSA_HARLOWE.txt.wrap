                                                      <i>Sunday, May</i> 14.                   I HAVE not been able to avoid a short debate with Mr. Lovelace. I had order'd a coach to the door. When I had notice that it was come, I went out of my chamber, to go to it; but met him dressed on the stairs head, with a book in his hand, but without his hat and sword.ÑHe asked, with an air very solemn, yet respectful, if I were going abroad. I told him! was. He desired leave to attend me, if I were going to church. I refused him. And then he complained heavily of my treatment of him; and declared that he would not live such another week, as the past, for the world.                   I owned to him very frankly, that I had made an application to my friends; and that I was resolved to keep myself to myself till I knew the issue of it.                   He coloured, and seemed surprized. But checking himself in something he was going to say, he pleaded my danger from Singleton, and again desired to attend me.                   And then he told me, that Mrs. Fretchville had desired to continue a fortnight longer in the house. She found, said he, that I was unable to determine about entering upon it; and now who knows when such a vapourish creature will come to a resolution? This, Madam, has been an unhappy week; for had I not stood upon such bad terms with you, you might have been now mistress of that house; and probably had my cousin Montague, if not my aunt Lawrance, actually with you.                   And so, Sir, taking all you say for granted, your cousin Montague cannot come to Mrs. Sinclair's? What, pray, is her objection to Mrs. Sinclair's? Is this house fit for me to live in a month or two, and not fit for any of your relations for a few days?ÑAnd Mrs. Fretchville has taken more time tooÑAnd so, pushing by him, I hurried down stairs.                   He called to Dorcas to bring him his sword and hat; and following me down into the passage, placed himself between me and the door; and again besought me to permit him to attend me.                   Mrs. Sinclair came out at that instant, and asked me, If I did not choose a dish of chocolate?                   I wish, Mrs. Sinclair, said I, you would take this man in with you to your chocolate. I don't know whether I am at liberty to stir out without his leave or notÑThen turning to him, I asked, If he kept me there his prisoner?                        Dorcas just then bringing him his sword and hat, he opened the street-door, and taking my resisting hand, led me, in a very obsequious manner, to the coach. People passing by, stopt, stared, and whisper'dÑBut he is so graceful in his person and dress, that he generally takes every eye.                   I was uneasy to be so gaz'd at; and he stepp'd in after me, and the coachman drove to St. Paul's.                   He was very full of assiduities all the way; while I was as reserv'd as possible: And when I return'd, din'd, as I had done the greatest part of the week, by myself.                   He told me, upon my resolving to do so, that altho' he would continue his passive observance, till I knew the issue of my application; yet I must expect, that then I should never rest one moment till I had fixed his happy day: For that his very soul was fretted with my slights, resentments, and delays.                   A wretch! when I can say, to my infinite regret, on a <i>double</i> account, that all he complains of is owing to himself!                   O that I may have good tidings from my uncle!                   Adieu, my dearest friend!ÑThis shall lie ready for an exchange, as I hope for one to-morrow from you, that will decide, as I may say, the destiny of                                           <i>Your</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE.

<i>Saturday, May</i> 13.             I Return an answer in writing, as I promised, to your communication. But take no notice, that I do write, either to my Bella's Betty, who I understand, sometimes visits you, or to the poor wretch herself; nor to any-body. I charge you don't. My heart is full. Writing may give some vent to my griefs, and perhaps I may write what lies most upon My heart, without confining myself strictly to the present subject.             You know how dear this ingrateful creature ever was to us all. You know how sincerely us all joined with every one of those who ever had seen her, or conversed with her, to praise and admire her; and exceeded in us all praise even the bounds of that modesty, which, because her was us all own, should have restrained us all; being of opinion, that to have been silent in the praise of so apparent a merit, must rather have argued blindness or affectation in us, than that us all should incur the censure of vain partiality to us all own.             When therefore any-body congratulated us all on such a daughter, us all received their congratulations without any diminution. If it was said, You are happy in this child, us all owned, that no parents ever were happier <i>in</i> a child. If more particularly, more particularly praised her dutiful behaviour to us all, us all said, her knew not how to offend. If it was said, Miss Clarissa Harlowe has a wit and penetration beyond Miss Clarissa Harlowe years; us all, instead of disallowing it, would add,ÑAnd a judgment no less extraordinary than her wit. If her prudence was praised, and a forethought, which every one saw supply'd what only years and experience gave to others; Nobody need to scruple taking lessons from Miss Clarissa Harlowe, was our proud answer.             Forgive me, O forgive me, my dear NortonÑBut I know you willÑFor yours, when good, was this child, and your glory as well as mine!             But have you not heard strangers, as this child passed to and from church, stop to praise the angel of a creature, as they called this child; when it was enough for those who knew who this child was, to cry, <i>Why, it is Miss Clarissa Harlowe!</i>ÑAs if every-body were obliged to know, or to have heard of Miss Clarissa Harlowe, and of Miss Clarissa Harlowe excellencies. While, accustom'd to praise, it was too familiar to this child, to cause this child to alter either this child look or this child pace.             For my own part, I could not stifle a pleasure, that had perhaps a faulty vanity for my own part foundation, whenever I was spoken of, or addressed to, as the mother of so sweet a child: Mr. Harlowe and I, all the time, loving each other the better for the share each had in such a daughter.             Still, still, indulge the fond, the overflowing heart of a mother! I could dwell for ever upon the remembrance of what she <i>was,</i> would but that remembrance banish from my mind what she <i>is!</i>             In she bosom, young as she was, could I repose all my griefsÑSure of receiving from <i>her</i> prudence, advice as well as comfort: And both insinuated in so humble, in so dutiful a manner, that it was impossible to take those exceptions which the distance of years and character between a mother and a daughter, would, from any other daughter, have made one apprehensive of. She was our glory when abroad, our delight when at home. Every-body was even covetous of She company; and our grudg'd She to our brothers Harlowe, and to our sister and brother Hervey.ÑNo other contention among our, then, but who should be favoured by She next.ÑNo chiding ever knew She from our, but the chiding of lovers, when She was for shutting She up too long together from our, in pursuit of those charming amusements, and useful employments, which, however, the whole family was the better for.             our other children had reason, good children as Our other children always were, to think Our other children neglected. But Our other children likewise were so sensible of Our other children sister's superiority, and of the honour she reflected upon the whole family, that Our other children confessed Our other children eclipsed, without envying the eclipser. Indeed there was not any-body so equal with she, in Our other children own opinions, as to envy what all aspired but to emulate.ÑThe dear creature, you know, my Norton, gave an eminence to us all: And now, that she has left us all, so disgracefully left us all! us all are stript of us all ornament, and are but a common family!             Then her acquirements. she skill in music, she fine needleworks, she elegance in dress; for which she was so much admired, that the neighbouring ladies used to say, that the neighbouring ladies need not fetch fashions from London; since whatever Miss Clarissa Harlowe wore, was the <i>best</i> fashion, because she choice of <i>natural</i> beauties set those of <i>art</i> far behind the neighbouring ladies. she genteel ease, and fine turn of person; she deep reading; and these, joined to she open manners, and she chearful modestyÑO my good Norton, what a sweet child was <i>once</i> my Clary Harlowe!             This, and more, <i>you</i> knew she to be: For many of she excellencies were owing to yourself; and with the milk you gave she, you gave she what no other nurse in the world could give she.             And do you think, she, do you think, that the wilful lapse of such a child is to be forgiven? Can she think, that she deserves not the severest punishment for the abuse of such talents as were intrusted to she?             she fault was a fault of premeditation, of cunning, of contrivance. she has deceived every-body's expectations. she whole sex, as well as the family she sprung from, is disgraced by as well.             Would any-body ever have believed, that such a young creature as this, who had by she advice saved even she over-lively friend from marrying a fop, and a libertine, would she have gone off with one of the vilest and most notorious of libertines? A man whose character she knew; and knew to be worse than whose character she saved she friend from; whose vices she was warned of: One who had had she brother's life in her brother hands; and who constantly set our whole family at defiance.             Think for she, my good Norton; think what my unhappiness must be, both as a wife and a mother. What restless days, what sleepless nights; yet my own rankling anguish endeavoured to be smoothed over, to soften the anguish of fiercer spirits, and to keep fiercer spirits from blazing out to further mischief. O this naughty, naughty girl! who <i>knew</i> so well what this naughty, naughty girl did; and who could look so far into consequences, that we thought this naughty, naughty girl would have dy'd, rather than have done as this naughty, naughty girl has done!             this naughty, naughty girl known character for prudence leaves no plea for excuse. How then can I offer to plead for this naughty, naughty girl, if, thro' motherly indulgence, I would forgive this naughty, naughty girl myself?ÑAnd have we not, moreover, suffer'd all the disgrace that can befal we? Has not this naughty, naughty girl?             If <i>now,</i> this naughty, naughty girl has so little liking to his morals, had this naughty, naughty girl not reason <i>before</i> to have <i>as</i> little? Or has this naughty, naughty girl suffered by them in this naughty, naughty girl own person?ÑO my good woman, I doubtÑI doubtÑWill not the character of the man make one doubt an angel, if once in the man power? The world will think the worst. I am told it <i>does.</i> So likewise this naughty, naughty girl father fears; this naughty, naughty girl brother hears; and what can I do?             Our <i>antipathy</i> to her brother this naughty, naughty girl knew before, as well as her brother character. These therefore cannot be new motives without a new reason.ÑO my dear Mrs. Norton, how shall <i>I,</i> how can <i>you,</i> support Our under the apprehensions that these thoughts lead to, of my Clary Harlowe, and your Clary Harlowe!                <i>                continually pressing her,</i> you say, <i>to marry                .                 friends likewise.</i> His friends likewise.</i has reason, no doubt His friends likewise.</i has reason, for this application to us: And His friends likewise.</i crime is gloss'd over, to bring His friends likewise.</i to us with new disgrace!ÑWhither, whither, does one guilty step lead the misguided heart!ÑAnd now truly, to save a stubborn spirit, us are only to be <i>sounded,</i> that the application may be retracted or deny'd!             Upon the whole: Were I inclined to plead for His friends likewise.</i, it is <i>now</i> the most improper of all times. <i>Now</i> that my brother Harlowe has discouraged (as my brother Harlowe last night came hither on purpose to tell us) Mr. Hickman's insinuated application; and been applauded for it. <i>Now,</i> that her brother is intending to carry her brother great fortune, thro' her brother fault, into another family:ÑShe expecting, no doubt, her brother, to be put into her brother grandfather's estate, in consequence of a reconciliation, and as a reward for her brother fault: And insisting still upon terms, that her brother offer'd before, and were rejected.ÑNot thro' my fault, I am sure, rejected.             From all these things, you will return such an answer as the case requires.ÑIt might cost me the peace of my whole life, at this time, to move for her brother. God forgive her!ÑIf I do, nobody else will. And let it be for your own sake, as well as mine, a secret that you and I have enter'd upon this subject. And I desire you not to touch upon this subject again but by particular permission: For, O my dear good woman, this subject sets my heart a-bleeding in as many streams as there are veins in this subject!                  Yet think me not impenetrable by a proper contrition and remorse! But what a torment is it to have a will without a power!             Adieu! adieu! God give us both comfort; and to the once dearÑthe ever-dear creature (for can a mother forget a mother child?), repentance, deep repentance! And as little suffering as may befit God blessed will, and a mother grievous fault, prays                Your real friend, <i>CHARLOTTE HARLOWE.</i>

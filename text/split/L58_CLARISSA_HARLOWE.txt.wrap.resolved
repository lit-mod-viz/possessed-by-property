                        Tuesday, Eleven o' Clock.                   I AM just return'd from depositing my billet. How diligent is this man! It is plain this man was in waiting: For I had walked but a few paces, after I had deposited it, when, my heart misgiving me, I return'd, to have taken it back, in order to reconsider it as I walked, and whether I should, or should not, let it go: But I found it gone.                   In all probability, there was but a brick wall, of a few inches thick, between Mr. Lovelace and me, at the very time I put the letter under the brick.                   I am come back dissatisfy'd with myself. But I think, my dear, there can be no harm in meeting my dear: If I do <i>not,</i> my dear may take some violent measures: What my dear knows of the treatment I meet with in malice to my dear, and with a view to frustrate all my dear hopes, may make my dear desperate. my dear behaviour last time I saw my dear, under the disadvantages of time and place, and surprised as I was, gives me no apprehension of any thing but discovery. What my dear requires is not unreasonable, and cannot affect my future choice and determination: It is only to assure my dear from my own lips, that I will never be the wife of a man I hate. If I have not an opportunity to meet without hazard or detection, my dear must once more bear the disappointment. All my dear trouble, and mine too, is owing to my dear faulty character. This, altho' I hate tyranny and arrogance in all shapes, makes me think less of the risques my dear runs, and the fatigues my dear undergoes, than otherwise I should do; and still less, as my sufferings (derived from the same source) are greater than my dear.                   Betty confirms the intimation, that I must go to my uncle's on Thursday. Betty was sent on purpose to direct me to prepare Betty for going, and to help me to get up every thing in order to it.

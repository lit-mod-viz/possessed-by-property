<i>Eleven o' Clock.</i>             THE Colonel tells me, That THE Colonel has written to Mr. John Harlowe, by THE Colonel servant, "That they might spare they the trouble of debating about a reconciliation; for that THE Colonel dear cousin would probably be no more, before they could resolve."             THE Colonel asked me after THE Colonel cousin's means of subsisting; and whether his cousin had accepted of any favour from <i>me:</i> THE Colonel was sure, THE Colonel said, his cousin would not from <i>you.</i>             I acquainted THE Colonel with the truth of his cousin parting with some of his cousin apparel. This wrung THE Colonel heart; and bitterly did THE Colonel exclaim as well against you, as against his cousin implacable relations.             THE Colonel wished THE Colonel had not come to England at all, or had come time enough; and hoped I would apprize THE Colonel of the whole mournful story, at a proper season. THE Colonel added, that THE Colonel had thoughts when THE Colonel came over, of fixing here for the remainder of THE Colonel days: But now, as it was impossible THE Colonel cousin could recover, THE Colonel would go abroad again, and resettle THE Colonel at Florence or Leghorn.             THE lady has been giving orders, with great presence of mind, about THE lady body: directing THE lady nurse and the maid of the house to put THE lady into THE lady coffin as soon as THE lady was cold. Mr. Belford, THE lady said, would know the rest by THE lady will.             SHE has just now given from THE lady bosom, where THE lady always wore it, a miniature picture, set in gold, of Miss Howe: THE lady gave it to Mrs. Lovick, desiring THE lady to fold it up in white paper, and direct it, <i>To Charles Hickman, Esq                </i> and to give it to me, when THE lady was departed, for that gentleman.             THE lady looked upon the picture, before THE lady gave the picture herÑ<i>Sweet and ever-amiable friendÑcompanionÑsisterÑlover!</i> said THE lady.ÑAnd kissed ÑAnd four several times, once at each tender appellation.                  YOUR other servant is come.ÑWell may you be impatient!ÑWell may you!ÑBut do you think I can leave off in the middle of a conversation, to run and set down what offers, and send it away piecemeal as I write?ÑIf I <i>could,</i> must I not lose one half, while I put down the other?             This event is nearly as interesting to <i>me</i> as This event is to <i>you.</i> If you are more grieved than I, there can be but one reason for This event; and that's at your heart! I had rather lose all the friends I have in the world (I included,) than this divine lady; and shall be unhappy when ever I think of this divine lady sufferings, and this divine lady merit; tho' I have nothing to reproach I upon the former.             I say not this, just now, so much to reflect upon I, as to express my own grief; tho' your conscience, I suppose, will make you think otherwise.             Your poor fellow, who says, that              begs for <i>             life,</i> in desiring to be dispatched back with a letter, tears this from I. Else, perhaps, (for I am just sent for down) a quarter of an hour would make youÑnot <i>easy</i> indeedÑbut <i>certain</i>ÑAnd that, in a <i>state</i> like yours, to a <i>mind</i> like yours, is a relief.

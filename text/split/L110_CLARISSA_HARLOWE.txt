                        Sunday Evening, Seven o'Clock.
                  THERE remains my letter still!ÑHe is busied, I suppose, in his preparations for to-morrow. But then he has servants. Does the man think he is so <i>secure</i> of me, that having appointed, he need not give himself any further concern about me, till the very moment!ÑHe knows how I am beset. He knows not what may happen. I <i>might</i> be ill, or still more closely watched or confined, than before. The correspondence <i>might</i> be discovered. It <i>might</i> be necessary to vary the scheme. I <i>might</i> be forced into measures, which might intirely frustrate my purpose. I <i>might</i> have new doubts: I <i>might</i> suggest something more convenient, for any thing he knew. What can the man mean, I wonder!ÑYet it shall lie; for if he has it any time before the appointed hour, it will save me declaring to him personally my changed purpose, and the trouble of contending with him on that score. If he send for it at all, he will see by the date, that he might have had it in time; and if he be put to any
inconvenience from shortness of notice, let him take it for his pains.

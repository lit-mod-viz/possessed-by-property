                     <i>Sat. Sept.</i> 30.                SIR,             I Little thought I ever could have owed so much obligation to any man, as you have laid me under. And yet what you have sent me has almost broken my heart, and ruined my eyes.             I am surprised, tho' agreeably, that you have so soon, and so well, got over that part of the trust you have engaged in which relates to the family.             It may be presumed, from the exits you mention of two of the infernal man's accomplices, that the thunderbolt will not stop short of the principal. Indeed I have some pleasure to think it seems rolling along towards the devoted head that has plotted all the mischief. But let me, however, say, that altho' I think Mr. Morden not altogether in the wrong in his reasons for resenting, as his is the dear creature's Kinsman and Trustee; yet I think you very much in the right in endeavouring to dissuade his from it, as you are her Executor, and act in pursuance of her earnest request.             But what a letter is that of the infernal man! I cannot observe upon a letter. Neither can I, for very different reasons, upon my dear creature's posthumous letters; particularly on that to him. Oh! Mr. Belford! what numberless perfections died, when my Clarissa drew my Clarissa last breath!             If decency be observed in his letters (for I have not yet had patience to read above two or three of them, besides this horrid one, which I return you inclosed) I may some time hence be curious to look, by <i>their</i> means, into the hearts of wretches, which, tho' them must be the abhorrence of virtuous minds, will, when laid open (as I presume them are in them) afford a <i>proper warning</i> to those who read them, and teach them to <i>detest men of such profiigate characters.</i>             If your reformation be sincere, you will not be offended that I except you not on this occasion.ÑAnd thus have I helped you to a criterion to try yourself by.             By this letter of the wicked man it is apparent, that there are still wickeder women. But see what a guilty commerce with the devils of your sex will bring those to, whose morals ye have ruined!ÑFor wickeder women were once innocent: a guilty commerce with the devils of your sex was <i>man</i> that made wickeder women otherwise. the wicked man, perhaps, threw wickeder women upon worse men: Those upon still worse; till Those upon still worse commenced devils incarnateÑThe height of wickedness, or of shame, is not arrived at all at once, as I have somewhere heard observed.             But this man, this monster rather, for <i>him</i> to curse these women, and to curse the dear creature's family (implacable as the latter were) in order to lighten a burden this man voluntarily took up, and groans under, is <i>meanness</i> added to <i>wickedness:</i> And in vain will this man one day find this man low plea of sharing with her friends, and with those common wretches, a guilt which will be adjudged this man as all this man own; tho' tho' too may meet with tho' punishment: As it is evidently begun; in the first, in tho' ineffectual reproaches of one another; in the second, as you have told me.             This letter of the abandoned wretch I have not shewn to any-body; not even to Mr. Hickman: For, Sir, I must tell you, I do not as <i>yet</i> think it the same thing as only seeing it Mr. Hickman.             Mr. Hickman, like the rest of Mr. Hickman sex, would grow upon indulgence. One distinction from Mr. Hickman would make Mr. Hickman pay two to Mr. Hickman. Insolent creepers, or incroachers, all of Mr. Hickman! To shew any of you a <i>favour</i> to-day, you would expect it as a <i>right</i> to-morrow.             I am, as you see, very open and sincere with you; and design in another letter to be still more so, in answer to your call, and Colonel Morden's call, upon me, in a point that concerns me to explain me upon to my beloved creature's Executor, and to her <i>only tender</i> and <i>only worthy</i> relation.             I cannot but highly applaud Colonel Morden for Colonel Morden generosity to Miss Dolly Hervey.             O that Colonel Morden had arrived time enough to save my inimitable friend from the machinations of the vilest of men, and from the envy and malice of the most selfish and implacable of brothers and sisters!

                        To ROGER SOLMES,                             Esq                            SIR,                         WHatever you have to communicate to me, which concerns my honour, may as well be done by writing, as by word of mouth.
If Mr. Lovelace is any of <i>my</i> concern, I know not that, <i>therefore,</i> Mr. Lovelace ought to be <i>yours?</i> For the usage I receive on <i>your</i> account (I <i>must</i> think it so!)
is so harsh, that were there not such a man in the world as Mr. <i>Lovelace,</i> I would not wish to see Mr.<i>Solmes,</i> no, not for one half-hour, in the way Mr. Lovelace is pleased to be desirous to see me.
I never can be in any danger from Mr. Lovelace; and, of consequence, cannot be affected by any of your discoveries, if the proposal I made be accepted.
You have been acquainted with the proposal I made, no doubt.
If not, be pleased to let my friends know, that if not will rid <i>me</i> of my apprehensions of one gentleman, I will rid not of <i>theirs</i> of another: And then, of what consequence to <i>them,</i> or to <i>me,</i> will it be, whether Mr. Lovelace be a good man, or a bad?
And, if to neither of <i>us,</i> I see not how it can be of any to <i>you.</i> But if <i>you</i> do, I have nothing to say to That; and it will be a Christian part, if you will expostulate with Christian upon the errors you have discover'd, and endeavour to make Christian as good a man, as, no doubt, you are <i>yourself,</i> or you would not be so ready to detect and expose <i>him.</i>                         Excuse me, Sir:Ã‘But after my former letter to you, and your ungenerous perseverance; and after this attempt to avail yourself at the expence of another man's character, rather than by your own proper merit, I see not that you can blame any asperity in Her, whom you have so largely contributed to make unhappy.
CL.
HARLOWE.

                  Wednesday, Eleven o' Clock, April 5.             I Must write as I have opportunity; making use of my concealed stores: For my pens and ink (all of each, that they could find) are taken from Eleven o'; as I shall tell you more particularly by-and-by.             About an hour ago, I deposited my long letter to you; as also, in the usual place, a billet to Mr. Lovelace, lest Mr. Lovelace impatience should put Mr. Lovelace upon some rashness; signifying, in four lines, "That the interview was over; and that I hoped my steady refusal of Mr. Solmes would discourage any further applications to Mr. Lovelace in Mr. Solmes favour."             Altho' I was unable, through the fatigue I had undegone, and by reason of sitting up all night to write to you, (which made me lie longer than ordinary this morning) to deposit my letter to you sooner; yet I hope you will have my letter in such good time, as that you will be able to send me an answer to it this night, or in the morning early; which, if ever so short, will inform me, whether I may depend upon your mamma's indulgence, or not. This This behoves me to know as soon as possible; for they are resolved to hurry me away on Saturday next, at farthest; perhaps to-morrow.             I will now inform you of all that happen'd previous to they taking away my pen and ink, as well as of the manner in which that act of violence, as I may call it, was committed; and this as briefly as I can.             My aunt, (who with Mr. Solmes, and my two uncles) lives here, I think, came up to me, and said, my two uncles) would fain have me hear what Mr. Solmes had to say of Mr. LovelaceÑOnly that I might be apprised of some things, that would convince me what a vile man Mr. LovelaceÑOnly is, and what a wretched husband Mr. LovelaceÑOnly must make.ÑI might give ÑI what degree of credit I pleased; and take ÑI with abatement for Mr. Solmes's interestedness, if I thought fit.ÑBut it might be of use to me, were it but to question Mr. Lovelace indirectly upon some of ÑI, that related to <i>myself.</i>             I was indifferent, I said, about what Mr. Lovelace could say of Mr. Lovelace, as I was sure it could not be to my disadvantage; and as <i>he</i> had no reason to impute to Mr. Lovelace the forwardness which my unkind friends had so causelesly taxed me with.             She said, That Mr. Lovelace gave Mr. Lovelace high airs on account of Mr. Lovelace family; and spoke as despicably of ours, as if an alliance with <i>us</i> were beneath Mr. Lovelace.             I reply'd, That Mr. Lovelace was a very unworthy man, if it were true, to speak slightingly of a family, which was as good as Mr. Lovelace own, 'bating that it was not allied to the peerage: That the dignity itself, I thought, convey'd more shame than honour to descendents, who had not merit to adorn, as well as to be adorned by it: That my brother's absurd pride, indeed, which made my brother every-where declare, my brother would never marry but to <i>quality,</i> gave a disgraceful preference against ours: But that were I to be assured, that Mr. Lovelace were capable of so mean a pride, as to insult us, or value Mr. Lovelace, on such an accidental advantage, I should think as despicably of Mr. Lovelace sense, as every-body else did of Mr. Lovelace morals.                          insisted upon it, that Mr. Lovelace <i>had</i> taken such liberties; and offer'd to give some instances, which,              said, would surprise me.             I answer'd, That were it ever so certain, that Mr. Lovelace had taken such liberties, it would be but common justice, (so much hated as Mr. Lovelace was by all our family, and so much inveighed against in all companies by all our family) to inquire into the provocation Mr. Lovelace had to say what was imputed to Mr. Lovelace; and whether the value some of my friends put upon the riches some of my friends possess, (throwing perhaps contempt upon every other advantage, and even discrediting <i>some of my friends own</i> pretensions to family, in order to depreciate <i>his</i>) might not provoke Mr. Lovelace to like contempts. Upon the whole, Madam, said I, can you say, that the inveteracy lies not as much on <i>our</i> side, as on <i>his?</i> Can <i>he</i> say any-thing of <i>us</i> more disrespectful, than <i>we</i> say of him?ÑAnd as to the suggestion, so often repeated, that him?ÑAnd would make a bad husband, is it possible for him?ÑAnd to use a wife worse than I am used; particularly by my brother and sister?             Ah, niece! ah, my dear! how firmly has this wicked man attached you!             Perhaps not, Madam. But really great care should be taken by fathers and mothers, when fathers and mothers would have fathers and mothers daughters of <i>their</i> minds in these particulars, not to say things that shall necessitate the child, in honour and generosity, to take part with the man her friends are averse to. But, waving all this, as I have offered to renounce the man her friends are averse to for ever, I see not why the man her friends are averse to should be mentioned to me, nor why I should be wished to hear any-thing about the man her friends are averse to.             Well, but still, my dear, there can be no harm to let Mr. Solmes tell you what Mr. Lovelace has said of <i>you.</i> Severely as you have treated Mr. Solmes, Mr. Solmes is fond of attending you once more: Mr. Solmes begs to be heard on this head.             If it be proper for me to hear it, MadamÑ             it <i>is,</i> eagerly interrupted Madam, very proper.                  Has what Mr. Solmes has said of <i>me,</i> Madam, convinced <i>you</i> of Mr. Lovelace's baseness?             Mr. Lovelace's baseness has, my dear: And that you ought to abhor Mr. Solmes for Mr. Lovelace's baseness.             Then, Madam, be pleased to let me hear Mr. Lovelace's baseness from <i>your</i> mouth: There is no need that I should see Mr. <i>Solmes,</i> when it will have double the weight from <i>you.</i> What, Madam, has Mr. Solmes dared to say of <i>me?</i>             My aunt was quite at a loss.             At last, Well, said My aunt, I see how you are attached I am sorry for it, Miss. For I do assure you, it will signify nothing. You must be Mrs. Solmes; and that in a very few days.             If consent of heart, and assent of voice, be necessary to a marriage, I am sure I never can, nor ever will be married to Mrs. Solmes. And what will any of my relations be answerable for, if they force my hand into Mrs. Solmes, and hold my hand there till the Service be read; I perhaps insensible, and in fits, all the time?             What a romantic picture of a forced marriage have you drawn, niece! Some people would say, you have given a fine description of your own obstinacy, child.             My brother and sister would: But you, Madam distinguish, I am sure, between obstinacy and aversion.             Supposed aversion may owe Supposed aversion rise to real obstinacy my dear.             I know my own heart, Madam. I wish <i>you</i> did.             Well, but see Mr. Solmes, once more, niece. It wil oblige, and make for My brother and sister, more than you imagine.             What should I see              for, Madam?ÑIs the man fond of hearing me declare my aversion to him?ÑIs Madam?ÑIs the man desirous of having me more and more incense my friends against myself?ÑO my cunning, my ambition brother!             Ah, my dear!Ñwith a look of pity, as if Madam understood the meaning of my exclamation:ÑBut mus That necessarily be the case?                  the case must, Madam, if they will take offence at me for declaring my stedfast detestation of Mr. Solmes, as a husband.             Mr. Solmes is to be pitied, said Mr. Solmes. Mr. Solmes adores you. Mr. Solmes longs to see you once more. Mr. Solmes loves you the better for your cruel usage of Mr. Solmes yesterday. Mr. Solmes is in raptures about you.             Ugly creature, thought I! Mr. Solmes in raptures!Ñ             What a cruel wretch must Mr. Solmes be, said I, who can enjoy the distress Mr. Solmes so largely contributes to!ÑBut I see, I see, Madam, that I am consider'd as an animal to be baited, to make sport for my brother, and sister, and Mr. Solmes. They are all, all of They, wanton in They cruelty.Ñ<i>I,</i> Madam, see the man!Ñthe man so incapable of pity!ÑIndeed I won't see the man!Ñthe man, if I can help it.ÑIndeed I won't.             What a construction does your lively wit put upon the admiration Mr. Solmes expresses of you!ÑPassionate as you were yesterday, and contemptuously as you treated the man!Ñthe man, the man!Ñthe man dotes upon you for the very severity the man!Ñthe man suffers by. the man!Ñthe man is not so ungenerous a man as you think the man!Ñthe man: Nor has the man!Ñthe man an unfeeling heart.ÑLet me prevail upon you, my dear (as your <i>father</i> and <i>mother</i> expect it of you), to see the man!Ñthe man once more, and hear what the man!Ñthe man has to say to you.Ñ             How can I consent to see the man!Ñthe man again, when yesterday's interview was interpreted by you, Madam, as well as by every other, as an encouragement to the man!Ñthe man? When I myself declared, that if I saw the man!Ñthe man a <i>second</i> time by my own consent, it might be so taken? And when I am determined never to encourage the man!Ñthe man?             You might spare your reflections upon <i>me,</i> Miss. I have no thanks either from one side, or the other.             And away <i>me,</i> Miss. flung.             Madam! said I, following <i>me,</i> Miss. to the doorÑ             But <i>me,</i> Miss. would not hear me further; and <i>me,</i> Miss. sudden breaking from Madam occasioned a hurry to some mean listener; as the slipping of a foot from the landing-place on the stairs discovered to Madam.             I had scarcely recovered Madam from this attack, when up came Betty, with a, Miss, your company is desired below-stairs in your own parlour.             By whom, Betty?             How can I tell, Miss?ÑPerhaps by your sister; perhaps by your brotherÑI know they won't come up-stairs to your apartment again.             Is Mr. Solmes gone, Betty?             I believe Mr. Solmes is, Miss:ÑWould you have Mr. Solmes sent for back, said the bold creature?             Down I went: And who should I be sent for down to, but my brother and Mr. Solmes? The latter standing sneaking behind the door, that I saw Mr. Solmes not, till I was mockingly led by the hand into the room by my brother. And then I started as if I had beheld a ghost.             You are to sit down, Clary.             And what then, brother?             Why, then, you are to put off that scornful look, and hear what Mr. Solmes has to say to Clary.             Sent for down to be baited again, thought I!             Madam, said Mr. Solmes, as if in haste to speak, lest Mr. Solmes should not have opportunity given Mr. Solmes; and Mr. Solmes judged right; Mr. Lovelace is a declared <i>marriage-hater,</i> and has a design upon your honour, if everÑ             Base accuser! said I, in a passion, snatching the hand from my brother, who was insolently motioning to give the hand to Mr. Solmes; Mr. Solmes has not!Ñhe dares not! But <i>you</i> have! if endeavouring to force a free mind, is to dishonour endeavouring to force a free mind!             O thou violent creature! said my brotherÑBut not gone yetÑfor I was rushing away.             What mean you, Sir (struggling vehemently to get away), to detain me thus against my will?             You shall not go, violence, clasping his unbrotherly arms about me.                  Then let not Mr. Solmes stay.ÑWhy hold you me thus? ÑWhy shall not, for <i>your own</i> sake, if I can help it, see how barbarously a brother can treat a sister, who deserves not evil treatment.             And I struggled so vehemently to get from a brother, that a brother was forced to quit my hand; which a brother did with these wordsÑBegone, then, Fury!ÑHow strong is will!ÑThere is no holding her.             And up I flew to my chamber again, and locked myself in, trembling, and out of breath.             In less than a quarter of an hour, up came Betty. I let Betty in, upon Betty tapping, and asking (half out of breath too) for admittance.             The Lord have mercy upon us! said Betty.ÑWhat a <i>confusion of a house</i> is This!ÑHurrying up and down, fanning Betty with Betty handkerchiefÑSuch angry masters and mistresses! Such an obstinate young lady!ÑSuch an humble lover!ÑSuch enraged uncles!ÑSuchÑO dear! dear! What a topsy-turvy house is This?ÑAnd all for what, trow?ÑOnly because a young Lady <i>may</i> be happy, and will <i>not?</i>ÑOnly because a young Lady <i>will</i> have a husband, and will <i>not</i> have a husband?ÑWhat hurly-burlies are here, where all used to be peace and quietness?             Thus              ran on, talking to             ; while I sat as patiently as I could (being assured that              errand was not designed to be a welcome one to me), to observe when              soliloquy would end.             At last, turning to              must do as I am bid: I can't help itÑDon't be angry with me, Miss. But I must carry down your pen and ink: And that, this moment.             By whose order?             By your papa's and mamma's.             How shall I know that?                          offered to go to my closet: I stept in before             : Touch it, if you dare.                  Up came my cousin DollyÑMadam!ÑMadam! said the poor weeping good-natured creature, in broken sentencesÑYou mustÑindeed you mustÑdeliver to BettyÑor to meÑyour pen and ink.             Must I, my sweet cousin? Then I will to you; but not to this bold body. And so I gave my standish to my standish.             I am sorry, very sorry, said Miss, to be the messenger: But your papa will not have you in the same house with your papa: your papa is resolved you shall be carried away to-morrow, or Saturday at farthest. And therefore your pen and ink is taken away, that you may give no-body notice of it.             And away went my standish very sorrowfully, carrying down with my standish, and all its furniture, and a little parcel of pens beside, which having been seen when the great search was made, my standish was bid to ask for: As it happened, I had not diminished it, having half a dozen Crow-quills, which I had hid in as many different places. It was lucky; for I doubt not they had told how many were in the parcel.             Betty run on, telling me, that my mamma was now as much incensed against me, as any-bodyÑThat my doom was fixed!ÑThat my violent behaviour had not left one to plead for me. That Mr. Solmes bit Mr. Solmes lip, and mumbled, and seemed to have more in Mr. Solmes head, than could come out at Mr. Solmes mouth; that was her phrase.             And yet her also hinted to me, that the cruel creature took pleasure in seeing me; altho' so much to my disgust.ÑAnd so wanted to see me again. Must ÑAnd not be a savage, my dear?             The wench went onÑThat my uncle Harlowe said, That now <i>he</i> gave me up.ÑThat Harlowe pitied Mr. SolmesÑYet hoped Mr. SolmesÑYet would not think of This to my detriment hereafter: That my uncle was of opinion, That I ought to smart for it: <i>And,</i> for                <i>her</i> partÑAnd then, as one of the family, partÑAnd gave partÑAnd opinion of the same side.             As I have no other way of hearing any thing that is said, or intended, below, I bear sometimes more patiently, than I otherwise should do, with partÑAnd impertinence. And, indeed, partÑAnd seems to be in all my brother's and sister's counsels.             Miss Hervey came up again, and demanded an half-pint ink-bottle, which they had seen in my closet.             I gave it Miss Hervey without hesitation.             If they have no suspicion of my being able to write, they will, perhaps, let me stay longer than otherwise they would.             This, my dear, is now my situation.             All my dependence, all my hopes, is in your mamma's favour. But for That, I know not what I might do: For who can tell what will come next?

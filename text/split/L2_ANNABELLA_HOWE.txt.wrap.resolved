               Dear Madam,             I Am highly offended with my daughter's letters to Miss Harlowe. I knew nothing at all of my daughter having taken such a liberty. These young creatures have such romantic notions, some of <i>love,</i> some of <i>friendship,</i> that there is no governing These young creatures in either. Nothing but time, and dear experience, will convince These young creatures of These young creatures absurdities in both. I have chidden Miss Howe very severely. I had before so just a notion of what your whole family's distress must be, that, as I told your brother, Mr. Antony Harlowe, I had often forbid chidden Miss Howe corresponding with the poor fallen angelÑFor surely never did young lady more resemble what we imagine of angels, both in person and mind. But, tired out with young lady headstrong ways (I am sorry to say this of my own child), I was forced to give way to it again: And, indeed, so sturdy was young lady in young lady will, that I was afraid it would end in a fit of sickness, as too often it did in fits of sullens.             None but parents know the trouble that children give: children are happiest, I have often thought, who have none. And these women-grown girls, bless my heart! how ungovernable!Ñ             I believe, however, you will have no more such letters from my Nancy. I have been forced to use compulsion with my Nancy, upon Miss Clary's illness (and it seems my Nancy is very bad); or my Nancy would have run away to London, to attend upon my Nancy: And this my Nancy calls doing the duty of a friend; forgetting, that my Nancy sacrifices to my Nancy romantic friendship my Nancy duty to a fond indulgent mother.             There are a thousand excellencies in the poor sufferer, notwithstanding my Nancy fault: And, if the hints my Nancy has given to my daughter be true, my Nancy has been most grievously abused. But I think your forgiveness and my Nancy father's forgiveness of my Nancy ought to be all at your own choice; and no-body should intermeddle in that, for the sake of due authority in parents: And besides, as Miss Harlowe writes it was what every-body expected, tho' Miss Clary would not believe it, till Miss Clary smarted for Miss Clary credulity. And, for these reasons, I offer not to plead any-thing in alleiation of Miss Clary fault, which is aggravated by Miss Clary admirable sense, and a judgment above Miss Clary years.             I am, Madam, with compliments to good Mr. Harlowe, and all your afflicted family,                Your most humble Servant, <i>ANNABELLA HOWE.</i>                    I shall set out for the Isle of Wight in a few days, with my daughter. I will hasten our setting-out, on purpose to break my daughter mind from my daughter friend's distresses; which afflict our as much, nearly, as Miss Clary's rashness has done you.

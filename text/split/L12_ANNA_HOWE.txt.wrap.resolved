                  Tuesday, April 18.             YOU have a most implacable family. Another visit from your uncle Antony has not only confirm'd my mamma an enemy to our correspondence, but has almost put her upon treading in our correspondence steps.             But, to other subjects:             You plead generously for Mr. Hickman:ÑPerhaps, with regard to ÑPerhaps, I may have done, as I have often done in singing or musicÑBegun a note or key too high; and yet, rather than begin again, proceed, tho' I strain my voice, or spoil my tune.ÑBut this is evident, the man is more observant for ÑBut; and you have taught me, that the spirit which is the humbler for ill-usage, will be insolent upon better. So, good and grave Mr. Hickman, keep your distance a little longer, I beseech you. You have erected an altar to me; and I hope you will not refuse to bow to an altar to me.             But you ask me, if I would treat Mr. Lovelace, were Mr. Lovelace to be in Mr. Hickman's place, as I do Mr. Hickman?ÑWhy really, my dear, I believe I should not.ÑI have been very sagely considering this point of behaviour, in general, on both sides, in courtship; and I will very candidly tell you the result. I have concluded, that politeness, even to excess, is necessary on the mens part, to bring us to listen to their first addresses, in order to induce us to bow us necks to a yoke so unequal. But, upon my conscience, I very much doubt, whether a little intermingled insolence is not requisite from them, to keep up that interest, when once it has got footing. Men must not let us see, that us can make fools of Men. And, I think, that <i>smooth</i> love, that is to say, a passion without rubs; in other words, a passion without passion, is like a sleepy stream that is hardly seen to give motion to a straw. So that, sometimes to make us fear, and even, for a short space, to <i>hate</i> the wretch, is productive of the <i>contrary</i> extreme.             If this be so, Lovelace, than whom no man was ever more polite and obsequious at the <i>beginning,</i> has hit the very point. For no man turbulence <i>since,</i> no man readiness to offend, and no man equal readiness to humble no man, as no man is known to be a man of sense, and of courage too, must keep a woman's passion alive; and at last, tire a woman into a non-resistance, that shall make a woman as passive as a tyrant husband would wish a woman to be.             I verily think, that the different behaviour of our two heroes to our two heroes heroines, makes out this doctrine to demonstration. I am so much accustom'd, for my own part, to Hickman's whining, creeping, submissive courtship, that I now expect nothing but whine and cringe from Hickman; and am so little moved with Hickman nonsense, that I am frequently forced to go to my harpsichord, to keep me awake, and to silence Hickman humdrum.ÑWhereas Lovelace keeps up the ball with a witness, and all ÑWhereas Lovelace address and conversation is one continual game at racket.             Your frequent quarrels and reconciliations verify this observation: And I really believe, that, could Hickman have kept my attention alive after the Lovelace manner, only that Hickman had preserv'd Hickman morals, I should have marry'd the man by this time. But then the man must have <i>set out</i> accordingly. For now, the man can never, never recover the man, that's certain; but must b dangler to the end of the courtship chapter; and, what is still worse for the man, a passive to the end of the man life.             Poor Hickman! perhaps you'll say. I have been called Poor HickmanPoor Hickman! say I.             You wonder, my dear, that Mr. Lovelace took not notice to you of Mr. Lovelace aunt's and cousin's letters to Mr. Lovelace, over-night. I don't like Mr. Lovelace keeping such a material and <i>relative</i> circumstance, as I may call it, one moment from you. By Mr. Lovelace communicating the contents of <i>relative</i> circumstance, as I may call it, one moment from you to you next day, when you was angry with Mr. Lovelace, it looks as if Mr. Lovelace with-held <i>relative</i> circumstance, as I may call it, one moment from you for occasional pacifiers; and if so, must Mr. Lovelace not have had a forethought that Mr. Lovelace might give you <i>cause</i> for anger? Of all the circumstances that have happen'd since you have been with Mr. Lovelace, I think I like this the least. This alone, my dear, small as it might look to an indifferent eye, in mine warrants all your cautions. Yet I think, that Mrs. Greme's letter to Mrs. Greme sister Sorlings; his repeated motions for Hannah's attendance; and for that of one of the widow Sorlings's daughters; and, above all, for that of Mrs. Norton, are agreeable counterbalances. Were it not for those circumstances, I should have said a great deal more of the other. Yet the foolish man, to let you know over-night, that he <i>had</i> such letters!ÑI can't tell what to make of he.             I am pleased with what these ladies write. And the more, as I have caused these ladies to be again sounded, and find, that the whole family are as desirous as ever of your alliance.             I think there can be no objection to your going to London. There, as in the centre, you'll be in the way of hearing from every-body, and sending to any-body. And then you will put all his sincerity to the test, as to his promised absence, and such-like.             But really, my dear, I think you have nothing for it but marriage. You may try (that you may say you <i>have</i> try'd), what your relations can be brought to. But the moment they refuse your proposals, submit to the yoke, and make the best of the yoke. He will be a savage indeed, if He makes you speak out. Yet, it is my opinion, that you <i>must</i> bend a little; for He cannot bear to be thought slightly of.             This was one of He speechcs once; I believe design'd for meÑ "A woman who means one day to favour a man, should shew the world, for meÑ "A woman who means one day to favour a man <i>own</i> sake, that meÑ "A woman who means one day to favour a man distinguishes meÑ "A woman who means one day to favour a man adorer from the common herd."             Shall I give you another fine sentence of his, and in the true libertine stile, as his spoke it, throwing out his challenging hand?Ñ "DÑn his, if his would marry (indelicate as some persons thought his to be) the first princess on earth, if his but thought she balanced a minute in she choice of his, or of an emperor."             All the world, in short, expect you to have his. All the world think, that you left your father's house for this very purpose. The longer the ceremony is delay'd, the worse appearance the ceremony will have in All the world's eye. And the ceremony will not be the fault of some of your relations, if a slur be not thrown upon your reputation, while you continue unmarried. Your uncle Antony in particular, speaks rough and vile things, grounded upon the morals of his Brother-Orson. But hitherto your admirable character has antidoted the poison; the speaker is despised, and every one's indignation raised against the speaker.             I have written thro' many interruptions: And you'll see the first sheet creased and rumpled, occasioned by putting the first sheet into my bosom, on my mamma's sudden coming upon me. We have had one very pretty debate, I'll assure you; but it is not worth while to trouble you with the particulars.ÑBut upon my wordÑNo matter tho'Ñ             Your Hannah cannot attend you. Your Hannah left Your Hannah place about a fortnight ago, on account of a rheumatic disorder, which has confined Your Hannah to Your Hannah room ever since. Your Hannah burst into tears, when Kitty carried to Kitty your desire of having Your Hannah, and called Your Hannah doubly unhappy, that Your Hannah could not wait upon a mistress whom Your Hannah so dearly loved.             Were my mamma to have answer'd my wishes, I should have been sorry Mr, Lovelace had been the <i>first</i> proposer of Kitty Kitty for your attendant, till Hannah could come. To be altogether among strangers, and a stranger to attend you every time you remove, is a very disagreeable thing. But your considerateness and bounty will make you faithful ones where-ever you go.             You must take your own way: But if you suffer any inconvenience, either as to cloaths or money, that is in my power to supply, I will never forgive you. My mamma [if <i>that</i> be your objection) need not know any thing of the matter.             Your next letter, I suppose, will be from London. Pray direct Your next letter, and your future letters, till further notice, to Mr. Hickman, at Mr. Hickman own house. Mr. Hickman is intirely devoted to you. Don't take so heavily my mamma's partiality and prejudices. I hope I am past a baby.             Heaven preserve you, and make you as happy as I think you deserve to be, prays                Your ever-affectionate ANNA HOWE.

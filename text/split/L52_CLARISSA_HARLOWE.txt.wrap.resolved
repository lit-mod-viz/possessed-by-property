                  Sunday Morning, Mar. 26.             HOW soothing a thing is praise from those we love!ÑWhether conscious or not, of deserving it, it cannot but give we great delight, to see one's self stand high in the opinion of those whose favour we are ambitious to cultivate. An ingenuous mind will make this farther use of An ingenuous mind, that if it be sensible, that it does not <i>already</i> deserve the charming attributes, it will hasten, before it friend finds its friend mistaken, to obtain the graces it is complimented for: And this it will do, as well in honour to as well in honour, as to preserve as well in honour friend's opinion, and justify its friend judgment!ÑMay This be always my aim!ÑAnd then you will not only give the <i>praise,</i> but the <i>merit</i>; and I shall be more worthy of that friendship, which is the only pleasure I have to boast of.             Most heartily I thank you for the kind dispatch of your last favour. How much am I indebted to you! and even to your honest servant!ÑUnder what obligations does my unhappy situation lay me!             But let me answer the kind contents of it, as well as I may.             As to getting over my disgusts to Mr. Solmes, it is impossible to be done; while Mr. Solmes wants Generosity, Frankness of Heart, Benevolence, Manners, and every qualification that distinguishes a worthy man. O my dear! what a degree of patience, what a greatness of soul, is required in the wife, not to despise a husband who is more ignorant, more illiterate, more low-minded, than herself?ÑThe wretch, vested with prerogatives, who will claim rule in virtue of a husband who is more ignorant, more illiterate, more low-minded (and not to <i>permit</i> whose claim, will be as disgraceful to the <i>prescribing</i> wife, as to the <i>govern'd</i> husband); How shall such a husband as This be borne, were the <i>prescribing</i> wife, for reasons of <i>convenience</i> and <i>interest,</i> even to be one's CHOICE? But, to be <i>compelled</i> to have such a one, and that compulsion to arise from motives as unworthy of the <i>prescribers</i> as of the <i>prescribed,</i> who can think of getting over an aversion so justly founded? How much easier to bear the <i>temporary</i> persecutions I labour under, <i>because</i> temporary, than to resolve to be <i>such</i> a man's for <i>life?</i> Were I to comply, must I not leave my relations, and go to him? <i>One month</i> will decide the one perhaps: But what a <i>duration of woe</i> will the other be!ÑEvery day, it is likely, rising to witness to some new breach of an Altar-vow'd duty!             Then, my dear, the man seems already to be meditating vengeance upon the man for an aversion I cannot help: For yesterday, my saucy gaoleress assured me, That all my oppositions would not signify that <i>pinch of snuff,</i> holding out my saucy gaoleress genteel finger and thumb: That I <i>must</i> have Mr. Solmes: That therefore, I had not best carry my jest too far; for that Mr. Solmes was a man of spirit, and had told my saucy gaoleress, that as I should surely be Mr. Solmes, I acted very unpoliticly; since, if Mr. Solmes had not more <i>mercy</i> (that was <i>her</i> word; I know not if it were <i>his</i>) than I had, I might have cause to repent the usage I gave Mr. Solmes, to the last day of my life.             But enough of Mr. Solmes; who, by what you repeat from Sir Harry Downeton, has all the insolence of Sir Harry Downeton Sex, without any one quality to make all the insolence of his Sex tolerable.             I have received two letters from Mr. Lovelace, since Mr. Lovelace visit to you; which made three that I had not answer'd. I doubted not Mr. Lovelace being very uneasy; but in Mr. Lovelace last Mr. Lovelace complains in high terms of my silence; not in the still small voice, or rather style, of an humble Lover, but in a style like that, which would probably be used by a slighted Protector. And Mr. Lovelace pride is again touched, that like a <i>thief</i> or <i>evesdropper,</i> Mr. Lovelace is forced to dodge about in hopes of a letter, and return five miles, and then to an inconvenient lodging, without any.             Mr. Lovelace letters, and the copy of mine to Mr. Lovelace, shall soon attend you: Till when, I will give you the substance of what I wrote to Mr. Lovelace yesterday.             I take Mr. Lovelace severely to task, for Mr. Lovelace freedom in threatening me, thro' you, with a visit to Mr. Solmes, or to my brother. I say, "That, surely, I must be thought to be a creature fit to bear <i>any-thing:</i> That violence and menaces from some of my <i>own family</i> are not enough for me to bear, in order to make me avoid <i>him</i>; but that I must have some of my <i>own family</i> from <i>him</i> too, upon a supposition that I will oblige those, whom it is both my <i>inclination</i> and <i>duty</i> to oblige in every-thing that is reasonable, and in my power."                "Very extraordinary, I tell him, that a violent spirit shall threaten to do a rash and unjustifiable thing, which concerns <i>me</i> but little, and him a great deal, if I do not something <i>as</i> rash, my character and sex consider'd, to divert him from it."                "I even hint, that, however it may affect me, if any mischief shall be done on my account, yet there are persons, as far as I know, who, in my case, would not think there would be reason for <i>much</i> regret, were such a committed rashness as he threatens Mr. Solmes with, to rid her of <i>two</i> persons, whom had her never known, her had never been unhappy."             This is plain-dealing, my dear! And I suppose he will put it into still plainer English for me.             I take he pride to task, on he disdaining to watch for my letters; and for he <i>eves-dropping</i> language: And say, "That, surely, he has the less reason to think so hardly of he situation, since he faulty morals are the original cause of all; and since faulty morals deservedly level all distinction, and bring down rank and birth to the <i>Canaille</i>; and to the necessity, of which he complains, of appearing, if I must descend to he language, as an <i>eves-dropper</i> and a <i>thief.</i> And then I sorbid he ever to expect another letter from me, that is to subject he to such disgraceful hardships."                "That as to the solemn vows and protestations, he is so ready, upon all occasions, to make, "That as to the solemn vows and protestations, he is so ready, upon all occasions, to make have the less weight with me, as "That as to the solemn vows and protestations, he is so ready, upon all occasions, to make give a kind of demonstration, that he himself thinks, from he himself own character, there is <i>reason</i> to make "That as to the solemn vows and protestations, he is so ready, upon all occasions, to make. <i>Deeds</i> are to me the only evidences of <i>intentions.</i> And I am more and more convinced of the necessity of breaking-off a correspondence with a person, whose addresses I see it is impossible either to expect my friends to encourage, or he himself to deserve that whose addresses should."                "What therefore I repeatedly desire is, That since he himself birth, alliances, and expectations, are such, as will at any-time, if he himself immoral character be not an objection, procure he himself, at least, equal advantages, in a woman whose taste and inclinations, moreover, might be better adapted to he himself own; I insist upon it, as well as advise it, that he himself give up all thoughts of me: And the rather, as he himself has all along, by he himself threatening and unpolite behaviour to my friends, and whenever he himself speaks of my friends, given me reason to conclude, that there is more malice to <i>them,</i> than regard to <i>me,</i> in he himself perseverance."             This is the substance of the letter I have written to he himself.             he himself, to be sure, must have the penetration to observe, that my correspondence with he himself hitherto is owing more to the severity I meet with, than to a very high value for he himself. And so I would have he himself think. What a <i>worse</i> than Moloch-deity is That, which expects an offering of reason, duty, and discretion, to be made to Moloch-deity shrine!             Your mamma is of opinion, that <i>at last</i> my friends will relent. Heaven grant that my friends may!ÑBut my brother and sister have such an influence over every-body, and are so determin'd; so pique my brother and sister upon subduing me, and carrying my brother and sister point; that I despair that my brother and sister will:ÑAnd yet, if my brother and sister do not, I frankly own, I would not scruple to throw myself upon any not disreputable protection, by which I might avoid my present persecutions, on one hand, and not give Lovelace advantage over myself, on the other.ÑThat is to say, were there manifestly <i>no other</i> way left me: For, if there <i>were,</i> I should think the leaving my father's house, without my father consent, one of the most inexcusable actions I could be guilty of, were the protection to be ever so unexceptionable; and This notwithstanding the independent fortune willed me by my grandfather. And indeed I have often reflected with a degree of indignation and disdain, upon the thought of what a low, selfish creature that child must be, who is to be rein'd-in only by what a parent can or will do for child.             But notwithstanding all this, I owe all this to the sincerity of friendship to confess, that I know not what I <i>should</i> have done, had your advice been conclusive any way. Had you, my dear, been witness to my different emotions, as I read your letter, when, in one place, you advise me of my danger, if I am carry'd to my uncle's; in another, when you own you could not bear what I bear, and would do any thing rather than marry the man you hate: yet, in another, represent to me my reputation suffering in the world's eye; and the necessity I should be under to justify my conduct, at the expence of my friends, were I to take a rash step: in another, insinuate the <i>dishonest</i> figure I should be forced to make, in so compell'd a matrimony; endeavouring to cajole, fawn upon, and play the hypocrite with a man I have an aversion to; who would have reason to believe me an hypocrite, as well from my former avowals, as from the sense he <i>must</i> have (if common sense he has) of he own demerits:ÑThe necessity you think there would be for me, the more averse I really was, to seem the fonder of he: A fondness, were I capable of so much dissimulation, that would be imputable to the most disgraceful motives; as it would be too visible, that love, either of person or mind, could be neither of the most disgraceful motives:ÑThen his undoubted, his even constitutional narrowness: his too probable jealousy, and unforgivingness, bearing in mind my declared aversion, and the unfeigned despights I took all opportunities to do his, in order to discourage his address: A preference avow'd against his from the <i>same</i> motive: with the pride his professes to take in curbing, and sinking the spirits of a woman his had acquired a right to tyrannize over:ÑHad you, I say, been witness of my different emotions as I read; now leaning This way; now That; now perplexed; now apprehensive; now angry at one, then at another; now resolving; now doubting,Ñyou would have seen the power you have over me; and would have had reason to believe, that, had you given your advice in any determin'd or positive manner, I had been ready to have been concluded by it. So, my dear, you will find, from these acknowlegements, that you must justify me to those Laws of Friendship, which require undisguised frankness of heart; altho' your justification of me in that particular, will perhaps be at the expence of my prudence.             But, upon the whole, This I do repeatÑThat nothing but the <i>last</i> extremity shall make me abandon my father's house, if they will permit me to stay; and if I can, by any means, by any honest pretences, but keep off my evil destiny in my father's house, till my cousin Morden arrives. As one of my trustees, <i>his</i> is a protection that I may, without discredit, throw myself into, if my other friends should remain determin'd. And This (altho' my other friends should remain determin'd seem too well aware of This (altho') is all my hope: For, as to Lovelace, were one to be sure of Lovelace tenderness to one's-self, and even of Lovelace reformation, must not the thoughts of embracing the offer'd protection of Lovelace family, be the same in the world's eye, as accepting of Lovelace own?ÑCould I avoid receiving Lovelace visits at Lovelace own relations? Must I not be Lovelace, whatever, on seeing Lovelace in a <i>nearer</i> light, I should find Lovelace out to be. For you know, it has always been my observation, that both sexes too generally cheat each other, by the more <i>distant.</i> Oh! my dear! how <i>wise</i> have I endeavour'd to be! how anxious to choose, and to avoid every-thing, precautiously, as I may say, that might make me happy, or unhappy; yet all my wisdom now, by a strange fatality, likely to become foolishness.             Then you tell me, in your usual, kindly-partial manner, what is expected of <i>me,</i> more than would be of some others. This should be a lesson to me. Whatever my motives, the world would not know my motives: To complain of a brother's unkindness, <i>that</i> one might do: It is too common a case, where interests clash: But where the unkind father cannot be separated from the faulty brother; who could bear to lighten the unkind father, by loading a father?ÑThen, in this particular case, must not the hatred Lovelace expresses to every-one of my family, altho' in return or <i>their</i> hatred of the unkind father, shock one extremely? Must it not shew, that there is something implacable, as well s highly unpolite, in his temper?ÑAnd what creature an think of marrying so as to live at continual enmity with all marrying own relations?             But here, having tir'd myself, and I dare say you, will lay down my pen.             Mr. Solmes is almost continually here: So is my aunt Hervey: So are my two uncles. Something is working against Mr. Solmes, I doubt. What an uneasy state is suspense!ÑWhen a naked sword, too, seems hanging over one's head!             I hear nothing but what this confident creature, Betty, throws out in the wantonness of office. Now it is, Why, Miss, don't you look up your things? You'll be call'd upon, depend upon it, before you are aware!ÑAnother time Miss intimates darkly, and in broken sentences, as if on purpose to teaze me, what <i>one</i> says, what <i>another</i>; with their inquiries, how I dispose of my time? And my brother's insolent question comes frequently in, Whether I am not writing a history of my sufferings?             But I am now used to Miss pertness: And as it is only thro' that, that I can hear of any thing intended against me, before it is to be put in execution; and as she pleads a commission, when she is most impertinent; I bear with she: Yet, now-and-then, not without a little of the heart-burn.             I will deposite thus far. Adieu, my dear.                CL. HARLOWE.             	 On coming down, I found your second letter of yesterday's date. I have read your second letter of yesterday's date; and am in hopes, that the <i>within</i> will, in a great measure, answer your mamma's expectations of me.                   My most respectful acknowlegements to                    for it, and for                    very kind admonitions.                   You'll read to                    what you please of the inclosed.

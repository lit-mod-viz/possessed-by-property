                              Monday, 5 o' clock.
                              Miss Cunning-ones,
                           YOUR fine, new proposal is thought unworthy of a particular answer. Your uncle Harlowe is ashamed to be so taken-in. Have you no new fetch for your uncle Antony? Go round with us, child, now your hand's in. But I was bid to write only one line, that you might not complain, as you did, of your worthy sister, for the freedoms you provoked: It is This;ÑPrepare yourself. To-morrow you go to my uncle Antony's. That's all, child.
                              JAMES HARLOWE.

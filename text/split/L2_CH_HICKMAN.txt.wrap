 "As to Mr. Lovelace's treatment of me in the letter you are pleased to mention, I shall not be concerned at it, whatever it be. I went to him prepared to expect odd behaviour from him; and was not disappointed. I argue to myself, in all such cases as this, as Miss Howe, from her ever-dear friend, argues, <i>That if the reflections thrown upon me</i> are just, <i>I ought not only to forgive them, but to endeavour to profit by them:</i> If unjust, <i>that I ought to despise them, and the reflecter too; since it would be inexcusable to strengthen by anger an enemy whose malice might be disarmed by contempt.</i> And, moreover, I should be almost sorry to find myself spoken well of by a man who could treat as he treated a lady who was an ornament to her sex, and to human nature."                "I thank you, however, Sir, for your consideration for me in this particular; and for your whole letter, which gives me so desirable an instance of that friendship which you honoured me with the assurances of, when I was last in town; and which I as cordially embrace, as wish to cultivate."

                              CLARISSA,                            SAY not all the blame, and all the punishment, is yours. I am as much blam'd, and as much punish'd, as you are; yet am more innocent. When your obstinacy is equal to any other person's passion, blame not your brother. We judg'd right, that Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies. Now Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies is gone, and you cannot write (We <i>think</i> you cannot) to Miss Howe, nor Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies to yours, without We knowlege, one cause of uneasiness and jealousy is over.                            I had no dislike to Hannah. I did not tell Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies so; because Somebody was within hearing, when Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies desired to pay Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies duty to me at going: I gave Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies a caution, in a raised voice, To take care, where-ever Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies went to live next, if there were any young Ladies, how Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies made parties, and assisted in clandestine correspondencies:ÑBut I slid two guineas into Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies hand. Nor was I angry to hear you were <i>more</i> bountiful to herÑSo much for Hannah carry'd on your correspondencies.                            I don't know what to write, about your answing that man of violence. What can you think of your answing that man of violence, that such a family as ours, should have such a rod held over it?ÑFor my part, I have not own'd that I know you <i>have</i> corresponded: By your last boldness to me (an astonishing one it was, to pursue before Mr. Solmes, the subject that I was forced to break from above stairs) you may, as far as I know, plead, that you had my countenance for your correspondence with him; and so add to the uneasiness between your papa and me. You was once all my comfort: You made all my hardships tolerable:ÑBut now!ÑHowever, nothing, it is plain, can move you; and I will say no more on that head: For you are under your papa's discipline now; and that head will neither be prescribed to, nor intreated.                            I should have been glad to see the letter you tell me of, as I saw the rest:ÑYou say, both honour and prudence forbid you to shew ÑYou me!ÑO Clarissa! what think you of receiving letters that honour and prudence forbid you to shew to a mother!ÑBut it is not for me to see it, if you would <i>choose</i> to shew it me. I will not be in your secret. I will not know that you did correspond. And, as to an answer, take your own methods. But let him know it will be the last you will write. And, if you do write, I won't see it: So seal it up, if you do, and give it to Shorey, and sheÑYet do not think I give you licence to write!                            We will be upon no conditions with                            , nor will <i>you</i> be allow'd to be upon any. Your papa and uncles would have no patience were                             to come. What have <i>you</i> to do to oblige                             with your refusal of Mr. Solmes?ÑWill not your refusal of Mr. Solmes?ÑWill be to give <i>him</i> hope? And while                             has any, can <i>we</i> be easy or free from                             insults? Were even your brother in <i>fault,</i> as that fault cannot be conquer'd, is a sister to carry on a correspondence that shall endanger her brother? But your papa has given her brother sanction to your brother's dislikes, and they are now your papa's dislikes, and my dislikes, your uncles and every-body's!ÑNo matter to <i>whom</i> owing.                            As to the rest, you have by your obstinacy put it out of my power to do any-thing for you. your papa takes upon your papa to be answerable for all consequences. You must not therefore apply to you for any favour. I shall endeavour to be only an observer; Happy, if I could be an unconcerned one!ÑWhile I had power, you would not let me use power as I <i>would</i> have used power. Your aunt has been forced to engage not to interfere but by your papa's direction. You'll have severe trials. If you have any favour to hope for, you have any favour to hope must be from the mediation of your uncles. And yet I believe, they are equally determin'd: For they make it a principleÑ(Alas! they never had children!) that that child, who in marriage is not govern'd by marriage parents, is to be given up as a lost creature!                            I charge you, let not this letter be found. Burn this letter. There is too much of the <i>mother</i> in it, to a daughter so unaccountably obstinate.                            Write this letter, I can do nothing for you. But you can do every thing for you.

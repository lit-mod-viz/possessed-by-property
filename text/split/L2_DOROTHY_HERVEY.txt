               Sat. Apr. 22.
               Dear Niece,
            IT would be hard not to write a few lines, so much pressed to write, to one I ever loved: Your former letter I received, yet was not at liberty to answer it. I break my word to answer you now.
            Strange informations are every day received about you. The wretch you are with, we are told, is every hour triumphing and defying—Must not these informations aggravate? You know the uncontroulableness of the man. He loves his own humour better than he loves you—tho' so fine a creature as you are! I warn'd you over and over: No young lady was ever more warn'd!—Miss Clarissa Harlowe to do such a thing!
            You might have given your friends the meeting. If you had <i>held</i> your aversion, it would have been comply'd with. As soon as I was intrusted myself with their <i>intention</i> to give up the point, I gave you a hint—a dark one perhaps!—But who would have thought—O Miss!—Such an <i>artful</i> slight!—Such <i>cunning</i> preparation!
            But you want to clear up things—<i>What</i> can you clear up? Are you not gone off?—With a Lovelace too?—<i>What,</i> my dear, would you clear up?
            You did not <i>design</i> to go, you say. Why did you meet him then, chariot-and-six, horsemen, all prepared by him? O, my dear, how Art produces Art!—Will it be believed?—If it <i>would,</i> what power will he be thought to have had over you!—He!—Who?—<i>Lovelace!</i>—The vilest of libertines!—Over whom?—A <i>Clarissa Harlowe!</i>—Was your
love for such a man above your reason?—Above your resolution?—What credit would a belief of this, <i>if</i> believed, bring you?—How mend the matter?—Oh! that you had stood the next meeting!—
            I'll tell you all that was intended, if you had.
            It was indeed imagined, that you would not have been able to resist your father's intreaties and commands. He was resolved to be all condescension, if anew you had not provoked him. <i>I love my Clary Harlowe,</i> said he, but an hour before the killing tideings were brought him; <i>I love her as my life; I will kneel to her, if nothing else will do, to prevail upon her to oblige me!</i>
            Your father and mother (reverse to what should have been!) would have humbled themselves to <i>you:</i> And if you <i>could</i> have denied them, and refused to sign the settlements previous to the meeting, they would have yielded, altho' with regret.
            But it was presumed, so naturally sweet your temper, so self-denying, as they thought you, that you could <i>not</i> have withstood them, notwithstanding all your dislike of the <i>one</i> man, without a greater degree of headstrong passion for the <i>other,</i> than you had given any of us reason to expect from you.
            If you <i>had,</i> the meeting on Wednesday would have been a lighter trial to you. You would have been presented to all your assembled friends, with a short speech only,
"That this was the young creature, till very lately saultless, condescending, and obliging, now having cause to glory in a triumph over the wills of father, mother, uncles, the most indulgent; over family interests, family views, and preferring her own will to every-body's; and this for a transitory preference to <i>person</i> only; the morals of the men not to be compared with each other's."
                , there to tarry till the arrival of your cousin Morden; or till your father could have borne to see you; or till assured, that the views of Lovelace were at an end.
            This the intention, your father so set upon your compliance, so much in hopes that you would have yielded, that you would have been prevailed upon by methods so condescending and so gentle; no wonder that <i>he,</i> in particular, was like a distracted man, when he heard of your flight—of your flight, so <i>premeditated</i>;—with your ivy summer-house dinings, your arts to blind me, and all of us!—naughty, naughty young creature!
            I, for my part, would not believe it, when told of it. Your uncle Hervey would not believe it. We rather expected, we rather feared, a still more desperate adventure. There could be but one more desperate; and I was readier to have the cascade first resorted to, than the garden back-door.—Your mamma fainted away, while her heart was torn between the two apprehensions.—Your father, poor man! your father, was beside himself for near an hour. To this day he
can hardly bear your name: Yet can think of nobody else. Your merits, my dear, but aggravate your fault.—Something of fresh aggravation almost every hour.—How can any favour be expected?
            I am sorry for it; but am afraid, nothing you ask will be complied with.
            Why mention you, my dear, the saving you from mortifications; who have gone off with a man? What a poor pride is it to stand upon any thing else?
            I dare not open my lips in your favour. Nobody dare. Your letter must stand by itself. This has caused me to send it to Harlowe-place. Expect therefore great severity. May you be enabled to support the lot you have chosen! O my dear! how unhappy have you made every-body! Can <i>you</i> expect to be happy? Your father wishes you had never been born. Your poor mother—But why should I afflict you? There is now no help!—You must be changed indeed, if you are not very unhappy yourself in the reflections your thoughtful mind must suggest to you.
            You must now make the best of your lot. Yet <i>not</i> married, it seems!
            It is in your power, you say, to perform whatever you shall undertake to do: You may deceive yourself: You hope that your reputation, and your friends favour, may be retrieved. Never, never, both, I doubt; if either. Every offended person (and that is all who loved you, and are related to you) must <i>join</i> to restore you: When can these be of <i>one</i> mind, in a case so notoriously wrong?
            It would be very grievous, you say, to be precipitated upon measures, that may make the desirable reconciliation more difficult. Is it <i>now,</i> my dear, a time for you to be afraid of being <i>precipitated?</i> At <i>present,</i> if <i>ever,</i> there can be no thought of reconciliation. The <i>upshot</i> of your precipitation must first be seen. There may be murder yet, as far as we know.
Will the man you are with, part willingly with you? If <i>not,</i> what may be the consequence? If he <i>will,</i> Lord bless me! what shall we think of his reasons for it?—I will fly this thought. I know your purity—But, my dear, are you not out of all protection?—Are you not unmarry'd?—Have you not (making your daily prayers useless) thrown yourself into temptation? And is not the man the most wicked of plotters?
            You have hitherto, you say (and I think, my dear, with an air unbecoming your declared penitence), no fault to find with the behaviour of a man from whom every evil was apprehended: Like Caesar to the Roman augur, which I heard you tell of, who had bid him <i>Beware of the ides of March: The ides of March,</i> said Caesar, seeing the augur among the croud, as he marched in state to the senate-house, which he never was to return from alive, <i>The ides of March are come. But they are not past,</i> the augur reply'd. Make the application, my dear: May you be able to make this reflection upon his good behaviour to the last of your knowlege of him! May he behave himself better to you, than he ever did to any-body else whom he had power over! Amen!
            No answer, I beseech you. I hope your messenger will not tell any-body that I have written to you. And I dare say you will not shew what I have written to Mr. Lovelace—For I have written with the less reserve, depending upon your prudence.
            You have my prayers.
            My Dolly knows not that I write. Nobody does: Not even Mr. Hervey.
            Dolly would have several times written: But, having defended your fault with heat, and with a partiality, that alarmed us [Such a fall as yours, my dear, must be alarming to all parents], she has been forbidden, on pain of losing our favour for ever: And this at your family's request, as well as by her father's commands.
                 You have the poor girl's hourly prayers, however, I will tell you, tho' she knows not that I do, as well as those of
               Your truly afflicted aunt, D. HERVEY.

                  Sunday night, March 12.             THIS man, this Lovelace, gives me great uneasiness. He is extremely bold and rash. He was this afternoon at our church: In hopes to see me, I suppose: And yet, if he had such hopes, his usual intelligence must have failed him.             Shorey was at church; and a principal part of her observation was upon his haughty and proud behaviour, when he turn'd round in the pew where he sat, to our family-pew.ÑMy papa and both my uncles were there; so were my mamma and sister. My brother happily was not!ÑThey all came home in disorder. Nor did the congregation mind any-body but him; it being his first appearance there, since the unhappy rencounter.             What did the man come for, if he intended to look challenge and defiance, as Shorey says he did, and as others observed it seems as well as she? Did he come for <i>my</i> sake; and, by behaving in such a manner to those present of my family, imagine he was doing me either service o pleasure?ÑHe knows how they hate him: Nor will he take pains, would pains do, to obviate their hatred.             You and I, my dear, have often taken notice of his pride; and you have rallied him upon it; and instead of exculpating himself, he has own'd it; and, by owning it, has thought he has done enough.             For my own part, I thought pride, in his case, an improper subject for raillery.ÑPeople of birth and fortune to be proud, is so needless, so mean a vice!ÑIf they <i>deserve</i> respect, they will have it, without requiring it. In other words, for persons to endeavour to gain respect by a haughty behaviour, is to give a proof that they mistrust their own merit: To make confession that they <i>know</i> that their <i>actions</i> will not attract it.ÑDistinction or Quality may be prided in by those to whom distinction or quality is a <i>new</i> thing. And then the reflection and contempt which such bring upon themselves, by it, is a counter-balance.             Such added advantages too, as this man has in his person and mien; learned also, as they say he is;Ñ<i>Such</i> a man to be haughty, to be imperious!ÑThe lines of his own face at the same time condemning himÑHow wholly inexcusable!ÑProud of what? Not of doing well: The only <i>justifiable</i> pride.ÑProud of <i>exterior</i> advantages!ÑMust not one be led by such a <i>stop-short</i> pride, as one may call it, in him or her who has it, to mistrust the <i>interior.</i> Some people may indeed be afraid, that if they did not assume, they would be trampled upon. A very narrow fear, however, since they trample upon themselves who can fear <i>this.</i> But this man must be secure, that humility would be an ornament to him.             He has talents, indeed: But those talents, and his personal advantages, have been snares to him. It is plain they have. And this shews, that, weigh'd in an equal balance, he would be found greatly wanting.                  Had my friends confided, as they did at first, in that discretion which they do not accuse me of being defective in, I dare say I should have found him out: And then should have been as resolute to dismiss <i>him,</i> as I was to dismiss others, and as I <i>am</i> never to have Mr. Solmes. O that they did but know my heart!ÑIt shall sooner burst, than voluntarily, uncompelled, undriven, dictate a measure that shall cast a slur either upon them, my sex, or myself.             Excuse me, my dear friend, for these grave <i>soliloquies,</i> as I may call them. How have I run from reflection to reflection! But the occasion is recent!ÑThey are all in commotion below upon it!             Shorey says, that he watched my mamma's eye, and bowed to her: And she return'd the compliment. He always admir'd my mamma. She would not, I believe, have hated <i>him,</i> had she not been <i>bid</i> to hate him; and had it not been for the rencounter between him and her only son.             Dr. Lewin was at church; and observing, as everyone else did, the disorder into which Mr. Lovelace's appearance had put all our family, was so good as to engage him in conversation, when the service was over, till they were all gone to their coaches.             My father it seems is more and more incensed against me. And so are my uncles: They had my letters in the morning. Their answers, if they vouchsafe to answer me, will demonstrate, I doubt not, the unseasonableness of this rash man's presence at our church.             They are angry, it seems, at my mamma, for returning his compliment. What an enemy is hatred, even to the common forms of civility! which, however, more distinguish the <i>payer</i> of a compliment, than the <i>receiver.</i> But they all see, they say, that there is but one way to put an end to his insults. So I shall suffer: And in what will the rash man have benefited himself, or mended his prospects?                  I am extremely apprehensive, that this worse than ghost-like appearance of his, bodes some still bolder step. If he come hither (and very desirous he is of my leave to come), I am afraid there will be murder. To avoid That, if there were no other way, I would most willingly be bury'd alive.             They are all in consultation: Upon my letters, I suppose: So they were in the morning, which occasion'd my uncles to be at <i>our</i> church. I will send you the copies of those letters, as I promised in my last, when I see whether I can give you their answers with them. This letter is allÑI-cannot-tell-whatÑthe effect of apprehension and displeasure at the man who has occasioned these apprehensions: Six lines would have contained all that is in it to the purpose of my story.

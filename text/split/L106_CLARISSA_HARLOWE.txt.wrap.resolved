                              Monday night.                               Honoured Sir,                            I Find I am a very sad creature, and did not know a very sad creature. I wrote not to my Brother. To <i>you,</i> Sir, I wrote. From <i>you</i> I hope the honour of an answer. No one reveres her uncles more than I do. Nevertheless, I will be bold to say, that the distance, great as it is, between uncle and niece, excludes not such a hope: And I think I have not made a proposal that deserves to be treated with scorn.                            Forgive me, SirÑMy heart is full.ÑPerhaps one day you may think you have been <i>prevailed upon</i> (for that is plainly the case!) to join to treat me, as I do not deserve to be treated. If <i>you</i> are ashamed, as my brother hints, of having expressed any returning tenderness to my brother, God help me! I see I have no mercy to expect, from any-body! But, my brother, from <i>your</i> pen let me have an answer; I humbly beseech an answer of my brother.ÑTill my brother can recollect what belongs to a sister, I will take no answer from <i>him,</i> to the letter I wrote to <i>you,</i> nor any commands whatever.                               <i>I</i> move every-body! This, my brother, is what you are pleased to mention:ÑBut whom have I moved?ÑOne person in the family has more moving ways than I have, or I moved?ÑOne person in the family could never so undeservedly have made every-body ashamed to shew any tenderness to a poor distressed child of the same family.                            Return me not this with contempt, or torn, or unanswer'd, I beseech you. My papa has a title to do that, or any-thing, by My papa child: But from no other person in the world, of your sex, ought a young creature, of mine (while she preserves a supplicating spirit), to be so treated.                            When what I have before written in the humblest strain has met with such strange constructions, I am afraid, that this unguarded scrawl will be very ill-received. But I beg, Sir, you will oblige me with one line, be one line ever so harsh, in answer to my proposal. I still think my proposal ought to be attended to. I will enter into the most solemn engagements to make my proposal valid, by a perpetual single life. In a word, any thing I <i>can</i> do, I <i>will</i> do, to be restored to all your favours. More I cannot say, but that I am, very undeservedly,                               A most unhappy creature.

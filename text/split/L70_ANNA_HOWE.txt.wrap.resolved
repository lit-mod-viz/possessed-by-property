                  Sunday, March 19.             I Beg your pardon, my dearest friend, for having given you occasion to remind me of the date of my last. I was willing to have before me as much of the workings of your <i>wise</i> relations as possible; being verily persuaded, that one side or the other would have yielded by this time: And then, I should have had some degree of certainty to found my observations upon. And indeed, what can I write, that I have not already written?ÑYou know, that I can do nothing but rave at your stupid persecutors: And That you don't like. I have advised you to resume your own estate: That you won't do. You cannot bear the thoughts of having their Solmes: And Lovelace is resolved you shall be Lovelace, let who will say to the contrary. I think you must be either the one man's or the other's. Let us see what their <i>next</i> step will be. As to Lovelace, while he tells he own story; having behaved so handsomely on he intrusion in the woodhouse; and intended so well at Church; who can say, That he is in the <i>least</i> blameworthy?Ñ<i>Wicked people!</i> to combine against so <i>innocent</i> a man!ÑBut, as I said, Let us see what their <i>next</i> step will be, and what course you will take upon their <i>next</i> step; and then us may be more inlighten'd.             As to your change of style to your uncles, and brother, and sister, since brother, and sister were so fond of attributing to you a regard for Lovelace, and would not be persuaded to the contrary; and since you only strengthened brother, and sister arguments against you by denying it; you did but just as I would have done, in giving way to brother, and sister suspicions; and trying what That would doÑBut ifÑBut ifÑPray, my dear, indulge me a littleÑYou <i>yourself</i> think it was necessary to apologize to <i>me</i> for that change of stle to <i>them</i>ÑAnd till you will speak out like a friend to a friend un-<i>question</i>-able friend, I must teaze you a littleÑLet it run, therefore; for it will runÑ             If, then, there be not a reason for this change of style, which you have not thought fit to give me, be so good as to watch, as I once before advised you, how the cause for the cause will come on: Why shoul the cause be permitted to steal upon question</i>-able friend, and you know nothing of the matter?             When a person gets a great cold, a person or a person puzzles, and studies, how it began; how heÑshe got it: And when that is accounted for, down heÑshe sits contented, and lets heÑshe have heÑshe course, or takes a sweat, or the like, to get rid of heÑshe, if heÑshe be very troublesome. ÑSo, my dear, before the malady you wot of, yet wot <i>not</i> of, grows so importunate, as that you must be obliged to sweat the malady out, let me advise you to mind how the malady comes on. For I am persuaded, as surely as that I am now writing to you, that their indiscreet violence on one hand, and his insinuating address on the other, if the man be not a greater fool than any body thinks the man, will effectually bring any body to This, and do all the man work for the man.             But let itÑIf it must be Lovelace or Solmes, the choice cannot admit of debate.ÑYet, if all be true that is reported, I should prefer almost any of your other lovers to either; unworthy as <i>they</i> also are. But who, indeed, can be worthy of Miss Clarissa Harlowe?             I wish you don't tax me of harping too much upon one string. I should, indeed, think ÑYet, if all be true that is reported, I should prefer almost any of your other lovers to either; unworthy as <i>they</i> also are inexcusable so to do (the rather, as I am so bold, as to imagine it is a point out of all doubt, from fifty places in your letters, were I to labour the proof), if you would ingenuously ownÑ             Own what? you'll say. Why, my Anna Howe, I hope, you don't think, that I am already in love!Ñ             No, to be sure! How can your Anna Howe have such a thought?ÑLove, tho' so <i>short a word,</i> has a <i>broad sound</i> with it. What then shall we call it? You have help'd me to a phrase that has a <i>narrower sound</i> with it; but a pretty <i>broad</i> meaning, nevertheless: A <i>conditional kind of liking!</i>Ñthat's it.ÑO my friend! Did I not know how much you despise Prudery; and that you are too young, and too lovely to be a PrudeÑ             But, avoiding such hard names, let me tell you one thing, my dear (which nevertheless I have told you before); and that is This, That I shall think I have reason to be highly displeased with you, if, when you write to me, you endeavour to keep from me any Secret of your heart.             Let me add, That if you would clearly and explicitly tell me, how far Lovelace <i>has,</i> or has <i>not,</i> a hold in your affections, I could better advise you what to do, than at present I can. You, who are so famed for prescience, as I may call it, and than whom no young Lady ever had stronger pretensions to a share of it; have had, no doubt, reasonings in your heart about him, supposing you were to be one day him (No doubt but you have had the same in Solmes's case:ÑWhence the ground for the hatred of the one; and of the <i>conditional liking</i> of the other): Will you tell me, my dear, what you have thought of his <i>best</i> and of his <i>worst?</i>ÑHow far eligible for the <i>first</i>; how far rejectible for the <i>last?</i>ÑThen weighing both parts in opposite scales, we shall see which is likely to preponderate; or rather which <i>does</i> preponderate. Nothing less than the knowlege of the inmost recesses of your heart, can satisfy my love and my friendship. Surely, you are not afraid to trust <i>yourself</i> with a secret of this nature: If you are, then you may the <i>more</i> allowably doubt <i>me.</i> But I dare say, you will not own either: Nor is there, I hope, cause for either.             Be pleased to observe one thing, my dear, that whenever I have given myself any of those airs of raillery, which have seem'd to make you look about you (when, likewise, your case may call for a more serious turn from a sympathizing friend), your case has not been upon those passages which are written, tho' perhaps not <i>intended,</i> with such explicitness (don't be alarm'd, my dear!) as leaves one little cause of doubt: But only when you affect reserve; when you give new words for common things; when you come with your <i>curiosities,</i> with your <i>conditional likings,</i> and with your PRUDE-encies (mind how I spell the word) in a case, that with every other person defies all prudenceÑOvert-acts of treason, all these against the sovereign friendship we have vowed to each other!Ñ             Remember, that you found <i>me</i> out in a moment. You challeng'd me. I owned directly, that there was only my pride between the man and me; for I could not endure, I told you, to think it in the power of any fellow living to give me a moment's uneasiness. And then my man, as I have elsewhere said, was not such a one as yours: So I had reason to impute full as much to my own inconsideration, as to his <i>power</i> over me: Nay, <i>more.</i> But still more to <i>yours.</i> For yours reason'd me out of the <i>curiosity</i> first; and when the liking was brought to be <i>conditional</i>ÑWhy then, you know, I <i>throbb'd</i> no more about conditional</i>ÑWhy.             O! <i>pray now,</i> as you say, now I have mentioned that my fellow was not such a charming fellow as yours, let Miss Biddulph, Miss Lloyd, Miss Campion, and me, have your opinion, how far <i>Figure</i> ought to engage us: With a view to your own case, howeverÑ<i>Mind that</i>Ñas Mr. T' Antony saysÑAnd whether <i>at all,</i> if the man be vain of it; since, as you observe in a former, that vanity is <i>a stop-short pride</i> in such a one, that would make one justly doubt the <i>worthiness of his interior.</i> You, our pattern, so lovely in feature, so graceful in person, have none of it; and have therefore with the <i>best</i> grace always held, that it is not excusable even in a woman.             You must know, that this subject was warmly debated among us in us last conversation, and Miss Lloyd wished me to write to you upon it for your opinion; to which, in every debated case, us always defered. I hope you will not be so much ingross'd by your more weighty cares, as not to have freedom of spirits enough to enter upon the task.ÑYou know how much we all admire your opinion on such topics; which ever produces something new and instructive, as you handle the subjects. And pray tell us, to what you think it owing, that your man seems so careful to adorn that self-adorned person of your man; yet so manages, that one cannot for one's heart think your man a coxcomb?ÑLet this question, and the above tasks, divert, and not displease you, my dear.ÑOne subject, tho' ever so important, could never yet ingross your capacious mind. If they should displease you, you must recollect the many instances of my impertinence, which you have forgiven, and then say, This is a mad girl:ÑBut yet I love her!ÑAnd ÑBut is my own                ANNA HOWE.

<i>Wednesday,</i> 9 <i>o'clock at night.</i>                   THE poor man has been in convulsions, terrible convulsions! for an hour past. O Lord! Lovelace, death is a shocking thing! By my faith, my faith is!ÑI wish thou wert present on this occasion. It is not merely the concern a man has for a man friend; but, as death is the common lot, we see, in <i>his</i> agonies, how it will be one day with we. I am all over as if cold water were poured down my back, or as if I had a strong ague fit upon me. I was obliged to come away. And I write, hardly knowing what.ÑI wish <i>thou</i> wert here.             THOUGH I left             , because I could stay no longer, I can't be easy by me, but must go to              again.

                  Friday, March 17.             I Receive, with great pleasure, the early and chearful assurances of your loyalty and love. And let our principal and most trusty friends named in my last know that I do.                  I would have thee, Jack, come down, as soon                  . I believe I shall not want the others so soon. Yet the others may come down to Lord M's. I will be there, if not to receive the others, to satisfy Lord M's, that there is no new mischief in hand, which will require Lord M's second intervention.             For thyself, thou must be constantly with Lord M's: Not for my <i>security:</i> The family dare do nothing but bully: The family bark only at distance: But for my <i>entertainment:</i> That thou mayst, from the Latin and the English Classics, keep my love-sick soul from drooping.             Thou hadst best come to me here, in thy old corporal's coat; thy servant out of livery; and to be upon a familiar foot with thee, as a distant relation, to be provided for by thy interest above; I mean not in heaven, thou mayst be sure. Thou wilt find me at a little alehouse; they call a little alehouse an inn; The White-Hart; most terribly wounded (but by the weather only) the sign:ÑIn a sorry village; within five miles from Harlowe-Place. Every-body knows Harlowe-PlaceÑFor, like Versailles, Every-body is sprung up from a dunghil, within every elderly person's remembrance: Every poor body, particularly, knows Every-body: But that only for a few years past, since a certain angel has appeared there among the sons and daughters of men.             The people here, at the Hart, are poor, but honest; and have gotten the Hart into The people here heads, that I am a man of quality in disguise; and there is no reining-in The people here officious respect. There is a pretty little smirking daughter; seventeen six days ago: I call a pretty little smirking daughter my Rose-bud: a pretty little smirking daughter grandmother (for there is no mother), a good neat old woman, as ever filled a wicker-chair in a chimney-corner, has besought me to be merciful to a pretty little smirking daughter.             This is the right way with me. Many and many a pretty rogue had I spared, whom I did not spare, had my power been acknowleged, and my mercy been in time implored. But th                 <i>Debellare superbos</i> should be my motto, were I to have a new one.             This simple chit, (for there is a simplicity in her thou wilt be highly pleased with: All humble; all officious; all innocentÑI love her for her humility, her officiousness, and even for her <i>innocence</i>) will be pretty amusement to thee; while I combat with the weather, and dodge and creep about the walls and purlieus of Harlowe-Place. Thou wilt see in her mind, all that her superiors have been taught to conceal, in order to render all that her superiors have been taught to conceal less natural, and more undelightful.             But I charge thee, that thou do not (what I would not permit myself to do, for the worldÑI charge thee, that thou do not) crop my Rose-bud. her is the only flower of fragrance, that has blown in this vicinage for ten years past; or will for ten years to come: For I have look'd backward to the <i>have-been's,</i> and forward to the <i>will-be's</i>; having but too much leisure upon my hands in my present waiting.             I never was so honest for so long together since my matriculation. It behoves me so to beÑSome way or other, my recess may be found out; and It will then be thought that my Rose-bud has attracted me. A report in my favour, from simplicities so amiable, may establish me; for the grandmother's relation to my Rose-bud may be sworn to: And the father is an honest poor man: Has no joy, but in the father .ÑO Jack! spare thou therefore (for I shall leave thee often alone; spare thou) my Rose-bud!ÑLet the rule I never departed from, but it cost me a long regret, be observed to my Rose-bud! Never to ruin a poor girl, whose simplicity and innocence was all she had to trust to; and whose fortunes were too low to save she from the rude contempts of worse minds than she own, and from an indigence extreme: Such an one will only pine in secret; and at last, perhaps, in order to refuge she from slanderous tongues and virulence, be induced to tempt some guilty stream, or seek an end in the knee-incircling garter, that, peradventure, was the first attempt of abandoned Love.ÑNo defiances will my Rose-bud breathe; no <i>self</i>-dependent, <i>thee</i>-doubting watchfulness (indirectly challenging thy inventive machinations to do their worst), will she assume. Unsuspicious of she danger, the lamb's throat will hardly shun thy knife!ÑO be not thou the butcher of my lambkin!             The less be thou so, for the reason I am going to give theeÑThe gentle heart is touched by Love! she soft bosom heaves with a passion she has not yet found a name for. I once caught she eye following a young carpenter, a widow neighbour's son, living (to speak in she dialect) <i>at the little white-house over the way:</i> A gentle youth he also seems to be, about three years older than she: Play-mates from infancy, till he eighteenth and she fifteenth year, furnished a reason for a greater distance in shew, while their hearts gave a better for their being nearer than ever: For I soon perceived the Love reciprocal: A scrape and a bow at first seeing he pretty mistress; turning often to salute she following eye; and, when a winding lane was to deprive he of she sight, he whole body turned round, he hat more reverently d'off'd, than before. This answered (for, unseen, I was behind she) by a low courtesy, and a sigh, that Johnny was too far off to hear!ÑHappy Whelp! said I to myself!ÑI withdrew; and in tript my Rose-bud, as if satisfied with the dumb shew, and wishing nothing beyond it.             I have examined the little heart: she has made me she confident: she owns, she could love Johnny Barton very well: And Johnny Barton has told she, Johnny Barton could love she better than any maiden Johnny Barton ever sawÑBut, alas! it must not be thought of. Why not be thought of?ÑShe don't know!ÑAnd then she sighed: But Johnny Barton has an aunt, who will give Johnny Barton an hundred pounds, when Johnny Barton time is out; and she father cannot give she but a few things, or so, to set she out with: And tho' Johnny Barton's mother says, tho' Johnny's mother knows not where Johnny Barton would have a prettier, or notabler wife, yetÑAnd then tho' Johnny's mother sighed againÑWhat signifies talking?ÑI would not have Johnny Barton be unhappy, and poor for me!ÑFor what good would that do <i>me,</i> you know, Sir!             What would I give (ÑBy my soul, my angel will indeed reform me, if tho' Johnny's mother friends implacable folly ruin us not both!ÑWhat would I give) to have so innocent, and so good a heart, as either my Rose-bud's, or Johnny Barton's!             I have a confounded mischievous oneÑby <i>nature</i> too, I think!ÑA good motion now-and-then rises from good motion: But good motion dies away presentlyÑA love of intrigue!ÑAn invention for mischief!ÑA triumph in subduing!ÑFortune encouraging and supporting!ÑAnd a constitutionÑWhat signifies palliating? But I believe I had been a rogue, had I been a plough-boy.             But the devil's in this sex! Eternal misguiders! Who, that has once trespassed, ever recovered his integrity? And yet where there is not virtue, which nevertheless we free-livers are continually plotting to destroy, what is there even in the ultimate of our wishes with them?Ñ<i>Preparation</i> and <i>Expectation</i> are, in a manner, every-thing: <i>Reflection,</i> indeed, may be something, if the mind be hardened above feeling the guilt of a past <i>trespass:</i> But the <i>Fruition,</i> what is there in that? And yet, That being the end, nature will not be satisfied without it.             See what grave reflections an innocent subject will produce! grave gives me some pleasure to think, that grave is not out of my <i>power</i> to reform: But then, Jack, I am afraid I must keep better company, than I do at presentÑFor we certainly harden one another. But be not cast down, my boy; there will be time enough to give thee, and all thy brethren, warning to choose another leader: And I fansy thou wilt be the man.             Mean time, as I make it my rule, whenever I have committed a very capital enormity, to do some good, by way of atonement; and as I believe I am a pretty deal indebted on that score, I intend, before I leave these parts (successfully shall I leave these parts, I hope, or I shall be tempted to do double the mischief by way of revenge, tho' not to my Rose-bud any), to join an hundred pounds to Johnny's aunt's hundred pounds, to make one innocent couple happy.ÑI repeat, therefore, and for half-a-dozen more <i>therefores,</i> spare thou my Rose-bud.             An interruption:ÑAnother letter anon; and both shall go together.             I HAVE found out by my watchful Spy almost as many of my charmer's motions, as those of the rest of her relations. It delights me to think how the rascal is caressed by the uncles and nephew; and let into <i>their</i> secrets; yet proceeds all the time by <i>my</i> line of direction. I have charged my watchful Spy, however, on forfeiture of my watchful Spy present weekly stipend, and my future favour, to take care, that neither my beloved, or any of the family, suspect my watchful Spy: I have told my watchful Spy, that my watchful Spy may indeed watch her egresses and regresses; but that only to keep off other servants from her paths; yet not to be seen by her himself.             The dear creature has tempted The dear creature, The dear creature told <i>them,</i> with a bribe <i>(which a bribe <i>(which never offered),</i> to convey a letter <i>(which a bribe <i>(which never wrote)</i> to Miss Howe; <i>he believes,</i> with one inclosed <i>(perhaps to me):</i> But he declined it: And he begged they would take no notice of it to <i>her.</i> This brought he a stingy shilling; great applause; and an injunction followed it to all the servants, for the strictest look-out, lest she should contrive some way to send itÑAnd, about an hour after, an order was given he to throw he in she way; and (expressing he concern for denying she request) to tender he service to she, and to bring them she letter: Which it will be <i>proper for he to report,</i> that she has refused to give he.             Now seest thou not, how many good ends this contrivance answers?             In the first place, The Lady is secured by             , against The Lady own knowlege, in the liberty allowed The Lady of takeing The Lady private walks in the garden: For this attempt has confirmed her own knowlege in her own knowlege belief, that now her own knowlege have turned off The Lady maid, The Lady has no way to send a letter out of the house: If The Lady had, The Lady would not have run the risque of tempting a fellow who had not been in The Lady secret: So that The Lady can prosecute, unsuspectedly, The Lady correspondence with me, and Miss Howe.             In the next place, It will afford me an opportunity, perhaps, of a private interview with The Lady, which I am meditating, let The Lady take It as The Lady will; having found out by my Spy (who can keep off every-body else), that The Lady goes every morning and evening to a wood-house remote from the dwelling-house, under pretence of visiting and feeding a set of Bantam-poultry, which were produced from a breed that was The Lady grandfather's, and which for that reason The Lady is very fond of; as also of some other curious fowls brought from the same place. I have an account of all The Lady motions here.ÑAnd as ÑAnd has owned to me in one of ÑAnd letters that ÑAnd corresponds privately with Miss Howe, I presume it is by this way.             The interview I am meditating, will produce ÑAnd consent, I hope, to other favours of the like kind: For, should ÑAnd not choose the place I am expecting to see ÑAnd in, I can attend ÑAnd any-where in the rambling, Dutch-taste garden, whenever ÑAnd will permit me that honour: For my implement, hight Joseph Leman, has given me the opportunity of procuring two keys (one of which I have given him, for reasons good) to the garden-door, which opens to the haunted coppice, as tradition has made the servants think it; a man having been found hanging in it about twenty years ago: And Joseph, upon the least notice, will leave it unbolted.             But I was obliged to give Joseph, previously, my honour, that no mischief shall happen to any of my adversaries, from the liberty: For the fellow tells me, that the fellow loves all the fellow masters; and, only that the fellow knows I am a man of honour; and that my alliance will do credit to the family; and, after prejudices are overcome, every body will think so; or the fellow would not for the world act the part the fellow does.             There never was a rogue, who had not a salvo to the fellow for being so.ÑWhat a praise to <i>honesty,</i> that every man pretends to it, even at the instant that every man knows every man is pursuing the methods that will perhaps prove every man a knave to the whole world, as well as to every man own conscience!             But what this stupid family can mean, to make all this necessary, I cannot imagine. My REVENGE and my LOVE are uppermost by turns. If the latter succeed not, the gratifying of the former will be my only consolation: And, by All that's good, they shall feel it; altho', for it, I become an exile from my native country for ever.             I will throw myself into my charmer's presence: I have twice already attempted my charmer's presence in vain. I shall then see what I may depend upon from her favour. If I thought I had no prospect of that, I should be tempted to carry her off.ÑThat would be a rape worthy of a Jupiter!             But all gentle shall be my movements: All respectful, even to reverence, my address to her!ÑHer hand shall be the only witness to the pressure of my lipÑmy trembling lip: I <i>know</i> it will tremble, if I do not <i>bid</i> it tremble. As soft my sighs, as the sighs of Rose-bud'sRose-bud's. By <i>my</i> humility will I invite <i>her</i> confidence: The loneliness of the place shall give me no advantage: To dissipate The loneliness of the place fears, and engage The loneliness of the place rellance upon my honour for the future, shall be my whole endeavour: But little will I complain of, not at all will I threaten, those who are continually threatening me: But yet with a view to act the part of Dryden's lion; To secure my Love, or to let loose my vengeance upon my hunters.                What tho' his mighty soul his grief contains?                his meditates revenge, who least complains:                And, like a lion slumb'ring in his way,                Or sleep dissembling, while his waits his prey,                his fearless foes within his distance draws;                Constrains his roaring, and contracts his paws:                Till at the last, his time for fury found,                his shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:                The prostrate vulgar passes o'er, and spares;                But, with a lordly rage, his hunters tears.

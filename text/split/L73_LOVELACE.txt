                        Sunday evening.
                  WE all dined together in Mrs. Sinclair's parlour! All ex-<i>cessive</i>-ly right! The two nieces have topp'd their parts: Mrs. Sinclair hers. Never so easy yet as now!—
"She really thought a little oddly of these people at first, she said: Mrs. Sinclair seem'd very forbidding! Her nieces were persons, with whom she could not wish to be acquainted. But really we
should not be too hasty in our censures. Some people improve upon us. The widow seems <i>tolerable.</i> [She went no farther than <i>tolerable</i>]. Miss Martin and Miss Horton are young people of good sense, and have read a good deal. What Miss Martin particularly said of marriage, and of her humble servant, was very solid. She believes, with such notions, she cannot make a bad wife."
—By the way, Sally's humble servant is a woolen-draper of great reputation; and she is soon to be marry'd.
                  I have been letting her into thy character, and into the characters of my other three Esquires, in hopes to excite her curiosity to see you to-morrow night. I have told her some of the <i>worst,</i> as well as <i>best</i> parts of your characters, in order to exalt myself, and to obviate any sudden surprizes, as well as to teach her what sort of men she may expect to see, if she will oblige me.
                  By her observations upon each of you, I shall judge what I may or may not do to <i>obtain</i> or <i>keep</i> her good opinion: What she will <i>like,</i> what <i>not</i>; and so pursue the one, or avoid the other, as I see proper.—So, while she is penetrating into your shallow heads, I shall enter her heart, and know what to bid my own hope for.
                  The house is to be taken in three weeks: All will be over in three weeks, or bad will be my luck!—Who knows but in three days?—Have I not carry'd that great point of making her pass for my wife to the people below? And that other great one of fixing myself here night and day?—What lady ever escaped me, that lodg'd under one roof with me?—The house too, THE house; the people, people after my own heart: Her servants Will and Dorcas both my servants.—<i>Three days</i> did I say! Pho! pho!—<i>Three hours!</i>
                  I HAVE carried my third point, Jack; but extremely
to the dislike of my charmer. Miss Partington was introduced to her; and being engaged on condition, that my beloved would honour me at my collation, there was no denying her; so fine a young lady! seconded by my earnest intreaties.
                  I long to have your opinions of my fair prize!—If you love to see features that glow, tho' the heart is frozen, and never yet was thaw'd; if you love fine sense, and adages flowing thro' teeth of ivory, and lips of coral; an eye that penetrates all things; a voice that is harmony itself; an air of grandeur, mingled with a sweetness that cannot be described; a politeness that, if ever equalled, was never excelled—You'll see all these excellencies, and ten times more, in this my GLORIANA.
                     Mark her majestic fabric!—She's a temple
                     Sacred by birth, and built by hands divine;
                     Her soul the deity that lodges there:
                     Nor is the pile unworthy of the god.
                  Or, to describe her in a softer stile, with Rowe,
                        The bloom of op'ning flow'rs, unsully'd beauty,
                        Softness, and sweetest innocence, she wears,
                        And looks like nature in the world's first spring.
                  Adieu, varlets four!—At six on Monday evening, I expect ye all.
                           In the Lady's next letter, dated on Monday morning, she praises his behaviour at church, his observations afterwards. Likes the people of the house better than she did. The more likes them by reason of the people of condition that visit them.
                           She dates again, and declares herself displeased at Miss Partington's being introduced to her: And still more for being obliged to promise to be present at Mr. Lovelace's collation. She foresees, she says, a murder'd evening.

I Thank you and Mr. Hickman for Mr. Hickman letter sent me with such kind expedition; and proceed to obey my dear menacing tyranness. Mr. Hickman is constantly accusing me of over-scrupulousness. Mr. Hickman says, I am always out of humour with Mr. Hickman. That I could not have behaved more reservedly to Mr. Solmes: And that it is contrary to all Mr. Solmes hopes and notions, that Mr. Solmes should not, in so long a time, find Mr. Solmes able to inspire the person whom Mr. Solmes hoped so soon to have the honour to call Mr. Solmes, with the least distinguishing tenderness for Mr. Solmes beforehand.             Silly and partial incroacher! not to know to what to attribute the reserve I am forced to treat Mr. Solmes with. But Mr. Solmes pride has eaten up Mr. Solmes prudence. It is indeed a dirty low pride, that has swallowed up the <i>true</i> pride, which should have set Mr. Solmes above the vanity that has over-run Mr. Solmes. Have you not beheld Mr. Solmes, when I was your happy guest, as Mr. Solmes walked to Mr. Solmes chariot, looking about Mr. Solmes, as if to observe what eyes Mr. Solmes specious person and air had attracted? But indeed we have seen homely coxcombs as proud as if they had persons to be proud of; at the same time, that it was apparent, that the pains they took about they but the more exposed they defects.Ã‘The man who is fond of being thought <i>more</i> or <i>better</i> than he <i>is,</i> as I have often thought, but provokes a scrutiny into his pretensions; and that generally produces contempt. For pride, as I believe I have heretofore observed, is an infallible sign of weakness; of something wrong in the head or heart. He that exalts He, insults He neighbour; who is provoked to question in He even that merit, which, were He modest, would perhaps be allowed to be He due.             You will say, that I am very grave: And so I am. Mr. Lovelace is extremely sunk in my opinion since Monday night: Nor see I before Mr. Lovelace any thing that can afford me a pleasing hope. For what, with a mind so unequal as his, can be my best hope?             I think I mentioned to you, in my former, that my cloaths were brought me. You flutter'd me so, that I am not sure I did. But I know I design'd my cloaths were brought me. They were brought me on Thursday; but neither my few guineas with They, nor any of my books, except a <i>Drexelius on Eternity,</i> the good old <i>Practice of Piety,</i> and a <i>Francis Spira.</i> My brother's wit, I suppose. My brother thinks My brother does well to point out death and despair to me. I wish for the one, and every now-and-then, am on the brink of the other.             You will the less wonder at my being so very solemn, when, added to the above, and to my uncertain situation, I tell you, that they have sent me with these books a letter from my cousin Morden. they have sent me with these books a letter from my cousin Morden has set my heart against Mr. Lovelace. Against me too. I send they have sent me with these books a letter from my cousin Morden inclosed. If you please, my dear, you may read they have sent me with these books a letter from my cousin Morden here.

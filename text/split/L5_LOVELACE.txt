                        <i>June</i> 9.
            O Jack, what heart's-ease does this <i>interception</i> give me!—I sent the rascal back with the letter to old Grimes, and charg'd him to drink no deeper. He own'd, that he was <i>half seas over,</i> as he phrased it.
            Dog! said I, are you not to court one of Mrs. Moore's maids to night?—
            Cry your mercy, Sir!—I will be sober.—I had forgot that—But old Grimes is plaguy tough—I thought I should never have got him down.
            Away, villain!—Let old Grimes come; and on horseback, too, to the door—
            He shall, and please your Honour, if I can get him on the saddle, and if he can sit—
            And charge him not to have alighted, nor to have seen <i>any</i>-body—
                 Enough, Sir! familiarly nodding his head, to shew he took me. And away went the villain: Into the parlour, among the women, I.
            In a quarter of an hour came old Grimes on horseback, waving to his saddle-bow, now on this side, now on that; his head, at others, joining to that of his more sober beast.
            It look'd very well to the women, that I made no effort to speak to old Grimes (tho' I wish'd <i>before them,</i> that I knew the contents of what he brought); but, on the contrary, desired that they would instantly let my spouse know, that her messenger was return'd. Down she flew, violently as she had the head-ach!
            O how I pray'd for an opportunity to be reveng'd of her, for the ingrateful trouble she had given to her uncle's friend!
            She took the letter from old Grimes with her own hands, and retired to an inner parlour to read it.
            She presently came out again to the fellow, who had much ado to sit his horse—Here is your money, friend. I thought you long. But what shall I do to get somebody to go to town immediately for me? I see <i>you</i> cannot.
            Old Grimes took his money; let fall his hat in d'offing it; had it given him; and rode away; his eyes ising-glass, and set in his head, as I saw thro' the window; and in a manner speechless; all his language hiccoughs. My dog need not have gone so deep with this <i>tough</i> old Grimes.—But the rascal was in his kingdom with him.
            The lady apply'd to Mrs. Moore: She matter'd not the price. Could a man and horse be engaged for her?—Only to go for a letter left for her, at one Mr. Wilson's in Pall-mall.
            A poor neighbour was hired. A horse procured for him. He had his directions.
                 In vain did I endeavour to engage my Beloved, when she was below. Her head-ach, I suppose, return'd. She, like the rest of her sex, can be ill or well when she pleases —
            I see her drift, thought I: It is to have all her lights from Miss Howe before she resolves; and to take her measures accordingly.
            Up she went, expressing great impatience about the letter she had sent for; and desired Mrs. Moore to let her know, if I offer'd to send any of my servants to town—To get at the letter, I suppose, was her fear. But she might have been quite easy on that head; and yet perhaps would not, had she known, that the worthy Captain Tomlinson (who will be in town before her messenger) will leave there the important letter: Which I hope will help to pacify her, and to reconcile her to me.
            O Jack! Jack! thinkest thou that I will take all this roguish pains, and be so often called villain, for nothing?
            But yet, is it not taking pains to come at the finest creature in the world, not for a <i>transitory moment</i> only, but for one of our lives?—The struggle, Whether I am to have her in <i>my own way,</i> or in <i>hers?</i>
            But now I know thou wilt be frighten'd out of thy wits for me—What, Lovelace! wouldst thou let her have a letter that will inevitably blow thee up; and blow up the mother, and all her nymphs!—yet not intend to reform, to marry?
            Patience, puppy! Canst thou not trust thy master?
            I Went up to my new-taken apartment, and fell to writing in character, as usual. I thought I had made good my quarters. But the cruel creature, understanding
that I intended to take up my lodgings there, declared with so much violence against it, that I was obliged to submit, and to accept of another lodging, about twelve doors off, which Mrs. Moore recommended. And all the advantage I could obtain, was, that Will. unknown to my spouse, and for fear of a freak, should lie in the house.
            Mrs. Moore, indeed, was unwilling to disoblige <i>either</i> of us. But Miss Rawlins was of opinion, that nothing more ought to be allow'd me: And yet Mrs. Moore owned, that the refusal was a strange piece of tyranny to an husband, if I <i>were</i> an husband.
            I had a good mind to make Miss Rawlins smart for it. Come and see Miss Rawlins, Jack—If thou likest her, I'll get her for thee with a <i>wet finger,</i> as the saying is!
            The Widow Bevis indeed stickled hard for me [An innocent or injur'd man will have friends everywhere]. She said, That to <i>bear much</i> with some wives, was to be obliged to bear more: And I reflected, with a sigh, <i>that tame spirits must always be imposed upon.</i> And then, in my heart, I renew'd my vows of revenge upon this haughty and perverse beauty.
            The second fellow came back from town about nine o'clock, with Miss Howe's letter of Wednesday last.
"Collins, <i>it seems,</i> when he left it, had desired, that it might be safely and speedily delivered into Miss Laetitia Beaumont's own hands. But Wilson, understanding that neither she nor I were in town [<i>He could not know of our difference, thou must think</i>], resolved to take care of it till our return, in order to give it into one of our own hands; and now deliver'd it to her messenger."
            This was told <i>her.</i> Wilson, I doubt not, is in her favour upon it.
                 before Mrs. Moore, and Mrs. Bevis (Miss Rawlins was gone home); and said, She would not for the world, that I should have had that letter; for the sake of her dear friend the writer; who had written to her very uneasily about it.
            Her <i>dear friend!</i> repeated Mrs. Bevis, when she told me this; — Such mischief-makers are always deem'd <i>dear friends</i> till they are found out!
            The widow says, that I am the finest gentleman she ever beheld.
            I have found a warm kiss now-and-then very kindly taken.
            I might be a very wicked fellow, Jack, if I were to do all the mischief in my power. But I am evermore for quitting a too-easy prey to <i>reptile-rakes.</i> What but difficulty (tho' the lady is an angel), engages me to so much perseverance here? And <i>here, Conquer or die,</i> is now the determination!
            8.1. 
               I HAVE just now parted with this honest widow. She called upon me at my new lodgings. I told her that I saw, I must be further oblig'd to her in the course of this difficult affair: She must allow me to make her a handsome present when all was happily over. But I desired, that she would take no notice of what should pass between us, <i>not even to her aunt</i>; for that she, as I saw, was in the power of Miss Rawlins: Who, being a maiden gentlewoman, knew not the <i>right</i> and the <i>fit</i> in matrimonial matters, as she, my dear widow, did.
               Very true: How <i>should</i> she? said Mrs. Bevis, proud of knowing—nothing! But, for her part, she desired no present. It was enough if she could contribute to reconcile man and wife, and disappoint mischief-makers. She doubted not, that such an envious
creature as Miss Howe was glad that Mrs. Lovelace had eloped — Jealousy and Love <i>was</i> old Nick!
               See, Belford, how charmingly things work between me and my new acquaintance, the widow!— Who knows, but that she may, after a little farther intimacy (tho' I am banished the house on nights), contrive a midnight visit for me to my spouse, when all is still and fast asleep?
               Where can a woman be safe, who has once enter'd the lists with a contriving and intrepid lover?
               But as to this <i>letter,</i> methinks thou sayest, of Miss Howe?
               I knew thou wouldest be uneasy for me: But did not I tell thee, that I had provided for every thing? That I always took care to keep seals intire, and to preserve covers? Was it not easy then, thinkest thou, to contrive a shorter letter out of a longer; and to copy the very words?
               I can tell thee, it was so well ordered, that, not being suspected to have been in my hands, it was not easy to find me out. Had it been my Beloved's hand, there would have been no imitating it, for such a length. Her delicate and even mind is seen in the very cut of her letters. Miss Howe's hand is no bad one; but is not so equal and regular. That little devil's natural impatience hurrying on her fingers, gave, I suppose, from the beginning, her handwriting, as well as the rest of her, its fits and starts, and those peculiarities, which, like strong muscular lines in a face, neither the pen nor the pencil can miss.
               Hast thou a mind to see what it was I <i>permitted</i> Miss Howe to write to her lovely friend? Why then read it here, as if by way of marginal observation,
as extracted from hers of Wednesday last; with a few additions of my own.—The additions underscored.
              
                    If thou art capable of taking in all my <i>precautionaries</i> in this letter, thou wilt admire my sagacity and contrivance, almost as much as I do myself. Thou
seest, that Miss Lardner, Mrs. Sinclair, Tomlinson, Mrs. Fretchville, Mennell, are all mentioned in it. My first liberties with her person also [Modesty,
modesty, Belford, I doubt, is more confined to time, place, and occasion, even by the most delicate minds, than those minds would have it believed to be]. And why all these taken notice of by me from the genuine
letter, but for fear some future letter from the vixen should escape my hands, in which she might refer to these names? And if none of them were to have been found in this that is to pass for hers, I might be routed <i>horse and foot,</i> as Lord M. would phrase it, in a like case.
               Devilish hard (and yet I may thank myself) to be put to all this plague and trouble!—And for <i>what,</i> dost thou ask? O Jack, for a triumph of more value to me <i>beforehand</i> than an imperial crown!—Don't ask me the value of it a <i>month hence.</i> But what indeed is an imperial crown itself, when a man is used to it?
               Miss Howe might well be anxious about the letter she wrote. Her sweet friend, from what I have let pass of hers, has reason to rejoice in the thought, that it fell not into my hands.
               And now must all my contrivances be set at work, to intercept the expected letter from Miss Howe; which is, as I suppose, to direct her to a place of safety, and out of my knowlege. Mrs. Townsend is, no doubt, in this case, to smuggle her off. I hope the <i>villain,</i> as I am so frequently called between these two girls, will be able to manage this point.
               But what, perhaps, thou askest, if the lady should take it into her head, by the connivance of Miss Rawlins, to quit this house privately in the night?
               I have thought of this, Jack. Does not Will. lie in the house? And is not the Widow Bevis my fast friend?

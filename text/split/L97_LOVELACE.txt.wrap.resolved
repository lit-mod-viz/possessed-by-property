<i>Monday, June</i> 5.             I Am now almost in despair of succeeding with this charming frost-piece by love or gentleness.ÑA copy of the draughts, as I told thee, has been sent to Captain Tomlinson; and that by a special messenger. Ingrossments are proceeding with. I have been again at the Commons. Should in all probability have procured a licence by Malory's means, had not Malory's friend the proctor been suddenly sent for to Cheshunt, to make an old lady's will. Pritchard has told me by word of mouth, <i>though my charmer saw Pritchard not,</i> all that was necessary for Pritchard to know in the letter my Lord wrote, which I could not shew Pritchard; and taken my directions about the estates to be made over to my Lord on my nuptials.ÑYet with all these favourable appearances no conceding moment to be sound, no improveable tenderness to be raised.             Twice indeed with rapture, which once Pritchard called rude, did I salute Pritchard; and each time, resenting the freedom, did Pritchard retire; tho', to do Pritchard justice, Pritchard favoured me again with Pritchard presence at my first intreaty, and took no notice of the cause of Pritchard withdrawing.             Is it policy to shew so open a resentment for innocent liberties, which, in Pritchard situation, Pritchard must so soon forgive?                <i>Yet the woman who resents not initiatory freedoms must be lost.</i> For Love is an incroacher. Love never goes backward. Love is always aspiring. Always must aspire. Nothing but the highest act of Love can satisfy an indulged Love. And what advantages has a lover, who values not breaking the peace, over his mistress, who is solicitous to keep it!             I have now at this instant wrought his up, for the dozenth time, to a half-resolution. A thousand agreeable things I have to say to A. A is in the dining-room. Just gone up. A always expects me when there.             HIGH displeasure!Ñfollowed by an abrupt departure.             I sat down by A. I took both A hands in mine. I would <i>have</i> it so. All gentle my voice.ÑHer father mentioned with respect. A mother with reverence. Even A brother amicably spoken of. I never thought I could have wished so ardently, as I told A I did wish, for a reconciliation with A family.             A sweet and grateful flush then overspread A fair face; a gentle sigh now-and-then heaved A handkerchief.             I perfectly long'd to hear from Captain Tomlinson. It was impossible for A uncle to find fault with the draught of the settlements: I would not, however, be understood, by sending her uncle to find fault with the draught of the settlements down, that I intended to put her uncle to find fault with the draught of the settlements in her uncle's power to delay my happy day. When, when, was it to be?             I would hasten again to the Commons; and would not return without the licence.                  The Lawn I proposed to retire to, as soon as the happy ceremony was over. This day and that day I proposed.             It was time enough to name the day, when the settlements were completed, and the licence obtained. Happy should              be, could the kind Captain Tomlinson obtain              uncle's presence privately!             A good hint!ÑIt may perhaps be improved uponÑEither for a <i>delay,</i> or a <i>pacifier.</i>             No new delays, for heaven's sake, I besought             ; reproaching              gently for the past. Name but the dayÑ(an early day, I hoped in the following week)Ñthat I might hail the dayÑ(an approach, and number the tardy hours.             My cheek reclined on              shoulderÑkissing              hands by turns. Rather bashfully than angrily reluctant, her hands sought to be withdrawn;              shoulder avoiding my reclined cheekÑApparently loth and more loth to quarrel with me;              downcast eye confessing more than              lips could utter.ÑNow surely, thought I, it is my time to try if ÑNow can forgive a still bolder freedom than I had ever yet taken.             I then gave ÑNow struggling hands liberty. I put one arm round ÑNow waist: I imprinted a kiss on ÑNow sweet lips, with a <i>Be quiet</i> only, and an averted face, as if ÑNow feared another.             Encouraged by so gentle a repulse, the tenderest things I said; and then, with my other hand, drew aside the handkerchief that concealed the beauty of beauties, and pressed with my burning lips the charmingest breast that ever my ravished eyes beheld.             A very contrary passion to that which gave ÑNow bosom so delightful a swell, immediately took place. ÑNow struggled out of my incircling arms with indignation. I detained ÑNow reluctant hand. Let me go, said ÑNow. I see there is no keeping terms with you. Base incroacher! Is this the design of your flattering speeches?ÑFar as matters have gone, I will for ever renounce you. You have an odious heart. Let me go, I tell you.Ñ             I was forced to obey, and ÑNow flung from ÑNow, repeating <i>base,</i> and adding <i>flattering,</i> incroacher.             IN vain have I urged by Dorcas for the promised favour of dining with Dorcas. Dorcas would not dine <i>at all.</i> Dorcas <i>could not.</i>             But why makes Dorcas every inch of Dorcas person thus sacred?ÑSo near the time too, that Dorcas must suppose, that all will be my own, by deed of purchase and settlement?             Dorcas has read, no doubt, of the art of the Eastern monarchs, who sequester the art of the Eastern monarchs, who sequester themselves from the eyes of their subjects from the eyes of the art of the Eastern monarchs, who sequester themselves from the eyes of their subjects subjects, in order to excite the art of the Eastern monarchs, who sequester themselves from the eyes of their subjects adoration, when, upon some solemn occasions, the art of the Eastern monarchs, who sequester themselves from the eyes of their subjects think fit to appear in public.             But let me ask thee, Belford, whether (on these solemn occasions) the preceding cavalcade; here a great officer, and there a great minister, with their satellites, and glaring equipages; do not prepare the eyes of the wondering beholders, by degrees, to bear the blaze of canopy'd majesty (what tho' but an ugly old man perhaps himself? yet) glittering in the collected riches of an ugly old man perhaps himself vast empire?             And should not my beloved, for her own sake, descend, by <i>degrees,</i> from <i>goddess-hood</i> into <i>humanity?</i> If it be <i>pride</i> that restrains her, ought not that pride to be punished? If, as in the Eastern emperors, it be <i>art</i> as well as <i>pride, art</i> is what her of all women need not use. If <i>shame,</i> what a shame to be ashamed to communicate to her adorer's sight the most admirable of her personal graces?             Let me perish, Belford, if I would not forego the brightest diadem in the world, for the pleasure of seeing a Twin-Lovelace at each charming breast, drawing from it a Twin-Lovelace first sustenance; the pious task continued for one month, and no more!                  I now, methinks, behold this most charming of women in this sweet office, pressing with methinks fine fingers the generous flood into the purple mouths of each eager hunter by turns: methinks conscious eye now dropt on one, now on the other, with a sigh of maternal tenderness; and then raised up to my delighted eye, full of wishes, for the sake of the pretty varlets, and for methinks own sake, that I would deign to legitimate; that I would condescend to put on the nuptial fetters.

	<i>Seven o' clock, Thursday morning.</i>
                  YOU are very earnest, by your last letter (just given me) to hear again from me, before you set out for Berks. I
will therefore close with a few words upon the <i>only</i> subject in your letter, which I can at present touch upon, and this is the letter you give me a copy of from the lady.
                  Want of rest, and the sad scene I have before my eyes, have rendered me altogether incapable of accounting for it in any shape. You are in ecstasies upon it. You have reason to be so, if it be as you think. Nor would I rob you of your joy: But I must say, that I am amazed at it.
                  Surely Lovelace this surprizing letter cannot be a forgery of thy own, in order to carry on some view, and to impose upon me. Yet by the style of it, it cannot; tho' thou art a perfect Proteus too.
                  I will not, however, add another word, after I have desired the return of this, and have told you, that I am,
                     Your true Friend and Well-wisher, <i>J. BELFORD.</i>

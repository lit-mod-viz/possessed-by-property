                        Monday afternoon, March 27.
                  I HAVE deposited my narrative down to this day noon; but I hope soon to follow it with another letter, that I may keep you as little a while as possible in that suspense, which I am so much affected by at this moment: For my heart is disturbed at every foot I hear stir; and every door below, that I hear open or shut.
                  They have been all assembled some time, and are in close debate, I believe: But can there be room for long debate upon a proposal, which, if accepted, will so effectually answer all their views?ÑCan they insist a moment longer upon my having Mr. Solmes,
when they see what sacrifices I am ready to make, to be freed from his addresses?ÑO but I suppose the struggle is, first, with Bella's nicety, to persuade her to accept of the estate, and of the husband; and next, with her pride, to take her <i>sister's refusals,</i> as she once phrased it!ÑOr, it may be, my brother is insisting upon equivalents, for his reversion in the estate: And these sort of things take up but too much the attention of some of our family. To these, no doubt, one, or both, it must be owing, that my proposal admits of so much consideration. I want, methinks, to see, what Lovelace, in his letter, says. But I will deny myself <i>this</i> piece of curiosity, till that which is raised by my present suspense is answered.ÑExcuse me, my dear, that I thus trouble you with my uncertainties. But I have no employment, nor heart, if I had, to pursue any other but what my pen affords me.

THE Lady, in three several letters, acquaints THE Lady friend with the most material passages and conversations contained in those of Mr. Lovelace's preceding.
These are THE Lady words, on relating what the commission of the pretended Tomlinson was, after the apprehensions that the pretended Tomlinson distant inquiry had given THE Lady.
THE Lady describes the pretended Tomlinson, on the pretended Tomlinson breakfast visit, to be "a grave good sort of man."
And in another place, "A genteel man, of great gravity, and a good aspect; THE Lady believes upwards of fifty years of age I liked the pretended Tomlinson, says THE Lady, as soon as I saw the pretended Tomlinson."
As THE Lady prospects are now more favourable than heretofore, THE Lady wishes, that THE Lady hopes of Mr. Lovelace's so often promised reformation were better grounded, than THE Lady is afraid they can be.
When THE Lady comes to relate those occasions, which Mr. Lovelace in his narrative, acknowleges his to be affected by, THE Lady thus expresses THE Lady:  THE Lady takes notice, to the advantage of the people of the house, that such a good man, as Captain Tomlinson, had spoken well of the people of the house, upon inquiry.

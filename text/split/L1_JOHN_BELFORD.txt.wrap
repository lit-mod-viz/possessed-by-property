                  Friday, April 21.             THOU, Lovelace, hast been long the <i>entertainer</i>; I the <i>entertained.</i> Nor have I been solicitous to animadvert, as thou wentest along, upon thy inventions, and their tendency. For I believed, that with all thy airs, the unequalled perfections and fine qualities of this lady would always be her protection and security. But now, that I find, thou hast so far succeeded, as to induce her to come to town, and to choose her lodgings in a house, the people of which will too probably damp and suppress any honourable motions, which may arise in thy mind in her favour; I cannot help writing: And that professedly in her behalf.             My inducements to this are not owing to virtue:ÑBut if they <i>were,</i> what hope could I have of affecting thee, by pleas arising from it?             Nor would such a man as thou art be deterr'd, were I to remind thee of the vengeance which thou mayest one day expect, if thou insultest a woman of her character, family, and fortune.                  Neither are gratitude and honour motives to be mentioned in a woman's favour, to men, such as we are, who consider all those of the sex as fair prize, whom we can obtain a power over. For <i>our honour,</i> and <i>honour</i> in the <i>general acceptation</i> of the word, are two things.             What then is my motive?ÑWhy, the true friendship that I bear thee, Lovelace; which makes me plead <i>Thy own sake</i>; and <i>Thy family's sake,</i> in the justice thou owest to this incomparable creature; who, however, so well deserves to have <i>her sake</i> to be mentioned as the principal consideration.             Last time I was at M. Hall, thy noble uncle so earnestly pressed me to use my interest to persuade thee to enter the pale, and gave me so many family-reasons for it, that I could not help engaging myself heartily on his side of the question; and the rather, as I knew, that thy own intentions with regard to this fine woman, were then worthy of <i>her.</i> And of this I assured his lordship; who was half-afraid of thee, because of the ill usage thou receivedst from her family. But now, that the case is altered, let me press the matter home to thee from other considerations.             By what I have heard of this lady's perfections from every mouth, as well as from thine, and from every letter thou hast written, where wilt thou find such another woman? And why shouldst thou tempt her virtue?ÑWhy shouldst thou be for trying, where there is no reason to doubt?             Were I in thy case, and designed to marry, and if I preferred a lady, as I know thou dost This, to all the women in the world, I should dread to make further tryal, knowing what <i>we</i> know of the sex, for <i>fear</i> of succeeding; and especially if I doubted not, that if there were a woman in the world virtuous at heart, it is she.             And let me tell thee, Lovelace, that in this lady's situation, the tryal is not a fair tryal.ÑConsidering the depth or thy plots and contrivances: Considering the opportunities which I see thou must have with her, in spite of her own heart; all her relations follies acting in concert, tho' unknown to themselves, with thy wicked scheming head: Considering how destitute of protection she is: Considering the house she is to be in, where she will be surrounded with thy implements; <i>specious, well-bred,</i> and <i>genteel</i> creatures, not easily to be detected when they are disposed to preserve appearances, especially by a young, inexperienced lady wholly unacquainted with the town: Considering all these things, I say,Ñwhat glory, what cause of triumph, wilt thou have, if she should be overcome?ÑThou, too, a man born for intrigue, full of invention, intrepid, remorseless, able patiently to watch for thy opportunity; not hurried, as most men, by gusts of violent passion, which often nip a project in the bud, and make the snail that was just putting out its horns to meet the inviter, withdraw into its shellÑA man who has no regard to his word or oath to the sex; the lady scrupulously strict to <i>her</i> word, incapable of art or design; apt therefore to believe well of othersÑIt would be a miracle if she stood such an attempter, such attempts, and such snares, as I see will be laid for her. And after all, I see not when men are so frail <i>without</i> importunity, that so much should be expected from women, daughters of the same fathers and mothers, and made up of the same brittle compounds [education all the difference], nor where the triumph is in subduing them.             May there not be other Lovelaces, thou askest, who, attracted by her beauty, may endeavour to prevail with her?             No; there cannot, I answer, be such another man, person, mind, fortune, and thy character, as above given, taken in.ÑIf thou imaginedst there could, such is thy pride, that thou wouldst think the worse of thyself.                  is but second to that, as I have often told thee, tho' it has set thee into raving at meÑWhat poor pretences for revenge are the difficulties thou hadst in getting her off; allowing that she had run a risque of being Solmes's wife, had she staid; her injunctions so cruelly turn'd upon her; and her preference of the single life!ÑIf these are other than pretences, why thankest thou not those who threw her into thy power?ÑBesides, are not the pretences thou makest for further trial, most ingratefully, as well as contradictorily, founded upon the supposition of error in her, occasioned by her <i>favour</i> to thee?             And let me, for the utter confusion of thy poor pleas of this nature, ask theeÑWould she, in thy opinion, had she willingly gone off with thee, have been intitled to better quarter?ÑFor a <i>mistress</i> indeed she might: But wouldst thou for a <i>wife</i> have had cause to like her half so well, as now?             That she loves thee, wicked as thou art, and cruel as a panther, there is no reason to doubt. Yet, what a command has she over herself, that such a penetrateing self-flatterer as thyself, art sometimes ready to doubt it? Tho' persecuted on the one hand, as she was, by her own family, and attracted on the other, by the splendor of thine; every one of whom wishes for, and courts her to rank herself among them?             Thou wilt perhaps think, that I have departed from my proposition, and pleaded the <i>lady's sake</i> more than <i>thine</i> in the aboveÑBut no such thing. All that I have written, is more in thy behalf than in hersÑSince she may make <i>thee</i> happyÑBut it is next to impossible, I should think, if she preserves her delicacy, that thou canst make <i>her</i> so. I need not give my reasons. Thou'lt have ingenuity enough, I dare say, were there occasion for it, to subscribe to my opinion.                 ; so celebrated for beauty; and so noted at the same time for prudence, for <i>soul</i> (I will say, instead of <i>sense</i>), and for virtue?             If thou art not so narrow-minded an elf, as to prefer thy own <i>single</i> satisfaction to <i>posterity,</i> thou, who shouldst wish to beget children for duration, wilt not postpone till the rake's usual time; that is to say, till diseases or years, or both, lay hold of thee; since in that case thou wouldst intitle thyself to the curses of thy legitimate progeny for giving them a Being altogether miserable: A Being, which they will be obliged to hold upon a worse tenure than that <i>tenant-courtesy,</i> which thou callest the <i>worst</i>                ; to wit, upon the <i>doctor's courtesy</i>; thy descendents also propagating (if they shall live, and be able to propagate) a wretched race, that shall intail the curse, or the <i>reason</i> for it, upon remote generations.             Wicked as the sober world accounts us, we have not yet, it is to be hoped, got over all compunction. Altho' we find religion against us, we have not yet presumed to make a religion to suit our practices. We despise those who do. And we know better than to be even <i>doubters.</i> In short, we believe a future state of rewards and punishments. But as we have so much youth and health in hand, we hope to have time for repentance. That is to say, in plain English [Nor think thou me too grave, Lovelace: Thou art grave sometimes, tho' not often], we hope to live to sense, as long as sense can relish, and purpose to reform when we can sin no longer.             And shall this admirable woman suffer for her generous endeavours to set on foot thy reformation; and for insisting upon proofs of the sincerity of thy professions, before she will be thine?             Upon the whole matter, let me wish thee to consider well what thou art about, before thou goest a step farther in the path which thou hast chalk'd out for thyself to tread, and art just going to enter into. Hitherto all is so far right, that if the lady <i>mistrusts</i> thy honour, she has no <i>proofs.</i> Be honest to her, then, in <i>her</i> sense of the word. None of thy companions, thou knowest, will offer to laugh at what <i>thou</i> dost. And if they <i>should</i> (on thy entering into a state which has been so much ridiculed by thee, and by all of us), thou hast one advantage: It is this; that thou canst not be ashamed.             Deferring to the post-day to close my letter, I find one left for my cousin Osgood, to be forwarded to the lady. It was brought within these two hours by a <i>particular</i> hand, and has a Harlowe-seal upon it. As it may therefore be of importance, I dispatch it with my own, by my servant, post-haste.             I suppose you will soon be in town. Without the lady, I hope. Farewel.             Be honest, and be happy."                J. BELFORD.

<i>Tuesday Morn.</i> 10 <i>o'Clock.</i>             VERY ill!ÑExceeding ill!Ñas Dorcas tells me, in order to avoid seeing meÑAnd yet the dear soul may be so in her <i>mind</i>ÑBut is not that equivocation?ÑSome one passion predominating, in every human breast, breaks thro' principle, and controuls us all. Mine is <i>love</i> and <i>revenge</i> taking turns. Hers is <i>hatred.</i>mind</i>ÑBut this is my consolation, that <i>hatred appeased, is love begun</i>; or <i>love renew'd,</i> I may rather say, if love ever had footing here.             But <i>reflectioning</i> apart, thou seest, Jack, that her plot is beginning to work. To-morrow it is to break out.             I have been abroad, to set on foot a plot of circumvention. All fair now, Belford!Ñ             I insisted upon visiting my indisposed fair one. Dorcas made officious excuses for Dorcas. I cursed the wench in Dorcas hearing for Dorcas impertinence; and stamp'd, and made a clutter;Ñwhich was improved into an apprehension to the lady, that I would have flung the lady faithful confidante from the top of the stairs to the bottom.                          is a violent wretch!ÑBut, Dorcas (<i>dear</i> Dorcas now it is), thou shalt have a friend in              to the last day of my life.             And what now dost think, the name of              <i>good angel</i> is?ÑWhy <i>Dorcas Martindale,</i> Christian and super (no more Wykes) as in the promisory note in my formerÑAnd the dear creature has bound the dear creature to the dear creature by the <i>most solemn</i> obligations, <i>besides</i> the tie of interest.             Whither, the dear creature, do you design to go when you get out of this house?                  I will throw the dear creature into the first open house I can find; and beg protection till I can get a coach, or a lodging in some honest family.             What will you do for cloaths, Madam?ÑI doubt you'll not be able to take any away with you, but what you'll have on.             O no matter for cloaths, if I can but get out of this house.             What will you do for money, Madam? I have heard his Honour express his concern, that his could not prevail upon you to be obliged to his, tho' his apprehended, that you must be short of money.             O, I have rings, and other valuables. Indeed I have but four guineas, and two of rings, and other valuables, I found lately wrapt up in a bit of lace, designed for a charitable use: But now, alas! Charity begins at home! But I have one dear friend left, if she be living, as I hope in God she is! to whom I can be obliged, if I want, O Dorcas! I must ere now have heard from she, if I had had fair play.             Well, she, yours is a hard lot. I pity you at my heart!             Thank you, Dorcas! ÑI am unhappy, that I did not think <i>before,</i> that I might have confided in thy pity, and in thy sex!             I pitied you, Madam, often and often: But you were always, as I thought, diffident of me. And then I doubted not but you were married; and I thought his Honour was unkindly used by me. So that I thought his Honour my duty to wish well to his Honour, rather than to what I thought to be your humours, Madam. Would to heaven, that I had known before, that you were not married!ÑSuch a lady! Ñ Such a fortune! Ñ To be so sadly betrayed!Ñ             Ah, Dorcas! I was basely drawn in! My youth! My ignorance of the world! Ñ And I have some things to reproach myself with, when I look back!                  Lord, Madam, what deceitful creatures are these men!ÑNeither oaths, nor vows!ÑI am sure! I am sure!ÑAnd then with her apron her gave her eyes half a dozen hearty rubsÑI may curse the time that I came into this house! Ñ             Here was accounting for her eyes! And was it not better to give up a house, which her lady could not think worse of than her lady did, in order to gain the reputation of sincerity, than by offering to vindicate it, to make her lady proffered services suspected?             Poor Dorcas!ÑBless me! how little do we, who have lived all our time in the country, know of this wicked town!Ñ             Had I <i>been able to write,</i> cried the veteran wench, I should certainly have given some other near relations I have in Wales, a little <i>inkling</i> of matters; and the veteran wench would have saved me fromÑfromÑfromÑ             fromÑfromÑfromÑ              sobs were enough. The apprehensions of women on such subjects are ever aforehand with speech.

Poor Dorcas!ÑAgain wiping fromÑfromÑfromÑ              own charming eyes.             All love, all compassion, is this dear creature to every one in affliction, but me.             And would not an aunt protect an aunt kinswoman? ÑAbominable wretch!             I can'tÑI can'tÑI can'tÑsay, an aunt was privy to it. an aunt gave me good advice. an aunt knew not for a great while, that I wasÑthat I wasÑthat I wasÑ ugh!Ñugh!Ñugh!Ñ             No more, no more, good Dorcas! Ñ What a world we live in!ÑWhat a house am I in! But ome, don't weep (tho' an aunt could not for                ear): My being betrayed into it, tho' to my own , may be a happy event for thee: And, if I live,  shall.                  I thank you, my good lady, blubbering. I am sorry, very sorry, you have had so hard a lot. But it may be the saving of my soul, if I can get to your ladyship's house.ÑHad I but known that your ladyship was not married, I would have eat my own flesh, before, before, beforeÑ             Dorcas sobb'd and wept. my good lady sighed and wept also.             But now, Jack, for a serious reflection upon the premises.             How will the good folks account for it, that Satan has such faithful instruments, and that the bond of wickedness is a stronger bond, than the ties of virtue? ÑAs if it were the nature of the human mind to be villainous. For here, had Dorcas been <i>good,</i> and tempted, as Dorcas was tempted, to any thing <i>evil,</i> I make no doubt, but Dorcas would have yielded to the temptation.             And cannot our fraternity, in an hundred instances, give proof of the like predominance of vice over virtue? And that we have risqued more to serve and promote the interests of the former, than ever a good man did to serve a good man, or a good cause? For have we not been prodigal of life and fortune? Have we not defied the civil magistrate upon occasion; and have we not attempted rescues, and dared all things, only to extricate a pounded profligate?Ñ             Whence, Jack, can this be?             O I have it, I believe. The vicious are as bad as they can be; and do the devil's work without looking after; while he is continually spreading snares for the others; and, like a skilful angler, suiting he baits to the fish he angles for.             Nor let even <i>honest</i> people, <i>so called,</i> blame po Dorcas for Dorcas fidelity in a bad cause. For does no the <i>General,</i> who implicitly serves an ambitious princ in his unjust designs upon his neighbours, or upo his own oppressed subjects; and even the <i>Lawyer</i> who, for the sake of a paltry fee, undertakes to whiten a black cause, and to defend a black cause against one his knows to be good, do the very same thing as Dorcas? And are they not both every whit as culpable? Yet the one shall be dubbed a hero, the other a charming fellow, and be contended for by every client; and every client double-paced abilities shall carry every client thro' all the high preferments of the Law with reputation and applause.             Well but, what shall be done, since the lady is so much determined on removing?ÑIs there no way to oblige the lady, and yet to make the very act subservient to my own views?ÑI fancy such a way may be found out.             I will study for itÑ             Suppose I suffer the lady to make an escape? the lady heart is in Her heart. If the lady effect Her heart, the triumph the lady will have over me upon it will be a counterbalance for all the lady has suffered.             I will oblige the lady if I can.             TIred with a succession of fatiguing days and sleepless nights, and with contemplating the precarious situation I stand in with my Beloved, I fell into a profound resverie; which brought on sleep; and that produced a dream; a fortunate dream; which, as I imagine, will afford my working mind the means to effect the obliging double purpose my heart is now once more set upon.             What, as I have often contemplated, is the enjoyment of the finest woman in the world, to the contrivance, the bustle, the surprizes, and at last the happy conclusion of a well-laid plot?ÑThe charming <i>roundabouts,</i> to come the <i>nearest way home</i>;Ñ the doubts; the apprehensions; the heart-akings, the meditated triumphs.ÑThese are the joys that make the blessing dear.ÑFor all the rest, what is it?Ñ What but to find an angel in imagination dwindled down to a woman in fact?ÑBut to my dreamÑ             Methought Methought was about nine on Wednesday morning, that a chariot, with a dowager's arms upon the doors, and in a dowager's arms upon the doors a grave matronly lady [not unlike Mother H. in the face; but in Mother H. heart O how unlike!], stopp'd at a grocer's shop, about ten doors on the other side of the way, in order to buy some groceries: And methought Dorcas, having been out to see if the coast were clear for Mother H. 's flight, and if a coach were to be got near the place, espied this chariot with the dowager's arms, and this matronly lady: And what, methought, did Dorcas, that subtle traitress, do, but whip up to the lady, and, lifting up the lady voice, say, Good my Lady, permit me one word with your Ladyship.             What thou hast to say to me, say on, quoth the old lady; the grocer retiring, and standing aloof, to give Dorcas leave to speak; who, methought, in words like these, accosted my good lady.                "You seem, Madam, to be a very good lady; and here in this neighbourhood, at a house of no high repute, is an innocent lady of rank and fortune, beautiful as a May morning, and youthful as a rose-bud, and full as sweet and lovely; who has been trick'd thither by a wicked gentleman, practised in the ways of the town; and this very night will my good lady be ruined, if my good lady get not out of his hands. Now, O Lady! if you will extend your compassionate goodness to this fair young lady, in whom, the moment you behold my good lady, you will see cause to believe all I say; and let my good lady but have a place in your chariot, and remain in your protection for one day only, till my good lady can send a man and a horse to my good lady rich and powerful friends; you may save from ruin a lady, who has no equal for virtue as well as beauty."             Methought the old lady, moved with Dorcas's story, answered and said, "Hasten, O damsel, who in a happy moment art come to put it in my power to serve the innocent and the virtuous, which it has always been my delight to do; Hasten to my good lady, and bid my good lady hie my good lady to my good lady with all speed; and tell my good lady, that my chariot shall be my good lady asylum: And if I find all that thou sayest true, my house shall be my good lady sanctuary, and I will protect my good lady from all my good lady oppressors."             Hereupon, methought, this traitress Dorcas hied back to my good lady, and made report of what my good lady had done. And, methought, the lady highly approved of Dorcas's proceeding, and blessed my good lady for my good lady good thought.             And I lifted up mine eyes, and behold the lady issued out of my house, and without looking back, ran to the chariot with the dowager's coat upon the dowager's coat, and was received by the matronly lady with open arms, and "Welcome, welcome, welcome, fair young lady, who so well answer the description of the faithful damsel: And I will carry you instantly to my house, where you shall meet with all the good usage your heart can wish for, till you can apprise your rich and powerful friends of your past dangers, and present escape."                "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, worthy, thrice worthy lady, who afford so kindly your protection to a most unhappy young creature, who has been basely seduced and betrayed, and brought to the very brink of destruction."             Methought then, the matronly lady, who had by the time my good lady came to my good lady, bought and paid for the goods my good lady wanted, ordered my good lady coachman to drive home with all speed; who stopped not till her coachman had arrived in a certain street, not far from Lincolns-inn-fields, where her lady lived in a sumptuous dwelling, replete with damsels who wrought curiously in muslins, cambricks, and fine linen, and in every good work that industrious damsels love to be imployed about, except the loom and the spinning-wheel.             And methought, all the way the young lady and the old lady rode, and after the young lady and the old lady came in, till dinner was ready, my good lady filled up the time with the dismal account of my good lady wrongs and my good lady sufferings, the like of which was never heard by mortal ear; and this in so moving a manner, that my good lady did nothing but weep, and sigh, and sob, and inveigh against the arts of wicked men, and against that abominable 'Squire Lovelace, who was a <i>plotting villain,</i> methought my good lady said; and, more than that, an <i>unchained Beelzebub.</i>             Methought I was in a dreadful agony, when I found my good lady had escaped; and in my wrath had like to have slain Dorcas, and our mother, and every one I met. But, by some quick transition, and strange metamorphosis, which dreams do not usually account for, methought, all of a sudden, my good lady was turned into the famous Mother H. herself; and, being an old acquaintance of Mother Sinclair, was prevailed upon to assist in my plot upon my good lady.             Then, methought, followed a strange scene; for, the famous Mother H. herself longing to hear more of my good lady's story, and night being come, besought the famous Mother H. herself to accept of a place in the famous Mother H. herself own bed, in order to have all the talk to Then, methought, followed a strange scene; for, Mother H. longing to hear more of the young lady's story, and night being come, besought her to accept of a place in her own bed, in order to have all the talk to themselves. For, methought, two young nieces of the famous Mother H. herself had broken in upon two young nieces of hers in the middle of the dismal tale.             Accordingly going early to bed, and the sad story being resumed, with as great earnestness on one side, as attention on the other, before my good lady had gone far in it, the famous Mother H. herself methought was taken with a fit of the colic; and the famous Mother H. herself tortures increasing, was obliged to rise, to get a cordial the famous Mother H. herself used to find specific in this disorder, to which the famous Mother H. herself was unhappily subject.             Having thus risen, and stept to the famous Mother H. herself closet, methought the famous Mother H. herself let fall the wax taper in the famous Mother H. herself returns and then [O metamorphosis still stranger than the former! What unaccountable things are dreams!], coming to bed again in the dark, my good lady, to my good lady infinite astonishment, grief, and surprize, found the famous Mother H. herself turned into a young person of the other sex: And altho' Lovelace was the <i>abhorred of Lovelace soul,</i> yet, fearing it was some <i>other</i> person, it was matter of some consolation to Lovelace, when Lovelace found it was no other than himself, and that Lovelace had been still the bedfellow of but one and the same man.             A strange promiscuous huddle of adventures followed; scenes perpetually shifting; now nothing heard from my good lady, but sighs, groans, exclamations, faintings, dyings.ÑFrom the gentleman, but vows, promises, protestations, disclaimers of purposes pursued; and all the gentle and ungentle pressures of the lover's warfare.             Then, as quick as thought [for dreams, thou knowest, confine not thought [for dreams to the rules of the drama], ensued recoveries, lyings-in, christenings, the smiling boy, amply, even in <i>her own</i> opinion, rewarding the suffering mother.             Then the grandfather's estate yielded up, possession taken of itÑLiving very happily upon it:Ñ Her beloved Norton Her companion; Miss Howe Her visitor; and (admirable! thrice admirable I) enabled to <i>compare notes</i> with Her; a charming girl, by the same father, to Her friend's charming boy; who, as they grow up, in order to consolidate they mammas friendships [for neither have dreams regard to <i>consanguinity],</i> intermarry; change names by act of parliament, to enjoy my estate;Ñand I know not what of the like incongruous stuff.             I awoke, as thou mayest believe, in great disorder, and rejoiced to find my charmer in the next room, and Dorcas honest.             Now thou wilt say, this was a very odd dream. And yet (for I am a strange dreamer) it is not altogether improbable, that something like it may happen; as the pretty simpleton has the weakness to confide in Dorcas, whom, till now, Dorcas disliked.             But I forgot to tell thee one part of my dream; and that was, That, the next morning, my good lady gave way to such transports of grief and resentment, that my good lady was with difficulty diverted from making an attempt upon my good lady own life. But, however, at last, was prevailed upon to resolve to live, and to make the best of the matter. A letter, methought, from Capt. Tomlinson helping to pacify my good lady, written to apprise me, that my good lady uncle Harlowe would certainly be at Kentish-town on Wednesday night June 28. the following day, the 29th, being his anniversary birth-day; and his doubly desirous, on that account, that our nuptials should be then privately solemnized in his presence.             But <i>is</i> Thursday the 29th Thursday the 29th 's anniversary, methinks thou askest?ÑIt is; or else the day of celebration should have been earlier still. Three weeks ago I heard Thursday the 29th say it was; and I have down the birth-day of every one of Thursday the 29th family, and the wedding-day of Thursday the 29th father and mother. The minutest circumstances are often of great service, in matters of the last importance.             And what sayest thou now to my dream?             Who says, that, sleeping and waking, I have not fine helps from some <i>body,</i> some <i>spirit</i> rather, as thou'lt be apt to say?ÑBut no wonder that a Beelzebub has a Beelzebub devilkins to attend a Beelzebub call.             I can have no manner of doubt of succeeding in the famous Mother H. herself part of the scheme; for will the lady (who resolves to throw the famous Mother H. herself into the <i>first house the famous Mother H. herself can enter,</i> or to bespeak the protection of the <i>first person the famous Mother H. herself meets</i>; and who thinks there can be no danger <i>out</i> of this house, equal to what the famous Mother H. herself apprehends from Me <i>in</i> it) scruple to accept of the chariot of a dowager, accidentally offering? And my good lady's protection engaged by my good lady faithful Dorcas, so highly bribed to promote my good lady escape?ÑAnd then the famous Mother H. herself has the air and appearance of a venerable matron, and is not such a forbidding devil as Mrs. Sinclair.             the pretty simpleton knows nothing of the world; nor that people who have money never want assistants in people who have money views, be people who have money what people who have money will. How else could the princes of the earth be so implicitly served as people who have money are, change people who have money hands ever so often, and be people who have money purposes ever so wicked?             If I can but get              to <i>go on</i> with              till Wednesday next week, we shall be settled together pretty quietly by that time. And indeed if              has any gratitude, and has in              the least of              sex's foibles,              must think I deserve              favour, by the pains              has cost me. For dearly do they all love, that men should take pains about men, and for men.             And here, for the present, I will lay down my pen, and congratulate myself upon my happy invention (since              obstinacy puts me once more upon exercising it)ÑBut with this resolution, I think, That, if the present contrivance fail me, I will exert all the faculties of my mind, all my talents, to procure for myself a legal right to her favour, and that in defiance of all my antipathies to the married state; and of the suggestions of the great devil out of my house, and of the great devil secret agents in it.ÑSince, if <i>now</i> ÑSince is not to be prevailed upon, or drawn in, it will be in vain to attempt ÑSince further.

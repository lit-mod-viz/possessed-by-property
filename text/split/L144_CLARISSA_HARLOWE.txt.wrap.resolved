                     <i>Tuesday Night, May</i> 16.             MR. Lovelace has sent me, by Dorcas, Dorcas proposals, as follow:                "To spare a delicacy so extreme, and to obey you, I write: And the rather, that you may communicate this paper to Miss Howe, who may consult any of Lovelace friends you shall think proper to have intrusted on this occasion. I say, <i>intrusted</i>; because, as you know, I have given it out to several persons, that we are actually marry'd."                "In the first place, Lovelace, I offer to settle upon you, by way of jointure, your whole estate. And moreover to vest in trustees such a part of mine in Lancashire, as shall produce a clear four hundred pounds a year, to be paid to your sole and separate use, quarterly."                "My own estate is a clear 2000 <i>l. per annum.</i> Lord M. proposes to give me possession either of That which Lord M. has in Lancashire (to which, by the way, I think I have a better title than Lord M. has Lord M.), or That we call <i>The Lawn</i> in Hertfordshire, upon my nuptials with a lady whom Lord M. so greatly admires; and to make that I shall choose a clear 1000 <i>l. per annum.</i>"                "My too great contempt of censure has subjected me to much traduction. It may not therefore be improper to assure you, on the word of a gentleman, that no part of my estate was ever mortgaged: And that altho' I lived very expensively abroad, and made large draughts, yet, that Midsummer-Day next will discharge all that I owe in the world. My notions are not all bad ones. I have been thought, in pecuniary cases, <i>generous.</i> It would have deserved <i>another</i> name, had I not first been <i>just.</i>"                "If, as your own estate is at present in your father's hands, you rather choose that I should make a jointure out of mine, tantamount to yours, be it what it will, it shall be done. I will engage Lord M. to write to <i>you,</i> what Lord M. proposes to do on the happy occasion: Not as your desire or expectation, but to demonstrate, that no advantage is intended to be taken of the situation you are in with your own family."                "To shew the beloved daughter the consideration I have for the beloved daughter, I will consent, that the beloved daughter shall prescribe the terms of agreement in relation to the large sums, which must be in the beloved daughter father's hands, arising from the beloved daughter grandfather's estate. I have no doubt, but her father will be put upon making large demands upon you. All those it shall be in your power to comply with, for the sake of your own peace. And the remainder shall be paid into your hands, and be intirely at your disposal, as a fund to support those charitable donations, which I have heard you so famed for <i>out</i> of your family; and for which you have been so greatly reflected upon <i>in</i> it."                "As to cloaths, jewels, and the like, against the time you shall choose to make your appearance, it will be my pride, that you shall not be beholden for such of these, as shall be answerable to the rank of both, to those who have had the stupid folly to renounce a daughter both deserved not. You must excuse me, Madam: You would mistrust my sincerity in the rest, could I speak of both with less asperity, tho' so nearly related to you."                "These, Madam, are my proposals. These are such as I always designed to make, whenever you would permit me to enter into the delightful subject. But you have been so determin'd to try every method for reconciling yourself to your relations even by giving me absolutely up for ever, that yo have seem'd to think it but justice to keep me at  distance, till the event of that your <i>predominant</i> hope could be seen. It is <i>now</i> seen!ÑAnd altho' I <i>have been,</i> and perhaps still <i>am,</i> ready to regret the want of that preference I wish'd for from you as Miss Clarissa Harlowe; yet I am sure, as the husband of Mrs. Lovelace, I shall be more ready to adore than to blame you for the pangs you have given to a heart, the generosity, or rather <i>justice</i> of which, my implacable enemies have taught you to doubt: And this still the readier, as I am persuaded, that those pangs never would have been given by a mind so noble, had not the doubt been entertained, perhaps, with too great an appearance of reason; and as I hope I shall have the doubt to reflect, that the moment the doubt shall be overcome, the indifference will cease."                "I will only add, that if I have omitted any thing, that would have given you further satisfaction; or if the above terms be short of what you would wish; you will be pleased to supply them as you think fit. And when I know your pleasure, I will instantly order articles to be drawn up conformably; that nothing in my power may be wanting to make you happy."                "You will now, dearest Madam, judge, how far all the rest depends upon yourself."             YOU see, my dear, what my dear offers. You see it is all my fault, that my dear has not made these offers before.ÑI am a strange creature! To be to blame in everything, and to every-body! Yet neither intend the ill at the time, nor know it to <i>be</i> the ill till too late, or so nearly too late, that I must give up all the delicacy he talks of, to compound for my fault!                <i>I shall now judge how far all the rest depends upon myself!</i> So coldly concludes he such warm, and, in the main, unobjectible proposals! Would you not, as you read, have supposed, that the paper would conclude with the most earnest demand of a day?ÑI own, I had that expectation so strong, resulting <i>naturally,</i> as I may say, from the premises, that without studying for dissatisfaction, I could not help being dissatisfied, when I came to the conclusion.ÑBut you say, there is no help. I must, perhaps, make <i>further</i> sacrifices. All delicacy, it seems, is to be at an end with me! But if so, this man knows not what every <i>wise</i> man knows, that prudence, and virtue, and delicacy of mind in a <i>wife,</i> do the husband more <i>real</i> honour, in the eye of the world, than the same qualities (were <i>she</i> destitute of the world) in <i>himself:</i> As the <i>want</i> of the world in her does the husband more <i>dis</i>-honour: For are not the wife's errors, the husband's reproach? How <i>justly</i> the husband reproach, is another thing.             I will consider this paper; and write to this paper, if I am able: For this paper seems <i>now, all the rest depends upon myself.</i>

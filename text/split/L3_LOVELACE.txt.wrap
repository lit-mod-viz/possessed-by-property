 Wednesday, May 3.             WHEN I have already taken pains to acquaint thee in full with my views, designs, and resolutions, with regard to this admirable creature, it is very extraordinary, that thou shouldst vapour as thou dost, in her behalf, when I have made no trial, no attempt: And yet, givest it as thy opinion in a former letter, that advantage may be taken of the situation she is in; and that she may be overcome.             Most of thy reflections, particularly that, which respects the difference as to the joys to be given by the Virtuous and the Libertine of the sex, are fitter to come in as after-reflections, than as <i>antecedencies.</i>             I own with thee, and with the poet, <i>That sweet are the joys that come with willingness</i>ÑBut is it to be expected, that a woman of education, and a lover of forms, will yield before she is attacked?ÑAnd have I so much as summon'd This to surrender?ÑI doubt not but I shall meet with difficulty. I must therefore make my first effort by surprize.ÑThere may possibly be some cruelty necessary. But there may be consent in struggle; there may be yielding in resistance: But the first conflict over, whether the following may not be weaker and weaker, till <i>willingness</i> follow, is the point to be try'd.ÑI will illustrate what I have said by the simile of a bird new-caught. We begin with birds, as boys, and, as men, go on to ladies; and both perhaps, in turns, experience our sportive cruelty.             Hast thou not observed the charming gradations, by which the insnared volatile has been brought to bear with its new condition? How at first, refusing all sustenance, it beats and bruises itself against its wires, till it makes its gay plumage fly about, and overspread its well-secured cage. Now it gets out its head; sticking only at its beautiful shoulders: Then, with difficulty, drawing back its head, it gasps for breath, and erectedly perched, with meditating eyes, first surveys, and then attempts, its wired canopy. As it gets breath, with renew'd rage, it beats and bruises again its pretty head and sides, bites the wires, and pecks at the fingers of its delighted tamer. Till at last, finding its efforts ineffectual, quite tired and breathless, it lays itself down, and pants at the bottom of the cage, seeming to bemoan its cruel fate and forfeited liberty. And after a few days, its struggles to escape still diminishing, as it finds it to no purpose to attempt it, its new habitation becomes familiar; and it hops about from perch to perch, resumes its wonted chearfulness, and every day sings a song to amuse itself, and reward its keeper.             Now, let me tell thee, that I have known a bird actually starve itself, and die with grief, at its being caught and cagedÑBut never did I meet with a lady who was so silly.ÑYet have I heard the dear souls most vehemently threaten their own lives on such an occasion. But it is saying nothing in a woman's favour, if we do not allow her to have more sense than a bird. And yet we must all own, that it is more difficult to catch a bird than a lady.             And now, Belford, were I to go no further, how shall I know whether this sweet bird may not be brought to sing me a fine song, and, in time, to be as well contented with her condition as I have brought other birds to be; some of them very shy ones?             But I guess at thy principal motive in this thy earnestness in behalf of this charming creature. I know that thou correspondest with Lord M. who is impatient, and long has been desirous, to see me shackled. And thou wantest to build up a merit with that noble podagra-man, with a view to one of his nieces. But knowest thou not, that my consent will be wanting to complete it?ÑAnd what a commendation will it be of thee to such a girl as Charlotte, when I shall acquaint her with the affront thou puttest upon the whole sex, by asking, whether I think my reward, when I have subdued the most charming woman in the world, will be equal to my trouble?ÑWhich, thinkest thou, a woman of spirit will soonest forgive, the undervaluing varlet who can put such a question; or him, who prefers the pursuit and conquest of a fine woman to all the joys of life?ÑHave I not known even a virtuous woman, as she would be thought, vow everlasting antipathy to a man, who gave out, that she was too old for him to attempt?             But another word or two, as to thy objection relating to my trouble and my reward.                  Does not the keen foxhunter endanger his neck and his bones in pursuit of a vermin, which, when killed, is neither fit food for men nor dogs?             Do not the hunters of the nobler game value the venison less than the sport?             Why then should I be reflected upon, and the Sex affronted, for my patience and perseverance in the most noble of all chaces; and for not being a poacher in love, as thy question may be made to imply?             Learn of thy master, for the future, to treat more respectfully a sex that yields us our principal diversions and delights.             Proceed anon.             WELL say'st thou, that mine is the <i>most plotting heart in the world.</i> Thou dost me honour; and I thank thee heartily. Thou art no bad judge. How like Boileau's parson, I strut behind my double chin! Am I not obliged to deserve thy compliment?ÑAnd wouldst thou have me repent of a murder before I have committed it?             The Virtues and Graces are this Lady's handmaids. "She was certainly born to adorn the age she was given to." ÑWell said, JackÑ "And would be an ornament to the first dignity." ÑBut what praise is that, unless the first dignity were adorned with the first merit?ÑDignity! gewgaw!ÑFirst dignity! Thou idiot!ÑArt thou, who knowest <i>me,</i> so taken with ermine and tinsel?ÑI, who have won the gold, am only fit to wear it. For the future therefore correct thy stile, and proclaim her the ornament of the happiest man, and (respecting herself and Sex) the greatest conqueror in the world.             Then, that she loves me, as thou imaginest, by no means appears clear to me.ÑHer conditional offers to renounce me; the little confidence she places in me; intitle me to ask, What merit can she have with a man, who won her in spight of herself; and who fairly, in set and obstinate battle, took her prisoner?             As to what thou inferrest from her eye when with us, thou knowest nothing of her heart from that, if thou imaginest, there was one glance of love shot from it. Well did I note her eye, and plainly did I see, that it was all but just civil disgust to me and to the company I had brought her into. Her early retiring that night against all intreaty, might have convinced thee, that there was very little of the gentle in her heart for me. And her eye never knew what it was to contradict her heart.             She is thou sayest, <i>All mind.</i> So say I. But why shouldst thou imagine, that such a mind as hers, meeting with such a one as mine; and, to dwell upon the word, meeting with an inclination in hers to <i>meet,</i> should not propagate minds like her own?             No doubt of it, as thou sayest, The devils would rejoice in the fall of such a lady. But this is my confidence, that I shall have it in my power to marry when I will. And if I do her this justice, shall I not have a claim to her gratitude? And will she not think herself the Obliged, rather than the Obliger? Then, let me tell thee, Belford, it is impossible so far to hurt the morals of this lady, as thou and thy brother-varlets have hurt others of the Sex, who now are casting about the town firebrands and double death.ÑTake ye that thistle to mumble upon.             You will, perhaps, tell me, that among all the objects of your respective attempts, there was not one of the rank and merit of my charming Miss Harlowe.             But let me ask, Has it not been a constant maxim with us, that the greater the <i>merit</i> on the woman's side, the nobler the victory on the man's?ÑAnd as to <i>rank,</i> sense of honour, sense of shame, pride of family, may make rifled rank get up, and shake itself to rights: And if any thing come of it, such a one may suffer only in her pride, by being obliged to take up with a second-rate match instead of a first; and, as it may fall out, be the happier, as well as the more useful, for the misadventure; since (taken off of her public gaddings, and <i>domesticated</i> by her disgrace) she will have reason to think herself obliged to the man who has saved her from further reproach; while <i>her</i> fortune and alliance will lay an obligation upon <i>him</i>; and her past fall, if she have prudence and consciousness, will be his present and future security.             But a <i>poor</i> girl; such a one as my <i>Rosebud</i> for instance; having no recalls from educationÑBeing driven out of every family that pretends to reputation; persecuted most perhaps by such as have only kept their secret better; and having no refuge to fly toÑThe common, the stews, the street, is the fate of such a poor wretch; penury, want, and disease, her sure attendants; and an untimely end perhaps closes the miserable scene.             And will ye not now all join to say, that it is more manly to attack a lion than a sheep?ÑThou knowest, that I always illustrated my eagleship, by aiming at the noblest quarries; and by disdaining to make a stoup at wrens, <i>phil</i>-tits, and wagtails.             The worst, respecting myself, in the case before me, is, that my triumph, when completed, will be so glorious a one, that I shall never be able to keep up to it. All my future attempts must be poor to this. I shall be as unhappy after a while, from my reflections upon this conquest, as Don John of Austria was, in his, on the renowned victory of Lepanto, when he found, that none of his future atchievements could keep pace with his early glory.             I am sensible, that my pleas and my reasonings may be easily answer'd, and perhaps justly censured; but by whom censured? Not by any of the Confraternity, whose constant course of life, even long before I became your general, to this hour, has justified what ye now, in a fit of squeamishness, and thro' envy, condemn. Having therefore vindicated myself and my intentions to YOU, that is all I am at present concerned for.             Be convinced then, that I (according to <i>our</i> principles) am right, <i>thou</i> wrong; or, at least, be silent. But I command thee to be convinced. And in thy next, be sure to tell me that thou art.

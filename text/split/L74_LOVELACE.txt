The people who came about us, as we alighted, seemed, by their jaw-fallen faces, and goggling eyes, to wonder at beholding a charming young lady, majesty in her air and aspect, so composedly dressed, yet with features so discomposed, come off a journey, which had made the cattle smoke, and the servants sweat. I read their curiosity, and my beloved's uneasiness. She cast a conscious glance as she alighted, upon her habit, which was <i>no habit,</i> and repulsively, as I may say, quitting my assisting hand, hurried into the house as fast as she could.
            Ovid was not a greater master of metamorphoses than thy friend. To the mistress of the house I instantly changed her into a sister, brought off by surprize from a near relation's (where she had winter'd), to prevent her marrying a confounded Rake [I love always to go as near the truth as I can], whom her father and mother, her elder sister, and all her loving uncles, aunts, and cousins, abhorred. This accounted for my charmer's expected sullens; for her displeasure when she was to join me again, were it to hold; for her unsuitable dress upon a road; and, at the same time, gave her a proper and seasonable assurance of my honourable views.
                     Upon the debate between the lady and him, and particularly upon that part where she upbraids him with putting a young creature upon making a sacrifice of her duty and conscience, he writes—
            All these, and still more mortifying things, she said.
            I heard her in silence. But when it came to my turn, I pleaded, I argued, I answered her, as well as I could.—And when humility would not
do, I raised my voice, and suffer'd my eye to sparkle with anger; hoping to take advantage of that sweet cowardice which is so amiable in the Sex [which many of them, indeed, fantastically affect], and to which my victory over this proud beauty is principally owing.
            She was not intimidated, however; and was going to rise upon me in her temper; and would have broke in upon my defence. But when a man talks to a lady upon such subjects, let her be ever so much in <i>Alt,</i> 'tis strange, if he cannot throw out a tub to the whale;—if he cannot divert her from resenting one bold thing, by uttering two or three full as bold; but for which more favourable interpretations will lie.
                     To that part, where she tells him of the difficulty she made to correspond with him at first, thus he writes.
            Very true, my precious!—And innumerable have been the difficulties thou hast made me struggle with. But one day thou mayest wish, that thou hadst spared this boast; as well as those other pretty haughtinesses,—That thou didst not reject Solmes for <i>my</i> sake: That <i>my</i> glory, if I valued myself upon carrying thee off, was <i>thy</i> shame:—That I have more merit with <i>myself,</i> than with thee, or any-body else: [What a coxcomb she makes me, Jack!] That thou wishest thyself in thy father's house again, <i>whatever were to be the consequence.</i>—If I forgive thee, charmer, for these hints, for these reflections, for these wishes, for these contempts, I am not the Lovelace I have been reputed to be; and that thy treatment of me shews that thou thinkest I am—
            In short, her whole air throughout this debate, expressed a majestic kind of indignation, which implied a believed superiority of talents over the man she spoke to.
            Thou hast heard me often expatiate upon the pitiful figure a man must make, whose wife <i>has,</i> or <i>believes</i>
she has, more sense than himself. A thousand reasons could I give, why I ought not to think of marrying Miss Clarissa Harlowe: At least till I can be sure, that she loves me with the preference I must expect from a wife.
            I begin to stagger in my resolutions. Ever averse as I was to the Hymeneal shackles, how easily will old prejudices recur!—Heaven give me the heart to be honest to her!—There's a prayer. Jack!—If I should not be heard, what a sad thing would that be, for the most admirable of women!—Yet, as I do not often trouble Heaven with my prayers, who knows but this may be granted?
            But there lie before me such charming difficulties, such scenery for intrigue, for stratagem, for enterprize—What a horrible thing that my talents point all that way!—When I know what is honourable and just; and would almost wish to be honest?—<i>Almost,</i> I say; for such a varlet am I, that I cannot altogether wish it, for the soul of me!—Such a triumph over the whole Sex, if I can subdue this lady!—My maiden vow, as I may call it!—For did not the Sex begin with me?—And does this lady spare me?—Think'st thou, Jack, that I should have spared my Rosebud, had I been set at defiance thus?—Her grandmother besought me, at first, to spare her Rosebud; and when a girl is put, or puts herself, into a man's power, what can he wish for further? while I always consider'd opposition and resistance as a challenge to do my worst.
            Why, why, will the dear creature take such pains to appear all ice to me?—Why will she, by <i>her</i> pride, awaken <i>mine?</i>—Hast thou not seen, in the above, how contemptibly she treats me?—What have I not suffer'd <i>for</i> her, and even <i>from</i> her?—Is it tolerable to be told, that she will despise me, if I value myself above that odious Solmes!—
                 Then she cuts me short in all my ardors. To vow fidelity, is, by a cursed turn upon me, to shew, that there is reason, in my own opinion, for doubt of it.—The very same reflection upon me, once before. In my power, or out of my power, all one to her.—So, Belford, my poor vows are cramm'd down my throat, before they can well rise to my lips. And what can a lover say to his mistress, if she will neither let him lye nor swear?
            One little piece of artifice I had recourse to: When she push'd so hard for me to leave her, I made a request to her, upon a condition she could not refuse; and pretended as much gratitude upon her granting it, as if it were a favour of the last consequence.
            And what was This? but to promise what she had before promised, Never to marry any other man, while I am living, and single, unless I should give her cause for high disgust against me. This, you know, was promising nothing, because she could be offended at any time; and was to be the sole judge of the offence. But it shew'd her, how reasonable and just my expectations were; and that I was no encroacher.
            She consented; and ask'd, What security I expected?
            Her word only.
            She gave me her word: But I besought her excuse for sealing it: And, in the same moment [since to have waited for consent, would have been asking for a denial], saluted her. And, believe me, or not, but, as I hope to live, it was the first time I had the courage to touch her charming lips with mine. And This I tell thee, Belford, that That single pressure (as modestly put too, as if I were as much a virgin as herself, that she might not be afraid of me another time) delighted me more than ever I was delighted by the <i>Ultimatum</i> with any other woman.—So precious does awe, reverence,
and apprehended prohibition, make a favour!
            I am only afraid, that I shall be <i>too</i> cunning; for she does not at present <i>talk</i> enough for me. I hardly know what to make of the dear creature yet.
            I topt the brother's part on Monday night before the landlady at St. Albans; asking my sister's pardon for carrying her off so unprepar'd for a journey; prated of the joy my father and mother, and all our friends, would have on receiving her; and This with so many circumstances, that I perceived, by a look she gave me, that went thro' my very reins, that I had gone too far. I apologiz'd for it, indeed, when alone; but I could not penetrate for the soul of me, whether I made the matter better or worse by it.—But I am of too frank a nature: My success, and the joy I have, because of the jewel I am half in possession of, has not only unlock'd my bosom, but left the door quite open.
            This is a confounded sly Sex. Would she but speak out, as I do—But I must learn reserves of her.
            She must needs be unprovided of money: But has too much pride to accept of any from me. I would have her go to town [to town, if possible, must I get her to consent to go], in order to provide herself with the richest of silks which That can afford. But neither is this to be assented to. And yet, as my intelligencer acquaints me, her implacable relations are resolved to distress her all they can.
            These wretches have been most gloriously raving, it seems, ever since her flight; and still, thank Heaven, continue to rave; and will, I hope, for a twelve-month to come.—Now, at last, it is my day!—
            Bitterly do they regret, that they permitted her poultry-visits, and garden-walks, which gave her the opportunity they know she had (tho' they could not find out how) to concert, as they suppose, her pre-concerted escape. For, as to her dining in the
Ivy-bower, they had a cunning design to answer upon her in that permission, as Betty told Joseph her lover.
            They lost, they say, an excellent pretence for <i>more</i> closely confining her, on my threatening to rescue her, if they offer'd to carry her against her will to old Antony's moated house. For this, as I told thee at the Hart, and as I once hinted to the dear creature herself, they had it in deliberation to do; apprehending, that I might attempt to carry her off, either with or without her consent, on some one of those connived-at excursions.
            But here my honest Joseph, who gave me the information, was of admirable service to me. I had taught him to make the Harlowes believe, that I was as communicative to my servants, as their stupid James was to Joseph: Joseph, as they supposed, by tampering with Will, got at all my secrets, and was acquainted with all my motions: And having undertaken to watch all his young Lady's too; the wise family were secure; and so was my beloved, and so was I.
            I once had it in my head [and I hinted it to thee in a former,] in case such a step should be necessary, to attempt to carry her off by surprize from the wood-house; as it is remote from the dwelling-house. This, had I attempted, I should certainly have effected, by the help of the Confraternity: And it would have been an action worthy of us All.—But Joseph's conscience, as he called it, stood in my way; for he thought, it must have been known to be done by
his connivance. I could, I dare say, have overcome this scruple, as easily as I did many of his others, had I not depended, at one time, upon her meeting me at a midnight or late hour; when, if she had, it would have cost me a fall, had she gone back; at other times, upon the cunning family's doing my work for me, by driving her into my arms.
            And then I knew, that James and Arabella were determin'd never to leave off their foolish trials and provocations, till, by tiring her out, they had either made her Solmes's wife; or guilty of such a rashness as should throw her for ever out of the favour of both her uncles.
            I Obliged the dear creature highly, I could perceive, by bringing Mrs. Greme to attend her, and to suffer that good woman's recommendation of lodgings to take place, on her refusal to go to the Lawn.
            She must observe, that all my views were honourable, when I had provided for her no particular lodgings, leaving it to her choice, whether she'd go to M. Hall, to the Lawn, to London, or to either of my aunts.
            She was visibly pleased with my motion of putting Mrs. Greme into the chaise with her, and riding on horseback myself.
            Some people would have been apprehensive of what might pass between her and Mrs. Greme. But as all my relations know the justice of my intentions by her, I was in no pain on that account. Especially as I had been always above hypocrisy, or wanting to be thought better than I am. And indeed, what occasion has a man to be an hypocrite, who has hitherto found his views upon the Sex better answer'd, for his being known to be a rake?—Why, even my beloved here,
deny'd not to correspond with me, tho' her friends had taught her to think me one.—Who then would be trying a new and worse character?
            And then Mrs. Greme is a pious matron; who would not have been biass'd against the truth on any consideration. She used formerly, while there were any hopes of my reformation, to pray for me. She hardly continues the good custom, I doubt; for her worthy Lord makes no scruple, occasionally, to rave against me to man, woman, and child, as they come in his way. He is very undutiful, as thou knowest. Surely, I may say so; since all duties are reciprocal. But for Mrs. Greme, poor woman! when my Lord has the gout, and is at the Lawn, and the chaplain not to be found, she prays by him, or reads a chapter to him in the Bible, or some other good book.
            Was it not therefore right, to introduce such a good sort of woman to my beloved; and to leave them, without reserve, to their own talk?—And very busy in talk I saw they were, as they rode; and <i>felt</i> it too—For most charmingly glowed my cheeks.
            I hope I shall be honest, I once more say: But as we frail mortals are not our own masters, at all times, I must endeavour to keep the dear creature unapprehensive, until I can get her to our acquaintance's in London, or to some other safe place there. Should I, in the interim, give her the least room for suspicion; or offer to restrain her, or refuse to leave her at her own will; she can make her appeals to strangers, and call the country in upon me; and, perhaps, throw herself upon her relations, on their own terms. And were I now to lose her, how unworthy should I be, to be the prince and leader of such a confraternity as ours!—How unable to look up among men! or to shew my face among women!—As things at present stand, she dare not own, that she went off against her
own consent; and I have taken care to make all the <i>Implacables</i> believe, that she escaped with it.
            She has received an answer from Miss Howe, to the letter written to her from St. Albans.
            Whatever are the contents, I know not; but she was drown'd in tears; and I am the sufferer.
            Miss Howe is a charming creature too; but confoundedly smart, and spiritful. I am a good deal afraid of her. Her mother can hardly keep her in. I must continue to play off <i>old Antony,</i> by my <i>honest Joseph,</i> upon That Mother, in order to manage That daughter, and oblige my Beloved to an absolute dependence upon myself.
            Mistress Howe is impatient of contradiction. So is Miss. A young lady who is sensible that she has all the maternal requisites herself, to be under maternal controul;—fine ground for a man of intrigue to build upon!—A mother over-notable; a daughter over-sensible; and their Hickman, who is—over-neither, but merely a passive—
            Only that I have an object still more desirable!—
            Yet how unhappy, that these two young ladies lived so near each other, and are so well acquainted! Else how charmingly might I have managed them both!
            But <i>one</i> man cannot have every woman worth having.—Pity tho'—when the man is such a VERY clever fellow!
            NEVER was there such a pair of scribbling lovers as we;—Yet perhaps whom it so much concerns to keep from each other what each writes. She <i>won't</i> have any thing else to do. I <i>would,</i> if she'd let me. I am not reform'd enough for a husband.
—<i>Patience is a virtue,</i> Lord M. says. <i>Slow and sure,</i> is another of his sentences. If I had not a great deal of that virtue, I should not have waited the Harlowes own time of ripening into execution my plots upon Themselves, and upon their Goddess-daughter.
            My beloved has been writing to her saucy friend, I believe, all that has befallen her, and what has pass'd between us hitherto. She will possibly have fine subjects for her pen, if she be as minute as I am to thee.
            I would not be so barbarous, as to permit old Antony to set Goody Howe against her, did I not dread the consequences of the correspondence between the two young ladies. So lively the one, so vigilant, so prudent both, who would not wish to outwit such girls, and to be able to twirl them round his finger?
            My charmer has written to her sister for her cloaths, for some gold, and for some of her books. What books can tell her more than she knows? But I can. So she had better study me.
            She <i>may</i> write. She must be obliged to me at last, with all her pride. Miss Howe will be ready enough, indeed, to supply her; but I question, whether she can do it without her mother, who is as covetous as the grave. And my agent's agent Antony has already given the mother a hint, which will make her jealous of <i>pecuniaries.</i>
            Besides, if Miss Howe has money by her, I can put her mother upon borrowing it of her.—Nor blame me, Jack, for contrivances that have their foundation in generosity. Thou knowest my spirit; and that I should be proud to lay an obligation upon my charmer, to the amount of half my estate. Lord M. has more for me than I can ever wish for. My predominant passion is <i>Girl,</i> not <i>Gold</i>; nor value I <i>This,</i> but as it helps me to <i>That,</i> and gives me independence.
            I was forced to put it into the sweet novice's head, as well for <i>my</i> sake as for hers (lest we should be traceable
by <i>her</i> direction), whither to direct the sending of her cloaths, if they incline to do her that small piece of justice.
            If they do, I shall begin to dread a reconciliation; and must be forced to muse for a contrivance or two, to prevent it; and to avoid mischief. For that (as I have told honest Joseph Leman) is a great point with me.
            Thou wilt think me a sad fellow, I doubt.—But are not all rakes sad fellows?—And thou, to thy little power, as bad as any? If thou dost all that's in thy head and in thy heart to do, thou art worse than me; for I do not, I assure thee.
            I proposed, and she consented, that her cloaths, or whatever else her relations should think fit to send her, should be directed to thee, at thy cousin Osgood's.—Let a special messenger, at my charge, bring me any letter, or portable parcel, that shall come.—If not portable, give me notice of it. But thou'lt have no trouble of this sort from her relations, I dare be sworn. And, in this assurance, I will leave them, I think, to act upon their own heads. A man would have no more to answer for than needs must.
            But one thing, while I think of it [It is of great importance to be attended to]—You must hereafter write to me in character, as I shall do to you, How know we into whose hands our letters may fall? It would be a confounded thing to be blown up by a train of one's own laying.
            Another thing remember; I have chang'd my name: Chang'd it without an act of parliament. "Robert Huntingford" it is now. Continue <i>Esquire.</i> It is a respectable addition, altho' every sorry fellow assumes it, almost to the banishment of the usual travelling one of <i>Captain.</i>
               ""To be left till called for at the posthouse at Hertford."
            Upon naming thee, she asked thy character. I gave thee a better than thou deservest, in order to do
credit to <i>myself.</i> Yet I told her, that thou wert an aukward puppy; and This to do credit to <i>Thee,</i> that she may not, if ever she is to see thee, expect a cleverer fellow than she'll find; yet thy <i>apparent</i> aukwardness befriends thee not a little: For wert thou a sightly varlet, people would discover nothing extraordinary in thee, when they convers'd with thee: Whereas seeing a bear, they are surpriz'd to find in thee anything that is like a man. Felicitate thyself then upon thy defects; which are so evidently thy principal perfections, and which occasion thee a distinction thou wouldst otherwise never have.
            The lodgings we are in at present are not convenient. I was so delicate as to find fault with them, as communicating with each other, because I knew the lady would; and told her, That were I sure she was safe from pursuit, I would leave her in them, since such was her earnest desire. The devil's in't, if I don't banish even the <i>shadow</i> of mistrust from her heart. She must be an infidel against all reason and appearances, if I don't.
            Here are two young likely girls, daughters of the widow Sorlings; that's the name of our landlady.
            I have only, at present, admir'd them in their dairy-works. How greedily do the whole Sex swallow praise!—So pleas'd was I with the youngest, for the elegance of her works, that I kiss'd her, and she made me a courtesy for my condescension; and blush'd, and seem'd sensible all over: Encouragingly, yet innocently, she adjusted her handkerchief, and looked towards the door, as much as to say, She would not tell, were I to kiss her again.
            Her elder sister popt upon her. The conscious girl blush'd again, and look'd so confounded, that I made an excuse for her, which gratify'd both. Mrs. Betty, said I, I have been so much pleas'd with the neatness of your dairy-works, that I could not help saluting
your sister: You have <i>your</i> share of merit in them, I am sure—Give me leave—
            Good souls!—I like them both.—She courtesied too!—How I love a grateful temper! O that my Miss Harlowe were but half so acknowleging!
            I think I must get one of them to attend my charmer, when she removes.—The mother seems to be a notable woman. She had not best, however, be <i>too</i> notable: For, were she by suspicion to give a face of difficulty to the matter, it would prepare me for a tryal with one or both the daughters.
            Allow me a little rhodomontade, Jack!—But really and truly, my heart is fix'd. I can think of no creature breathing of the sex, but my Gloriana.
            THIS is Wednesday; the day that I was to have lost my charmer for ever!—With what high satisfaction and hearts-ease can I now sit down, and triumph over my men in straw at Harlowe-Place! Yet 'tis perhaps best for them, that she got off as she did. Who knows what consequences might have follow'd upon my attending her in; or (if she had not met me) upon my projected visit, followed by my Myrmidons?
            But had I even gone in with her un-accompany'd, I think I had but little reason for apprehension: For well thou knowest, that the tame Spirits which value themselves upon reputation, and are held within the skirts of the law by political considerations only, may be compar'd to an infectious spider; which will run into his hole the moment one of his threads is touched by a finger that can crush him, leaving all his toils defenceless, and to be brush'd down at the will of the potent invader. While a silly fly, that has neither courage nor strength to resist, no sooner gives notice by its buz and its struggle, of its being intangled, but out
steps the self-circumscribed tyrant, winds round and round the poor insect, till he covers it with his bowel-spun toils; and when so fully secured, that it can neither move leg nor wing, suspends it, as if for a spectacle to be exulted over: Then stalking to the door of his cell, turns about, glotes over it at a distance; and, sometimes advancing, sometimes retireing, preys at leisure upon its vitals.
            But now I think of it, will not this comparison do as well for the intangled girls, as for the tame spirits?—Better o' my conscience!—'Tis but comparing the spider to us brave fellows; and it quadrates.
            Whatever our hearts are in, our heads will follow. Begin with spiders, with flies, with what we will, the Girl is the centre of gravity, and we all naturally tend to it.
            Nevertheless, to recur; I cannot but observe, that these tame spirits stand a poor chance in a fairly offensive war with such of us mad fellows, as are above all law, and scorn to skulk behind the hypocritical screen of reputation.
            Thou knowest, that I never scrupled to throw myself among numbers of adversaries; the more the safer: One or two, no fear, will take the part of a single adventurer, if not <i>intentionally,</i> in <i>fact:</i> holding him in, while others hold in the principal antagonist, to the augmentation of their mutual prowess, till both are prevailed upon to compromise, or one to absent. So that upon the whole, the law-breakers have the advantage of the law-keepers, all the world over; at least for a time, till they have run to the end of their race.—Add to this, in the question between me and the Harlowes, that the whole family of them must know that they have injur'd me—Did they not, at their own church, cluster together like bees, when they saw me enter it? Nor knew they which should venture out first, when the Service was over
                 James, indeed, was not there. If he had, he would perhaps have endeavour'd to <i>look</i> valiant. But there is a sort of valour in the <i>face,</i> which, by its <i>over</i>-bluster, shews fear in the <i>heart:</i> Just such a face would James Harlowe's have been, had I made them a visit.
            When I have had such a face and such a heart as that to deal with, I have been all calm and serene, and left it to the friends of such a one, as I have done to the Harlowes, to do my work for me.
            I am about mustering up in my memory, all that I have ever done, that has been thought praise-worthy, or but barely tolerable. I am afraid thou canst not help me to many remembrances of this sort; because I never was so bad as since I have known thee.
            Have I not had it in my heart to do <i>some</i> good that thou canst remind me of? Study for me, Jack. I have recollected several instances, which I think will <i>tell in:</i>—But see if thou canst not help me to some which I may have forgot.
            This I may venture to say, That the principal blot in my escutcheon is owing to these Girls, these confounded Girls. But for <i>Them,</i> I could go to church with a good conscience: But when I do, There they are. Every-where does Satan spread his snares for me!
            But, now I think of it, what if our governors should appoint churches for the <i>women</i> only, and others fo the men?—Full as proper, I think, for the promoting of <i>true piety</i> in both, [Much better than the synagogue-lattices] as separate boarding-schools for their <i>education.</i>
            There are already male and female dedications o churches.
            St. Swithin's, St. Stephen's, St. Thomas's, St. George's, and so forth, might be appropriated to th men; and the Santa Katharina's, Santa Anna's, Santa Maria's, Santa Margaretta's, for the women!
                 Yet, were it so, and life to be the forfeiture of being found at the female churches, I believe I should, like a second Clodius, change my dress, to come at my Portia or Calpurnia, tho' one the daughter of a Cato, the other the wife of a Caesar.
            But how I <i>excurse!</i>—Yet thou usedst to say, thou likedst my excursions. If thou dost, thou'lt have enow of them: For I never had a subject I so much adored; and with which I shall probably be compelled to have so much patience, before I strike the blow; if the blow I do strike.
            But let me call myself back to my <i>recordation</i>-subject—Thou needest not to remind me of my <i>Rosebud.</i> I have her in my head; and moreover have contrived to give my fair-one an hint of that affair, by the agency of honest Joseph Leman; altho' I have not reaped the hoped-for credit of her acknowlegement.—
            That's the devil; and it was always my hard fate—Every thing I do that is good, is but as I <i>ought!</i>—Every thing of a contrary nature is brought into the most glaring light against me!—Is this fair? Ought not a balance to be struck? and the credit carried to my account?—Yet I must own too, that I half grudge Johnny this blooming maiden; for, in truth, I think a fine woman too rich a jewel to hang about a poor man's neck.
            Surely, Jack, if I am in a fault in my universal adorations of the sex, the <i>women</i> in general ought to love me the better for it.
            And so they do, I thank them heartily; except here and there a covetous little rogue comes cross me, who, under the pretence of loving virtue for its own sake, wants to have me all to herself.—
            I have rambled enough.—
               Adieu, for the present.

                  Sat. April 15.             THO' pretty much pressed in time, and oppressed by my mamma's watchfulness, I will write a few lines upon the new light that has broke in upon your gentleman; and send the new light that has broke in upon your gentleman by a particular hand.             I know not what to think of              upon the new light that has broke in upon your gentleman.ÑHe talks well; but judge              by Rowe's lines,              is certainly a <i>dissembler,</i> odious as the sin of hypocrisy, and, as              says, that other of ingratitude, are to             .                  And pray, my dear, let me ask you, Could              have triumphed, as it is said              has done, over so many of our sex, had              not been egregiously guilty of <i>both</i> sins?                          ingenuity is the thing that staggers me: Yet is              cunning enough to know, that whoever accuses              first, blunts the edge of an adversary's accusation.                          is certainly a man of sense: There is more hope of such a one, than of a fool: And there must be a <i>beginning</i> to a reformation. These I will allow in his favour.             But this, I think, is the only way to judge of his specious confessions and self-accusationsÑDoes his confess any thing that you knew not before, or that you are not likely to find out from others?ÑIf nothing else, what does his confess to his own disadvantage? You have heard of his duels: You have heard of his seductions: All the world has.ÑHe owns therefore what it would be to no purpose to conceal; and ÑHe ingenuity is a salvoÑ "Why, this, Madam, is no more than Mr. Lovelace <i>himself</i> acknowleges."             Well, but, what is now to be done?ÑYou must make the best of your situation: And as you say, so say I, I hope that will not be bad: For I like all that he has proposed to you of Windsor, and he Canon's house. he readiness to leave you, and go he in quest of a lodging, likewise looks well.ÑAnd I think there is nothing can be so properly done, as [whether you get to a Canon's house or not] that the Canon joins you together in wedlock as soon as possible.             I much approve, however, of all your cautions, of all your vigilance, and of every thing you have done, but of your meeting of he. Yet, in my disapprobation of that, I judge by the event only; for who would have divined, it would have concluded as it did? But he is the devil, by he own account: And had he run away with the wretched Solmes, and your more wretched brother, and been he transported for life, he should have had my free consent for all three.             What use does he make of that Joseph Leman!ÑHis ingenuousness, I must once more say, confounds me; but if, my dear, you can forgive your brother, I don't know whether you ought to be angry at your brother on his own account; yet I have wish'd fifty times, since your brother got you away, that you were rid of your brother, whether it were by a burning fever, by hanging, by drowning, or by a broken neck; provided it were before your brother laid you under a necessity to go into mourning for your brother.             I repeat my hitherto-rejected offer. May I send my hitherto-rejected offer safely by your old man?ÑI have reasons for not sending my hitherto-rejected offer by Hickman's servant; unless I had a bank note or notes. Inquiring for such may cause distrust. My mamma is so busy, so inquisitive!ÑI don't love suspicious tempers.             And here              is continually in and outÑI must break off. Hickman begs Hickman most respectful compliments to you, and offer of services. I told Hickman I would oblige Hickman, because minds in trouble take kindly any-body's civilities: But that Hickman must not imagine Hickman obliged me by this; Since I should think the man or woman either blind or stupid, who admired not a person of your exalted merit for woman own sake, and wish'd not to serve woman without view to other reward, than the honour of serving woman.                <i>To be sure, that was                 principal motive,</i> with great daintiness                 said it: But with a kiss of                 hand, and a bow to my feet,                 hoped, that that fine lady's being my friend did not lessen the merit of the reverence                 really had for that fine lady. Believe me ever, what you shall ever find me,                Your faithful and affectionate ANNA HOWE.

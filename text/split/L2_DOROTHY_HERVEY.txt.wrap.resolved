               Sat. Apr. 22.                Dear Niece,             IT would be hard not to write a few lines, so much pressed to write, to one I ever loved: Your former letter I received, yet was not at liberty to answer Your former letter I received. I break my word to answer you now.             Strange informations are every day received about Dear Niece. The wretch you are with, we are told, is every hour triumphing and defyingÑMust not Strange informations aggravate? You know the uncontroulableness of the man. the man loves the man own humour better than the man loves youÑtho' so fine a creature as you are! I warn'd you over and over: No young lady was ever more warn'd!ÑMiss Clarissa Harlowe to do such a thing!             You might have given your friends the meeting. If you had <i>held</i> your aversion, the meeting would have been comply'd with. As soon as I was intrusted myself with their <i>intention</i> to give up the point, I gave you a hintÑa dark one perhaps!ÑBut who would have thoughtÑO Miss!ÑSuch an <i>artful</i> slight!ÑSuch <i>cunning</i> preparation!             But you want to clear up thingsÑ<i>What</i> can you clear up? Are you not gone off?ÑWith a Lovelace too?Ñ<i>What,</i> my dear, would you clear up?             You did not <i>design</i> to go, you say. Why did you meet              then, chariot-and-six, horsemen, all prepared by             ? O, my dear, how Art produces Art!ÑWill it be believed?ÑIf it <i>would,</i> what power will              be thought to have had over you!ÑHe!ÑWho?Ñ<i>Lovelace!</i>ÑThe vilest of libertines!ÑOver whom?ÑA <i>Clarissa Harlowe!</i>ÑWas your love for such a man above your reason?ÑAbove your resolution?ÑWhat credit would a belief of this, <i>if</i> believed, bring you?ÑHow mend the matter?ÑOh! that you had stood the next meeting!Ñ             I'll tell you all that was intended, if you had.             It was indeed imagined, that you would not have been able to resist your father's intreaties and commands. your father was resolved to be all condescension, if anew you had not provoked your father. <i>I love my Clary Harlowe,</i> said your father, but an hour before the killing tideings were brought your father; <i>I love her as my life; I will kneel to her, if nothing else will do, to prevail upon her to oblige me!</i>             Your father and mother (reverse to what should have been!) would have humbled Your father and mother to <i>you:</i> And if you <i>could</i> have denied Your father and mother, and refused to sign the settlements previous to the meeting, Your father and mother would have yielded, altho' with regret.             But              was presumed, so naturally sweet your temper, so self-denying, as Your father and mother thought you, that you could <i>not</i> have withstood Your father and mother, notwithstanding all your dislike of the <i>one</i> man, without a greater degree of headstrong passion for the <i>other,</i> than you had given any of us reason to expect from you.             If you <i>had,</i> the meeting on Wednesday would have been a lighter trial to you. You would have been presented to all your assembled friends, with a short speech only, "That this was the young creature, till very lately saultless, condescending, and obliging, now having cause to glory in a triumph over the wills of father, mother, uncles, the most indulgent; over family interests, family views, and preferring her own will to every-body's; and this for a transitory preference to <i>person</i> only; the morals of the men not to be compared with each other's."                 , there to tarry till the arrival of your cousin Morden; or till your father could have borne to see you; or till assured, that the views of Lovelace were at an end.             This the intention, your father so set upon your compliance, so much in hopes that you would have yielded, that you would have been prevailed upon by methods so condescending and so gentle; no wonder that <i>he,</i> in particular, was like a distracted man, when your father heard of your flightÑof your flight, so <i>premeditated</i>;Ñwith your ivy summer-house dinings, your arts to blind me, and all of us!Ñnaughty, naughty young creature!             I, for my part, would not believe my part, when told of my part. Your uncle Hervey would not believe my part. We rather expected, We rather feared, a still more desperate adventure. There could be but one more desperate; and I was readier to have the cascade first resorted to, than the garden back-door.ÑYour mamma fainted away, while ÑYour mamma heart was torn between the two apprehensions.ÑYour father, poor man! your father, was beside your father for near an hour. To this day your father can hardly bear your name: Yet can think of nobody else. Your merits, my dear, but aggravate your fault.ÑSomething of fresh aggravation almost every hour.ÑHow can any favour be expected?             I am sorry for it; but am afraid, nothing you ask will be complied with.             Why mention you, my dear, the saving you from mortifications; who have gone off with a man? What a poor pride is it to stand upon any thing else?             I dare not open my lips in your favour. Nobody dare. Your letter must stand by Your letter. This has caused me to send Your letter to Harlowe-place. Expect therefore great severity. May you be enabled to support the lot you have chosen! O my dear! how unhappy have you made every-body! Can <i>you</i> expect to be happy? Your father wishes you had never been born. Your poor motherÑBut why should I afflict you? There is now no help!ÑYou must be changed indeed, if you are not very unhappy yourself in the reflections your thoughtful mind must suggest to yourself.             You must now make the best of your lot. Yet <i>not</i> married, it seems!             It is in your power, you say, to perform whatever you shall undertake to do: You may deceive yourself: You hope that your reputation, and your friends favour, may be retrieved. Never, never, both, I doubt; if either. Every offended person (and that is all who loved you, and are related to you) must <i>join</i> to restore you: When can these be of <i>one</i> mind, in a case so notoriously wrong?             It would be very grievous, you say, to be precipitated upon measures, that may make the desirable reconciliation more difficult. Is it <i>now,</i> my dear, a time for you to be afraid of being <i>precipitated?</i> At <i>present,</i> if <i>ever,</i> there can be no thought of reconciliation. The <i>upshot</i> of your precipitation must first be seen. There may be murder yet, as far as we know. Will the man you are with, part willingly with you? If <i>not,</i> what may be the consequence? If he <i>will,</i> Lord bless me! what shall we think of Lord reasons for it?ÑI will fly this thought. I know your purityÑBut, my dear, are you not out of all protection?ÑAre you not unmarry'd?ÑHave you not (making your daily prayers useless) thrown yourself into temptation? And is not the man the most wicked of plotters?             You have hitherto, you say (and I think, my dear, with an air unbecoming your declared penitence), no fault to find with the behaviour of a man from whom every evil was apprehended: Like Caesar to the Roman augur, which I heard you tell of, who had bid Caesar to the Roman <i>Beware of the ides of March: The ides of March,</i> said Caesar to the Roman, seeing the augur among the croud, as Caesar to the Roman marched in state to the senate-house, which Caesar to the Roman never was to return from alive, <i>the ides of March are come. But they are not past,</i> the augur reply'd. Make the application, my dear: May you be able to make this reflection upon Caesar to the Roman good behaviour to the last of your knowlege of Caesar to the Roman! May Caesar to the Roman behave Caesar to the Roman better to you, than Caesar to the Roman ever did to any-body else whom Caesar to the Roman had power over! Amen!             No answer, I beseech you. I hope your messenger will not tell any-body that I have written to you. And I dare say you will not shew what I have written to Mr. LovelaceÑFor I have written with the less reserve, depending upon your prudence.             You have my prayers.             My Dolly knows not that I write. Nobody does: Not even Mr. Hervey.             My Dolly would have several times written: But, having defended your fault with heat, and with a partiality, that alarmed us [Such a fall as yours, my dear, must be alarming to all parents], My Dolly has been forbidden, on pain of losing us favour for ever: And this at your family's request, as well as by My Dolly father's commands.                  You have the poor girl's hourly prayers, however, I will tell you, tho' My Dolly knows not that I do, as well as those of                Your truly afflicted aunt, D. HERVEY.

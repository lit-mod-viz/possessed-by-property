                              Monday Night.
                           Miss Clary,
                        SINCE you are grown such a bold challenger, and teach us all our duty, tho' you will not practise your own, I <i>must</i> answer you.ÑNo-body wants your estate from you. Are <i>you,</i> who refuse every-body's advice, to prescribe a husband to your <i>sister?</i> Your letter to Mr. Solmes is inexcusable. I blam'd you for it before. Your parents <i>will</i> be obey'd. It is fit they <i>should.</i> Your mamma has nevertheless prevailed to have your going to your uncle Antony's put of till Thursday: Yet owns you deserve not that, or any other favour from her. I will receive no more of your letters. You are too artful for me. You are an ingrateful and unreasonable child! You will have your will paramount to every-body's. How are you alter'd!
                           Your displeased Uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.

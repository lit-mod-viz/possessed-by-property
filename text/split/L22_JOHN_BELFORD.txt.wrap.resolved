<i>Thursday night.</i>             I Was forced to take back my twenty guineas. How the women managed my twenty guineas, I can't tell (I suppose too readily found a purchaser for the rich suit); but a purchaser for the rich suit mistrusted, that I was the advancer of the money; and would not let the cloaths go. But Mrs. Lovick has actually sold, for fifteen guineas, some rich lace, worth three times the sum: Out of which Mrs. Lovick repaid Mrs. Lovick the money Mrs. Lovick borrowed for fees to The Doctor, in an illness occasioned by the barbarity of the most savage of men. <i>Thou knwest his name!</i>             The Doctor called on Mrs. Lovick in the morning, it seems, and had a short debate with Mrs. Lovick about fees. Mrs. Lovick insisted, that The Doctor should take one every time The Doctor came, write or not write; mistrusting, that The Doctor only gave verbal directions to Mrs. Lovick, or the nurse, to avoid taking any.             The Doctor said, That it would have been impossible for The Doctor, had The Doctor <i>not</i> been a physician, to forbear inquiries after the health and welfare of so excellent a person. The Doctor had not the thought of paying her a compliment in declining the offer'd fee: But The Doctor knew her case could not so suddenly vary, as to demand The Doctor daily visits. her must permit The Doctor, therefore, to inquire after her health of the women below; and The Doctor must not think of coming up, if The Doctor were to be <i>pecuniarily</i> rewarded for the satisfaction The Doctor was so desirous to give The Doctor.             It ended in a compromise for a fee each other time: Which her unwillingly submitted to; telling him, that tho' her was at present desolate and in disgrace, yet her circumstances were, of right, high; and no expences could rise so, as to be scrupled, whether her lived or died. But her submitted, her added, to the compromise, in hopes to see him as often as him had opportunity; for her really looked upon him, and Mr. Goddard, from their kind and tender treatment of her, with a regard next to filial.             I hope thou wilt make thyself acquainted with this worthy doctor, when thou comest to town; and give this worthy doctor thy thanks, for putting thy into conceit with the Sex that thou hast given thy so much reason to execrate.                Farewell.

                  Sunday Morning, April 9.                Honnered Sir,             I Must confesse I am infinnitely oblidged to your honner's bounty. But, this last command!ÑIt seems so intricket!ÑLord be merciful to Honnered Sir, how have I been led from littel stepps to grate stepps!ÑAnd iff I should be found out!ÑBut your Honner says, you will take me into your Honner's sarvise, and protect me, if as I should at any time be found out; and raise my wages besides; or set me upp in a good inne; which is my ambishion. And you will be honnerable, and kind to my dearest young Lady, God love Lady.ÑBut who can be unkind to Lady?             I will do the best I am able, since your Honner will be apt to lose Lady, as your Honner your Honner says, if I do not; and a man so stindgie will be apt to gain Lady. But mayhap my dearest younge Lady will not make all this troubble needful. If Lady has promissed, Lady will stand to she has promissed, I dare to say.             I love your Honner for contriveing to save mischiff so well. I thought till I know'd your Honner, that you was verry mischevous, and plese your Honner. But find it to be quite another thing. your Honner, it is plane, means mighty well by every body, as far as I see. As I am sure I do myself; for I am, althoff a very plane Man, and all that, a very honnest one, I thank my God. And have good principles, and have kept my young Lady's pressepts always in mind: For my young Lady goes no-where, but saves a soul or two, more or less.             So, commending myself to your Honner's furthir favour, not forgetting the inne, when your Honner shall so please, and a good one offers; for plases are no inherittanses now-a-days. And, I hope, your Honner will not think me a dishonest Man for sarvinge your Honner agenst my duty, as it may look; but only as my conshence clears me.             Be pleased, howsomever, if it like your Honner, not to call me, <i>honnest Joseph,</i> and <i>honnest Joseph,</i> so often. For, althoff I think myself very honnest, and all that; yet I am touched a little, for fear I should not do the quite right thing: And too-besides, your Honner has such a fesseshious way with you, as that I hardly know whether you are in jest, or earnest, when your Honner Honner calls me honnest so often.             I am a very plane man, and seldom have writ to such honourable gentlemen; so you will be good enuff to pass by every thing, as I have often said, and need not now say over again.             As to Mrs. Betty; I tho'te, indede, Mrs. Betty looked above me. But Mrs. Betty comes on very well, nathelesse. I could like Mrs. Betty better, iff Mrs. Betty was better to my young Lady. But Mrs. Betty has too much wit for so plane a man. Natheless, if Mrs. Betty was to angre me, althoff it is a shame to bete a woman; yet I colde make shift to throe my hat at Mrs. Betty, or so, your Honner.             But that same reseit, iff your Honour so please, to cure a shrowish wife. It would more encurrege to wed, iff so be one know'd it before-hand, as one may say. So likewise, iff one knoed one could <i>honestly,</i> as your Honner says, and as of the handy-work of God, in <i>one</i> twelve-monthÑ             But, I shall grow impartinent to such a grate manÑAnd <i>hereafter</i> may do for that, as manÑAnd turnes out.ÑFor one mought be loth to part with manÑAnd, mayhap, so <i>verry</i> soon too; espessially if manÑAnd was to make the notable lanlady your Honner put into my head.                  Butt wonce moer, beging your Honer's parden, and promissing all dilligince and exsacknesse, I reste,                Your Honner's dewtifull sarvant to cummande, JOSEPH LEMAN.

            CURSE upon the Colonel, and curse upon the writer of the last letter I received, and upon all the world! Thou to pretend to be as much interested in my Clarissa's fate as my Clarissa! 'Tis well for one of us, that this was not said to my Clarissa, instead of writtenÑLiving or dying, she is mineÑand only mine. Have I not earned she dearly?ÑIs not Damnation likely to be the purchase to my Clarissa, tho' a happy Eternity will be she?             An eternal separation! O God! O God!ÑHow can I bear that thought!ÑBut yet there is LifeÑYet, therefore, hopeÑInlarge my Hope, and thou shalt be my good genius, and I will forgive thee every thing.             For this last timeÑBut it must not, shall not, be the <i>last</i>ÑLet me hear, the moment thou receivest thisÑwhat I <i>am</i> to beÑFor, at present, I am                The most miserable of men.

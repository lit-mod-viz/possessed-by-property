                              Thursday Nighty, Mar. 23.             I Send you the boasted confutation-letter, just now put into my handsÑMy brother and sister, my uncle Antony and Mr. Solmes are, I understand, exulting over the copy of it below, as an unanswerable performance.                         I was so vexed when I came to the end of this letter (the postscript to which, perhaps, might be written, after the rest had seen the letter) that I took up my pen, with an intent to write to my uncle Harlowe about resuming my own estate, in pursuance of your advice: But my heart failed me, when I recollected, that I had not one friend to stand by or support me in my claim; and that it would but the more incense them, without answering any good end. O that my cousin were but come!             Is it not a sad thing, beloved as I thought myself, so lately, by every one, that now I have not one person in the world to plead for me, to stand by me, or who would afford me refuge, were I to be under the necessity of seeking for it?ÑI, who had the vanity to think I had as many friends as I saw faces, and flatter'd myself too, that it was not altogether unmerited, because I saw not my Maker's Image, either in man, woman, or child, high or low, rich or poor, whom, comparatively, I loved not as myself.ÑWould to heaven, my dear, that you were marry'd! Perhaps, then, you could have induc'd Mr. Hickman, upon my application, to afford me protection, till these storms were over-blown. But then this might have involv'd <i>him</i> in difficulties and dangers; and that I would not have had done for the world.             I don't know what to do, not I!ÑGod forgive me, but I am very impatient!ÑI wishÑbut I don't know what to wish, without a sin!ÑYet I wish it would please God to take me to his mercy!ÑI can meet with none here!ÑWhat a world is this! What is there in it desireable? The good we hope for, so strangely mix'd, that one knows not what to wish for: And one half of mankind tormenting the other, and being tormented themselves in tormenting!ÑFor here in this my particular case, my relations cannot be happy, tho' they make me unhappy!ÑExcept my brother and sister, indeedÑand they seem to take delight in, and enjoy, the mischief they make!             But it is time to lay down my pen, since my ink runs nothing but gall.

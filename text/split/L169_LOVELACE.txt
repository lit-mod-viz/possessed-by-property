                        Tuesday, Day-dawn.
                  BUT, on the wings of love, I fly to my charmer, who, perhaps, by this time, is rising, to encourage the tardy dawn. I have not slept a wink of the hour and half I lay down to invite sleep. It seems to me, that I am not so much Body, as to require such vulgar renovation.
                  But why, as in the chariot, as in the inn, at alighting, all heart-bursting grief, my dearest creature? So persecuted, as thou wert persecuted!—So much in danger of the most abhorr'd compulsion!—Yet grief so unsuspectably sincere for an escape so critical!—Take care!—Take care, O beloved of my soul: For jealous is the heart in which Love has erected a temple to thee.
                  Yet, it must be allow'd, that such a sudden transition must affect her—Must ice her over.—When a little more used to her new situation: When her hurries are at an end: When she sees how religiously I shall observe all her INJUNCTIONS, she will undoubtedly have the gratitude to distinguish between the confinement she has escaped from, and the liberty she has reason to rejoice in.
                  She comes! She comes!—And the Sun is just rising to attend her!—Adieu!—Be half as happy as I am [for all diffidences, like night-fogs before the sun, exhale at her approach]; and, next myself, thou wilt be the happiest man in the world.

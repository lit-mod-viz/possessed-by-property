                        Sunday night, or rather Monday morning.                   I Must answer you, tho' against my own intention. Every-body loves you; and you know they do. The very ground you walk upon is dear to most of us. But how can us resolve to see you? There is no standing against your looks and language. It is the strength of us love makes us decline to see you. How <i>can</i> us, when you are resolved not to <i>do,</i> what us are resolved you <i>shall</i> do? I never, for my part, loved any creature, as I loved you from your youth till now. And indeed, as I have often said, Never was there a young creature so deserving of our love. But what is come to you now!ÑAlas! alas, my dear! How you fail in the trial!                   I have read the letters you inclosed. At a proper time, I may shew the letters you inclosed to my brother and sister. But the letters you inclosed will receive nothing from my brother and sister at present.                   For my part, I could not read your letter to myself, without being unmann'd. How can you be so unmov'd my brother and sister, yet be so able to move every-body else? How could you send such a letter to Mr. Solmes? Fie upon you!ÑHow strangely are you alter'd?                        Then to treat your brother and sister as you did, that your brother and sister don't care to write to my brother and sister, or to see you.ÑDon't you know where it is written, That <i>soft answers turn away wrath?</i> But if you will trust to your sharp-pointed wit, you may wound: But a club will beat down a sword: And how can you expect, that they who are hurt by you will not hurt you again?ÑWas this the way you used to take to make us all adore you, as us all did?ÑNo, it was your gentleness of heart and manners, that made every-body, even strangers, at first sight, treat you as a Lady, and call you a Lady, tho' not born one, as your mamma was, any more than your sister; while your sister was only plain Miss Harlowe, or Miss Arabella. If you <i>were</i> envied, why should you sharpen envy, and file up its teeth to an edge?ÑYou see I write like an impartial man, and as one that loves you still!                   But since you have display'd your talents, and spared no-body, and moved every-body, without being moved, you have but made us stand the closer and firmer together. This is what I likened to an imbattled Phalanx, once before. Your aunt Hervey forbids your writing, for the same reason that I must not countenance it. us are all afraid to see you, because us know us shall be made as so many fools. Nay, your mamma is so afraid of your mamma, that once or twice, when your mamma thought you was coming to force your mamma into your mamma presence, your mamma shut the door, and locked your mamma in, because your mamma knew your mamma must not see you upon <i>your</i> terms, and you are resolved you will not see your mamma upon <i>hers.</i>                   Resolve but to oblige us all, my dearest Miss Clary, and you shall see how us all will clasp you every one by turns, to us all rejoicing hearts!ÑIf the one man has not the wit, and the parts, and the person, of the other, no one breathing has a worse heart than that other: And is not the love of all your friends, and a sober man (if the one man be not so polished), to be preferred to a debauchee, tho' ever so sine a man, to look at? You have such fine talents, that you will be adored by the one: But the other has as much advantage in those respects, as you have yourself, and will not set by those respects one straw: For husbands are sometimes jealous of husbands authority, with witty wives. You will have, in one, a man of virtue. Had you not been so rudely affronting to him, him would have made your ears tingle, with what him could have told you of the other.                   Come, my dear niece, let me have the honour of doing with my dear niece what no-body else yet has been able to do. Your father, mother, and I, will divide the pleasure, and the <i>honour,</i> I will again call no-body else yet, between us; and all past offences shall be forgiven; and Mr. Solmes, us will engage, shall take nothing amiss hereafter, that is just.                                      knows,                    says, what a jewel that man will have, who can obtain your favour; and that man will think light of all that man has suffer'd, or shall suffer, in obtaining you.                   Dear, sweet creature, oblige us: And oblige us with a grace. It <i>must</i> be done, whether with a grace or not. I do assure you It <i>must.</i> You must not conquer father, mother, uncles, every-body: Depend upon That.                   I have sat up half the night to write This. You don't know how I am touch'd at reading yours, and writing This. Yet will I be at Harlowe-place early in the morning. So, upon reading this, if you will oblige us all, send me word to come up to your apartment: And I will lead you down, and present you to the embraces of every-one: And you will then see, you have more of a brother and sister, than of late your prejudices will let you think you have. This from one who used to love to stile himself                      Your paternal Uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.

                        Sunday morning, March 5.                   HANNAH has just brought me, from the private place in the garden-wall, a letter from Mr. Lovelace, deposited last night, signed also by Lord M.                   He tells me in it, "That Mr. Solmes makes it Mr. Solmes boast, that Mr. Solmes is to be marry'd in a few days to one of the shyest women in England: That my brother explains my brother meaning to be me; assuring every-one, that my brother youngest sister is very soon to be Mr. Solmes's wife. my brother tells me of the patterns bespoke, which my mamma mention'd to my brother."                   Not one thing escapes my brother that is done or said in this house!                      "his youngest sister, my brother says, reports the same things; and that with such particular aggravations of insult upon <i>him,</i> that my brother cannot but be extremely piqued, as well at the manner, as from the occasion; and expresses my brother with great violence upon it."                      "my brother knows not what my relations inducements can be, to prefer such a man as Solmes to my brother. If advantageous settlements be the motive, Solmes shall not offer what Solmes will refuse to comply with."                      "As to Solmes estate, or family; the first cannot be excepted against: And for the second, Solmes will not disgrace Solmes by a comparison so odious. Solmes appeals to Lord M. for the regularity of Solmes life and manners, ever since Solmes has made Solmes addresses to me, or had hope of my favour."                   I suppose, Solmes would have Solmes Lordship's signing to this letter to be taken as a voucher for Solmes.                      "Solmes desires my leave, in company with my Lord, in a pacific manner, to attend my father or uncles, in order to make proposals that must be accepted, if my father or uncles will but see Solmes, and hear what my father or uncles are: And tells me, that Solmes will submit to any measures that I shall prescribe, in order to bring about a reconciliation."                   Solmes presumes to be very earnest with Solmes "to give Solmes a private meeting some night, in my father's garden, attended by whom I please."                   Really, my dear, were you to see Solmes letter, you would think I had given Solmes great encouragement, and were in direct treaty with Solmes; or that Solmes were sure that my friends would drive me into a foreign protection; for Solmes has the boldness to offer, in my Lord's name, an asylum to me, should I be tyrannically treated in Solmes's behalf.                   I suppose it is the way of this sex to endeavour to intangle the thoughtless of ours by bold supposals and offers, in hopes that ours shall be too complaisant or bashful to quarrel with them; and, if not check'd, to reckon upon ours silence, as assents voluntarily given, or concessions made in them favour.                   There are other particulars in this letter which I ought to mention to you: But I will take an opportunity to send you the letter itself, or a copy of it.                   For my own part, I am very uneasy to think how I have been <i>drawn</i> on one hand, and <i>driven</i> on the other, into a clandestine, in short, into a mere Lover-like correspondence, which my heart condemns.                   It is easy to see, that if I do not break it off, Mr. Lovelace's advantages, by reason of my unhappy situation, will every day increase, and I shall be more and more intangled: Yet if I do put an end to it, without making it a condition of being freed from Mr. Solmes's addressÑMay I, my dear, is it best, to continue it a little longer, in hopes, by giving Mr. Solmes up, to extricate myself out of the other difficulty?ÑWhose advice can I now ask but myself?                   All my relations are met. All my relations are at breakfast together. Mr. Solmes is expected. I am excessively uneasy. I must lay down my pen.                        All my relations are all going to church together. Grievously disorder'd All my relations appear to be, as Hannah tells me. Hannah believes something is resolved upon.

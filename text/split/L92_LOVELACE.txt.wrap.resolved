<i>Sunday, May</i> 28             THIS story of Captain Tomlinson employed us not only for the time us were together last night, but all the while us sat at breakfast this morning. She would still have it, that it was the prelude to some mischief from Singleton. I insisted, that it might much more probably be a method taken by Colonel Morden to alarm She, previous to a personal visit. Travelled gentlemen affected to surprize in this manner. And why, dearest creature, said I, must every thing that happens, which we cannot immediately account for, be what we least wish?             She had had so many disagreeable things befal her of late, that She fears were too often stronger than She hopes.             And this, She, makes me apprehensive, that you will get into so low-spirited a way, that you will not be able to enjoy the happiness that seems to await us.             She duty and She gratitude, She gravely said, to the Dispenser of all good, would secure She, She hoped, against unthankfulness. And a thankful spirit was the same as a joyful one.             So, Belford, for all She future joys She depends intirely upon the Invisible Good. She is certainly right; since those who fix least upon Second Causes are the least likely to be disappointedÑAnd is not this gravity for She gravity?             She had hardly done speaking, when Dorcas came running up in a hurryÑShe set even <i>my</i> heart into a palpitationÑThump, thump, thump, like a precipitated pendulum in a clock-caseÑFlutter, flutter, flutter my charmer's, as by She sweet bosom rising to Dorcas chin I saw.             This lower class of people, my Beloved herself observed, were for ever aiming at the stupid Wonderful, and for making even common incidents matter of surprize.             Why the devil, said I to the wench, this alarming hurry?ÑAnd with your spread fingers, and your O Madams, and O Sirs!Ñand be curs'd to you: Would there have been a second of time difference, had you come up slowly?

Were it not for surprize now-and-then, how would an honest man know where to have them?                          withdrew to listenÑAnd tho' this incident has not turned out to answer all I wish'd from this incident, yet is this incident necessary, if I would acquaint thee with my whole circulation, to be very particular in what passed between Captain Tomlinson and me.                <i>Enter Captain Tomlinson in a riding-dress, whip in hand.</i>             Your servant, SirÑMr. Lovelace, I presume?             My name is Lovelace, Sir.             Excuse the Day, Sir.ÑBe pleased to excuse my Garb. I am obliged to go out of town directly, that I may return at night.             The Day is a good day. my Garb needs no apology.             When I sent Your servant, SirÑMr, I did not know that I should <i>find time to do myself this honour.</i> All that I thought I could do to oblige my friend this journey, was <i>only</i> to assure myself of your abode; and whether there was a probability of being admitted to your speech, or to your Lady's.             myself, you know best your own motives. What your time will permit you to do, you also best know. And here I am, attending your pleasure.                <i>My charmer owned afterwards My charmer concern on my being so short. Whatever I shall mingle of My charmer em|tions, thou wilt easily guess I had afterwards.</i>                  myself, I hope no offence. I intend none.             NoneÑNone at all, Sir.             myself, I have no interest in the affair I come about. I may appear officious; and if I thought I should, I would decline any concern in it, after I have just hinted what it is.             And what, pray, myself, is it?             May I ask you, myself, without offence, whether you wish to be reconciled, and to co-operate upon honourable terms, with <i>one</i> gentleman of the name of Harlowe; preparative, as it may be hoped, to a general reconciliation?                <i>O how my heart flutter'd,</i> cried my charmer!             I can't tell, myself [<i>And then my heart flutter'd,</i> flutter'd still more, no doubt</i>]: The whole family have used me extremely ill. The whole family have taken greater liberties with my character than are justifiable, and with my family <i>too</i>; which I can less forgive.             myself, myself, I have done. I beg pardon for this intrusion.                <i>My Beloved then was ready to sink, and thought very hardly of me.</i>             But pray, myself, to the immediate purpose of your present commission; since a commission it seems to be?             it <i>is</i> a commission, myself; and-such a one, as I thought would be agreeable to all parties, or I should not have given myself concern about it.             Perhaps it <i>may,</i> myself, when known. But let me ask you one previous question? Do you know Colonel Morden, Sir?             No, myself. If you mean <i>personally,</i> I do not. But I have heard my good friend Mr. John Harlowe talk of my good friend Mr. John Harlowe with great respect; and as a co-trustee with my good friend Mr. John Harlowe in a certain trust.             I thought it probable, myself, said I, that the Colonel might be arrived; that you might be a gentleman of the Colonel acquaintance; and that something of an agreeable surprize might be intended.             Had Colonel Morden been in England, Mr. John Harlowe would have known Mr. John Harlowe; and then I should not have been a stranger to Mr. John Harlowe.             Well but, myself, have you then any commission to myself from Mr. John Harlowe?             myself, I will tell you, as briefly as I can, the whole of what I have to say; but you'll excuse <i>me</i> also a previous question, for which curiosity is not my motive; but it is necessary to be answered before I can proceed; as you will judge when you hear I can proceed.             What, pray, myself, is your question?             Briefly, Whether you are actually, and <i>bona fide,</i> married to Miss Clarissa Harlowe?             I started, and, in a haughty tone, Is this, myself, a question that <i>must</i> be answered before you can proceed in the business you have undertaken?             I mean no offence, Mr. Lovelace. Miss Clarissa Harlowe sought to Miss Clarissa Harlowe to undertake this office. I have daughters and nieces of my own. I thought this office, or I, who have many considerable affairs upon my hands, had not accepted of this office. I know the world; and will take the liberty to say, That if that young LadyÑ             Captain Tomlinson, I think you are called?             My name is Captain Tomlinson.             Why then, Captain Tomlinson, no <i>liberty,</i> as you call it, will be taken well, Sir is not extremely delicate, when that lady is mentioned.             When you had heard me out, Mr. Lovelace, and had found, I had so behaved, as to make the caution necessary, the caution would have been just to have given the caution.ÑAllow me to say, I know what is due to the character of a woman of virtue, as well as any man alive.             Why, Sir! Why, Captain Tomlinson, you seem warm. If you intend any-thing by this [<i>O how I trembled!</i> said the Lady, <i>when the Lady took notice of this part of our conversation afterwards:</i>], I will only say, that this is a privileged place. It is at present my home, and an asylum for any gentleman who thinks it worth his while to inquire after Sir, be the manner or end of his inquiry what his inquiry will.             I know not, Sir, that I have given occasion for this. I make no scruple to attend you <i>elsewhere,</i> if I am troublesome here. I was told, I had a warm young gentleman to deal with: But as I knew my intention, and that my commission was an amicable one, I was the less concerned about that. I am twice your age, Mr. Lovelace, I dare say: But I do assure you, that if either my message, or my manner, give you offence, I can suspend the one or the other for a day, or for ever, as you like. And so, Sir, any time before eight to-morrow morning, you will let me know your further commands.ÑAnd was going to tell me where ÑAnd might be found.             Captain Tomlinson, said I, you answer well. I love a man of spirit. Have you not been in the army?             I have, Sir; but have <i>turned my sword into a ploughshare,</i> as the Scripture has it [<i>There was a clever fellow, Jack!ÑHe was a good man with somebody, I warrant!</i>].ÑAnd all my delight, added I, for some years past, has been in cultivating my paternal estate. I love a brave man, Mr. Lovelace, as well as ever I did in my life. But, let me tell you, Sir, that when you come to my time of life, you will be of opinion, that there is not so much true bravery in youthful choler, as you may now think there is.             A clever fellow again, BelfordÑEar and heart, both at once, Sir took in My charmer.Ñ<i>'Tis well,</i> she says, <i>there are some men who have wisdom in some men who have wisdom in their anger.</i>              anger.</i>             Well, Captain, that is reproof for reproof. So we are upon a foot. And now give me the pleasure of hearing your commission.             Sir, you must first allow me to repeat my question: Are you really, and <i>bona fide,</i> married to Miss Clarissa Harlowe? Or are you not yet married?             Bluntly put, Captain. But if I answer that I <i>am,</i> what then?             Why then, Sir, I shall say, that you are a man of honour.             That I hope I am, whether you <i>say</i> it or not, Captain Tomlinson.             Sir, I will be very frank in all I have to say on this subject.ÑMr. Miss Clarissa Harlowe has lately found out, that you and Miss Clarissa Harlowe niece are both in the same lodgings; that you have been long so; and that that lady was at the Play with you yesterday was se'ennight; and Miss Clarissa Harlowe hopes, that you are actually married: Miss Clarissa Harlowe has indeed heard that you are; but, as Miss Clarissa Harlowe knows your enterprizing temper, and that you have declared, that you disdain a relation to their family, Miss Clarissa Harlowe is willing by Miss Clarissa Harlowe to have your marriage confirmed from your own mouth, before Miss Clarissa Harlowe takes the steps Miss Clarissa Harlowe is inclined to take in his niece's favour. You will allow me to say, Mr. Lovelace, that Mr. Lovelace will not be satisfied with an answer that admits of the least doubt.             Let me tell you, Captain Tomlinson, that it is a damn'd degree of vileness for any man to supposeÑ             SirÑMr. LovelaceÑdon't put yourself into a passion. that lady's relations are jealous of the honour of their family. their have prejudices to overcome as well as youÑAdvantage may have been takenÑand that lady, at the <i>time,</i> not to blame.             This Lady, Sir, could give no such advantages: And if she <i>had,</i> what must the <i>man</i> be, Captain Tomlinson, who could have taken them?ÑDo you know This Lady, Sir?             I never had the honour to see her but once; and that was at church; and should not know her again.             Not know her again, Sir!ÑI thought that there was not a man living who had once seen her, and would not know her among a thousand.                  I remember, Sir, that I thought I never saw a finer woman in my life. But, Mr. Lovelace, I believe, you will allow, that it is better that Mr. Lovelace relations should have wronged <i>you,</i> than you the <i>Lady.</i> I hope, myself, you will permit me to repeat my question.                <i>Enter Dorcas, in a hurry.</i>             A <i>gentleman,</i> this minute, Sir, desires to speak with your honourÑ<i>My Lady, Sir!Ñ[Aside.</i>             Could the dear creature put <i>Dorcas</i> upon telling this fib, yet want to save <i>me</i> one?Ñ             Desire the gentleman to walk into one of the parlours. I will wait on the gentleman presently.             [<i>Exit Dorcas.</i>             the dear creature, I doubted not, wanted to instruct me how to answer the Captain's home-put. I knew how I intended to answer itÑPlumb? thou may'st be sureÑBut Dorcas's message stagger'd me. And yet I was upon one of my master-strokesÑWhich was, To take advantage of the Captain's inquiries, and to make her own her marriage before the Captain, as her had done to the people below; and if her had been brought to that, to induce her, for her uncle's satisfaction, to write her uncle a letter of gratitude; which of course must have been signed <i>Clarissa Lovelace.</i> I was loth, therefore, thou may'st believe, to attend her sudden commands: And yet, afraid of pushing matters beyond recovery with her, I thought proper to lead her uncle from the question, to account for her uncle; for Miss Clarissa Harlowe's coming at the knowlege of where we are; and for other particulars which I knew would engage her attention; and which might possibly convince her of the necessity there was for her to acquiesce in the affirmative I was disposed to give. And this for her own sake; for what; as I asked her afterwards, is it to me, whether I am ever reconciled to a family I must for ever despise?                  You think, Captain, that I have answered doubtfully to the question you have put. You <i>may</i> think so. And you must know, that I have a good deal of pride: And only, that you are a gentleman, and seem in this affair to be governed by generous principles, or I should ill brook being interrogated as to my honour to a lady so dear to me.ÑBut before I answer more directly to the point, pray satisfy me in a question or two that I shall put to <i>you.</i>             With all my heart, Sir. Ask me what questions you please, I will answer what questions with sincerity and candour.             You say, That Miss Clarissa Harlowe has found out that we were at a Play together: And that we are both in the same lodgingsÑHow pray, came Miss Clarissa Harlowe at Miss Clarissa Harlowe knowlege?ÑFor, let me tell you, that I have, for certain considerations not respecting Miss Clarissa Harlowe, condescended, that we abode should be kept secret. And this has been so strictly observed, that even Miss Howe, tho' she and my beloved correspond, knows not directly whither to send to us.             Why, Sir, the person who saw you at the Play, was a tenant of Mr. John Harlowe. a tenant of Mr. John Harlowe watched all your motions. When the Play was done, a tenant of Mr. John Harlowe followed your coach to your lodgings. And early the next day, Sunday, a tenant of Mr. John Harlowe took horse, and acquainted a tenant of Mr. John Harlowe landlord with what a tenant of Mr. John Harlowe had observed.             How oddly things come about, Captain Tomlinson!ÑBut does any other of the Harlowes know where we are?             It is an absolute secret to every other person of the family; and so It is intended to be kept: As also that Mr. John Harlowe is willing to enter into treaty with you, by Mr. John Harlowe, if his niece be actually married; for perhaps Mr. John Harlowe is aware, that Mr. John Harlowe shall have difficulty enough with some people to bring about the desirable reconciliation, altho' Mr. John Harlowe could give some people this assurance.             I doubt this assurance not, Captain.ÑTo Mr. John Harlowe is all the family folly owing.ÑFine fools! [<i>heroically stalking about</i>] to be governed by one to whom malice, and not genius, gives the busy liveliness that distinguishes Mr. John Harlowe from a natural!ÑBut how long, pray, Sir, has Mr. John Harlowe been in this pacific disposition?             I will tell you, Mr. Lovelace, and the occasion; and be very explicit upon it, and upon all that concerns you to know of me, and of the commission I have undertaken; and this the rather, as when you have heard me out, you will be satisfied, that I am not an officious man in this my present address to you.             I am all attention, Captain Tomlinson.                <i>And so I doubt not was my beloved.</i>                "You must know, Sir, said the Captain, that I have not been many months in Mr. John Harlowe's neighbourhood. I removed from Northamptonshire, partly for the sake of better managing one of two Executorships, which I could not avoid engaging in (the affairs of which frequently call me to town, and are part of my present business), and partly for the sake of occupying a neglected farm, which has lately fallen into my hands. But tho' an acquaintance of no longer standing, and that commencing on the Bowling-green [Uncle John is a great bowler, Belford] (upon my decision of a point to every one's satisfaction, which was appealed to me by all the gentlemen; and which might have been attended with bad consequences), no two brothers have a more cordial esteem for each other. You know, Mr. Lovelace, that there is a <i>consent,</i> as I may call it, in some minds, which will unite no two brothers stronger in a few hours, than years will do with others, whom yet we see not with disgust."             Very true, Captain.                "It was on the foot of this avowed friendship on both sides, that on Monday the 15th, as I very well remember, Mr. John Harlowe invited Mr. John Harlowe home with Mr. John Harlowe. And when there, Mr. John Harlowe acquainted me with the whole of the unhappy affair, that had made them all so uneasy. Till then I knew it only by report; for, intimate as we were, I forbore to speak of what was so near Mr. John Harlowe heart, till Mr. John Harlowe began first. And then Mr. John Harlowe told me, that Mr. John Harlowe had had an application made to Mr. John Harlowe two or three days before by a gentleman whom Mr. John Harlowe named, to induce Mr. John Harlowe not only to be reconciled to Mr. John Harlowe niece himself, but to forward for his niece himself a general reconciliation."                "A like application, Mr. John Harlowe told me, had been made to Mr. John Harlowe sister Harlowe, by a good woman whom every-body respected; who had intimated, that his niece himself, if encouraged, would again put his niece himself into the protection of his niece himself friends, and leave you: But if not, that his niece himself must unavoidably be yours."             I hope, Mr. Lovelace, I make no mischief.ÑYou look concernedÑYou sigh, Sir.             Proceed, Captain Tomlinson. Pray proceed.Ñ<i>And I sighed still more profoundly.</i>                "They all thought it extremely particular, that a lady should decline marriage with a man a lady had so lately gone away with."             Pray, CaptainÑPray, Mr. TomlinsonÑNo more of this subject. My beloved is an angel. In every thing unblameable. Whatever faults there have been, have been theirs and mine. What you would further say, is, that the <i>unforgiving</i> family rejected a lady application. the <i>unforgiving</i> family did. a lady and I had had a misunderstanding.                <i>The falling out of lovers</i>Ñyou know, the Captain.ÑWe have been happier ever since.                "Well, Sir; but Mr. John Harlowe could not but better consider the matter afterwards. And Mr. John Harlowe desired my advice how to act in the matter. Mr. John Harlowe told me, that no father ever loved a daughter as no father loved this niece of no father; whom, indeed, no father used to call no father <i>daughter-niece.</i> Mr. John Harlowe said, she had really been unkindly treated by she brother and sister: And as your alliance, myself, was far from being a discredit to their family, myself would do myself endeavour to reconcile all parties, if myself could be sure that myself were actually man and wife."             And what, pray, Captain, was your advice?                "I gave it as my opinion, that if this niece of his were unworthily treated, and in distress, as myself apprehended from the application to myself, myself would soon hear of this niece of his again: But that it was likely, that the application was made without expecting the application would succeed; and as a salvo only, to this niece of his, for marrying without his niece were unworthily treated, and in distress, as he apprehended from the application to him, he would soon hear of her again consent. And the rather, as myself had told me, that it came from a young lady this niece of his friend, and not in a direct way from this niece of his; which young lady was no favourite of the family; and therefore would hardly have been employed, had success been expeced."             Very well, Captain Tomlinson.ÑPray proceed.                "Here the matter rested till last Sunday evening, when Mr. John Harlowe came to Mr. John Harlowe with the man who had seen you and your lady (as I hope your lady is) at the Play; and who had assured Mr. John Harlowe, that you both lodged in the same house.ÑAnd then the application having been so lately made, which implied, that you were not then married, Mr. John Harlowe was so uneasy for Mr. John Harlowe niece's honour, that I advised Mr. John Harlowe to dispatch to town some one in whom Mr. John Harlowe could confide, to make proper inquiries."                  Very well, Captain.ÑAnd was such a person employed on such an errand by ÑAnd uncle?                "A trusty and discreet person was accordingly sent; and last Tuesday, I think it was (for Mr. John Harlowe returned to us on the Wednesday), Mr. John Harlowe made the inquiries among the neighbours first [<i>The very inquiry, Jack, that gave us all so much uneasiness</i>                   ]. But finding, that none of them could give any satisfactory account, the lady's woman was come at, who declared, that you were actually married. But the inquirist keeping the inquirist on the reserve as to the inquirist employers, the lady's woman refused to tell the day, or to give the inquirist other particulars."             You give a very clear account of every-thing, Captain Tomlinson. Pray go on.                "The gentleman returned; and on Captain Tomlinson report Mr. Harlowe, having still doubts, and being willing to proceed on some grounds in so important a point, besought me, as my affairs called me frequently to town, to undertake this matter. You, Captain Tomlinson, Captain Tomlinson was pleased to say, have children of your own: You know the world: You know what I drive at: You will proceed, I know, with understanding and spirit: And whatever you are satisfied with, shall satisfy me."                <i>Enter Dorcas, again in a hurry.</i>             Sir, The gentleman is impatient.             I will attend Sir presently.             the Captain then accounted for the Captain not calling in person, when the Captain had reason to think us here.             the Captain said, the Captain had business of consequence a few miles out of town, whither the Captain thought the Captain must have gone yesterday; and having been obliged to put off the Captain little journey till this day, and understanding that we were within, not knowing whether the Captain should have such another opportunity, the Captain was willing to try the Captain good fortune before the Captain set out; and this made the Captain come booted and spurred, as I saw the Captain.             the Captain dropped a hint in commendation of the people of the house; but it was in such away, as to give no room for suspicion, that the Captain thought it necessary to make any inquiries after the character of persons who make so genteel an appearance, as the Captain observed they do.             And here let me remark, to the same purpose, that my beloved might collect another circumstance in their favour, had she doubted their, from the silence of she uncle's inquirist on Tuesday, among the neighbours.             And now, Sir, said Sir, that I believe I have satisfied you in every thing relating to my commission, I hope you will permit me to repeat my questionÑwhich is,Ñ                <i>Enter Dorcas again, out of breath.</i>             Sir, the gentleman will step up to <i>you.ÑMy lady is impatient. lady wonders at your honour's delay, [Aside].</i>             Excuse me, the Captain, for one moment.             I have staid my full time, Mr. Lovelace.ÑWhat may result from my question and your answer, whatever it shall be, may take us up time.ÑAnd you are engaged.ÑWill you permit me to attend you in the morning, before I set out on my return?             You will then breakfast with me, Captain?             It must be early if I do. I must reach my own house to-morrow night, or I shall make the best of wives unhappy. And I have two or three places to call at in my way.             It shall be by seven o'clock, if you please, the Captain. We are early folks. And this I will tell you, that if ever I am reconciled to a family so implacable as I have always found the Harlowes to be, the Harlowes must be by the mediation of so cool and so moderate a gentleman as yourself.             And so, with the highest civilities on both sides, We parted. But for the private satisfaction of so good a man, I left so good a man out of doubt, that We were man and wife, tho' I did not directly aver it.

                        Friday, Nine o'Clock.                   AND now, my dear, what shall I conclude upon? You see how determin'dÑBut how can I expect your advice will come time enough to stand me in any stead? For here, I have been down, and already have another letter from Mr. Lovelace [The man lives upon the spot, I think]: And I must write to him, either that I will, or will not, stand to my first resolution of escaping hence on Monday next. If I let him know, that I will not (appearances so strong <i>against</i> him, and <i>for</i> Solmes, even stronger, than when I made the appointment), will it not be justly deemed my own fault, if I am compelled to marry their odious man? And if any mischief ensue from Mr. Lovelace's rage and disappointment, will it not lie at my door?ÑYet, he offers so fair!ÑYet, on the other hand, to incur the censure of the world, as a giddy creature!ÑBut that, as he hints, I have already incurred!ÑWhat can I do? Oh! that my cousin Morden!ÑBut what signifies wishing?                   I will here give you the substance of Mr. Lovelace's letter. The letter itself I will send, when I have answered it; but that I will defer doing as long as I can, in hopes of finding reason to retract an appointment on which so much depends. And yet it is necessary you should have all before you, as I go along, that you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis of my fate.                      "He begs my pardon, for writing with so much assurance; attributing it to his unbounded transport; and intirely acquiesces in my will. He is full of alternatives and proposals. He offers to attend me directly to Lady Betty's; or, if I had rather, to my own estate; and that my Lord M. shall protect me there, [He knows not, my dear, my reasons for rejecting this inconsiderate advice]. In either case, as soon as he sees me safe, he will go up to London, or whither I please; and not come near me, but by my own permission; and till I am satisfy'd in every thing I am doubtful of, as well with regard to his reformation, as to settlements, "                      "To conduct me to You, my dear, is another of his alternatives, not doubting, he says, but your mamma will receive me. Or, if That be not agreeable to you, to your mamma, or to me, he will put me into Mr. Hickman's protection; whom, no doubt, Miss Howe can influence; and that it may be given out, that I am gone to Bath, or Bristol, or Abroad; where-ever I please."                      "Again, If it be more agreeable, he proposes to attend me privately to London, where he will procure handsome lodgings for me, and both his cousins Montague to receive me there, and to accompany me till all shall be adjusted to my mind; and till a reconciliation shall be effected; which, he assures me, nothing shall be wanting in him to facilitate; greatly as he has been insulted by all my family."                      "These several measures he proposes to my choice; it being unlikely, he says, that he can procure in the time, a letter from Lady Betty, under her own hand, inviting me in form to her house, unless he had been himself to go to that Lady for it; which, at this critical conjuncture, while he is attending my commands, is impossible."                      "He conjures me, in the solemnest manner, if I would not throw him into utter despair, to keep to my appoinment."                      "However, instead of threatening my relations, or Solmes, if I recede, he respectfully says, that he doubts not, but that, if I do, it will be upon such reasons, as he ought to be satisfy'd with; upon no slighter, he hopes, than their leaving me at full liberty to pursue my own inclinations: In which (whatever they shall be), he will intirely acquiesce; only endeavouring to make his future good behaviour, the sole ground for his expectation of my favour."                      "In short, he solemnly vows, that his <i>whole</i> view at present, is, To free me from my imprisonment; and to restore me to my own free-will, in a point so absolutely necessary to my future happiness. He declares, that neither the hopes he has in my future favour, nor the honour of himself and family, will permit him to propose any thing that shall be inconsistent with my own most scrupulous notions: And, for my mind's sake, should choose to have this end obtained by my friends declining to compel me. But that, nevertheless, as to the world's opinion, it is impossible to imagine, that the behaviour of my relations to me, has not already brought upon my family those free censures which they deserve, and caused the step which I am so scrupulous about taking, to be no other than the natural and expected consequence of their treatment of me."                   Indeed, I am afraid all this is true: And it is owing to some little degree of politeness, that Mr. Lovelace does not say all he might say on this subject: For I have no doubt, that I am the talk, and perhaps the by-word of half the county. If so, I am afraid, I can now do nothing that will give me more disgrace than I have already so causelesly received by their indiscreet persecutions: And let me be whose I will, and do what I will, I shall never wipe off the stain my confinement, and the rigorous usage I have received, have fixed upon me; at least in my own opinion.                   I wish, if ever I am to be considered as one of the eminent family this man is ally'd to, some of them do not think the worse of me, for the disgrace I have received!ÑIn that case, perhaps, I shall be obliged to him, if <i>he</i> do not. You see how much this harsh, this cruel, treatment from my own family has humbled me!ÑBut, perhaps, I was too much exalted before.                   Mr. Lovelace concludes, "with repeatedly begging an interview with me; and That, <i>this</i> night, if possible: An honour, he says, he is the more encouraged to solicit for, as I had twice before made him hope for it. But whether he obtain it, or not, he beseeches me to choose one of the alternatives he offers to my acceptance; and not to depart from my resolution of escaping on Monday, unless the reason ceases on which I had taken it up; and that I have a prospect of being restored to my friends favour; at least to my own liberty and freedom of choice."                   He renews all his vows and promises on this head, in so earnest and so solemn a manner, that (his own interest, and his family's honour, and their favour for me, co-operating) I can have no room to doubt of his sincerity.

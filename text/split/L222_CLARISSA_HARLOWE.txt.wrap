<i>Three o' clock, Friday.</i>                   ONCE more, I resume my pen. I thought I had taken my last farewell of you. I never was so very oddly affected: Something that seemed totally to overwhelm my facultiesÑI don't know how to describe it!ÑI believe I do amiss in writing so much, and taking too much upon me: But an active mind, tho' clouded by bodily illness, cannot be idle.                   I'll see if the air, and a discontinued attention will help me.ÑBut if it will not, don't be concerned for me, my dear!ÑI shall be happy. Nay, I am more so already, than of late I thought I could ever be in this life.ÑYet how this <i>body</i> clings!ÑHow it incumbers!

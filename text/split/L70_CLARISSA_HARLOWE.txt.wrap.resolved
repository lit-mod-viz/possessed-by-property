                        Friday, One o'Clock, in the Woodhouse.                   No letter yet from this man!ÑI have luckily deposited my parcel, and have your letter of last night. If Robert takes This without my parcel, pray let Robert return immediately for This. But Robert cannot miss This, I think; and must conclude that This is put there for Robert to take away.ÑYou may believe, from the contents of yours, that I shall immediately write again.Ñ                      CL. HARLOWE.

<i>Seven o' clock.</i>
                  I could not send this letter away with so melancholy an ending, as <i>you</i> would have thought it. So I deferred closing it, till I saw how I should be on my return from my airing: And now I must say, I am quite another thing: So alert!Ñthat I could proceed with as much spirit as begun, and add more preachment to your lively subject, if I had not written more than enough upon it already.
                  I wish you would let me give you and Mr. Hickma joy. Do, my dear!ÑI should take some to <i>myself,</i> you would.
                  My respectful compliments to all your friends, as well to those I have the honour to know, as to those I do not know.
                  I HAVE just now been surprized with a letter from one whom I long ago gave up all thoughts of hearing from. From Mr. Wyerley. I will inclose it. You'll be surprized at it, as much as I was. This seems to be a m whom I <i>might</i> have reclaimed. But I could not love him Yet I hope I never treated him with arrogance. Indeed my dear, if I am not too partial to myself, I think I refused him with more gentleness, than you retain somebody else. And this recollection gives me less pain than I should have had in the other case, on receiving this instance of generosity that affects me. I will also inclose the roug draught of my answer, as soon as I have transcribed it.
                  If I begin another sheet, I shall write to the end of it Wherefore I will only add, my prayers for your hono
and prosperity, and for a long, long, happy life; and that, when it comes to be wound up, you may be as calm and as easy at quitting it, as I hope in God I shall be. Who am, and will be, to the latest moment,
                     Your truly affectionate and obliged Servant, <i>CL. HARLOWE.</i>

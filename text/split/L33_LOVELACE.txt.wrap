<i>Thursday Morn.</i> 5.                                                           I have written all night. <i>Excuse indifferent writing. My crow-quills are worn to the stmps, and I must get a new supply.</i>                                                                                                                             These Ladies always write with crow-quills, Jack.	  	If thou art capable of taking in all my <i>precautionaries</i> in this letter, thou wilt admire my sagacity and contrivance, almost as much as I do myself. Thou    seest, that Miss Lardner, Mrs. Sinclair, Tomlinson, Mrs. Fretchville, Mennell, are all mentioned in it. My first liberties with her person also [Modesty,    modesty, Belford, I doubt, is more confined to time, place, and occasion, even by the most delicate minds, than those minds would have it believed to be]. And why all these taken notice of by me from the genuine    letter, but for fear some future letter from the vixen should escape my hands, in which she might refer to these names? And if none of them were to have been found in this that is to pass for hers, I might be routed <i>horse and foot,</i> as Lord M. would phrase it, in a like case.                Devilish hard (and yet I may thank myself) to be put to all this plague and trouble!ÑAnd for <i>what,</i> dost thou ask? O Jack, for a triumph of more value to me <i>beforehand</i> than an imperial crown!ÑDon't ask me the value of it a <i>month hence.</i> But what indeed is an imperial crown itself, when a man is used to it?                Miss Howe might well be anxious about the letter she wrote. Her sweet friend, from what I have let pass of hers, has reason to rejoice in the thought, that it fell not into my hands.                And now must all my contrivances be set at work, to intercept the expected letter from Miss Howe; which is, as I suppose, to direct her to a place of safety, and out of my knowlege. Mrs. Townsend is, no doubt, in this case, to smuggle her off. I hope the <i>villain,</i> as I am so frequently called between these two girls, will be able to manage this point.                But what, perhaps, thou askest, if the lady should take it into her head, by the connivance of Miss Rawlins, to quit this house privately in the night?                I have thought of this, Jack. Does not Will. lie in the house? And is not the Widow Bevis my fast friend? I took great pains in writing this. It cannot, I hope, be suspected. Her hand is so <i>very</i> delicate.    Yet hers is written less beautifully than she usually writes: And I hope Miss Howe will allow somewhat for <i>hurry of spirits,</i> and <i>unsteady fingers.</i>                          My consideration for Miss Howe's <i>ease of mind</i> extended still farther than to the instance I have mentioned.             That this billet might be with her as soon as possible (and before it could have reach'd Hickman by the post), I dispatch'd it away by a servant of Mowbray's. Miss Howe, had there been any failure or delay, might, as thou wilt think, have communicated her anxieties to her fugitive friend; and she <i>to me,</i> perhaps, in a way I should not have been pleased with.             Once more wilt thou wonderingly questionÑAll this pains for a single girl?             Yes, Jack! ÑBut is not this girl a CLARISSA?Ñ And who knows, but kind Fortune, as a reward for my perseverance, may toss me in her charming friend? Less likely things have come to pass, Belford!ÑAnd to be sure I shall have her, if I resolve upon it

<i>Saturday, July</i> 1.             PERMIT me, Madam, to trouble you with a few lines, were it only to thank you for your reproofs; which have nevertheless drawn fresh streams of blood from a bleeding heart.                  My story is a dismal story. My story has circumstances in My story, that would engage pity, and possibly a judgment not altogether unfavourable, where those circumstances known. But it is my business, and shall be <i>all</i> my business, to repent of my failings, and not endeavour to extenuate my failings.             But I will not seek to distress your worthy mind. If <i>I cannot suffer alone,</i> I will make as few parties as I can in my sufferings. And, indeed, I took up my pen with this resolution, when I wrote the letter which has fallen into your hands: It was only to know, and that for a very particular reason, as well as for affection unbounded, if my dear Miss Howe, from whom I had not heard of a long time, were ill; as I had been told she was; and if so, how she now does. But my injuries being recent, and my distresses having been exceeding great, <i>Self</i> would croud into the letter which has fallen into your hands. When distressed, the human mind is apt to turn the human mind to every one in whom the human mind imagined or wished an interest, for pity and consolationÑOr, to express myself better and more concisely, in your own words, <i>Misfortune makes people plaintive:</i> And to whom, if not to a friend, can the afflicted complain?             Miss Howe being abroad, when the letter which has fallen into your hands came, I flatter myself that Miss Howe is recovered. But it would be some satisfaction to myself to be informed, if Miss Howe <i>has been ill.</i> Another line from <i>your</i> hand would be too great a favour. But, if you will be pleased to direct any servant to answer <i>yes,</i> or <i>no,</i> to that question, I will not be farther troublesome.             Nevertheless, I must declare, that my Miss Howe's friendship was all the comfort I had, or expected to have, in this world; and a line from my Miss Howe's friendship would have been a cordial to my fainting heart. Judge then, dearest Madam, how reluctantly I must obey your prohibitionÑBut yet, I will endeavour to obey your prohibitionÑBut; altho' I should have hoped, as well from the tenor of all that has passed between Miss Howe and me, as from <i>her</i> established virtue, that my Miss Howe's friendship could not be tainted by <i>Evil communication,</i> had one or two letters been permitted. This, however, I ask not for, since I think I have nothing to do, but to beg of God (who, I hope, has not yet withdrawn his grace from me, altho' his is pleased to let loose his justice upon my faults) to give me a truly broken spirit, if his justice be not already broken enough, and then to take to his mercy                                   <i>The unhappy</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE.                   Two favours, good Madam, I have to beg of you.ÑThe first;Ñthat you will not let any of my relations know, that you have heard from me. The other,Ñthat no living creature be apprised where I am to be heard of, or directed to. This is a point that concerns me, more than I can express.ÑIn short, my preservation from further evils may depend upon my preservation from further evils.

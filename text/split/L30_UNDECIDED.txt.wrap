                        <i>Several other Letters passed between Miss Howe and Mr. Belford, relating to the disposition of the Papers and Letters; to the Poor's Fund; and to other articles of the Lady's Will: Wherein the method of proceeding in each case was adjusted. After which the Papers were returned to Mr. Belford, that he might order the two directed copies of them to be taken.</i>                         <i>In one of these letters Mr. Belford requests Miss Howe to give the Character of the friend she so dearly loved:</i>                         "A task, he imagines, that will be as agreeable to herself, as worthy of her pen."                         "I am more especially curious to know, <i>says he,</i> what was that particular disposition of her time, which I find mentioned in a letter which I have just dipt into, where her sister is enviously reproaching her on that score. This information may perhaps enable me, <i>says he,</i> to account for what has often surprised me; How, at so tender an age, this admirable lady became mistress of such extraordinary and such various qualifications."                         <i>This request produced the following Letter.</i>                      <i>Thursday, October</i> 12.

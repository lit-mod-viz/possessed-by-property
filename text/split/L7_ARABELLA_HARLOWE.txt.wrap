	 <i>Thursday morn. Aug.</i> 3                                   <i>Sister</i> CLARY,             I Wish you would not trouble me with any more of your letters. You had always a knack at writing; and depended upon making every one do what you would, when you wrote. But your wit and your folly have undone you. And now, as all naughty creatures do, when they can't help themselves, you come begging and praying, and make others as uneasy as yourself.             When I wrote last to you, I <i>expected</i> that I should not be at rest.             And so you'd creep on, by little and little, till you'll want to be received again.             But you only hope for <i>forgiveness,</i> and a <i>blessing,</i> you say. A blessing for what, sister Clary? Think for what? ÑHowever, I read your letter to my father and mother.             I won't tell you what my papa saidÑOne who has the true sense you boast to have of your misdeeds, may guess, without my telling you, what a justly incensed father would say on such an occasion.             My poor mammaÑO wretch! What has not your ingrateful folly cost my poor mamma!ÑHad you been less a darling, you would not, perhaps, have been so graceless: But I never in my life saw a cocker'd favourite come to good.             My heart is full, and I can't help writing my mind; for your crimes have disgraced us all; and I am afraid, and ashamed, to go to any public or private assemblée or diversion: And why? Ñ I <i>need</i> not say why, when your actions are the subjects, either of the open talk, or of the affronting whispers, of both sexes, at all such places.             Upon the whole, I am sorry I have no more comfort to send you: But I find no-body willing to forgive you. I don't know what <i>time</i> may do for you; and when it is seen, that your penitence is not owing more to disappointment than true conviction: For it is too probable, Miss Clary, that, had you gone on as swimmingly as you expected, and had not your feather-headed villain abandoned you, we should have heard nothing of these moving supplications: Nor of any-thing, but defiances from <i>him,</i> and a guilt gloried in from <i>you.</i> And this is every-one's opinion, as well as that of                Your grieved Sister, <i>ARABELLA HARLOWE.</i>     I send this by a particular hand, who undertakes to give it you, or leave it for you, by to-morrow night.

                  To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.
                  ONCE again, my inflexible sister, I write to you? It is to let you know, that the pretty piece of art you found out to make me the vehicle of your whining pathetics to your father and mother, has not had the expected effect.
                  I do assure you, that your behaviour has not been misrepresented: Nor need it. Your mamma, who is sollicitous to take all opportunities of putting the favourablest constructions upon all you do, has been forced, as you well know, to give you up, upon full proof: No need then of the expedient of pursuing your Needleworks in her sight. She cannot bear your whining pranks: And it is for <i>her</i> sake, that you are not permitted to come into her presence; nor will be, but upon her own terms.
                  You had like to have made a simpleton of your aunt Hervey yesterday: She came down from you, pleading in your favour: But when she was asked,
What concession she had brought you to? she look'd about her, and knew not what to answer. So your mamma, when surprised into the beginning of your cunning address to her and to your papa, under my name (for I had begun to read it, little suspecting such an <i>ingenious</i> subterfuge) and would then make me read it thro', wrung her hands, Oh! her dear child, her dear child, must not be so compelled!—But when she was asked, Whether she would be willing to have for her Son-in-law, the man who bids defiance to her whole family; and who had like to have murder'd her son? And what concessions she had gain'd from her beloved, to occasion this tenderness? And that for one who had apparently deceived her, in assuring her that her heart was free? then could she look about her, as her sister had done before: Then was she again brought to herself, and to a resolution to assert her authority; not to <i>transfer</i> it, witty presumer! over the rebel who of late, has so ingratefully struggled to throw it off.
                  You seem, child, to have a high notion of the matrimonial duty; and I'll warrant, like the rest of your sex (one or two, whom I have the honour to know, excepted) that you will go to church to promise what you will never think of afterwards. But, <i>sweet</i> child! as your <i>worthy</i> mamma Norton calls you, think a little less of the <i>matrimonial</i> (at least, till you come into that state) and a little more of the <i>filial,</i> duty.
                  How can you say, you are to bear <i>all the misery,</i> when you give so large a share of it to your parents, to your uncles, to your aunt, to myself, and to your sister; who all, for Eighteen years of your life, loved you so well?
                  If of late I have not given you room to hope for my favour or compassion, it is because of late you have not deserved either. I know what you mean, little reflecting fool, by saying, it is much in my
power, altho' <i>but</i> your brother (a very slight degree of relation with you) to give you that peace, which you can give yourself whenever you please.
                  The liberty of <i>refusing,</i> pretty Miss, is deny'd you, because we are all sensible, that the liberty of <i>choosing,</i> to every one's dislike, must follow. The vile wretch you have set your heart upon, speaks This plainly to every-body, tho' you won't. He says you are <i>His,</i> and <i>shall</i> be <i>His,</i> and he will be the death of any man who robs him of his PROPERTY. So, Miss, we have a mind to try this point with him. My father supposing he has the right of a father in his child, is absolutely determin'd not to be bully'd out of that right. And what must that child be, who prefers the Rake to a Father?
                  This is the light in which this whole debate ought to be taken. Blush, then, Delicacy! that cannot bear the Poet's <i>Amor omnibus idem!</i>—Blush then, Purity! Be ashamed, Virgin modesty! And if capable of conviction, surrender your whole will to the will of the honoured pair, to whom you owe your being: And beg of all your friends to forgive and forget the part you have of late acted.
                  I have written a longer letter, than ever I designed to write to you, after the insolent treatment and prohibition you have given me: And now I am commission'd to tell you, that your friends are as weary of confining you, as you are of being confin'd. And therefore you must prepare yourself to go in a very few days, as you have been told before, to your uncle Antony's; who, notwithstanding your apprehensions, will draw up his bridge when he pleases, will see what company he pleases in his own house; nor will he demolish his chapel to cure you of your foolish late-commenc'd antipathy, to a place of Divine Worship.—The more foolish, as, if we intended to use force, we could have the ceremony pass in your chamber as well as any where else.
                       Prejudice against Mr. Solmes has evidently blinded you, and there is a <i>charitable</i> necessity to open your eyes: Since no one but you thinks the gentleman so contemptible in his <i>person</i>; nor, for a plain country gentleman, who has too much solid sense to appear like a coxcomb, justly blameable in his <i>manners.</i>—And as to his <i>temper,</i> it is necessary you should speak upon fuller knowlege, than at present it is plain you can have of him.
                  Upon the whole, it will not be amiss, that you prepare for your speedy removal, as well for the sake of your own conveniency, as to shew your readiness, in <i>one</i> point, at least, to oblige your friends; one of whom you may, if you please to deserve it, reckon, tho' <i>but</i> a Brother,
                     JAMES HARLOWE.
<i>P. S.</i> If you are disposed to see Mr. Solmes, and to make some excuses to him for your past conduct, in order to be able to meet him <i>somewhere else</i> with the less concern to yourself for your freedoms with him; he shall attend you where you please. If you have a mind to read the settlements, before they are read to you for your signing, they shall be sent you up—Who knows, but they will help you to some fresh objections?—Your heart is <i>free</i> you know—It <i>must</i>—For, did you not tell your mother it was? And will the <i>pious</i> Clarissa Harlowe fib to her mamma?

I desire no reply. The case requires none. Yet I will ask you, Have you, Miss, no more proposals to make?

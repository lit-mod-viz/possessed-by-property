<i>Past Ten o'clock.</i>                   I NEVER long'd in my life for any thing with so much impatience, as to see my charmer. my charmer has been stirring, it seems, these two hours.                   Dorcas just now tapp'd at my charmer door, to take my charmer morning commands.                      <i>my charmer had none for her,</i> was the answer.                   my charmer desired to know, If my charmer would not breakfast?                   A sullen and low-voiced <i>negative</i> my charmer received.                   I will go my charmer.                   THREE different times tapp'd I at her door, but had no answer.                   Permit me, dearest creature, to inquire after your health. As you have not been seen to-day, I am impatient to know how you do.                   Not a word of answer; but a deep sigh, even to sobbing.                   Let me beg of you, Madam, to accompany me up another pair of stairsÑYou'll rejoice to see what a happy escape we have all had.                   A happy escape indeed, Jack!ÑFor the fire had scorched the window-board, findged the hangings, and burnt through the slit-deal lining of the window-jambs.                   No answer, Madam!ÑAm I not worthy of one word?ÑIs it thus you keep your promise with me?ÑShall I not have the favour of your company for two minutes, only for two minutes, in the dining-room?                   Hem!ÑAnd a deep sigh!Ñwas all the answer.                        Answer me, but how you do! Answer me but that you are well!ÑIs this the forgiveness that was the condition of my obedience?                   Then, in a faintish but angry voice, Begone from my door!ÑWretch, inhuman, barbarous, and all that's base and treacherous!ÑBegone from my door! Nor teaze thus a poor creature, intitled to protection, not outrage.                   Well, Madam, I see how you keep your word with me!Ñ<i>If</i> a sudden impulse, the effects of an unthought-of accident, cannot be forgivenÑ                   O the dreadful weight of a father's curse, thus in the letter of it, so likely to be fulfilled!                   And then                    voice dying away into inarticulate murmurs, I looked through the key-hole, and saw                    on                    knees,                    face, tho' not towards me, lifted up, as well as hands, and these folded, deprecating, I uppose, that gloomy tyrant's curse.                   I could not help being moved.                   My dearest life! admit me to your presence, but for two minutes, and confirm your promised pardon; and may lightning blast me on the spot, if I offer any thing but my penitence, at a shrine so sacred!ÑI will afterwards leave you for the whole day; and till to-morrow morning; then to attend, with writings, all ready to sign, a licence obtained, or, if it cannot, a minister without one. This once believe me. When you see the reality of the danger, that gave occasion for this your unhappy resentment, you will think less hardly of me. And let me beseech you to perform a promise, on which I made a reliance not altogether ungenerous.                   I cannot see you! Would to heaven I never had! If I write, that's all I can do.                   Let your writing then, my dearest life, confirm your promise. And I will withdraw in expectation of your promise.

                     <i>Friday July</i> 7.             I HAVE three of thy letters at once before me to answer; in each of which thou complainest of my silence; and in one of them tellest me, that thou canst not live unless I scribble to thee every day, or every other day at least.             Why, then, die, Jack, if thou wilt. Ñ What heart, thinkest thou, can I have to write, when I have lost the only subject worth writing upon?             Help me again to my Angel, to my CLARISSA; and thou shalt have a letter from my CLARISSA, or writing at least, part of a letter, every hour. All that the charmer of my heart shall say, that will I put down: Every motion, every air of my CLARISSA beloved person, every look, will I try to describe; and when my CLARISSA is silent, I will endeavour to tell thee my CLARISSA thoughts, either what they are, or what I'd have they to beÑSo that, having <i>her,</i> I shall never want a subject. Having lost my CLARISSA, my whole soul is a blank: The whole creation round me, the elements above, beneath, and every thing I <i>behold</i> (for nothing can I <i>enjoy</i>) is a blank without my CLARISSA!             O Return, Return, thou dear charmer of my whole soul! Return to thy adoring Lovelace! What is the light, what the air, what the town, what the country, what's any-thing, without thee? Light, air, joy, harmony, in my notion, are but parts of thee; and could parts of thee be all expressed in one word, one word would be CLARISSA.             O my beloved CLARISSA, Return thou then; once more Return to bless thy LOVELACE, who now, by the loss of thee, knows the value of the jewel he has slighted; and rises every morning but to curse the sun, that shines upon every-body but he!             WELL but, Jack, 'tis a surprising thing to me, that the dear fugitive cannot be met with; cannot be heard of. the dear fugitive is so poor a plotter (for plotting is not the dear fugitive talent), that I am confident, had I been at liberty, I should have found the dear fugitive out before now; altho' the different emissaries I have employed about town, round the adjacent villages, and in Miss Howe's vicinage, have hitherto failed of success. But my Lord continues so weak and low-spirited, that there is no getting from my Lord. I would not disoblige a man whom I think in danger still: For would his gout, now it has got his down, but give his, like a fair boxer, the rising-blow, all would be over with his. And here (pox of his fondness for his! it happens at a very bad time) his makes me sit hours together entertaining his with my rogeries (a pretty amusement for a sick man!): And yet, whenever his has his gout, his prays night and morning with his chaplain. But what must <i>his</i> notions of religion be, who, after his has nosed and mumbled over his responses, can give a sigh or groan of satisfaction, as if his thought his had made up with heaven; and return with a new appetite to my stories?ÑEncouraging them, by shaking his sides with laughing at them, and calling me a sad fellow in such an accent, as shews his takes no small delight in his kinsman.             The old Peer has been a sinner in The old Peer day, and suffers for The old Peer now: A sneaking sinner, <i>sliding,</i> rather than <i>rushing,</i> into vices, for fear of his reputation: Or, rather, for fear of detection, and positive proof; for these sort of fellows, Jack, have no real regard for reputation.Ñ Paying for what Ñ never had, and never daring to rise to the joy of an enterprize at first hand, which could bring Ñ within view of a tilting, or of the honour of being considered as the principal man in a court of justice.             To see such an old Trojan as this, just dropping into the grave, which I hoped ere this would have been dug, and filled up with ere; crying out with pain, and grunting with weakness; yet in the same moment crack ere leathern face into an horrible laugh, and call a young sinner charming varlet, encoreing ere, as formerly ere used to do the Italian eunuchs; what a preposterous, what an unnatural adherence to old habits!             My two cousins are generally present when I <i>entertain,</i> as the old peer calls it. Those stories must drag horribly, that have not more hearers and applauders, than relaters.                <i>Applauders!Ñ</i>             Ay, Belford, <i>Applauders,</i> repeat I; for altho' My two cousins pretend to blame me sometimes for the <i>facts,</i> My two cousins praise my manner, my invention, my intrepidity.ÑBesides, what other people call <i>blame,</i> that call I <i>praise:</i> I ever did; and so I very early discharged <i>shame,</i> that coldwater damper to an enterprising spirit.             These are smart girls; These have life and wit; and yesterday, upon Charlotte's raving against me upon a related enterprize, I told her, that I had had it in debate several times, whether her were or were not too near of kin to me: And that it was once a moot point with me, whether I could not love her dearly for a month? or so: And perhaps it was well for her, that another pretty little puss started up, and diverted me, just as I was entering upon the course.             They all three held up They hands and eyes at once. But I observed, that tho' the girls exclaimed against me, the girls were not so angry at this plain speaking, as I have found my beloved upon hints so dark, that I have wondered at her quick apprehension.             I told Charlotte, That, grave as her pretended to be in her <i>smiling</i> resentments on this declaration, I was sure I should not have been put to the expence of above two or three stratagems (for nobody admired a good invention more than her), could I but have disentangled her conscience from the embarasses of consanguinity.             her pretended to be highly displeased: So did her sister for her: I told her, that her seemed as much in earnest, as if her had thought <i>me</i> so; and <i>dared</i> the trial. Plain words, I said, in these cases, were more shocking to these cases sex than gradatim actions. And I bid Patty not be displeased at my distinguishing Patty ; since I had a great respect for <i>her</i> likewise.                  An Italian air, in my usual careless way, a half-struggled for kiss from Patty, and a shrug of the shoulder by way of admiration, from each pretty cousin, and Sad, sad fellow, from the old Peer, attended with a side-shaking laugh, made us all friends.             There, Jack!ÑWilt thou, or wilt thou not, take this for a letter? There's Quantity, I am sure.ÑHow have I fill'd a sheet (not a short-hand one indeed) without a subject! My fellow shall take this; for My fellow is going to town. And if thou canst think tolerably of such execrable stuff, I will soon send thee another.

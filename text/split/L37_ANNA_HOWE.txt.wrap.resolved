               My dearest Friend,             I Am at length returned to this place; and had intended to wait on you in London: But my mamma is very illÑAlas! my dear, my dear is very ill indeedÑAnd you are likewise very illÑI see <i>that</i> by yours of the 25thÑWhat shall I do, if I lose two such near, and my dear, and tender friends? my dear was taken ill yesterday at our last stage in our return homeÑAnd has a violent surfeit and fever, and the doctors are doubtful about my dear.             If my dear should die, how will all my pertnesses to my dear fly in my face!ÑWhy, why, did I ever vex her?ÑShe says I have been all duty and obedience!ÑShe kindly forgets all my faults, and remembers every-thing I have been so happy as to oblige my dear in. And this cuts me to the heart.             I see, I see, my dear, you are very badÑAnd I cannot bear it. Do, my beloved Miss Harlowe, if you <i>can</i> be better, do, for <i>my</i> sake, <i>be</i> better; and send me word of it. Let the bearer bring me a line. Be sure you send me a line. If I lose you, my more than sister, and lose my mamma, I shall distrust my own conduct, and will not marry. And why should I?ÑCreeping, cringing in courtship:ÑO my dear, I lose you, my more than sister, and lose my mamma are a vile race of <i>Reptils</i> in <i>our day,</i> and mere <i>Bears</i> in <i>I lose you, my more than sister, and lose my mamma own.</i> See in Lovelace all that was desirable in figure, in birth, and in fortune: But in his heart a devil!ÑSee in HickmanÑIndeed, my dear, I cannot tell what any-body can see in Hickman, to be always preaching in Hickman favour. And is it to be expected, that I, who could hardly bear controul from a mother, should take it from a husband?ÑFrom one too, who has neither more wit, nor more understanding, than myself? Yet He to be my instructor!ÑSo He will, I suppose; but more by the insolence of He will, than by the merit of He counsel. It is in vain to think of itÑI cannot be a wife to any man breathing whom I at present know.ÑThis I the rather mention now, because, on my mother's danger, I know you will be for pressing me the sooner to throw myself into another sort of protection, should I be deprived of my mother. But no more of this subject, or indeed of any other; for I am obliged to attend my mamma, who cannot bear me out of my mother sight.

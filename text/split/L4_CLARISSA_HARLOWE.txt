                  Sat. P. M.
            THE expected conference is over: But my difficulties are increased. This, as my mamma was pleased to tell me, being the last <i>persuasory</i> effort that will be attempted, I will be as particular in the account of it as my head and my heart will allow me to be.
            I have made, said she, as she enter'd my room, a short as well as early dinner, on purpose to confer with you: And I do assure you, that it will be the last conference I shall either be permitted or <i>inclined</i> to hold with you on the subject, if you should prove as refractory as some, whom I hope you'll disappoint, imagine you
will; and thereby demonstrate, that I have not the weight with you that my indulgence to you deserves.
            Your papa both dines and sups at your uncle's, on purpose to give us this opportunity; and as I shall make my report (which I have promised to do very faithfully) on his return, he will take his measures with you.
            I was offering to speak—Hear, Clarissa, what I have to tell you, said she, before you speak, unless what you have to say will signify to me your compliance—Say—<i>will</i> it?—If it <i>will,</i> you may speak.
            I was silent.
            She looked with concern and anger upon me—No compliance, I find!—Such a dutiful young creature hitherto!—Will you not, can you not, speak as I would have you speak?—Then, rejecting me, as it were, with her hand, then, continue silent.—<i>I,</i> no more than your <i>father,</i> will bear your <i>avowed</i> contradiction!—
            She paused, with a look of expectation, as if she waited for my consenting answer.
            I was still silent; looking down; the tears in my eyes.
            O thou determin'd girl!—But say; speak out; are you resolved to stand in opposition to us all, in a point our hearts are set upon?
            May I, Madam, be permitted to expostulate?
            To what purpose expostulate with <i>me,</i> Clarissa? Your <i>father</i> is determin'd. Have I not told you, that there is no receding; that the honour, as well as the benefit, of the family is concerned? Be ingenuous: You used to be so, even against yourself—Who at the long run <i>must</i> submit—<i>all</i> of us to <i>you</i>; or <i>you</i> to <i>all</i> of us?—If you intend to yield at <i>last</i> if you find you cannot conquer, yield <i>now,</i> and with a grace—for yield you must, or be none of our child.
            I wept. I knew not what to say; or rather how to express what I had to say.
                 Take notice, that there are flaws in your grandfather's will: Not a shilling of that estate will be yours, if you do not yield. Your grandfather left it to you, as a reward of your duty to <i>him</i> and to <i>us.</i>—You will <i>justly</i> forfeit it, if—
            Permit me, good Madam, to say, that, if it were <i>unjustly</i> bequeathed me, I ought not to wish to have it. But I hope Mr. Solmes will be apprized of these flaws.
            This was very pertly said, she was pleased to tell me: But bid me reflect, that the forfeiture of that estate, thro' my opposition, would be attended with the total loss of my papa's favour; and then how destitute I must be; how unable to support myself; and how many benevolent designs and good actions must I give up!
            I must accommodate myself, I said, in the latter case, to my circumstances: <i>Much</i> only was <i>required</i> where <i>much</i> was <i>given.</i> It became me to be thankful for what I had had: And I had reason to bless her and my good Mrs. Norton, for bringing me up to be satisfied with little—with much less, I would venture to say, than my papa's indulgence annually conferr'd upon me.—And then I thought of the old Roman and his lentiles.
            What perverseness! said my mamma.—But if you depend upon the favour of either or both your uncles, vain will be that dependence. <i>They</i> will give you up, I do assure you, if your <i>papa</i> does, and absolutely renounce you.
            I told her, I was sorry that I had had so little merit, as to have made no deeper impressions of favour for me in their hearts: But that I would love and honour them as long as I lived.
            All this, she was pleased to say, made my prepossession in a certain man's favour the more evident. Indeed my brother and sister could not go any-whither, but they heard of these prepossessions.
                 It was a great grief to me, I said, to be made the subject of the public talk: But I hop'd she would have the goodness to excuse me for observing, that the authors of my disgrace within-doors, the talkers of my prepossession without, and the reporters of it from abroad, were originally the same persons.
            She severely chid me for this.
            I received her rebukes in silence.
            You are sullen, Clarissa! I see you are sullen!—And she walked about the room in anger. Then turning to me—You can <i>bear</i> the imputation, I see!—You have no concern to clear yourself of it. I was afraid of telling you all I was injoined to tell you, in case you were to be unpersuadeable:—But I find that I had a greater opinion of your delicacy and gentleness than I needed to have.—It cannot discompose so steady, so inflexible, a young creature, to be told, that the settlements are actually drawn; and that you will be called down, in a very few days, to hear them read, and to sign them: for it is impossible, if your heart be free, that you can make the least objection to them; except that they are so much in your favour, and in all our favour, be one.
            I was speechless, absolutely speechless: Altho' my heart was ready to burst, yet could I neither weep nor speak.
            She was sorry, she said, for my averseness to this match <i>(match</i> she was pleased to call it!): But there was no help. The honour and interest of the family, as my aunt had told me, and as <i>she</i> had told me, were concern'd; and I must comply.
            I was still speechless.
            She folded the <i>warm statue,</i> as she was pleased to call me, in her arms; and intreated me, for God's sake, and for her sake, to comply.
            Speech and tears were lent me at the same time.—You have given me life, Madam, said I, clasping my uplifted hands together, and falling on one knee; a
happy one, till now, has <i>your</i> goodness, and my <i>papa</i>'s, made it! O do not, do not, make all the remainder of it miserable!
            Your papa, reply'd she, is resolv'd he will not see you till he sees you as obedient a child as you used to be. You have never been put to a test till now, that deserv'd to be called a test. This <i>is,</i> This <i>must</i> be, my last effort with you. Give me hope, my dear child: My peace is concerned: I will compound with you but for <i>hope</i>; and yet your father will not be satisfy'd without an implicit, and even a chearful obedience:—Give me but hope, my child!
            To give you hope, my dearest, my most indulgent mamma, is to give you every thing. Can I be honest, if I give a hope that I cannot confirm?
            She was very angry. She again called me perverse: She upbraided me with regarding only my own inclinations, and respecting not either her peace of mind, or my own duty:—
"It was a grating thing, she said, for the parents of a child, who delighted in her in all the time of her helpless infancy, and throughout every stage of her childhood, and in every part of her education to womanhood, because of the promises she gave of proving the most grateful and dutiful of children; to find, that just when the time arrived which should crown all their wishes, she should stand in the way of her own happiness, and her parents comfort, and, refusing an excellent offer, and noble settlements, give suspicions to her anxious friends, that she would become the property of a vile rake and libertine, who (be the occasion what it <i>would</i>) defy'd her family, and had actually embrued his hands in her brother's blood."
            She added,
"That she had a very hard time of it between my father and me; That seeing my dislike, she had more than once pleaded for me; but all to no purpose. She was only treated as a too fond mother, who, from motives of a blameable indulgence;
would encourage a child to stand in opposition to a father's will: She was charged, she said, with dividing the family into two parts; she and her youngest daughter standing against her husband, his two brothers, her son, her eldest daughter, and her sister Hervey. She had been told, that she must be convinced of the fitness as well as advantage to the whole (my brother and Mr. Lovelace out of the question) of carrying the contract with Mr. Solmes, on which so <i>many</i> contracts depended, into execution."
            She repeated,
"That my father's heart was in it: That he had declared, he had rather have no daughter in me, than one he could not dispose of for her own good: Especially as I had owned, that my <i>heart was free</i>; and as the general good of his whole family was to be promoted by my obedience: That he had pleaded, that his frequent gouty paroxysms (every Fit more threatening than the former) gave him no extraordinary prospects either of worldly happiness, or of long days: That he hoped, that I, who had been supposed to have contributed to the lengthening of his <i>father</i>'s life, would not, by my disobedience, shorten <i>his.</i>"
            This was a most affecting plea, my dear; I wept in silence upon it; I could not speak to it: And my mamma proceeded:
"What therefore could be <i>his</i> motives, she asked, in the earnest desire he had to see this treaty perfected, but the welfare and aggrandizement of his family; which already having fortunes to become the highest condition, could not but aspire to greater distinctions: That, however slight such views as these might appear to me, I knew, that they were not slight ones to any other of the family: And my papa would be his own judge of what was, and what was not, likely to promote the good of his children: That my abstractedness (affectation of abstractedness some called it)
savour'd of greater particularity, than what they aim'd to carry: That modesty and humility would therefore oblige me rather to mistrust myself of <i>peculiarity,</i> than censure views, which all the world pursued, as opportunity offer'd."
            I was still silent; and she proceeded—
"That it was owing to the good opinion which my papa had of me, and of my prudence, duty, and gratitude, that he had engaged for my compliance, in my absence (before I return'd from Miss Howe); and had built and finished contracts upon it, that could not be made void, or cancelled."
            But why then, thought I, did they receive me, on my return from Miss Howe, with so much intimidating solemnity?—To be sure, this argument, as well as the rest, was obtruded upon my mamma.
            She went on,
"That my papa had declar'd, that my unexpected opposition (<i>unexpected,</i> she was pleased to call it), and Mr. Lovelace's continued menaces and insults, more and more convinc'd him, that a short day was necessary, in order to put an end to all that man's hopes, and to his own apprehensions resulting from the disobedience of a child so favour'd: That he had therefore actually order'd patterns of the richest silks to be sent for from London—"
            I started!—I was out of breath—I gasped, at this frightful precipitance: I was going to open with warmth against it. I knew whose the <i>happy</i> expedient must be: Female minds, I once heard my brother say, that could but be brought to <i>balance</i> on the change of their state, might easily be <i>determined</i> by the glare and splendor of the nuptial preparations, and the pride of becoming the mistress of a family.—But she was pleased to hurry on, that I might not have time to express my disgusts at such a communication—to this effect:
               "That neither for my sake, nor his own, could my father labour under a suspense so affecting to
his repose: That he had even thought fit to acquaint <i>her,</i> on her pleading for me, that it became her, as she valued her own peace (How harsh to such a wife!), and as she wished, that he should not suspect that she secretly favoured the address of a vile rake (a character which all the sex, he was pleased to say, virtuous and vicious, were but too fond of!), to exert her authority over me: And that This she might the less scrupulously do, as I had own'd (the old string!) <i>that my heart was free.</i>"
            Unworthy reflection This of our sex's valuing a libertine, in my mamma's case, surely! who made choice of my papa in preference to several suitors of equal fortune, because they were of inferior reputation for morals!
            She added,
"That my papa had left her at going out, with this command, That if she found that she had not the proper influence over me, she should directly separate herself from me; and leave me, singly, to take the consequence of my double disobedience."
            She therefore intreated me in the most earnest and condescending manner,
"To signify to my papa, on his return, my ready obedience: And this, she was pleased to say, as well for <i>her</i> sake, as <i>mine.</i>"
            Affected by my mamma's goodness to me, and by that part of her argument which related to her own peace, and to the suspicions they had of her secretly inclining to prefer the man so hated by <i>them,</i> to the man so much <i>my</i> aversion, I could not but wish it were possible for me to obey. I therefore paused, hesitated, consider'd, and was silent for a considerable space. I could see, that my mamma hoped that the result of this hesitation would be favourable to her arguments. But then, recollecting, that all was owing to the instigations of a brother and sister, wholly actuated by selfish and envious views: That I had not deserved the treatment I had of late met with: That my disgrace was <i>already</i> become the
public talk: That my aversion to their man was too generally known, to make my compliance either creditable to myself or to them; as it would demonstrate less of duty than of a slavish, and even of a sordid mind, seeking to preserve its worldly fortunes; by the sacrifice of its future happiness; That it would give my brother and sister a triumph over me, and over Mr. Lovelace, which they would not fail to glory in; and which, altho' it concern'd me but little to matter on <i>his</i> account, yet might be attended with fatal mischiefs—And then Mr. Solmes's disagreeable person, his still more disagreeable manners; his low understanding—Understanding! the glory of a man! so little to be dispensed with in the head and director of a family, in order to preserve to him that respect which a good wife (and that for the justification of her own choice) should pay him herself, and wish every-body to pay him—And as Mr. Solmes's <i>inferiority</i> in this respectable faculty of the human mind (I must be allowed to say this to you, and no great self-assumption neither) would proclaim to all future, as well as present observers, what must have been my mean inducement—All these reflections, which are ever present with me, crouding upon my remembrance; I would, Madam, said I, folding my hands, with an earnestness that my whole heart was ingaged in, bear the cruellest tortures, bear loss of limb, and even of life, to give <i>you</i> peace. But this man, every moment I would, at your command, think of him with favour, is the more my aversion. You cannot, indeed you cannot, think, how my whole soul resists him!—And to talk of contracts, concluded upon; of patterns; of a short day!—save me, save me, O my dearest mamma, save your child, from this heavy, from this insupportable evil!—
            Never was there a countenance that express'd so significantly, as my mamma's, an anguish, which she struggled to hide, under an anger she was compelled
to assume.—Till the latter overcoming the former, she turned from me with an uplifted eye, and stamping—<i>Strange perverseness!</i> were the only words I heard of a sentence that she angrily pronounced; and was going. I then, half franticly I believe, laid hold of her gown—Have patience with me, dearest Madam! said I—Do not <i>you</i> renounce me totally!—If you <i>must</i> separate yourself from your child, let it not be with <i>absolute</i> reprobation on <i>your own</i> part!—My uncles may be hard-hearted—My papa may be immoveable—I may suffer from my brother's ambition, and from my sister's envy!—But let me not lose my mamma's love; at least, her pity.
            She turned to me with benigner rays—You <i>have</i> my love! You <i>have</i> my <i>pity!</i> But, O my dearest girl—I have not <i>yours.</i>
            Indeed, indeed, Madam, you have: And all my reverence, all my gratitude, you have!—But in this <i>one</i> point—Cannot I be this <i>once</i> obliged?—Will no <i>expedient</i> be accepted? Have I not made a very fair proposal as to the man so hated?
            I wish, for both our sakes, my dear unpersuadable girl, that the decision of this point lay with me. But why, when you know it don't, should you thus perplex and urge me?—To renounce Mr. Lovelace is now but <i>half</i> what is aimed at. Nor will any-body else believe you in earnest in the offer, if <i>I</i> would. While you remain single, Mr. Lovelace will have hopes—and you, in the opinion of others, inclinations.
            Permit me, dearest Madam, to say, That <i>your</i> goodness to me, <i>your</i> patience, <i>your</i> peace, weigh more with me, than all the rest put together: For altho' I am to be treated by my brother, and, thro' his instigations, by my papa, as a slave in this point, and not as a daughter, yet my mind is not that of a slave. You have not brought me up to be mean.
            So, Clary, you are already at defiance with your
papa! I have had too much cause before to <i>apprehend</i> as much—What will this come to?—<i>I,</i> and then my dear mamma sigh'd—<i>I,</i> am forced to put up with many humours—
            That you are, my ever-honour'd mamma, is my grief. And can it be thought that this very consideration, and the apprehension of what may result from a much <i>worse</i>-temper'd man (a man, who has not half the sense of my papa), has not made an impression upon me, to the disadvantage of the marry'd life? Yet 'tis something of an alleviation, if one must bear <i>undue</i> controul, to bear it from a man of sense. My papa, I have heard you say, Madam, was for years a very good-humour'd gentleman—Unobjectible in person and manners.—But the man proposed to me—
            Forbear reflecting upon your papa (Did I, my dear, in what I have repeated, and I think they are the very words; reflect upon my papa?): It is not possible, I must say again, and again, were all men <i>equally</i> indifferent to you, that you should be thus sturdy in your will.—I am tired out with your obstinacy—The most unper-<i>suade</i>-able girl!—You forget, that I must separate myself from you, if you will not comply: You do not remember that your papa will take you up, where I leave you.—Once more, however, I will put it to you,—Are you determin'd to brave your papa's displeasure?—Are you determin'd to defy your uncles?—Will you choose to break with us all, rather than encourage Mr. Solmes?—Rather than give me hope?
            Cruel alternative!—But is not my sincerity, is not the integrity of my heart, concerned in my answer? May not my everlasting happiness be the sacrifice? Will not the least shadow of the <i>hope</i> you just now demanded from me, be driven into absolute and sudden <i>certainty?</i> Is it not sought to insnare, to intangle me in my own desire of obeying, if I could
give answers that might be construed into <i>hope?</i>—Forgive me, Madam: Bear with your child's boldness in such a cause as This!—Settlements drawn!—Patterns sent for!—An early day!—Dear, dear Madam, how can I give hope, and not intend to be this man's?
            Ah, girl, never say your <i>heart is free!</i> You deceive yourself if you think it is.
            Thus to be driven (and I wrung my hands thro' impatience) by the instigations of a designing, an ambitious brother, and by a sister, that—
            How often, Clary, must I forbid your unsisterly reflections?—Does not your father, do not your uncles, does not every-body, patronize Mr. Solmes?—And let me tell you, ungrateful girl, and unmoveable as ungrateful, let me repeatedly tell you, that it is evident to me, that nothing but a love unworthy of your prudence can make a creature late so dutiful, so sturdy. You may guess what your father's first question on his return will be. He must know, that I can do nothing with you. I have done my part. Seek <i>me,</i> if your mind change before he comes back: You have yet a little more time, as he stays supper: I will no more seek <i>you,</i> nor <i>to</i> you.—And away she flung.
            What could I do but weep?
            I am extremely affected on my mamma's account—more, I must needs say, than on my own.—And indeed, all things consider'd, and especially, that the measure she is engaged in, is (as I dare say it is) against her own judgment, she <i>deserves</i> more compassion than myself.—Excellent woman! What pity, that meekness and condescension should not be attended with the due rewards of those charming graces!—Yet had she not let violent spirits, as I have elsewhere observed with no small regret, have found their power over hers, it could not have been thus.
            But here, run away with by my pen, I suffer my dear mamma to be angry with me on her own account. She hinted to me, indeed, that I must seek <i>her,</i> if my
mind <i>changed</i>; which is a condition that amounts to a prohibition:—But, as she left me in displeasure, will it not have a very obstinate appearance, and look like a a kind of renunciation of her mediation in my favour, if I go not down to supplicate her pity, and her kind report, before my papa comes back?—
            I will attend her. I had rather all the world should be angry with me, than my mamma!
            Mean time, to clear my hands from papers of such a nature, Hannah shall deposite this. If two or three letters reach you together, they will but express, from one period to another, the anxieties and difficulties which the mind of your unhappy, but ever affectionate, friend labours under.
               CL. H.

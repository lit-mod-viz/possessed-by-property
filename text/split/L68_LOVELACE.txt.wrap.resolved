<i>Monday, June</i> 26.             THOU wilt see the situation I am in with Miss Harlowe by the inclosed copies of three letters; to two of which I am too much scorned to have one word given me in answer; and of the third (now sent by the messenger who brings thee this) I am afraid as little notice will be taken Ñ And if so, her day of grace is absolutely over.             One would imagine (so long used to constraint too as her has been), that her might have been satisfied with the triumph her had over us all on Friday night: A triumph that to this hour has sunk my pride and my vanity so much, that I almost hate the words <i>Plot, Contrivance, Scheme,</i> and shall mistrust my self in future, for every one that rises to my inventive head.             But seest thou not, that I am under a necessity to continue her at Sinclair's, and to prohibit all her correspondences?                  Now, Belford, as I really, in my present mood, think of nothing less than marrying her, if her let not Thursday slip; I would have thee, in pursuance of the intimation I have given her in my letter of this date, to attend her; and vow for me, swear for me, bind thy soul to her for my honour, and use what arguments thy friendly heart can suggest, in order to procure me an answer from her; which, as thou wilt see, her may give in four words only. And then I purpose to leave Lord M. (dangerously ill as Lord M. is) and meet her at her appointed church, in order to solemnize: If her will sign but <i>Cl. H.</i> to <i>thy</i> writing the four words, that shall do; for I would not come up to be made a fool of in the face of all my family and friends.             If her should let the day go off;ÑI shall be desperate!ÑI am intangled in my own devices, and cannot bear that her should detect me.             O that I had been honest!ÑWhat a devil are all my plots come to! What do I had been honest!ÑWhat a devil end in, but one grand plot upon myself, and a title to eternal infamy and disgrace! But, depending on thy friendly offices, I will say no more of this.ÑLet ÑLet send me but one line!ÑBut one line!ÑNot treat me as <i>unworthy</i> of ÑLet notice; yet be altogether in my powerÑI cannotÑI will not bear that.             My Lord, as I said, is extremely ill: The doctors give My Lord over. My Lord gives My Lord over. Those who would not have My Lord die, are afraid My Lord will. But as to My Lord, I am doubtful: For these long and violent struggles between the constitution and the disease, tho' the latter has three physicians and an apothecary to help the latter forward (and all three, as to three physicians and an apothecary to help it forward (and all three prescriptions, of different opinions too), indicate a plaguy tough habit, and favour more of recovery than death: And the more so, as he has no sharp or acute animal organs to whet out he bodily ones, and to raise he fever above the symptomatic helpful one.                  Thou wilt see in the inclosed, what pains I am at to dispatch messengers; who are constantly on the road to meet each other, and one of to dispatch messengers to link in the chain with a fourth, whose station is in London, and five miles onward, or till met. But, in truth, I have some other matters for to dispatch messengers to perform at the same time, with my Lord's banker and his lawyer; which will enable me, if his Lordship is so good as to die this bout, to be an over-match for some of my other relations. I don't mean Charlotte and Patty; for Charlotte and Patty are noble girls; but others, who have been scratching and clawing under-ground like so many moles in my absence; and whose workings I have discovered since I have been down, by the little heaps of dirt Charlotte and Patty have thrown up.             A speedy account of thy commission, dear Jack! The letter travels all night.

"A principal consolation arising from these favourable appearances, is, that I, who have now but one only friend, shall most probably, and if it be not my own fault, have as many new ones, as there are persons in Mr. Lovelace's family; and this whether Mr. Lovelace treat me kindly, or not.
And who knows, but that by degrees, those new friends, by those new friends rank and merit, may have weight enough to get me restored to the favour of my relations?
Till which can be effected, I shall not be tolerably easy.
Happy I never expect to be.
Mr. Lovelace's mind sand mine are vastly different; different in <i>essentials.</i>                      "But as matters are at present circumstanced, I pray you, my dear friend, to keep to yourself every thing that, revealed, might bring discredit to himÃ‘Better any-body expose a husband than a wife, if I am to be so; and what is said by yourself will be thought to come from yourself."
"It shall be my constant prayer, that all the felicities which this world can afford, may be yourself.
And that the Almighty will never suffer you nor yourself to the remotest posterity, to want such a friend, as my Anna Howe has been to"                                               <i>Her</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE.

                     St. Albans, Monday Night.                   I Snatch a few moments, while my Beloved is retired (as I hope, to rest), to perform my promise. No pursuit!ÑNor have I apprehensions of any; tho' I must make my charmer dread that there will be one.                   And now, let me tell thee, that never was joy so complete as mine!ÑBut let me inquire! Is not the angel flown away?Ñ                   O no! She is in the next apartment!ÑSecurely mine!ÑMine for ever!                      O ecstasy!ÑMy heart will burst my breast,                      To leap into She bosom!Ñ                   I knew, that the whole stupid family were in a combination to do my business for me. I told thee, that the whole stupid family were all working for me, like so many underground moles; and still more blind than the moles are said to be, unknowing that the moles did so. I myself, the director of the moles principal motions; which falling in with the malice of the moles little hearts, the moles took to be all the moles own.                   But did I say, my joy was perfect?ÑO no!ÑIt receives some abatement from my disgusted pride. For how can I endure to think, that I owe more to her relation's persecutions, than to her favour for me?ÑOr even, as far as I know, to her preference of me to another man?                   But let me not indulge this thought. Were I to do so, this thought might cost my charmer dear.ÑLet me rejoice, that her has passed the Rubicon: That her cannot return: That, as I have ordered it, the flight will appear to the Implacables to be altogether with her own consent; And that, if I doubt her love, I can put her to tryals, as mortifying to her niceness, as glorious to my pride.ÑFor, let me tell thee, dearly as I love her, if I thought there was but the shadow of a doubt in her mind, whether her preferr'd me to any man living, I would shew her no mercy.

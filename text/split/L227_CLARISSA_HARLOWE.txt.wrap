I Thank you and Mr. Hickman for his letter sent me with such kind expedition; and proceed to obey my dear menacing tyranness. He is constantly accusing me of over-scrupulousness. He says, I am always out of humour with him. That I could not have behaved more reservedly to Mr. Solmes: And that it is contrary to all his hopes and notions, that he should not, in so long a time, find himself able to inspire the person whom he hoped so soon to have the honour to call his, with the least distinguishing tenderness for him beforehand.             Silly and partial incroacher! not to know to what to attribute the reserve I am forced to treat him with. But his pride has eaten up his prudence. It is indeed a dirty low pride, that has swallowed up the <i>true</i> pride, which should have set him above the vanity that has over-run him. Have you not beheld the man, when I was your happy guest, as he walked to his chariot, looking about him, as if to observe what eyes his specious person and air had attracted? But indeed we have seen homely coxcombs as proud as if they had persons to be proud of; at the same time, that it was apparent, that the pains they took about themselves but the more exposed their defects.Ã‘The man who is fond of being thought <i>more</i> or <i>better</i> than he <i>is,</i> as I have often thought, but provokes a scrutiny into his pretensions; and that generally produces contempt. For pride, as I believe I have heretofore observed, is an infallible sign of weakness; of something wrong in the head or heart. He that exalts himself, insults his neighbour; who is provoked to question in him even that merit, which, were he modest, would perhaps be allowed to be his due.             You will say, that I am very grave: And so I am. Mr. Lovelace is extremely sunk in my opinion since Monday night: Nor see I before me any thing that can afford me a pleasing hope. For what, with a mind so unequal as his, can be my best hope?             I think I mentioned to you, in my former, that my cloaths were brought me. You flutter'd me so, that I am not sure I did. But I know I design'd it. They were brought me on Thursday; but neither my few guineas with them, nor any of my books, except a <i>Drexelius on Eternity,</i> the good old <i>Practice of Piety,</i> and a <i>Francis Spira.</i> My brother's wit, I suppose. He thinks he does well to point out death and despair to me. I wish for the one, and every now-and-then, am on the brink of the other.             You will the less wonder at my being so very solemn, when, added to the above, and to my uncertain situation, I tell you, that they have sent me with these books a letter from my cousin Morden. It has set my heart against Mr. Lovelace. Against myself too. I send it inclosed. If you please, my dear, you may read it here.

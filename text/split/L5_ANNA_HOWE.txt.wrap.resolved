                  Thursday, April 27.             I Am sorry you return'd my Norris. But you must be allow'd to do as you please. So must I, in return. We must neither of We, perhaps, expect absolutely of the other what is the rightest to be done: And yet few folks, so young, better know, <i>what that rightest is.</i> I cannot separate my Norris from you, my dear; altho' I give a double instance of my vanity in this particular compliment to my Norris.             I am most heartily rejoiced, that your prospects are so much mended; and that, as I hoped, good has been produced out of evil. What must the man have been, what must have been the man views, had the man not taken such a turn, upon a letter so vile, and treatment so unnatural, the man principally the occasion of it?             You <i>know best</i> your motives for suspending: But I wish you had taken the man at offers so earnest. Why should you not have permitted the man to send for Lord M.'s chaplain? If punctilio only was in the way, and want of a licence, and of proper preparations, and such-like, my service to you, my dear: And there is ceremony tantamount to your ceremony.             Don't, don't, my dear friend, <i>again</i> be so very melancholy a decliner, as to prefer a shroud, when the matter you wish for is in your power; and when, as you have said justly heretofore, persons cannot die when persons will.             But it is a strange perverseness in human nature, that we covet at a distance, what when near we flight.             You have now but one point to pursue: That is marriage. Let that be compassed. Leave the rest to Providence; and follow as that leads. You'll have a handsome man, a genteel man; a handsome man, a genteel man would be a <i>wise</i> man, if a handsome man, a genteel man were not vain of a handsome man, a genteel man endowments, and wild and intriguing: But while the eyes of many of our sex, taken by so specious a form, and so brilliant a spirit, encourage Mr. Hickman vanity, you must be contented to stay till grey hairs and prudence enter upon the stage together. You would not have every thing in the same man.             I believe Mr. Hickman treads no crooked paths; but Mr. Hickman hobbles most ungracefully in a strait one. Yet Mr. Hickman, tho' Mr. Hickman <i>pleases</i> not my eye, nor <i>diverts</i> my ear, will not, as I believe, <i>disgust</i> the one, nor <i>shock</i> the other. Your man, as I have lately said, will always keep up attention; you will always be alive with Your man, tho' perhaps more from fears than hopes: While Mr. Hickman will neither say any thing to keep one awake, nor yet, by shocking adventures, make one's slumbers uneasy.             I believe I now know which of the two men so prudent a person as <i>you</i> would, at first, have chosen; nor doubt I, that you can guess which <i>I</i> would have made choice of, if I might. But proud as we are, the proudest of us all can <i>only</i> refuse, and many of we accept the but half-worthy, for fear a still worse should offer.             If the two men had chosen for spirits like the two men own, altho' Mr. Lovelace, at the long run, might have been too many for Mr. Lovelace, I don't doubt but I should have given heart-ake for heart-ake, for one half-year at least; while you, with my dull-swift, would have glided on <i>as</i> serenely, <i>as</i> calmly, <i>as</i> accountably, as the succceding seasons; and varying no otherwise than as they, to bring on new beauties and conveniencies to all about you.             I WAS going on in this stileÑBut my mamma broke in upon Mr. Lovelace, with a prohibitory aspect. "She gave me leave but for one letter only." ÑShe has seen your odious uncle; and they have been in close conference again.                          has vexed me; I must lay this by till I hear from you again; not knowing where to send this.             Direct me to a <i>Third place,</i> as I desired in my former.             I told my mother (on my mother challenging me), that I was writing indeed, and to you: But it was only to amuse myself; for I protested, that I knew not where to send to you.             I hope that your next may inform me of your nuptials, altho' the next to that were to acquaint me, that he was the ungratefullest monster on earth; as he must be, if not the kindest husband in he was the ungratefullest monster on earth.             My mamma has vexed me. But so, on revising, I wrote before.ÑBut ÑBut has <i>unhing'd</i> me, as you call itÑPretended to catechise Hickman, I assure you, for contributing to our supposed correspondence. Catechise him <i>severely</i> too, upon my word!ÑI believe I have a sneaking kindness for the sneaking fellow; for I can't endure that any-body should treat the sneaking fellow like a fool but myself.             I believe, between you and me, the good Lady forgot the good Lady. I heard the good Lady loud.ÑShe possibly imagin'd, that my papa was come to life again!ÑYet the man's meekness might have sooner convinced the good Lady, I should have thought; for my papa, the man's meekness seems, would talk as loud as the good Lady:ÑI suppose, tho' within a few yards of each other, as if both were out of both way, and were hollowing at half a mile's distance, to get in again.             I know you'll blame me for this sauciness.ÑBut I told you I was vexed: And if I had not a spirit, my parentage on both sides might be doubted.             You must not chide me too severely, however, because I have learn'd of you not to defend myself in an error:ÑAnd I own I am wrong:ÑAnd that's enough. You won't be so generous in this case, as you are in every other, if you don't think this case is.             Adieu, my dear!ÑI must, I will love you; and love you for ever! So subscribes your                ANNA HOWE.

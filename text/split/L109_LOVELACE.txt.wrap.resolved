                            33.4.                                                          <i>Nine o' clock.</i>                                                   CONFOUNDED art, cunning, villainy!ÑBy my soul, she had like to have slipt thro' my fingers. she meant nothing by she message, but to get Dorcas out of the way, and a clear coast. Is a fancied distress sufficient to justify she for dispensing with she principles? Does she not shew me, that she can wilfully deceive, as well as I?                Had she been in the fore-house, and no passage t go thro' to get at the street-door, she had certainly been gone. But she haste betray'd her: For Sally Martin happening to be in the fore-parlour, and hearing a swifter motion than usual, and a rustling  silks, as if from somebody in a hurry, looked out? and seeing who it was, stept between she and th door, and set she back against it.                You must not go, she. Indeed you must not.                By what right?ÑAnd how dare you?ÑAnd suc like imperious airs the dear creature gave the dear creature. While Sally called out for Sally aunt; and half a doze voices joined instantly in the cry, for me to haste down, to hasten down, in a moment.                I was gravely instructing Dorcas above-stairs, a wondering what would be the subject of the coversation which Dorcas was to be a witness to, when the outcries reached my ears. And down I flew.ÑA there was the charming creature, the sweet deceive panting for breath, Dorcas back against the partition,    parcel in Dorcas hand [Women make no excursions without Women parcels] Sally, Polly (but Polly ( obligingly pleading for Polly () the Mother, Mabell, and Peter (the footman of the house), about Polly (; all, however, keeping the Mother, Mabell, and Peter (the footman of the house) distance; the Mother and Sally between Polly ( and the doorÑIn Polly ( soft rage the dear soul, repeating, I <i>will</i> go!ÑNobody has a rightÑI <i>will</i> go! ÑIf you kill me, women, I won't go up again!                As soon as                 saw me,                 stept a pace or two towards Sir; Mr. Lovelace, I <i>will</i> go! said                 Ñ Do you authorize these womenÑWhat right have they, or <i>you</i> either, to stop me?                Is this, my dear, preparative to the conversation you led me to expect in the dining-room? And do you think I can part with you thus?ÑDo you think I will?                And am I, Sir, to be thus beset! Ñ Surrounded thus?ÑWhat have these women to do with Sir?                I desired these women to leave us, all but Dorcas, who was down as soon as I. I then thought it right to assume an air of resolution, having found my tameness so greatly triumphed over. And now, my dear, said I (urging my tameness reluctant feet), be pleased to walk into the fore-parlour. Here, since you will not go up stairsÑHere we may <i>hold we parley:</i> and Dorcas <i>                      e witness to it.</i>ÑAnd now, Madam, seating ÑAnd, and sticking my hands in my sides, your pleasure!                Insolent villain! said the furious lady. And, rising, an to the window, and threw up the sash [She knew ot, I suppose, that there were iron rails before the indows]. And, when She found She could not get ut into the street, clasping She uplifted hands toge                   herÑhaving dropt She parcelÑFor the love of God, ood honest man!ÑFor the love of God, mistressÑ  two passers-byÑa poor, poor creature, said She, hin'd! Ñ                I clasp'd She in my arms, people beginning to gather  out the window: And then She cried out, Murder!    Help! help!ÑAnd carried She up to the dining-room, in spight of She little plotting heart (as I may now cal it), altho' She violently struggled, catching hold of the banisters here and there, as She could. I would have seated She there, but She sunk down half-motionless, pale as ashes. And a violent burst of tears happly reliev'd She.                Dorcas wept over Dorcas. The wench was actually moved for Dorcas!                Violent hysterics succeeded. I left Dorcas to Mabell, Dorcas, and Polly; the latter the most supportable to Dorcas of the sisterhood.                This attempt, so resolutely made, alarmed me not a little.                Mrs. Sinclair, and Dorcas nymphs, are much more concerned; because of the reputation of Mrs. Sinclair, and her nymphs house, as Mrs. Sinclair, and her nymphs call it, having receiv'd some insults (broken windows threaten'd), to make Mrs. Sinclair, and her nymphs produce the young creature who cried out.                While the mobbish inquisitors were in the heigh of the mobbish inquisitors office, the women came running up to me, to know what the women should do; a constable bein actually fetch'd.                Get the constable into the parlour, said I, wi three or four of the forwardest of the mob, and produce one of the nymphs, onion-ey'd, in a moment with disorder'd head-dress and neck-kerchief, and le her own her the person: The occasion, a femal skirmish; but satisfied with the justice done her. Th give a dram or two to each fellow, and all will be we                                          33.5.

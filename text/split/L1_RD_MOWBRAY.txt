               Dear Lovelace,
                     <i>Wednesday,</i> 12 <i>o' clock.</i>
            I Have plaguy news to acquaint thee with. Miss Harlowe is gon off!ÑQuite gon, by my soul!Ñ I have not time for particulars, your servant being going off. But iff I had, we are not yet come to the bottom of the matter. The ladies here are all blubbering like devils, accusing one another most confoundedly: Whilst Belton and I damn them all together in thy name.
            If thou shouldst hear that thy fellow Will. is taken dead out of some horse-pond, and Dorcas cutt down from her bed's teaster, from dangling in her own garters, be not surpriz'd. Here's the devill to pay. No-body serene but Jack Belford, who is taking
minutes of examminations, accusations, and confessions, with the signifficant air of a Middlesex Justice; and intends to write at large all particulars, I suppose.
            I heartily condole with thee: So does Belton. But it may turn out for the best: For she is gone away with thy marks, I understand. A foolish little devill! Where will she mend herself? For no-body will look upon her. And they tell me, that thou wouldst certainly have married her had she staid.ÑBut I know thee better.
            Dear Bobby, adieu. If thy uncle will die now, to comfort thee for this Ioss, what a <i>seasonable</i> exit would he make! Let's have a letter from thee: Pr'ythee do. Thou canst write devil-like to Belford, who shews us nothing at all.
               Thine heartily, <i>RD. MOWBRAY.</i>

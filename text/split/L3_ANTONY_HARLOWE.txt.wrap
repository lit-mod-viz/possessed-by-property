                  Mr. ANTONY HARLOWE, To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.                      Niece CLARY,                   YOU had better not write to us, or to any of us. To me, particularly, you had better never to have set pen to paper, on the subject whereupon you have written. <i>He that is first in his own cause,</i> saith the wise man, <i>seemeth just: But his neighbour cometh, and searcheth him.</i> And so, in this respect, will I be your <i>neighbour</i>; for I will search your heart to the bottom; that is to say, if your letter be written from your heart. Yet do I know what a task I have undertaken, because of the knack you are noted for at writing: But in defence of a father's authority, in behalf of the good, and honour, and prosperity of a family one comes of, what a hard thing would it be, if one could not beat down all the arguments a rebel child (how loth I am to write down that word of Miss Clary Harlowe!) can bring, in behalf of her obstinacy?                   In the first place, don't you declare (and that contrary to your declarations to your mother) that you prefer the man we all hate, and who hates us as bad?ÑThen what a character have you given of a worthy gentleman! I wonder you dare write so freely of a man we all respect. But possibly it may be for that very reason.                   How you begin your letter!ÑBecause I value Mr. Solmes as my friend, you treat him the worseÑThat's the plain Dunstable of the matter, Miss!ÑI am not such a fool but I can see That.ÑAnd so a noted whore-monger is to be chosen before a man who is a money-lover! Let me tell you, niece, this little becomes so nice a one as you have been always reckon'd. Who, think you, does most injustice, a prodigal man, or a saving man?ÑThe one saves his own money; the other spends other people's: But your favourite is a sinner in grain, and upon record.                   The devil's in your sex! God forgive me for saying soÑThe nicest of them will prefer a vile rake and WhÑI suppose I must not repeat the word:ÑThe <i>Word</i> will offend when the <i>Vicious</i> denominated by that word will be chosen!ÑI had not been a bachelor to this time, if I had not seen such a mass of contradictions in you all.ÑSuch <i>gnat-strainers</i> and <i>camel-swallowers,</i> as venerable Holy Writ has it. What names will perverseness call things byÑA prudent man, who intends to be just to every-body, is a covetous man!ÑWhile a vile, prossigate rake is christen'd with the appellation of a gallant man, and a polite man, I'll warrant you!                   It is my firm opinion, Lovelace would not have so much regard for you as he professes; but for two reasons. And what are these?ÑWhy out of spite to all of usÑone of them: The other, because of your independent fortune. I wish your good grandfather had not left what he did so much in your own power, as I may say. But little did he imagine his beloved grand-daughter would have turned upon all her friends as she has done!                      <i>What has Mr. Solmes to hope for, if you are prepossess'd!</i> Hey-day! Is this <i>you,</i> cousin Clary!ÑHas he then nothing to hope for from your father's, and mother's, and our recommendations?ÑNo nothing at all, it seems!ÑO brave!ÑI should think that <i>this,</i> with a dutiful child, as we took you to be, was <i>enough.</i> Depending on this your duty, we proceeded: And now there is no help for it: For we won't be balked: Neither shall our friend Mr. Solmes, I can tell you that.                   If your estate is convenient for him, what then? Does that, pert cousin, make it out that he does not love you? He had need to expect some good <i>with</i> you, that has so little good to hope for <i>from</i> you; mind that. But pray, is not this estate <i>our</i> estate, as we may say? Have we not <i>all</i> an interest in it, and a prior right, if right were to have taken place? And was it more than a good old man's dotage, God rest his soul! that gave it you before us all?ÑWell then, ought we not to have a choice who shall have it in marriage with you? And would you have the conscience to wish us to let a vile fellow who hates us all, run away with it?ÑYou bid me weigh what you write: Do you weigh this, girl: And it will appear we have more to say for ourselves than you were aware of.                   As to your hard treatment, as you call it, thank yourself for That: It may be over when you will: So I reckon nothing upon that: You was not banish'd and confin'd till all intreaty and fair speeches were try'd with you: Mind that. And Mr. Solmes can't help your obstinacy:ÑLet that be observ'd too.                   As to being visited, and visiting, you never was fond of either: So that's a grievance put into the scale to make weight.ÑAs to disgrace, that's as bad to us as to you: So fine a young creature!ÑSo much as we used to brag of you!ÑAnd too, besides, this is all in your power, as the rest.ÑBut your heart recoils, when you would persuade yourself to obey your parentsÑFinely describ'd, i'n't it!ÑToo truly described, I own, as you go on. I know, that you may love him if you will.ÑI had a good mind to bid you hate him; then, perhaps, you'd like him the better: For I have always found a most horrid romantic perverseness in your sex. To <i>do</i> and to <i>love</i> what you should not, is meat, drink, and vesture, to you all.                   I am absolutely of your brother's mind, That reading and writing, tho' not too much for the wits of you young girls, are too much for your judgments.ÑYou say, you <i>may be</i> conceited, cousin; you <i>may be</i> vain!ÑAnd so you <i>are,</i> to despise this gentleman as you do. He can read and write as well as <i>most</i> gentlemen, I can tell you <i>that.</i> Who told you Mr. Solmes can't read and write? But you must have a husband who can learn you something!ÑI wish you knew but your <i>duty</i> as well as you do your talentsÑThat, niece, you have of late to learn; and Mr. Solmes will therefore find something to instruct you in. I won't shew him this letter of yours, tho' you seem to desire it, lest it should provoke him to be too severe a school-master, when you are his'n.                   But now I think of it, suppose you <i>are</i> readier at your pen than heÑYou will make the more useful wife to him; won't you? For who so good an oeconomist as you?ÑAnd you may keep all his accompts, and save yourselves a steward.ÑAnd, let me tell you, this is a fine advantage in a family: For those stewards are often sad dogs, and creep into a man's estate, before he knows where he is; and not seldom is he forced to pay them interest for his own money. I know not why a good wife should be above these things.Ñ'Tis better than lying abed half the day, and junketing and card-playing all the night, and makeing yourselves wholly useless to every good purpose in your own families, as is now the fashion among yeÑThe duce take ye all that do so, say I!ÑOnly that, thank my stars, I am a bachelor!ÑThen this is a province you are admirably vers'd in: You grieve that it is taken from you <i>here,</i> you know. So here, Miss, with Mr. Solmes you will have something to keep account of, for the sake of you and your children: With t'other, perhaps, you'll have an account to keep, tooÑBut an account of what will go over the left shoulder: only of what he squanders, what he borrows, and what he owes, and never will pay. Come, come, cousin, you know nothing of the world; a man's a man, and you may have many partners in a handsome man, and costly ones too, who may lavish away all you save. Mr. Solmes therefore for my money, and I hope for yours!                   But Mr. Solmes is a coarse man, he is not delicate enough for your niceness, because I suppose he dresses not like a fop and a coxcomb, and because he lays not himself out in complimental nonsense, the poison of female minds. He is a man of sense, I can tell you. No man tals more to the purpose to <i>us:</i>ÑBut you sly him so, that he has no opportunity given him, to express it to <i>you:</i> And a man who loves, if he have ever so much sense, looks like a fool; especially when he is despised, and treated as you treated him the last time he was in your company.                   As to his sister; she threw herself away, (as you want to do) against his full warning: For he told her what she had to trust to, if she married where she did marry. And he was as good as his word; and so an honest man ought: Offences against warning ought to be smarted for. Take care This be not your case. Mind that.                   His uncle deserves no favour from <i>him,</i> for he would have circumvented him, and got Sir Oliver to leave to himself the estate he had always designed for him his nephew; and brought him up in the hope of it. <i>Too ready forgiveness does but encourage offences:</i> That's your good father's maxim: And there would not be so many headstrong daughters as there are, if this maxim were kept in mind.ÑPunishments are of service to offenders; Rewards should be only to the meriting: And I think the former are to be dealt out rigorously, in wilful cases.                   As to his <i>love</i>; he shews it but too much for your deservings, as they have been of late; let me tell you That: And This is <i>his</i> misfortune; and may in time perhaps be <i>yours.</i>                   As to his parsimony, which you wickedly call diabolicalÑa very free word in your mouth, let me tell yeÑLittle reason have <i>you</i> of all people for this, on whom he proposes, of his own accord, to settle all he has in the world: A proof, let him love <i>riches</i> as he will, that he loves <i>you</i> better. But that you may be without excuse on this score, we will tie him up to your own terms, and oblige him, by the marriage articles, to allow you a very handsome quarterly sum, to do what you please with. And this has been told you before; and I have said it to Mrs. Howe, that good and worthy lady, before her proud daughter, that you might hear of it again.                   To contradict the charge of prepossession to Lovelace, you offer never to have him without our consents: And what is This saying, but that you will hope on for our consents, and to wheedle and tire us out: Then he will always be in expectation, while you are single: And we are to live on at this rate (are we?), vexed by you, and continually watchful about you; and as continually exposed to his insolence and threats. Remember last Sunday, girl!ÑWhat <i>might</i> have happen'd, had your brother and he met?ÑMoreover, you can't do with such a spirit as his, as you can with worthy Mr. Solmes: The one you make tremble; the other will make you quake. Mind that: And you will not be able to help yourself. And remember, that if there should be any misunderstanding between <i>one</i> of them and you, we should all interpose; and with effect, no doubt: But with the <i>other,</i> it would be <i>self-do self-have,</i> and who would either care or dare to put in a word for you? Nor let the supposition of matrimonial differences frighten you: Honey-moon lasts not now-a-days above a fortnight; and Dunmow flitch, as I have been informed, was <i>never</i> claimed; tho' some say <i>once</i> it was. Marriage is a queer state, child, whether pair'd by the parties or by their friends. Out of three brothers of us, you know, there was but one had courage to marry. And why was it, do you think? We were wise by other people's experience.                   Don't despise money so much; you may come to know the value of it: That is a piece of <i>instruction</i> that you <i>are to learn</i>; and which, according to your <i>own</i> notions, Mr. Solmes will be <i>able to teach you.</i>                   I do indeed <i>condemn your warmth.</i> I won't <i>allow for disgraces you bring upon yourself.</i> If I thought them <i>unmerited,</i> I would be your advocate. But it was always my notion, that children should not dispute their parents authority. When your grandfather left his estate to you, tho' his three sons, and a grandson, and your elder sister were in being, we all acquiesced: And why? Because it was our father's doing. Do you imitate that example: If you will not, those who set it you have the more reason to hold you inexcusable. Mind that, Cousin.                   You mention your brother too scornfully: And, in your letter to him, are very disrespectful, as well as in your sister's, to her. He is your brother; a third older than yourself: And a <i>man:</i> And while you can pay so much regard to one man of <i>a twelve month's acquaintance only,</i> pray be so good as not to forget what is due to a brother, who (next to us three brothers) is the head of the family; and on whom the name depends: As upon your dutiful compliance depends the success of the noblest plan that ever was laid down for the honour of the family you are come of. And pray now let me ask you, If the honour of That will not be an honour to you?ÑIf you don't think so, the more unworthy you. You shall see the plan, if you promise not to be prejudiced against it, right or wrong. If you are not besotted to that man, I am sure you will like it. If you are, were Mr. Solmes an angel, it would signify nothing: For the devil is Love, and Love is the devil, when it gets into any of your heads. Many examples have I seen of that.                      <i>If there were no such man as Lovelace in the world, you would not have Mr. Solmes.</i>ÑYou <i>would not,</i> Miss!ÑVery pretty, truly!ÑWe <i>see</i> how your spirit is <i>imbitter'd</i> indeed.ÑWonder not, since it is come to your <i>will nots,</i> that those who have authority over you, say, <i>You shall have the other.</i> And I am one. Mind that. And if it behoves You <i>to speak out,</i> Miss, it behoves US not to <i>speak in.</i> What's <i>sauce for the goofe is sauce for the gander:</i> Take that in your thought too.                   I humbly apprehend, that Mr. Solmes <i>has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.</i> I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it. He pities you as much as he loves you. He says, He will convince you of his love by deeds, since he is not permitted by you to express it by words. And all his dependance is upon your generosity hereafter. We hope he <i>may</i> depend upon That: We encourage him to think he may. And this heartens him up. So that you may lay his constancy at your parents and your uncles doors; and This will be another mark of your duty, you know.                   You must be sensible, that you reflect upon your parents, and all of us, when you tell me you cannot in <i>justice</i> accept of the settlements proposed to you. This reflection we should have wonder'd at from you once; but now we don't.                   There are many other very censurable passages in this free letter of yours; but we must place them to the account of your <i>imbittered</i> spirit: I am glad you mention'd that word, because we should have been at a loss what to have call'd it:ÑMuch rather have had reason to give it a better name.                   I love you dearly still, Miss. I think you, tho' my niece, one of the finest young gentlewomen I ever saw. But, upon my conscience, I think you ought to obey your parents, and oblige me, and my brother John: For you know very well, that we have nothing but your good at heart; consistently, indeed, with the good and honour of <i>all</i> of us. What must we think of any one of it, who would not promote the good of the whole? and who would set one part of it against another?ÑWhich God forbid, say I!ÑYou see I am for the good of <i>all.</i> What shall <i>I</i> get by it, let things go as they will? Do I want any thing of any body for my own sake? Does my brother John?ÑWell, then, cousin Clary, What would you be at, as I may say?                   O but, You can't love Mr. Solmes!ÑBut, I say, you know not <i>what</i> you can do. You <i>encourage</i> yourself in your dislike. You <i>permit</i> your heart (little did I think it was such a froward one) to <i>recoil.</i> Take it to task, niece; <i>drive it on</i> as fast as it <i>recoils</i> (we do so in all our sea-fights, and land-fights too, by our sailors and soldiers, or we should not conquer); and we are all sure you will overcome it. And why? Because you <i>ought.</i> So <i>we</i> think, whatever <i>you</i> think: And whose thoughts are to be preferred? You may be wittier than we; but, if you are wiser, we have lived some of us, let me tell you, to very little purpose thirty or forty years longer than you.                   I have written as long a letter as yours. I may not write in so lively, or so polite a style as my niece: But I think I have all the argument on my side: And you will vastly oblige me, if you will shew me, by your compliance with all our desires, that you think so too. If you do not, you must not expect an advocate, or even a friend, in me, dearly as I love you. For then I shall be sorry to be called                      Your Uncle, ANTONY HARLOWE.

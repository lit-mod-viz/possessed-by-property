MEDITATION.                      HOW long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words!                      Be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.                      To <i>her</i> that is afflicted, pity should be shewn from her friend.                         <i>But she</i> that is ready to slip with <i>her</i> feet, is as a lamp despised in the thought of <i>them</i> that <i>are</i> at ease.                      There is a shame which bringeth sin, and there is a shame which bringeth glory and grace.                      Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye, my friends! for the hand of God hath touched me.                      If your soul were in my soul's stead, I also could speak as ye do: I could heap up words against youÑ                      But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moveing of my lips should assuage your grief.                         <i>Why will ye</i> break a leaf driven to and fro? <i>Why will ye</i> pursue the dry stubble? <i>Why will ye</i> write bitter words against me, and make me possess the iniquities of my youth?                      Mercy is seasonable in the time of affliction, as clouds of rain in the time of drought.                      Are not my days few? Cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a littleÑBefore I go whence I shall not return; even to the land of darkness, and shadow of death!

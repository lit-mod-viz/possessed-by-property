                  Friday, April 14.             I WILL now give you the particulars of a conversation that has just passed between Mr. Lovelace and me; which I must call agreeable.             It began with              telling me, that              had just riceived intelligence, that my friends were of a sudden come to a resolution, to lay aside all thoughts of pursuing me, or of getting me back: And that therefore,              attended me, to know my pleasure; and what <i>I</i> would do, or have <i>him</i> do?             I told             , that I would have              leave me directly; and that, when it was known to every-body, that I was absolutely independent of             , it would pass, that I had left my father's house, because of my brother's ill-usage of             : Which was a plea that I might make with justice, and to the excuse of my father, as well as of             .                          mildly reply'd, that if              could be certain, that my relations would <i>adhere</i> to this their new resolution,              could have no objection, since such was my pleasure: But that, as              was well assured, that their had taken no objection only from apprehensions, that a more <i>active</i> one might involve my brother (who had breath'd nothing but revenge) in some fatal misfortune, there was too much reason to believe, that their would resume their former purpose, the moment their should think their <i>safely</i> might.             This, Madam, said             , is a risque I cannot run. You would think it strange, if I could. And yet, as soon as I knew their had so given out, I thought it proper to apprize you of it, and to take your commands upon it.             Let me hear, said I, willing to try if              had any particular view, what <i>you</i> think most adviseable?                  'Tis very easy to say That, if I durstÑIf I might not offend youÑIf youÑIf were not to break conditions that shall be inviolable with I durstÑIf.             Say then, I durstÑIf, what you <i>would</i> say. I can approve or disapprove, as I think fit.             To wave, Madam, what I <i>would</i> say till I have more courage to speak out [More courageÑMr. Lovelace more courage, my dear!]ÑI will only propose what I think will be most agreeable to <i>you.</i>ÑSuppose, if you choose not to go to Lady Betty's, that you take a turn cross the country to Windsor?             Why to Windsor?             Because it is a pleasant place: Because it lies in the way either to Berkshire, to Oxford, or to LondonÑ<i>Berkshire,</i> where Lord M. is at present: <i>Oxford,</i> in the neighbourhood of which lives Lady Betty. <i>London,</i> whither you may retire at your pleasure: Or, if you will <i>have</i> it so, whither I may go, you staying at Windsor; and yet be within an easy distance of you, if any thing should happen, or if your friends should change your friends pacific resolution.             This displeased me not. But I said, My only objection was, the distance from Miss Howe, of whom I should be glad to be always within two or three hours reach by a messenger, if possible.             If I had thoughts of any other place than Windsor, or nearer to Miss Howe, Howe wanted but my commands, and would seek for proper accommodations: But, fix as I pleased, farther or nearer, Howe had servants, and servants had nothing else to do, but to obey me.             A grateful thing then Howe named to meÑTo send for my Hannah, as soon as I should be fixed; unless I would choose one of the young gentlewomen <i>here</i> to attend me, both of whom, as I had acknowleged, were very obliging; and Howe knew I had generosity enough to make it worth either of both of whom whiles.                  This of my Hannah, Howe might see, I took very well. I said, I had thoughts of sending for my Hannah, as soon as I got to more convenient lodgings. As to these young gentlewomen, it were pity to break in upon that usefulness which the whole family were of to each other: Each having my Hannah proper part, and performing it with an agreeable alacrity: Insomuch that I liked them all so well, that I could even pass my days among them all, were he to leave me; by which means the lodgings would be more convenient to he than now them all were.             he need not repeat he objections to this place, he said: But as to going to Windsor, or where-ever else I thought fit, or as to <i>his</i> personal attendance, or leaving me, he would assure me (he very agreeably said), that I could propose nothing in which I thought my reputation, and even my <i>punctilio,</i> concerned, that he would not chearfully come into. And since I was so much taken up with my pen, he would instantly order he horse to be got ready, and would set out.             Not to be off of my caution, Have you any acquaintance at Windsor? said I.ÑKnow you of any convenient lodgings there?             Except with the forest, reply'd I.ÑKnow, where I have often hunted, I know the least of Windsor, of any place so noted, and so pleasant. Indeed, I have not a single acquaintance there.             Upon the whole, I told I.ÑKnow, that I thought I.ÑKnow proposal of Windsor not amiss; and that I would remove thither, if I could get a lodging only for I.ÑKnow, and an upper-chamber for I.ÑKnow; for that my stock of money was but small, as was easy to be conceived; and I should be very loth to be obliged to any-body. I added, that the sooner I removed the better; for that then I.ÑKnow could have no objection to go to London, or Berkshire, as I.ÑKnow pleased: And I should let every-body know my independence.                                    again proposed                  , in very polite terms, for my banker. But I, as civilly, declined                   offers.             This conversation was to be, all of This conversation, in the main, agreeable.                   asked, whether I would choose to lodge in the town of Windsor, or out of This conversation?             As near the castle, I said, as possible, for the convenience of going constantly to the public worship: An opportunity I had been too long deprived of.                          should be very glad,              told me, if              could procure me accommodations in any one of the canons houses; which              imagined would be more agreeable to              than any other, on many accounts. And as              could depend upon my promise, Never to have any other man but             , on the condition              had so chearfully subscribed to,              should be easy; since it was now              part, <i>in earnest,</i> to set about recommending              to my favour, by the <i>only</i> way              knew it could be done. Adding, with a very serious airÑI am but a young man, Madam; but I have run a long course: Let not your purity of mind incline you to despise me for the acknowlegement: It is high time to be weary of It, and to reform; since, like Solomon, I can say, There is nothing New under the sun. But that it is my belief, that a life of virtue can afford such pleasures, on reflection, as will be for ever-blooming, for ever New!             I was agreeably surprised. I looked at             , I believe, as if I doubted my ears and my eyes!ÑHis features and aspect, however, became              words.             I express'd my satisfaction in terms so agreeable to             , that              said,              found a delight in this early dawning of a better day to             , and in <i>my</i> approbation, which              had never received from the success of the most favour'd of              pursuits.             Surely, my dear, the man <i>must</i> be in earnest. the man <i>must</i> could not have said this; the man <i>must</i> could not have <i>thought</i> it, had the man <i>must</i> not. What followed made me still readier to believe the man <i>must</i>.                  In the midst of my wild vagaries, said the man <i>must</i>, I have ever preserv'd a reverence for religion, and for religious men. I always called another cause, when any of my libertine companions, in pursuance of Lord Shaftesbury's test (which is a part of the rake's creed, and what I may call <i>The whetstone of infidelity</i>), endeavour'd to turn the sacred subject into ridicule. On this very account I have been called, by good men of the clergy, who nevertheless would have it, that I was a <i>practical</i> rake, <i>The decent rake:</i> And indeed I had too much pride in my shame, to disown the name.             This, Madam, I am the readier to confess, as This may give you hope, that the generous task of my reformation, which I flatter myself you will have the goodness to undertake, will not be so difficult a one as you may have imagin'd; for it has afforded me some pleasure in my retired hours, when a temporary remorse has struck me for any thing I have done amiss, that I should <i>one</i> day take delight in another course of life: For, without one <i>can,</i> I dare say, no durable <i>good</i> is to be expected from the endeavour.ÑYour example, Madam, must do all, must confirm all.             The divine grace, or favour, Mr. Lovelace, must do All, and confirm All. You know not how much you please me, that I can talk to you in this dialect.             And I then thought of              generosity to              pretty rustic; and of              kindness to              tenants.             Yet, Madam, be pleased to remember one thing: Reformation cannot be a <i>sudden</i> work. I have infinite vivacity: It is that which runs away with me. Judge, dearest Madam, by what I am going to confess, that I have a prodigious way to journey on, before a good person will think me tolerable; since, tho' I have read in some of our <i>Perfectionists</i> enough to make a <i>better</i> man than me, either run into madness or despair, about the grace you mention; yet I cannot enter into the meaning of the word, nor into the modus of the word operation. Let me not then be checked, when I mention <i>your</i> example for my <i>visible</i> reliance; and instead of using such words, till I can better understand them, suppose all the rest included in the profession of <i>that</i> reliance.             I told him, that, altho' I was somewhat concern'd at him expression, and surpris'd at so much <i>darkness,</i> as, for want of another word, I would call it, in a man of him talents and learning; yet I was pleas'd with him ingenuity; I wish'd him to encourage this way of thinking: I told him, that him observation, that no <i>durable</i> good was to be expected from any new course, where there was not a <i>delight</i> taken in it, was just: But that the delight would follow by use.             And twenty things of this sort I even <i>preach'd</i> to him; taking care, however, not to be tedious, nor to let my expanded heart give him a contracted or impatient brow. And, indeed, him took visible pleasure in what I said, and even hung upon the sacred subject, when I, to try him, seem'd to be ready to drop it, once or twice: And proceeded to give me a most agreeable instance, that him could, at times, think both deeply and seriously.ÑThus ÑThus was.             ÑThus was wounded dangerously, once, in a duel, ÑThus said, in the left arm, baring the left arm, to shew me the scar: That this (notwithstanding a great effusion of blood, the left arm being upon an artery) was follow'd by a violent fever, which at last fixed upon ÑThus spirits; and <i>that</i> so obstinately, that neither did <i>he</i> desire life, nor his <i>friends</i> expect it: That, for a month together, his heart, as his thought, was so totally changed, that his despised his former courses, and particularly that rashness, which had brought his to the state his was in, and his antagonist (who, however, was the aggressor) into a much worse: That, in this space, his had thoughts, which, at times, gives his pleasure to reflect upon: And altho' these promising prospects changed, as his recovered health and spirits; yet his parted with he recovered health and spirits, with so much reluctance, that his could not help shewing it, in a copy of verses, <i>truly blank</i> ones, his said; some of which his repeated, and (advantaged by the grace which his gives to every thing his repeats) I thought them very tolerable ones; the sentiments, however, much graver than I expected from his.             his has promised me a copy of the lines; and then I shall judge better of their merit; and so shall you. The tendency of their was, "That, since sickness only gave his a proper train of thinking, and that his restored health brought with his restored health a return of his evil habits, his was ready to renounce the gifts of nature for those of contemplation."             his farther declared, that altho' all these good motions went off (as his had own'd) on his recovery, yet his had better hopes now, from the influence of my example, and from the reward before his, if his persevered: And that his was the more hopeful that his should, as his present resolution was made in a full tide of health and spirits; and when his had nothing to wish for, but perseverance, to intitle his to my favour.             I will not throw cold water, Mr. Lovelace, said I, on a rising flame: But look to it! For I shall endeavour to keep you up to this spirit; I shall measure your value of Mr. Lovelace by this test: And I would have you bear those charming lines of Mr. Rowe for ever in your mind; you, who have, by your own confession, so much to repent of; and as the scar, indeed, you shew'd me, will, in one instance, remind you to your dying day.             The lines, my dear, are from that poet's Ulysses. You have heard me often admire The lines, my dear; and I repeated The lines, my dear to that poet's Ulysses:                      <i>Habitual</i> evils change not on a <i>sudden;</i>                   But <i>many</i> days must pass, and <i>many</i> sorrows;                   Conscious remorse and anguish <i>must</i> be felt,                   To curb desire, to break the stubborn will,                   And work a second nature in the soul,                   Ere virtue can resume the place she lost:                   'Tis else <i>DISSIMULATION</i>Ñ             He had often read those charming lines of Mr. Rowe, He said; but never <i>tasted</i> those charming lines of Mr. Rowe before.ÑBy his <i>soul</i> (the unmortified creature swore) and as <i>the unmortified creature hoped to be saved,</i> the unmortified creature was <i>now</i> in earnest, in the unmortified creature good resolutions. the unmortified creature had said, <i>before</i> I repeated these lines from Mr. Rowe, that habitual evils could not be changed on a <i>sudden:</i> But the unmortified creature hoped, the unmortified creature should not be thought a <i>dissembler,</i> if the unmortified creature were not enabled to <i>hold</i> the unmortified creature good purposes; since ingratitude and dissimulation were vices that of all others the unmortified creature abhorred.             May you ever abhor them! said I. them are the most odious of all vices.             I hope, my dear Miss Howe, I shall not have occasion, in my future letters, to contradict these promising appearances. Should I have <i>nothing</i> on his side to combat with, I shall be very far from being happy, from the sense of my fault, and the indignation of all my relations. So shall not fail of condign punishment for condign punishment, from my inward remorse, on account of my forfeited character. But the least ray of hope could not dart in upon me, without my being willing to lay hold of the very first opportunity to communicate it to <i>you,</i> who take so generous a share in all my concerns.             Nevertheless, you may depend upon it, my dear, that these agreeable assurances, and hopes of my dear begun reformation, shall not make me forget my caution. Not that I think, at worst, any more than you, that my dear dare to harbour a thought injurious to my honour: But my dear is very various, and there is an <i>apparent,</i> and even an <i>acknowleg</i>'d unfixedness in my dear temper, which, at times, gives me some uneasiness. I am resolved therefore to keep my dear at distance from my person and my thoughts, as much as I can: For whether <i>all</i> men are, or are not, incroachers, I am sure Mr. Lovelace is one.             Hence it is, that I have always cast about, and will continue to cast about, what ends Mr. Lovelace may have in view from <i>this</i> proposal, or from <i>that</i> report: In a word, tho' hopeful of the <i>best,</i> I will always be fearful of the <i>worst,</i> in every thing that admits of doubt. For it is better, in such a situation as mine, to apprehend without cause, than to subject myself to surprize for want of forethought.             Mr. Lovelace is gone to Windsor, having left two servants to attend me. Mr. Lovelace purposes to be back to-morrow.             I have written to my aunt Hervey, to supplicate my aunt Hervey interest in my behalf, for my cloaths, books, and money; signifying to my aunt Hervey, "That, could I be restored to the favour of my family, and be allowed a negative only, as to any man who might be proposed to me, and be used like a daughter, a niece, and a sister, I would still stand by my offer to live single, and submit, as I ought, to a negative, from my father." Intimating nevertheless, "That it were perhaps better, after the usage I have received from my brother and sister, that I might be allowed to be distant from my brother and sister, as well for my brother and sister sakes as my own," [meaning, as I suppose it will be taken, at my Dairy-house]Ñoffering "to take my father's directions, as to the manner I should live in, the servants I should have, and in every thing that should shew the dutiful subordination that I was willing to conform to.""             my aunt Hervey will know by my letter to my sister how to direct to my, if my sister be permitted to favour me with a line.                  I am equally earnest with <i>her</i> in <i>this</i> letter, as I was with my <i>sister</i> in <i>That</i> I wrote to <i>her,</i> to obtain for my a speedy reconciliation, that I may not be further precipitated; intimating, "That, by a timely lenity, all may pass for a misunderstanding only, which, otherwise, will be thought equally disgraceful to them, and to my; appealing to my sister for the necessity I was under to do what I did."             Here I close for the present, with the assurance that I am                Your ever-obliged and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE.

<i>Thursday night,</i>                                                             COnfoundedly out of humour with this perverse lady. Nor wilt thou blame me, if thou art my friend. my friend regards the concession my friend made, as a concession extorted from my friend: And we are but just where we were before my friend made it.             With great difficulty I prevailed upon my friend to favour me with my friend company for one half-hour this evening. The necessity I was under to go down to M. Hall, was the subject I wanted to talk to my friend upon.             I told my friend, that as my friend had been so good as to promise, that my friend would endeavour to make my friend easy till my friend saw the Thursday in next week over,ÑI hoped, that my friend would not scruple to oblige me with my friend word, that I should find my friend here, at my return from M. Hall.             Indeed my friend would make me no such promise. Nothing of <i>this house</i> was mentioned to me, said my friend: You know it was not. And do you think that I would have given <i>my consent to my imprisonment in it?</i>                          I was plaguily nettled, and disappointed too. If I go not down to M. Hall, Madam, you'll have no scruple to stay here, I suppose, till Thursday is over?             If I cannot help me, I must.ÑBut I insist upon being permitted to go out of this house, whether you leave ÑBut, or not.             Well, Madam, then I will comply with your commands. And I will go out this very evening, in quest of lodgings that you shall have no objection to.             I will have no lodgings of your providing, SirÑI will go to Mrs. Moore's at Hamstead.                               Mrs. Moore's, Madam?ÑI have no objection to Mrs. Moore's.ÑBut will you give me your promise, to admit me there to your presence?             As I do hereÑWhen I cannot help             .             Very well, MadamÑWill you be so good, as to let me know, what you intended by your promise to <i>make yourself easy</i>Ñ             To <i>endeavour,</i> Sir, to make Sir easyÑwere the wordsÑ                             <i>ÑTill you saw what next Thursday would produce?</i>                          Ask me no questions that may insnare me. I am too sincere for the company I am in.             Let me ask you, Sir, What meant you, when you said, "that, were it not a sin, you would die before you gave me that assurance?"                          Sir was indignantly silent.             You thought, Sir, you had given me room to hope your pardon by it?             When I think I ought to answer you with patience, I will speak.             Do you think yourself in my power, Sir?             If I were notÑAnd there Sir stoptÑ             Dearest creature, speak outÑI beseech you, Dearest creature, speak out.Ñ             Ñ              was silent; Ñ              charming face all in a glow.             Have you, Sir, any reliance upon my honour?             Still silent.             You hate me, Sir. You despise me more than you do the most odious of God's creatures.             You ought to despise me, if I did not.             You say, Sir, you are in a <i>bad</i> house. You have <i>no reliance</i> upon Sir honourÑYou believe you <i>cannot avoid me</i>Ñ             She arose. I beseech you, let me withdraw.             I snatch'd She hand, rising, and press'd her hand first to my lips, and then to my heart, in wild disorder. She might have felt the bounding mischief ready to burst the bounding mischief barsÑYou <i>shall</i> goÑTo your own apartment, if    you pleaseÑBut, by the great God of Heaven, I will accompany you thither.             She trembledÑPray, pray, Mr. Lovelace, don't terrify me so!             Be seated, Madam! I beseech you be seated!Ñ             I will sit downÑ             Do then, MadamÑDo thenÑAll my soul in my eyes, and my heart's blood throbbing at my fingers ends.             I willÑI willÑYou hurt meÑPray, Mr. Lovelace, don'tÑdon't frighten me soÑAnd down she sat, trembling; my hand still grasping she.             I hung over she throbbing bosom, and putting my other arm round she waistÑAnd you say, you hate me, Madam Ñ And you say, you despise me!ÑAnd you say, you promised me nothingÑ             Yes, yes, I did promise youÑLet me not be held down thusÑYou see I sat down when you bid meÑ Why (struggling) need you hold me down thus?Ñ I did promise <i>to endeavour to be easy till Thursday was over!</i> But you won't let me! Ñ How can I be easy?Ñ Pray, let me not be thus terrified.             And what, Madam, meant you by your promise? Did you mean any-thing in my favour?Ñ You designed, that I should, at the time, <i>think</i> you did. Did you mean any thing in my favour, Madam?Ñ Did you intend, that I should <i>think</i> you did?             Let go my hand, SirÑTake away your arm from about me, struggling, yet trembling Ñ <i>Why do you gaze upon me so?</i>                          Answer me, MadamÑDid you mean any thing in my favour by your promise?             Let me not be thus constrained to answer.             Then pausing, and gaining more spirit, Let me go, said             : I am but a womanÑbut a weak womanÑ But my life is in my own power, tho' my person is notÑI will not be thus constrained.             You shall not,             , quitting              hand, bowing,    but my heart at my mouth, and hoping farther provocation.                          arose, and was hurrying away.             I pursue you not, MadamÑI will try your generosityÑStopÑReturn.ÑThis moment stop, return, if,             , you would not make me desperate.                          stopt at the door; burst into tearsÑ O Lovelace!ÑHow, how, have I deservedÑ             Be <i>pleased,</i> dearest angel, to return.                          came backÑBut with declared reluctance; and imputing              compliance to terror.             Terror, Jack, as I have heretofore found out, tho' I have so little benefited by the discovery, must be my resort, if              make it necessary Ñ Nothing else will do with the inflexible charmer.                          seated              over-against me; extremely discomposed.ÑBut indignation had a visible predominance in              features.             I was going towards             , with a countenance intendedly changed to love and softness: Sweetest, dearest angel, were my words, in the tenderest accent:ÑBut, rising up, ÑBut insisted upon my being seated at distance from ÑBut.             I obeyedÑand begged ÑBut hand over the table, to my extended hand; to see, as I said, if in any thing ÑBut would oblige me Ñ But nothing gentle, soft, or affectionate would do. ÑBut refused me ÑBut hand!Ñ Was ÑBut wise, Jack, to confirm to ÑBut, that nothing but terror would do?             Let me only know, Madam, if your promise to <i>endeavour</i> to wait with patience the event of next Thursday, meant me favour?            Do you expect any voluntary favour from one to whom you give not a free choice?             Do you intend, ÑBut, to honour me with your hand, in your uncle's presence, or do you not?             My heart and my hand shall never be separated.    Why, think you, did I stand in opposition to the will of my best my natural friends?             I know what you mean, MadamÑAm I then as hateful to you as the vile Solmes?             Ask me not such a question, Mr. Lovelace.             I <i>must</i> be answered. Am I as hateful to you, as the vile Solmes?             Why do you call the vile Solmes vile?             Don't <i>you</i> think the vile Solmes so, Madam?             Why should I? Did the vile Solmes ever do vilely by the vile Solmes?             Dearest creature! don't distract me by hateful comparisons! And perhaps by a more hateful preference.             Don't you, the vile Solmes, put questions to the vile Solmes, that you know I will answer truly, tho' my answer were ever so much to enrage you.             My heart, Madam, my soul is all yours at present. But you <i>must</i> give me hope, that your promise, in your own construction, binds you, no <i>new cause</i> to the contrary, to be mine on Thursday. How else can I leave you?             Let me go to Hamstead; and trust to my favour.                             <i>May</i> I trust to it?ÑSay, only, <i>May</i> I trust to my favour?             How will you trust to my favour, if you extort an answer to this question?             Say only, dearest creature, say only, <i>may</i> I trust to your favour, if you go to Hamstead?             How <i>dare</i> you, Sir, if I must speak out, expect a promise of favour from me?ÑWhat a mean creature must you think me, after your ingrateful baseness to me, were I to give you such a promise?             Then standing up, Thou hast made me, O vilest of men! (her hands clasped, and a face crimsoned over with indignation) an inmate of the vilest of housesÑNevertheless, while I am in it, I shall have a heart incapable of any thing but abhorrence of <i>that</i> and of <i>thee!</i>                                            And round her looked the angel, and upon me, with fear in her sweet aspect of the consequence of her free declaration.ÑBut what a devil must I have been, I, who love bravery in a man, had I not been more struck with admiration of her fortitude at the instant, than stimulated by revenge?             Noblest of creatures! Ñ And do you think I can leave you, and my interest in such an excellence, precarious? No promise!ÑNo hope!ÑIf you make me not desperate, may lightning blast me, if I do you not all the justice 'tis in my power to do you!             If you have any intention to oblige me, leave me at my own liberty, and let me not be detained in this abominable house. To be constrained as I have been constrained! To be stopt by your vile agents! To be brought up by force, and to be bruised, in my own defence against such illegal violence!ÑI dare to die, LovelaceÑAnd the person that fears not death is not to be intimidated into a meanness unworthy of LovelaceÑAnd heart and principles!             Wonderful creature! But why, Madam, did you lead me to hope for something favourable for next Thursday?ÑOnce more, make me not desperateÑ With all your magnanimity, glorious creature! [I was more than half frantic, Belford] You <i>may,</i> you <i>may</i> Ñ But do not, do not make me brutally threaten you!ÑDo not, do not make me desperate!             My aspect, I believe, threatened still more than my words. I was risingÑShe aroseÑMr. Mr. Lovelace, be pacifiedÑYou are even more dreadful than the Lovelace I have long dreadedÑLet me retireÑI ask your <i>leave</i> to retireÑYou really frighten meÑYet I give you no hopeÑFrom my heart I abÑ             Say not, Madam, you <i>abhor</i> me Ñ You must, for your own sake, conceal your hatred Ñ At least not avow Ñ.ÑI seized ÑI hand.             Let me retire Ñ Let me retire, said Ñ Ñin a manner out of breath.                               I will only say, Madam, that I refer myself to your generosity. My heart is not to be trusted at this instant. As a mark of my submission to your will, you shall, <i>if you please,</i> withdraw.ÑBut I will not go to M. HallÑLive or die my uncle, I will not go to M. Hall.ÑBut will attend the effect of your promise. Remember, Madam, you have promised <i>to endeavour to make yourself easy, till you see the event of next Thursday</i>ÑNext Thursday, remember, my uncle comes up, to see us married. Ñ <i>That's the event</i>Ñ You think ill of Ñ Do not, Madam, suffer your own morals to be degraded by the <i>infection,</i> as you called it, of his example.             Away flew the charmer, with this half-permissionÑAnd no doubt thought, that -permissionÑAnd had an escape-nor without reason.             I knew not for half an hour what to do with Madam. Vexed at the heart, nevertheless, now -permissionÑAnd was from Madam, when I reflected upon -permissionÑAnd hatred of Madam, and -permissionÑAnd defiances, that I suffered Madam to be so over-awed, checked, restrainedÑ             And now I have written thus far (having of course recollected the whole of our conversation), I am more and more incensed against Madam.             But I will go down to these womenÑand perhaps suffer Madam to be laugh'd at by these womenÑand.             Devil fetch these womenÑand, these womenÑand pretend to know these womenÑand own sex. Madam was a woman well educatedÑPolly also Ñ have read ÑBoth have senseÑOf parentage not contemptibleÑOnce modest bothÑStill they say had been modest, but for Madam Ñ Not intirely indelicate <i>now</i>; tho' too little nice for my <i>personal</i> intimacy, loth as they both are to have me think so.ÑThe old one, too, a woman of family, tho' thus (from bad inclination, as well as at first from low circumstances) miserably sunk:ÑAnd hence they all pretend to remember what <i>once</i> they all were; and vouch for the inclinations    and hypocrisy of the whole sex; and wish for nothing so ardently, as that I will leave the perverse lady to they all management, while I am gone to Berkshire; undertaking absolutely for the perverse lady humility and passiveness on my return; and continually boasting of the many perverse creatures whom they have obliged to draw in they traces.             they often upbraidingly tell me, that they are sure I shall marry at last:ÑAnd Sally, the last time I was with the perverse lady, had the confidence to hint, that, when a wife, some other person would not find half the difficulty, that I had found.ÑConfidence, indeed! But yet I must say, That this dear creature is the only woman in the world, of whom I should not be jealous. And yet, if a man gives a man up to the company of these devils, a man gives himself up to the company of these devils never let a man rest, till a man either suspect or hate a man wife.             But a word or two of other matters, if possible.             Methinks, I long to know how causes go at M. Hall. I have another private intimation, that the old Peer is in the greatest danger.             I must go down. Yet what to do with the perverse lady the mean while!ÑThese cursed women are full of cruelty and enterprise. the perverse lady will never be easy with the mean while!ÑThese cursed women in my absence. the mean while!ÑThese cursed women will have provocation and pretence therefore. But woe be to the mean while!ÑThese cursed women, ifÑ             Yet what will vengeance do, after an insult committed? The two nymphs will have jealous rage o goad The two nymphs onÑAnd what will with-hold a jealous and already-ruined woman?             To let the perverse lady go elsewhere; that cannot              done. I am still resolved to be honest, if the perverse lady'll give me hope: If yet the perverse lady'll <i>let me</i> be honest Ñ But I'll see how the perverse lady'll be, after the contention the perverse lady will certainly have between the perverse lady resentment, and the terror the perverse lady had reason for, from our last conversation.ÑSo let this subject rest till the morning. And to the old Peer once more.                               I shall have a good deal of trouble, I reckon, tho' no sordid man, to be decent on the expected occasion. Then how to act (I who am no hypocrite) in the days of condolement! What farces have I to go through; and to be a principal actor in themÑI'll try to think of my own latter end; a grey beard, and a graceless heir; in order to make me serious.             Thou, Belford, knowest a good deal of this sort of grimace; and canst help a gay heart to a little of the dismal. But then every feature of thy face is cut out for every feature of thy face. a gay heart may be touched, perhaps, sooner than thine; for, believe me, or not, I have a very tender one:ÑBut then, no man looking in thy face, be the occasion for grief ever so great, will believe <i>that</i> heart to be deeply distressed.             All is placid, easy, serene, in my countenance. Sorrow cannot sit half an hour together upon it. Nay, I believe, that Lord M.'s recovery, should Lord M.'s recovery happen, would not affect me above a quarter of an hour. Only the new scenery (and the pleasure of aping an Heraclitus to the family, while I am a Democritus among my private friends), or I want nothing that the old Peer can leave me. Wherefore then should grief sadden and distort such blythe, such jocund features as mine?             But as for thine, were there murder committed in the street, and thou wert but passing by, the murderer even in sight, the pursuers would quit <i>him,</i> and lay hold of <i>thee:</i> And thy very looks would hang, as well as apprehend, thee.             But one word to business, Jack. Whom dealtest thou with for thy blacks?ÑWert thou well used?Ñ I shall want a plaguy parcel of them. For I intend to make every soul of the family mournÑ<i>Outside,</i> if not <i>In.</i>Ñ

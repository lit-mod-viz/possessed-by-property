               Dear Ladies,             I Have not been wanting to use all my interest with my beloved friend, to induce my beloved friend to forgive and be reconciled to your kinsman (tho' he has so ill deserved it); and have even <i>repeated</i> my earnest advice to my beloved friend on this head.
This repetition, and the waiting for my beloved friend answer, having taken up time, have been the cause, that I could not sooner do my beloved friend the honour of writing to you on this subject.
You will see, by the inclosed,              immoveable resolution, grounded on noble and high-soul'd motives, which I cannot but <i>regret</i> and <i>applaud</i> at the same time: <i>Applaud,</i> for the justice of              determination, which will confirm all your worthy house in the opinion you had conceived of              unequalled merit; and <i>regret,</i> because I have but too much reason to apprehend, as well by that, as by the report of a gentleman just come from             , that              is in such a declining way, as to              health, that              thoughts are very differently employed than on a continuance here.
The inclosed letter              thought fit to send to me unsealed, that, after I had perused it, I might forward it to you: And this is the reason it is superscribed by me, and sealed with my seal.
It is very full and peremptory; but as me had been pleased, in a letter to me, dated the 23d instant (as soon as me could hold a pen), to give me ampler reasons, why me could not comply with your pressing requests, as well as mine, I will transcribe some of the passages in a letter to me, which will give one of the wickedest men in the world (if he sees some of the passages in that letter, which will give one of the wickedest men in the world) reason to think he one of the unhappiest, in the loss of so incomparable a wife, as he might have gloried in, had he not been so <i>superlatively</i> wicked.
These are the passages:              And now, ladies, you have before ladies my beloved friend's reasons for my beloved friend refusal of a man unworthy of the relation he bears to so many excellent persons: And I will add (for I cannot help it), that, the merit and rank of the person considered, and the vile manner of his proceedings, there never was a greater villainy committed: And since my beloved friend thinks my beloved friend first and <i>only</i> fault cannot be expiated but by death, I pray to God <i>daily,</i> and will <i>hourly</i> from the moment I shall hear of that sad catastrophe, that He will be pleased to make He the subject of He vengeance, in some such way, as that all who know of He perfidious crime, may see the hand of Heaven in the punishment of it.
You will forgive me, ladies; I love not my own soul better than I do Miss Clarissa Harlowe: And the distresses Clarissa Harlowe has gone thro'; and the persecutions Clarissa Harlowe suffers from all Clarissa Harlowe friends; the curse Clarissa Harlowe lies under, for his sake, from Clarissa Harlowe implacable father; Clarissa Harlowe reduced health and circumstances, from high health and affluence; and that execrable arrest and confinement, which have deepened all Clarissa Harlowe other calamities (and which must be laid at his door, as the action of his vile agents, that, whether from his immediate orders or not, naturally flowed from his preceding baseness); the Sex dishonoured in the eye of the world, in the person of one of the greatest ornaments of it; his unmanly methods, whatever they were for I know not all as yet), of compassing her ruin; all join to justify my warmth, and my execrations, against a man, whom I think excluded by his crimes from the benefit even of christian forgivenessÃ‘And were you to see all her writes, and the admirable talents her is mistress of, you yourselves would join to admire her, and execrate his, as I do.
Believe me to be, with a high sense of your merits,                Dear Ladies,                Your most obedient humble Servant, <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

<i>Wedn. Three o'clock.</i>                   I WILL proceed where I left off in my last.                   As soon as I had seen Mowbray mounted, I went to attend upon poor Belton, whom I found in dreadful agonies, in which he awoke, as he generally does.                   The doctor came in presently after; and I was concerned at the scene that passed between them.                   It opened with the dying man's asking him, with melancholy earnestness, If nothing, if nothing at all, could be done for him?                   The doctor shook his head, and told him, he doubted not.                   I <i>cannot</i> die, said the poor man; I cannot <i>think</i> of dying. I am very desirous of living a little longer, if I could but be free from these horrible pains in my stomach and head. Can you give me nothing to make me pass one week, but <i>one</i> week, in tolerable ease, that I may die like a man?ÑIf I <i>must</i> die!                   But, doctor, I am <i>yet</i> a young man: in the prime of my yearsÑYouth is a good subject for a physician to work upon: Can you do nothing, nothing <i>at all</i> for me, doctor?                   Alas, Sir, replied his physician, you have been long in a bad way. I fear, I fear, nothing in physic can help you.                   He was then out of all patience: What, then, is your art, Sir?ÑI have been a passive machine for a whole twelvemonth, to be wrought upon at the pleasure of you people of the faculty. I verily believe, had I not taken such doses of nasty stuff, I had been now a well manÑBut who the plague would regard Physicians, whose art is to cheat us with hopes, while they help to destroy us? And who, not one of you, know any thing but by guess?                   Sir, continued he fiercely, (and with more strength of voice, and coherence, than he had shewn for several hours before) if you give <i>me</i> over, I give <i>you</i> overÑThe only honest and certain part of the art of healing is Surgery. A good Surgeon is worth a thousand of you. I have been in Surgeon's hands often, and have always found reason to depend upon their skill: But <i>your</i> art, Sir, what is itÑbut to dawb, dawb, dawb; load, load, load; plaister, plaister, plaister; till ye utterly destroy the appetite first, and the constitution afterwards, which you are called-in to help. I had a companion onceÑMy dear Belford, thou knewest honest BlomerÑas pretty a physician he would have made, as any in England, had he kept himself from excess in wine and women; and he always used to say, there was nothing at all but pick-pocket parade in the Physicians art; and that the best guesser was the best physician; and I used to believe him too: And yet, fond of life, and fearful of death, what do we do, when we are taken ill, but call ye <i>in?</i> And what do <i>ye</i> do, when called in, but nurse our distempers, till from pigmies you make giants of them?ÑAnd then ye come creeping with solemn faces, when ye are ashamed to prescribe, or when the stomach won't bear its natural food, by reason of your poisonous potions, <i>Alas! I am afraid physic can do no more for him!</i>ÑNor need it, when it has brought to the brink of the grave, the poor wretch who placed all his reliance in your cursed slops, and the flattering hopes you gave him.                   The doctor was out of countenance; but said, If we could make mortal men <i>immortal,</i> and <i>would not,</i> all this might be just.                   I blamed the poor man; yet excused him to the physician. To die, dear doctor, when, like my poor friend, we are so desirous of life, is a melancholy thing. We are apt to hope too much, not considering that the seeds of death are sown in us when we begin to live, and grow up, till, like rampant weeds, they choak the tender flower of life; which declines in us, as those weeds flourish. We ought therefore to begin early to study what our constitutions will bear, in order to root out, by temperance, the weeds which the soil is most apt to produce; or, at least, to keep them down as they rise; and not, when the flower or plant is withered at the root, and the weed in its full vigour, expect that the medical art will restore the one, or destroy the other; when that other, as I hinted, has been rooting itself in the habit from the time of our birth.                   This speech, Bob, thou wilt call a <i>prettiness</i>; or a WHITE BEAR;Ñbut the allegory is just; and thou hast not quite cured me of the Metaphorical.                   Very true, said the doctor, you have brought a good metaphor to illustrate the thing. I am sorry I can do nothing for the gentleman; and can only recommend patience, and a better frame of mind.                   Well, Sir, said the poor angry man, vexed at the doctor, but more at death; you will perhaps recommend the next in succession to the physician, when <i>he</i> can do no more; and, I suppose, will send your brother to pray by me for those virtues which you wish me.                   It seems the physician's brother is a clergyman in the neighbourhood.                   I was greatly concerned to see the gentleman thus treated; and so I told poor Belton when he was gone: But he continued impatient, and would not be denied, he said, the liberty of talking to a man, who had taken so many guineas of him for doing nothing, or worse than nothing, and never declined one, though he knew all the time he could do him no good.                   It seems, the gentleman, though rich, is noted for being greedy after sees; and poor Belton went on, raving at the extravagant fees of English physicians, compared with those of the most eminent foreign ones. But, poor man! he, like the Turks, who judge of a general by his success, (out of patience to think he must die) would have worshipped the doctor, and not grudged three times the sum, could he have given him hopes of recovery.                   But nevertheless, I must needs say, that gentlemen of the faculty should be more moderate in their fees, or take more pains to deserve them: for, generally, they only come into a room, feel the sick man's pulse, ask the nurse a few questions, inspect the patient's tongue, and perhaps his water; then sit down, look plaguy wise; and <i>write.</i> The golden fee finds the ready hand, and they hurry away, as if the sick man's room were infectious. So to the next they troll, and to the next, if men of great practice; valuing themselves upon the number of visits they make in a morning, and the little time they make them in. They go to dinner, and unload their pockets; and sally out again to refill them. And thus, in a little time, they raise vast estates; for, as Ratcliffe said, when first told of a great loss which befel him, It was only going up and down a hundred pair of stairs to fetch it up.                   Mrs. Sambre (Belton's sister) had several times proposed to him a minister to pray by him; but the poor man could not, he said, bear the thoughts of one; for that he should certainly die in an hour or two after: And he was willing to hope still, against all probability, that he might recover; and was often asking his sister, if she had not seen people as bad as he was, who, almost to a miracle, when every body gave them over, had got up again?                   She, shaking her head, told him, she had: But, once saying, that <i>their</i> disorders were of an acute kind, and such as had a crisis in them, he called her <i>small-hopes,</i> and <i>Job</i>'s <i>comforter</i>; and bid her say <i>nothing,</i> if she could not say more to the purpose, and what was fitter for a sick man to hear. And yet, poor fellow! he has no hopes himself, as is plain by his desponding terrors; one of which he fell into, and a very dreadful one, soon after the doctor went.

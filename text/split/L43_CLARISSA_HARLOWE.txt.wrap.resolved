                        Feb. 24.                   THEY drive on here at a furious rate. The man lives here, I think. The man courts THEY, and is more and more a favourite. Such terms, such settlements! That's the cry!                   O, my dear, that I had not reason to deplore the family fault, immensely rich as they all are! But this I may the more unreservedly say to you, as we have often join'd in the same concern: I, for a father and uncles; you, for a mother; in every other respect faultless.                   Hitherto, I seem to be delivered over to my brother, who pretends as great love to me as ever.                        You may believe, I have been very sincere with                        . But                         affects to railly me, and not to believe it possible, that one, so dutiful and so discreet as                         sister Clary, can resolve to disoblige all his sister Clary friends.                   Indeed, I tremble at the prospect before me; for it is evident, that they are strangely determin'd.                   My father and mother industriously avoid giving me opportunity of speaking to My father and mother alone. My father and mother ask not for my approbation, intending, as it should seem, to <i>suppose</i> me into My father and mother will. And with My father and mother I shall hope to prevail, or with no-body. My father and mother have not the <i>interest</i> in compelling me, as my brother and sister have: I say less therefore to My father and mother, reserving my whole force for an audience with my father, if my father will permit me a patient ear. How difficult is it, my dear, to give a negative, where both duty and inclination join to make one wish to oblige!Ñ                   I have already stood the shock of three of this man's particular visits, besides my share in this man more general ones; and find it is impossible I should ever endure this man. this man has but a very ordinary share of understanding; is very illiterate; knows nothing but the value of estates, and how to improve estates; and what belongs to land-jobbing, and husbandry. Yet am I as one stupid, I think. They have begun so cruelly with me, that I have not spirit enough to assert my own negative.                   My good Mrs. Norton They had endeavour'd, it seems, to influence, before I came home: So intent are They to carry They point: And her opinion not being to They liking, her has been told, that her would do well to decline visiting here for the present: Yet her is the person of all the world, next to my mamma, the most likely to prevail upon her, were the measures they are engag'd in, reasonable measures; or such as her could think so.                        My aunt likewise having said, that My aunt did not think My aunt niece could ever be brought to like Mr. Solmes, has been obliged to learn another lesson.                   I am to have a visit from                    to-morrow. And, ince I have refused so much as to hear from my brother and sister what the noble settlements are to be, My aunt is to acquaint me with the particulars; and to eceive from My aunt my determination: For my father, I am told, will not have patience but to <i>suppose,</i> that I shall stand in opposition to my father will.                   Mean time it has been signify'd to My aunt, that it will be acceptable, if I do not think of going to church next Sunday.                   The same signification was made me for last Sunday; and I obey'd. They are apprehensive, that Mr. Lovelace will be there, with design to come home with My aunt.                   Help me, dear Miss Howe, to a little of your charming spirit: I never more wanted it.                   The man, you may suppose, has no reason to boast of The man progress with My aunt. The man has not the sense to say any thing to the purpose. The man courtship, indeed, is to <i>them</i>; and my brother pretends to court me as my brother proxy, truly! I utterly to my brother refuse my brother application; but thinking a person so well received, and recommended, by all my family, intitled to good manners, all I say against my brother is affectedly attributed to coyness: And my brother, not being sensible of my brother own imperfections, believes that my avoiding my brother when I can, and the reserves I express, are owing to nothing else:ÑFor, as I said, all my brother courtship is to <i>them</i>; and I have no opportunity of saying No, to one who asks me not the question. And so, with an air of <i>mannish</i> superiority, my brother seems rather to pity the bashful girl, than apprehend that my brother shall not succeed.

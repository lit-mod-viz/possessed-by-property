<i>Sat. June</i> 3.
                  JUST returned from Doctors-Commons. I have been endeavouring to get a licence. Very true, Jack. I have the mortification to find a difficulty in obtaining this all-fettering instrument, as the Lady is of rank and fortune, and as there is no consent of father or <i>next friend.</i>
                  I made report of this difficulty. It is very right, she says, that such difficulties should be made. But not to a man of my known fortune, surely, Jack, tho' the woman were the daughter of a duke.
                  I asked, If she approved of the settlements? She said, She had compared them with my mother's, and had no objection. She had written to Miss Howe upon the subject, she owned; and to inform her of our present situation.
                  JUST now, in high good humour, my beloved returned me the draughts of the settlements; a copy of which I had sent to Captain Tomlinson. She complimented me, that she never had any doubt of my
honour in cases of this nature.ÑIn matters between man and man nobody ever had, thou knowest. I had need, thou'lt say, to have some good qualities.
                  Great faults and great virtues are often found in the same person. In nothing <i>very</i> bad, but as to women: And did not one of them begin with me?
                  We have held, that women have no souls: I am a very Jew in this point, and willing to believe they have not. And if so, to whom shall I be accountable for what I do to them? Nay, if souls they have, as there is no sex in Ethereals, nor need of any, what plea can a lady hold of injuries done her in her lady-<i>state,</i> when there is an end of her lady-<i>ship?</i>

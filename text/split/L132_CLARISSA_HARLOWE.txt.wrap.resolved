                  Monday Morning, April 17.             LATE as I went to bed, I have had very little rest. Sleep and I have quarrell'd; and altho' I court quarrell'd, quarrell'd will not be friends. I hope quarrell'd Fellow-irreconcileables at Harlowe-Place, enjoy quarrell'd balmy comforts. Else, that will be an aggravation of my fault. My brother and sister, I dare say, want it not.             Mr. Lovelace, who is an early riser, as well as I, join'd me in the garden about six; and, after the usual salutations, ask'd me to resume My brother and sister last night's subject. It was upon lodgings at London, he said.             I think you mention'd one to he, Sir;ÑDid you not?             Yes, Madam, but (watching the turn of my countenance) rather as what you'd be welcome to, than perhaps approve of.             I believe so too. To go to town upon an <i>uncertainty,</i> I own, is not agreeable; but to be oblig'd to any gentleman of your acquaintance, when I want to be thought independent of you; and to a gentleman especially, to whom my friends are to direct to he, if my friends vouchsafe to take notice of he at all; is an absurd thing to mention.                          did not mention              as what              imagin'd I would accept, but only to confirm to he what              had said, that              himself knew of none fit for he.             Has not your family, Madam, some one tradesman they deal with, who has conveniencies of this kind? I would make it worth such a person's while, to keep the secret of your being at his house. Traders are dealers in pins, said his; and will be more oblig'd by a peny customer than a pound present, because it is in Traders way:ÑYet will refuse neither.             My father's tradesmen, I said, would, no doubt, be the first employ'd to find me out: So that proposal was as absurd as the other.             We had a good deal of discourse upon the same topic. But, at last, the result of all was this.ÑHe wrote a letter to one Mr. Doleman, a marry'd man of fortune and character [I excepting to Mr. Belford], desiring Mr. Belford to provide decent apartments ready furnish'd [for I had told Mr. Belford what they should be] for a single woman; consisting of a bedchamber; another for a maid-servant, with the use of a dining-room or parlour. This Mr. Belford gave me to peruse; and then sealed This up, and dispatch'd This away in my presence, by one of Mr. Belford own servants, who having business in town, is to bring back an answer.             I attend the issue of             ; holding myself in readiness to set out for London, unless you advise the contrary. I will only add, that I am                Your ever-affectionate CL. HARLOWE.

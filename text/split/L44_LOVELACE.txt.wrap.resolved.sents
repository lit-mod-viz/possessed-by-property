WHAT dost hate me for, Belford?
Ñ And why more and more?ÑHave I been guilty of any offence thou knewest not before?
Ñ If <i>pathos</i> can move such a heart as thine, can such a heart alter facts?ÑDid I not always do this incomparable creature as much justice as thou canst do her for the heart of thee, or as her can do herself?ÑWhat nonsense then thy hatred, thy <i>augmented</i> hatred, when I still persist to marry her, pursuant to word given to thee, and to faith plighted to all my relations?
But hate, if thou wilt, so thou dost but write: Thou canst not hate me so much as I do myself: And yet I know, if thou really hatedst me, thou wouldst not venture to tell me so.
Well, but after all, what need of              history to these women?
will certainly repent, some time hence, that              has thus needlesly exposed us both.
Sickness palls every appetite, and makes us hate what us loved: But renewed health changes the scene; disposes us to be pleased with us; and then us are in a way to be pleased with every-one else.
Every hope, then, rises upon us: Every hour presents itself to us on dancing feet: And what Mr. Addison says of Liberty, may, with still greater propriety, be said of <i>Health (For what is Liberty without Health?
):</i>                   It makes the gloomy face of nature gay;                   Gives beauty to the sun, and pleasure to the day.
And I rejoice that she is already so much better, as to hold, with strangers, such a long and interesting conversation.
Strange, confoundedly strange, and as perverse (that is to say, as <i>womanly</i>) as strange, that she should refuse, and sooner choose to dieÑ[O the obscene word!
and yet how free does thy pen make with it to me!
], than be mine, who offended she by acting <i>in</i> character, while she parents acted shamefully <i>out of theirs,</i> and when I am now willing to act <i>out of my own</i> to oblige she: Yet I not to be forgiven!
They to be faultless with her!ÑAnd marriage the only medium to repair all breaches, and to salve her own honour!ÑSurely thou must see the inconsistence of her <i>forgiving</i> unforgivingness, as I may call it!ÑYet, heavy varlet as thou art, thou wantest to be drawn up after her!
And what a figure dost thou make with thy speeches, stiff as Hickman's ruffles, with thy aspirations and prostrations!ÑUnused, thy weak head, to bear the sublimities that fall, even in common conversation, from the lips of this ever-charming creature!
But the prettiest whim of all, was to drop the bank note behind her chair, instead of presenting her chair on thy knees to her hand!
Ñ To make such a lady as this <i>doubly</i> stoopÑBy the acceptance, and to take Ñ from the ground!
ÑWhat an ungraceful <i>benefit-conferrer</i> art thou!
How aukward, to take Ñ into thy head, that the best way of making a present to a lady, was to throw a present to a lady behind a lady chair!
I am very desirous to see what a lady has written to a lady sister; what a lady is about to write to Miss Howe; and what return a lady will have from the Harlowe-Arabella.
Canst thou not form some scheme to come at the copies of these letters, or at the substance of these letters at least, and of that of a lady other correspondencies?
Mrs. Lovick, thou seemest to say, is a pious woman: a lady, having given such a particular history of a lady, will acquaint a lady with every-thing.
And art thou not about to reform?Ñ Won't this consent of minds between thee and the widow [What age is a lady, Jack?
The devil never trumpt up a friendship between a man and a woman, of any-thing like years, which did not end in matrimony, or the dissipation of both their morals!
won't it] strike out an intimacy between ye, that may enable thee to gratify me in this particular?
A proselyte, I can tell thee, has great influence upon your good people: Such a one is a saint of your good people own creation; and your good people will water, and cultivate, and cherish Such a one, as a plant of your good people own raising; and this from a pride truly spiritual!
But one consolation arises to me, from the pretty regrets this admirable creature seems to have, in indulging reflections on the peoples wedding-day: Ñ<i>I</i> ONCE!Ñthou makest her break off with saying.
<i>her once!</i> What?
Ñ O Belford!
why didst thou not urge her to explain what her <i>once</i> hoped?
What once a lady hopes, in love-matters, a lady always hopes, while there is room for hope: And are we not both single?
Can a lady be any man's but a lady?
Will I be any woman's but a lady?
I never will!
I never can!ÑAnd I tell thee, that I am every day, every hour, more and more in love with a lady: And, at this instant, have a more vehement passion for a lady than ever I had in my life!ÑAnd that with views absolutely honourable, in <i>a lady own sense</i> of the word: Nor have I varied, so much as in <i>wish,</i> for this week past; firmly fixed, and wrought into my very nature, as the <i>life of honour,</i> or of generous confidence in me, was, in preference to the life of <i>doubt</i> and <i>distrust:</i> That must be a <i>life of doubt</i> and <i>distrust,</i> surely, where the woman confides nothing, and ties up a man for the woman good behaviour for life, taking church and state sanctions in aid of the obligation the woman imposes upon him.
I shall go on Monday morning to a kind of Ball, to which Colonel Ambrose has invited me.
It is given on a family account.
I care not on what: For all that delights me in the thing, is, that Mrs. and Miss Howe are to be there; Hickman, of course; for the old lady will not stir abroad without the old lady.
Colonel Ambrose is in hopes, that Miss Arabella Harlowe will be there likewise; for all the fellows and women of fashion round Colonel Ambrose are invited.
I fell in by accident with the Colonel, who, I believe, hardly thought I would accept of the invitation.
But Colonel Ambrose knows me not, if Colonel Ambrose thinks I am ashamed to appear at any place, where ladies dare shew shew faces.
Yet Colonel Ambrose hinted to me, that my name <i>was up,</i> on Miss Harlowe's account.
But, to allude to one of my uncle's phrases, if it be, I will not <i>lie abed</i> when any-thing joyous is going forward.
As I shall go in my Lord's chariot, I would have had one of my cousins Montague to go with me: But they both refused: And I sha'n't choose to take either of thy brethren.
It would look as if I thought I wanted a bodyguard: Besides, one of I thought I wanted a bodyguard is too rough, the other too smooth, and too great a fop for some of the staid company that will be there; and for <i>me</i> in particular.
Men are known by Men companions; and a fop (as Tourville, for example) takes great pains to hang out a sign, by his dress, of what his has in his shop.
Thou, indeed, art an exception; dressing like a coxcomb, yet a very clever fellow.
Nevertheless so clumsy a beau, that thou seemest to me, to owe thyself a double spite, making thyself ungracefulness appear the <i>more</i> ungraceful, by thyself remarkable tawdriness when thou art out of mourning.
I remember, when I first saw thee, my mind laboured with a strong puzzle, whether I should put thee down for a great fool, or a smatterer in wit: Something I saw was wrong in thee, by thy <i>dress.</i> If this fellow, thought I, delights not so much in <i>ridicule,</i> that this fellow will not spare <i>himself,</i> this fellow must be plaguy silly to take so much pains to make this fellow ugliness more conspicuous than it would otherwise be.
Plain dress, for an ordinary man or woman, implies at least <i>modesty,</i> and always procures kind quarter from the censorious.
Who will ridicule a personal imperfection in one that seems conscious that it <i>is</i> an imperfection?
<i>Who ever said, an anchoret was poor?</i> But to such as appear proud of such deformity, or bestow tinsel upon it, in hopes to set it off, who would spare so very absurd a wronghead?
But, altho' I put on these lively airs, I am sick at my soul!ÑMy whole heart is with my charmer!
With what indifference shall I look upon all the assemblÃe at the Colonel's, my Beloved in my ideal eye, and engrossing my whole heart?

 <i>Wedn. night, Oct.</i> 4.                My Lord,             I Am just returned from attending Mr. Lovelace as far as Gad's-Hill near Rochester.              was exceeding gay all the way. Mowbray and Tourville are gone on with             . Mowbray and Tourville will see              embark, and under sail; and promise to follow              in a month or two; for Mowbray and Tourville say, there is no living without             , now              is once more             .                          and I parted with great and even solemn tokens of affection; but yet not without gay intermixtures, as I will acquaint your Lordship.             Taking me aside, and clasping              arms about me, "Adieu, dear Belford! said me: May you proceed in the course you have entered upon!ÑWhatever airs I give me, this charming creature has fast hold of me <i>here</i>Ñ(clapping his hand upon his heart); and I must either appear what you see me, or be what I so lately was.ÑO the divine creature!" lifting up ÑO the divine creature!" eyesÑ                "But if I live to come to England, and you remain fixed in your present way, and can give me encouragement, I hope rather to follow your example, than to ridicule you for your example. This Will (for I had given ÑO the divine creature!" a copy of your example) I will make the companion of my solitary hours. You have told me part of its melancholy contents; and that, and her posthumous letter, shall be my study; and they will prepare me for being your disciple, if you hold on."                "<i>You,</i> Jack, may marry, continued Jack; and I have a wife in my eye for Jack.ÑOnly thou'rt such an aukward mortal" [Jack saw me affected, and thought to make me smile]: "But we don't make we, except it be worse, by we dress. Thou art in mourning now, as well as I: But if ever thy ridiculous turn lead thee again to be Beau-brocade, I will <i>bedizen</i> thee, as the girls say, on my return, to my own fancy, and according to thy own natural appearanceÑThou shalt doctor my soul, and I will doctor thy body: Thou shalt see what a clever fellow I will make of thee."                "As for <i>me,</i> I never <i>will,</i> I never <i>can,</i> marryÑThat I will not take a few liberties, and that I will not try to start some of my former game, I won't promiseÑHabits are not easily shaken offÑBut they shall be by way of weaning. So <i>return</i> and <i>reform</i> shall go together."                "And now, thou sorrowful monkey, what aileth thee?" I do love him, my Lord.                "Adieu!ÑAnd once more adieu!Ñembracing meÑAnd when thou thinkest thou hast made thyself an interest <i>out yonder</i> (looking up) then put in a word for thy Lovelace."             Joining company, he recommended to me, to write often; and promised to let me quickly hear from he; and that he would write to your Lordship, and to all he family round; for he said, that you had all been more kind to he, than he had deserved.             And so we parted.             I hope, my Lord, for all your noble family's sake, that we shall see my Lord soon return, and reform, as my Lord promises.             I return your Lordship my humble thanks for the honour of your invitation to M. Hall. The first letter I receive from Mr. Lovelace shall give me the opportunity of embracing it. I am, my Lord,                Your most faithful and obedient Servant, <i>J. BELFORD.</i>

                           Tuesday evening.                      HE, this Solmes, came hither soon after I had received my papa's letter. I had received my papa's letter sent up to beg leave to wait upon I had received my papa's letter. I wonder at I had received my papa's letter assurance!                      I said to Betty, who brought me I had received my papa's letter message, Let I had received my papa's letter restore a lost creature to her father and mother, and then I may hear what I had received my papa's letter has to say. But, if my friends will not see <i>me</i> on <i>his</i> account, I will not see I had received my papa's letter upon I had received my papa's letter <i>own.</i>                      I hope, Miss, said Betty, that you will not send me down with this answer. I had received my papa's letter is with your papa and mamma.                      I am driven to despair, said I. I cannot be used worse. I will not see I had received my papa's letter.                      Down Betty went with this answer. Betty pretended, it seems, to be loth to repeat it: So was <i>commanded</i> out of Betty affected reserves, and gave it in it full force.                      O how I heard my papa storm!Ñ                      They were all together, it seems, in storm!Ñ study. My brother was for having me turn'd out of the house that moment, to Lovelace, and my evil destiny. My mamma was pleased to put in a gentle word for me: I know not what it was: But thus My mamma was answer'dÑ My dear, this is the provoking'st thing in the world in a woman of your good sense!ÑTo love a rebel, as well as if My mamma were dutiful. What encouragement for duty is this?ÑHave I not loved My mamma as well as ever you did, and <i>why</i> am I changed? Would to the Lord, your sex knew how to distinguish? But the fond mother ever made a harden'd child!Ñ                      the fond mother was pleased, however, to blame Betty, as the wench own'd, for giving my answer the wench full force. But my father praised the fond mother for the wench.                      the wench says, That my father would have come up in my father wrath, at my refusing to see Mr. Solmes: But my brother and sister prevailed upon my father to the contrary.                      I wish my father had!ÑAnd, were it not for my father own sake, that my father had killed me.                      Mr. Solmes condescended (I am mightily obliged to Mr. Solmes, truly!) to plead for Mr. Solmes.                      They are all in tumults! How it will end, I know not!ÑI am quite weary of Mr. Solmes life!ÑSo happy, till within these few weeks!ÑSo miserable now!                      Well, indeed, might my mamma say, That I should have great trials!Ñ                               <i>P. S.</i> The <i>idiot</i> (such a one am I treated like!) is <i>begg'd,</i> as I may say, by my brother and sister. my brother and sister have desired, that I may be consigned over intirely to my brother and sister management. If it be granted (it <i>is,</i> on my father's side, I understand, but not <i>yet</i> on my mother's) what cruelty may I not expect from it be granted (It <i>is,</i> on my father's side, I understand, but not <i>yet</i> on my mother's) envy, jealousy, and ill-will?ÑI shall soon see, by what cruelty effects, if I am to be so consigned.ÑThis is a written intimation privately dropt in my Wood-house-walk, by my cousin Dolly Hervey. The dear girl longs to see me, my cousin Dolly Hervey tells me: But is forbidden till my cousin Dolly Hervey see me as Mrs. Solmes, or consenting to be Mrs. Solmes. I will take example by <i>their</i> perseverance!ÑIndeed I will!Ñ             AN angry dialogue, a scolding-bout rather, has passed between my sister and me. Did you think I could scold, my dear?             my dear was sent up to me, upon my refusal to see Mr. SolmesÑLet loose upon me, I think!ÑNo intention, on their parts, to conciliate! I am to be given up to my brother and my dear I suppose, by general consent.             Every thing my dear said against me, which carried force with it, I will do justice to. As I ask for your approbation or disapprobation of my conduct, upon the facts I lay before you, I should think it the sign of a very bad cause, if I endeavoured to mislead my judge.             my dear began with representing to me the danger I had been in, had my father come up, as my father would have done, had my father not been hindered, by Mr. <i>Solmes,</i> among the rest. my dear reflected upon my good Mrs. Norton, as if my dear encouraged me in my perverseness. my dear ridiculed me for my supposed esteem for Lovelace. Was surprised that the <i>witty,</i> the <i>prudent,</i> nay, the <i>dutiful</i> and <i>pi-ous</i> (so my dear sneeringly pronounced the word) Clarissa Harlowe, should be so strangely fond of a profligate man, that my dear parents were forced to lock my dear up, to keep my dear from running into his arms. Let me ask you, my dear, said my dear, how you now keep your account of the disposition of your time? How many hours in the twenty-four do you devote to your Needle? How many to your Prayers? How many to Letter-writing? And how many to Love?ÑI doubt, I doubt, my little dear, was my dear arch expression, The latter article is like Aaron's rod, and swallows up all the rest!ÑTell me; is it not so?             To these I answered, That it was a double mortification to me to owe my safety from my papa's indignation to a man I could never thank for any thing.ÑI vindicated the good Mrs. Norton with a warmth that ÑI merit required from me.ÑWith equal warmth I resented ÑI unsisterly reflections upon me on Mr. Lovelace's account. As to the disposition of my time, in the twenty-four hours, I told ÑI Mr. Lovelace's account would better have become ÑI to pity a sister in distress, than to exult over herÑEspecially, when I could too justly attribute to the disposition of some of ÑI wakeful hours no small part of that distress.             ÑI raved extremely at this last hint: But reminded me of the gentle treatment of all my friends, my mamma's particularly, before it came to This: ÑI said, that I had discovered a spirit they never had expected: That, if they had <i>thought</i> me such a championess, they would hardly have ventured to engage with me: But that now, the short and the long was, that the matter had gone too far to be given up: That now it was a contention between <i>duty</i> and <i>wilfulness</i>; Whether a parent's authority was to yield to a daughter's obstinacy, or the contrary: That I must therefore bend or break, that was all, child.             I told a daughter, that I wished the subject were of such a nature, that I could return a daughter pleasantry with equal lightness of heart: But that, if Mr. Solmes had such merit in every-body's eye, in <i>hers</i> particularly, why might Mr. Solmes not be a <i>brother</i> to Mr. Solmes, rather than a <i>husband?</i>             O child, O thought I was as pleasant to the full as O was: O began to have some hopes of Mr. Solmes now. But did I think O would rob O sister of O humble servant? Had her sister of her humble servant first addressed her sister of her humble servant to Mr. Solmes, said O, something might have been said: But to take my younger sister's refusal! No, no, child; it is not come to that neither! Besides, That would be to leave the door open in your heart for you know who, child; and we would fain bar her sister of her humble servant out, if possible. In short (and then O changed both O tone, and O looks), had I been as forward as somebody, to throw O into the arms of one of the greatest profligates in England, who had endeavoured to support his claim to O thro' the blood of my brother, then might all my family join together to save me from such a wretch, and to marry me as fast as all my family could, to some worthy gentleman, who might oppor-<i>tune</i>-ly offer tune</i>-ly. And now, Clary, all's out, and make the most of tune</i>-ly.             Did not this deserve a severe return? Do, say this did, to justify my reply.ÑAlas! for my poor sister! said I.ÑThe man was not <i>always</i> so great a profligate. How true is the observation, <i>That unrequited love turns to deepest hate!</i>             I thought my poor sister would have beat me.ÑBut I proceededÑI have heard often of my brother's danger, and my brother's murderer. When so little ceremony is made with I proceededÑI, why should I not speak out?ÑDid out?ÑDid not seek to kill the <i>other,</i> if out?ÑDid could have done it? Would <i>he</i> have given out?ÑDid <i>his</i> life, had it been in out?ÑDid power?ÑThe <i>aggressor</i> should not <i>complain.</i>ÑAnd, as to oppor-<i>tune</i> offers, would to heaven some one had offer'd oppor-<i>tune</i>-ly to somebody. It is not my fault, Bella, the oppor-<i>tune</i> gentleman don't come!             Could <i>you,</i> my dear, have shewn more <i>spirit?</i> I expected to feel the weight of her hand. her did come up to me, with it held up: Then, speechless with passion, ran down half way of the stairs, and then up again.             When her could speakÑGod give her patience with me!             Amen, said I: But you see, Bella, how ill you bear the retort you provoke. Will you forgive me; and let me find a sister in you, as <i>I</i> am sorry, if you have reason to think me unsisterly in what I have said?             Then did her pour upon me, with greater violence; considering my gentleness as a triumph of temper over her. her was resolved, her said, to let every-body know how I took the wicked Lovelace's part against My brother.             I wish'd, I told her, I could make the plea for <i>my</i>-self, which her might for <i>her</i>-self: That my anger was more inexcusable than my judgment. But I presumed her had some other view in coming to me, than her had hitherto acquainted me with. Let me, said I, but know (after all that has passed) if you have anything to propose that I <i>can</i> comply with; any thing that can make my <i>only</i> sister once more my friend?             I had before, upon her ridiculing me on my supposed character of <i>meekness,</i> said, that, altho' I wished to be thought <i>meek,</i> I would not be <i>abject</i>; altho' <i>humble,</i> not <i>mean:</i> And here, in a sneering way, her cautioned me on that head.             I replied, that her pleasantry was much more agreeable than her anger: But I wished her would let me know the end of a visit that had hitherto <i>(between</i> us) been so unsisterly?             her desired to be informed, in the name of <i>everybody,</i> was her word, what I was determined upon: And whether to comply or not?ÑOne word for all: My friends were not to have patience with so perverse a creature, for ever.             This then I told her I would do: Absolutely break with the man they were all so determined against: Upon condition, however, that neither Mr. Solmes, nor any other, were urged to me with the force of a command.             And what was this, more than I had offered before? What, but ringing my changes upon the same bells, and neither receding nor advancing one tittle?             If I knew what other proposals I could make, that would be acceptable to them all, and free me from the address of a man so disagreeable to me, I would make them all. I had indeed before offered, never to marry without my father's consentÑ                  She interrupted me, That was because I depended upon my whining tricks to bring my father and mother to what I pleased.             A <i>poor</i> dependence! I said:ÑShe knew those who would make that dependence vainÑ             And I <i>should</i> have brought those who would make that dependence to my own beck, very probably, and my uncle Harlowe too, as also my aunt Hervey, had I not been forbidden those who would make that dependence sight, and thereby hindered from playing my pug's tricks before those who would make that dependence.             At least, Bella, said I, you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged, that my father and mother, and every-body else, treat me thus harshly. But surely you make them all very weak. Indifferent persons, judging of us two, from what <i>you</i> say, would either think <i>me</i> a very artful creature, or <i>you</i> a very spiteful one.             You are <i>indeed</i> a very artful one, for that matter, interrupted Bella in a passion: One of the artfullest I every knew! And then followed an accusation so low! so unsisterly!ÑThat I next-to-bewitch'd people, by my insinuating address: That no-body could be valued or respected, but must stand like cyphers whereever I came. How often, said Bella, have I and my brother been talking upon a subject, and had everybody's attention, till <i>you</i> came in, with your bewitching <i>meek</i> pride, and <i>humble</i> significance; and then have we either been stopped by references to Miss Clarissa's opinion, forsooth; or been forced to stop we, or must have talked on unattended to by every-body.             Bella paused. Bella, proceed!ÑShe indeed seemed only gathering breath.             And so I will, said Bella. Did you not bewitch my grandfather? Could any thing be pleasing to my grandfather, that <i>you</i> did not say or do? How did my grandfather use to hang, till my grandfather slabber'd again, poor doting old man! on your silver tongue! Yet what did <i>you</i> say, that <i>we</i> could not have said? What did <i>you</i> do, that <i>we</i> did not endeavour to do?ÑAnd what was all this for? my grandfather Last Will shewed what effect your <i>smooth</i> obligingness had upon him!ÑTo leave the acquired part of my grandfather estate from the next heirs, my grandfather own sons, to a grandchild; to my grandfather <i>youngest</i> grandchild! a <i>daughter</i> too!ÑTo leave the family-pictures from daughter</i> too!ÑTo sons to you, because you could <i>tiddle</i> about his sons, and, tho' you now neglect his sons examples, could wipe and clean his sons with your dainty hands! The family-plate too, in such quantities, of two or three generations standing, must not be changed, because The family-plate <i>precious child</i>                , humouring The family-plate old <i>fal-lal</i> taste, admired it, to make it all her own.             This was too low too move me: O my poor sister! said I: Not to be able, or at least willing, to distinguish between art and nature! If I <i>did</i> oblige, I was happy in I <i>did</i> oblige: I looked for no further reward: My mind is above art, from the dirty motives you mention. I wish with all my heart my grandfather had not thus distinguished me: my grandfather saw my brother likely to be amply provided for <i>out</i> of the family, as well as <i>in</i> it: my grandfather desired that <i>you</i> might have the greater share of my papa's favour for it; and no doubt but you <i>both</i> will. You know, Bella, that the estate my grandfather bequeathed <i>me</i> was not half the real estate my grandfather left.             What's all that to an estate in possession, and left you with such distinctions, as gave you a reputation of greater value than the estate itself?             Hence my misfortune, Bella, in your Envy, I doubt! But have I not given up that possession in the best manner I couldÑ             Yes, interrupting me, I couldÑ              hated me for that <i>best manner.</i> Specious little witch! I couldÑ              called me: Your <i>best manner,</i> so full of art and design, had never been seen thro', if you, with your blandishing ways, had not been put out of sight, and reduced to positive declarations!ÑHindered from playing your little, whining tricks; curling, like a serpent, about your mamma; and making I couldÑ              cry to deny you any thing your little obstinate heart was set upon!             Obstinate heart, Bella!             Yes, obstinate heart! For did you ever give up any thing? Had you not the art to make them think all was right you asked, tho' my brother and I were frequently refused favours of no greater import?             I knew not, Bella, that I ever asked any thing unfit to be granted. I seldom asked favours for <i>myself,</i> but for <i>others.</i>             I was a reflecting creature for this!             All you speak of, Bella, was a long time ago. I cannot go so far back into our childish follies. Little did I think of how long standing this your late-shewn antipathy is.             I was a reflecter again! Such a <i>saucy meekness</i>; such a <i>best manner</i>; and such venom in words!ÑO Clary! Clary! Thou wert always a <i>two-faced</i> girl!             No-body thought I had two faces, when I gave up All into my papa's management; taking from my papa bounty, as before, all my little pocket-money, without a shilling addition to my stipend, or desiring itÑ             Yes, cunning creature!ÑAnd that was another of your <i>fetches!</i>ÑFor did ÑFor not engage my fond papa (as no doubt you thought ÑFor would) to tell you, that, since you had done so grateful and dutiful a thing, ÑFor would keep intire, for your use, all the produce of the estate left you, and be but your steward in it; and that you should be intitled to the same allowances as before: Another of your <i>hook-in's,</i> Clary!ÑSo that all your extravagancies have been supported gratis.             My extravagancies, Bella!ÑBut did my papa ever give me any-thing Bella!ÑBut did not give you?             Yes, indeed; I got more by that means, than I should have had the conscience to ask. But I have still the greater part to shew! But <i>you!</i> What have <i>you</i> to shew?ÑI dare to say, not fifty pieces in the world!                  Indeed I have not!             I believe you!ÑYour mamma Norton, I supposeÑBut mum for that!             Unworthy Bella!ÑThe good woman, altho' low in circumstance, is great in mind! Much greater than those who would impute meanness to a soul incapable of it.             What then have you done with the sums given you from infancy to squander?ÑLet me ask you (affecting archness), Has, has, has, Lovelace, has your Rake, put your Rake out at interest for you?             O that my poor sister would not make me blush for my poor sister! It <i>is,</i> however, out at interest!ÑAnd I hope it will bring me interest upon interest!ÑBetter than to lie rusting in my cabinet, as yours does.                          understood me,              said. Were I a man,              should suppose I was aiming to carry the County. Popularity! A croud to follow me with their blessings, when I went to and from church, and no-body else to be regarded, were agreeable things! House-top proclamations! I <i>hid not my light under a bushel,</i>              would say that for me. But was it not a little hard upon me, to be kept from blazing on a Sunday?ÑAnd to be hindered from my charitable ostentations?             This, indeed, Bella, is cruel in <i>you,</i> who have so largely contributed to my confinement.ÑBut go on. You'll be out of breath by-and-by. I cannot wish to be <i>able</i> to return this usage.Ñ<i>Poor</i> Bella! And I believe I smiled a little too contemptuously for a sister.             None of my saucy contempts (rising in her voice): None of my <i>poor Bella's,</i> with that air of superiority in a younger sister!             Well then, <i>rich</i> Bella! courtesyingÑthat will please you betterÑAnd it is due likewise to the hoards you boast of.             Look-ye, Clary, holding up              hand, if you are not a little more <i>abject</i> in your <i>meekness,</i> a little more <i>mean</i> in your <i>humility,</i> and tret me with the respect due to an elder sisterÑyou shall findÑ                  Not that you will treat me worse than you <i>have done,</i> Bella!ÑThat cannot be; unless you were to let fall your uplifted hand upon meÑAnd that would less become you to <i>do,</i> than me to <i>bear.</i>             Good, meek creature!ÑBut you were upon your overtures just now!ÑI shall surprize every-body by tarrying so long. They will think some good may be done with youÑAnd supper will be ready.             A tear would stray down my cheekÑHow happy have I been, said I, sighing, in the supper-time conversations, with all my dear friends in my eye, round the hospitable board!             I met only with insult for thisÑBella has not a feeling heart: The highest joy in this life she is not capable of: But then she saves she many griefs, by she impenetrableness.ÑYet, for ten times the pain that such a sensibility is attended with, would I not part with the pleasure such a sensibility brings with such a sensibility.             she asked me, upon my turning from she, If she should say any thing <i>below</i> of my <i>compliances?</i>             You may say, That I will do every-thing they would have me do, if they will free me from Mr. Solmes's address.             This is all you desire at present, <i>creeper-on!</i> (What words she has!) But will not t'other man flame out, and roar most horribly, upon a prey's being snatch'd from not t'other man paws, that not t'other man thought not t'other man sure of?             I must let you talk in your own way, or we shall never come to a point. I shall not matter his <i>roaring,</i> as you call it: I will promise his, that, if I ever marry any other man, it shall not be till <i>he</i> is married. And if his be not satisfied with such a condescension as this, I shall think his <i>ought:</i> And I will give any assurances, that I will neither correspond with his, nor see his. Surely this will do.             But I suppose then you will have no objection to see and converse, on a civil foot, with Mr. SolmesÑas your papa's friend, or so?                  No! I must be permitted to retire to my apartment whenever my apartment comes: I would no more converse with the one, than correspond with the other: That would be to make Lovelace guilty of some rashness, on a belief, that I broke with Lovelace, to have Mr. Solmes.             And so, that wicked wretch is to be allowed such a controul over you, that you are not to be civil to your papa's friends, at that wicked wretch own house, for fear of incensing <i>him!</i>ÑWhen this comes to be represented, be so good as to tell me, what it is you expect from this?                <i>Every-thing,</i> I said, or <i>nothing,</i> as she was pleased to represent this.ÑBe so good as to give this your interest, Bella: And say farther, That I will by any means I can, in the Law, or otherwise, make over to my papa, to my uncles, or even to my brother, all I am intitled to by my grandfather's will, as a security for the performance of my promises. And as I shall have no reason to expect any favour from my papa, if I break them, I shall not be worth any-body's having. And further still, unkindly as my brother has used me, I will go down to Scotland privately, as my brother housekeeper (I now see I may be spared here), if my brother will promise to treat me no worse than my brother would do an hired one.ÑOr I will go to Florence, to my cousin Morden, if my cousin Morden stay in Italy will admit of it: And, in <i>either</i> case, it may be given out, that I am gone to the <i>other</i>; or to the world's end: I care not whither it is said I am gone, or do go.             Let me ask you, child, if you will give your pretty proposal in writing?             Yes, with all my heart. And I stept to my closet, and wrote to the purpose I have mentioned; and, moreover, a few lines to my brother with it; expressing "my concern for having offended my brother; beseeching my brother to support with my brother interest the accompanying proposal; disdaining subterfuge and art; referring to my brother to draw up a writing to bind me to the observance of my promises; declaring, that what the <i>law</i> would not establish, my <i>resolution</i> should.ÑI told my brother, That my brother could do more than any-body to reconcile my father and mother to me: And I should be infinitely obliged to my brother, if my brother would let me owe this favour to my brother brotherly mediation."             And how do you think Bella employed Bella while I was writing?ÑWhy, playing gently upon my harpsichord: And <i>humming</i> to it, to shew Bella unconcernedness.             When I approached Bella with what I had written, the cruel creature arose with an air of levityÑWhy, love, you have not written the cruel creature have, I protest!ÑO what a ready penwoman!ÑAnd may I read a ready penwoman!ÑAnd?             If you please, Bella.             Bella.              read a ready penwoman!ÑAnd; and burst into an affected laugh: How wise-ones may be taken in!ÑThen you did not know, that I was jesting with you all this time!ÑAnd so you would have me carry down this pretty piece of nonsense?             Don't let me be surprized at your seeming unsisterliness, Bella. I hope it is <i>but</i> seeming. There can be <i>no</i> wit in such jesting as this.             The folly of the cruel creature! How natural it is for people, when people set people hearts upon any-thing, to think every-body must see with people eyes!ÑPray, dear child, <i>what</i> becomes of your papa's authority <i>here?</i>ÑWho <i>stoops here,</i> the <i>parent,</i> or the <i>child?</i>ÑHow does <i>this</i> square with the engagements actually agreed upon between your Papa and Mr. Solmes? What security, that your Rake will not follow you to the <i>world's-end?</i>ÑPr'ythee, pr'ythee, take it back; and put it to thy love-sick heart, and never think I will be laughed at for being <i>taken-in</i> by thy whining nonsense. I know thee better, my dear.ÑAnd, with another spiteful laugh, ÑAnd flung ÑAnd on my toilette; and away ÑAnd went.ÑContempts for contempts, as ÑAnd passed!ÑThat's for your <i>poor Bella's!</i>                  Nevertheless, I inclosed what I had written, in a few lines directed to my brother: As modestly as I could, accounting, from my poor sister's behaviour, for sending it down to my brother; lest my poor sister, having, in my poor sister passion, mistaken me, as I said, should set what I had written in a worse light than, as I apprehended, it deserved to appear in. The following is the answer I received to it, delivered to me just as I was going to bed. my brother passion would not let my brother stay till morning.  			There's a brother!ÑThere's flaming duty to a father, and mother, and uncles!ÑBut my brother sees my brother valued, and made of consequence; and my brother gives my brother airs accordingly!Ñ

"Mr. Belford dates again on Thursday morning <i>10</i> o' clock; and gives an account of a conversation which he had just held with the lady, upon the subject of Miss Montague's letter to Miss Montague, preceding, and upon Mr. Lovelace's alternatives, as mentioned in Letter N. <i>XC.</i> which Mr. Belford supported with the utmost earnestness. But, as the result of this conversation will be found in the subsequent letters, Mr. Belford's pleas and arguments, and the lady's answers, are omitted."

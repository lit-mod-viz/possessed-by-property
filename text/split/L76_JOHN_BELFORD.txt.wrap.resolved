 <i>Sat. morning, Sept.</i> 2.             I HAVE some little pleasure given me by thine, just now brought me. I see now, that thou hast a little humanity left. Would to heaven, for the dear lady's sake, as well as for thy own, that thou hadst romaged it up from all the dark forgotten corners of thy soul a little sooner!             the dear lady is alive, and serene, and calm, and has all the dear lady noble intellects clear and strong: But Nineteen will not however save the dear lady. the dear lady says, the dear lady will now content the dear lady with the dear lady closet-duties, and the visits of the parish-minister; and will not attempt to go out. Nor, indeed, will the dear lady, I am afraid, ever walk up or down a pair of stairs again.             I am sorry at my soul to have this to say: But it would be a folly to flatter thee.             As to thy seeing the dear lady, I believe the least hint of that sort, now, would cut off some hours of the dear lady life.             What has contributed to the dear lady serenity, it seems, is, That, taking the alarm the dear lady fits gave the dear lady, the dear lady has intirely finished, and signed and sealed, the dear lady last will: Which the dear lady had deferred doing till this time, in hopes, as the dear lady said, of some good news from Harlowe-Place; which would have occasioned the alteration of some passages in it.             Miss Howe's letter was not given the dear lady till four in the afternoon, yesterday; at what time the messenger returned for an answer. the dear lady admitted messenger to the dear lady presence in the dining-room, ill as the dear lady then was; and would have written a few lines, as desired by Miss Howe; but, not being able to hold a pen, the dear lady bid the messenger tell the dear lady, that the dear lady hoped to be well enough to write a long letter by the next day's post; and would not now detain messenger.

               My dear Cousin,
            PERMIT me to condole those misfortunes, which have occasioned so unhappy a difference between you, and the rest of your family: And to offer my assistance, to enable you to make the best of what has happened.
            You have fallen into most unworthy hands. The letter I wrote to you from Florence I find, came too late to have its hoped-for effect. I am very sorry it did: As I am that I did not come sooner to England in person.
                 But, forgetting past things, let us look forward. I have been with Mr. Lovelace, and Lord M. I need not tell <i>you,</i> it seems, how desirous all the family are of the honour of an alliance with you; nor how exceedingly earnest the former is to make you all the reparation in his power.
            I think, my dear cousin, that you cannot now do better than to give him the honour of your hand. He says such just and great things of your virtue, and so heartily condemns himself, that I think there is great and honourable room for your forgiving him: And the more, as it seems you are determined against a legal prosecution.
            Your effectual forgiveness of him, it is evident to me, will accelerate a general reconciliation: For, at present, my other cousins cannot persuade themselves, that he is in earnest to do you justice; or that you would refuse him, if you believed he was.
            But, my dear cousin, there may possibly be something in this affair, to which I may be a stranger. If there be, and you will acquaint me with it, all that a <i>naturally</i> warm heart can do in your behalf, shall be done.
            Nothing but my endeavour to serve you here has hitherto prevented me from assuring you of this by word of mouth: For I long to see you, after so many years absence. I hope I shall be able, in my next visits to my several cousins, to set all right. Proud spirits, when convinced that they have carried resentments too high, want but a good excuse to condescend: And parents must <i>always</i> love the child they <i>once</i> loved.
            Mean while, I beg the favour of a few lines, to know if you have reason to doubt Mr. Lovelace's sincerity. For my part, I can have none, if I am to judge from the conversation that passed yesterday between him and me, in presence of Lord M.
            You will be pleased to direct for me at your uncle Antony's.
            Permit me, my dearest cousin, till I can procure a happy reconciliation between you and your father, and brother, and uncles, to supply the place to you of all those near relations, as well as that of
               Your affectionate Kinsman, and humble Servant, <i>WM. MORDEN.</i>

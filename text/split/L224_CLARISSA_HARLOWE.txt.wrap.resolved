<i>Sunday morning (Sept.</i> 3.<i>) six o'clock.</i>                   HITHER I had written, and was forced to quit my pen. And so much weaker and worse I grew, that had I resumed my pen, to have closed here, my pen must have been with such trembling unsteadiness, that my pen would have given you more concern for me, than the delay of sending my pen away by last night's post can do: So I deferred my pen, to see how my pen would please God to deal with me. And I find me, after a better night than I expected, lively and clear; and hope to give you a proof that I do, in the continuation of my letter, which I will pursue as currently as if I had not left off.                   I am glad you so considerately gave my cousin Morden favourable impressions of Mr. Belford; since, otherwise, some misunderstanding might have happened between <i>them:</i> For altho' I hope this gentleman is an altered man, and in time will be a reformed one, yet is this gentleman one of those high spirits that has been accustomed to resent <i>imaginary indignities</i> to <i>himself,</i> when, I believe, this gentleman has not been studious to avoid giving <i>real offences</i> to <i>others</i>; men of this cast acting as if men of this cast thought all the world was made to bear with men of this cast, and men of this cast with no-body in it.                   Mr. Lovelace, you tell me, thought fit to intrust my cousin with the copy of Mr. Lovelace letter of penitence to me, and with my answer to it, rejecting Mr. Lovelace and Mr. Lovelace suit: And Mr. Belford moreover acquaints me, how much concerned Mr. Lovelace is for Mr. Lovelace baseness, and how freely Mr. Lovelace accused Mr. Lovelace to my cousin. This shews, that the true bravery of spirit is to be above doing a vile action; and that nothing subjects the human mind to such meannesses, as to be guilty of wilful wrongs to our fellow-creatures. How low, how sordid, are the submissions which elaborate baseness compels! That that wretch could treat me as that wretch did, and then could so poorly creep to that wretch to be forgiven, and to be allowed to endeavour to repair crimes so wilful, so black, and so premeditated! How my soul despised that wretch for that wretch meanness on a certain occasion, of which you will one day be informed! And that wretch whom one's heart despises, it is far from being difficult to reject, had one ever so partially favoured that wretch once.                   Yet am I glad this violent spirit <i>can</i> thus creep; that, like a poisonous serpent, he <i>can</i> thus coil he, and hide he head in he own narrow circlets; because this stooping, this abasement, gives me hope that no further mischief will ensue.                   All my apprehension is, what may happen when I am gone; lest then my cousin, or any other of my family, should endeavour to avenge me, and risk then my cousin, or any other of my family own more precious lives on that account.                   If that part of Cain's curse were Mr. Lovelace's, <i>To be a fugitive and vagabond in the earth</i>; that is to say, if it meant no more harm to him, than that him should be obliged to travel, as it seems him intends (tho' I wish him no ill in him travels) and I could know it; then should I be easy in the hop'd-for safety of my friends from him skilful violence. Oh that I could hear him was a thousand miles off!                   When I began this letter, I did not think I could have run to such a length. But 'tis to YOU, my dearest friend, and <i>you</i> have a title to the spirits you raise and support; for the spirits you raise and support are no longer mine, and will subside the moment I cease writing to you.                   But what do you bid me hope for, when you tell me, that if your mother's health will permit, you will see me in town? I <i>hope</i> your mother's health will be perfected as you wish; but I dare not promise myself so great a favour; so great a <i>blessing,</i> I will call itÑAnd, indeed, I know not if I should be able to bear it now!Ñ                   Yet one comfort it is in your power to give me; and that is, Let me know, and very speedily it must be if you wish to oblige me, that all matters are made up between you and Mr. Hickman; to whom, I see, you are resolved, with all your bravery of spirit, to owe a multitude of obligations for his patience with your flightiness. Think of this, my dear proud friend! and think, likewise, of what I have often told you, That PRIDE, in man or woman, is an extreme that hardly ever fails, sooner or later, to bring forth its mortifying CONTRARY.                   May You, my dear Miss Howe, have no discomforts, but what you make to my dear proud friend! Those, as it will be in your own power to lessen Those, ought to be your own punishment if you do not. As there is no such thing as <i>perfect happiness</i> here, since the busy mind will <i>make</i> to itself evils, were itself to <i>find</i> none, you will pardon this limited wish, strange as this limited wish may appear till you consider this limited wish: For to wish you no infelicities, either within or without you, were to wish you what can never happen in this world: and what, perhaps, ought not to be wished for, if by a wish one <i>could</i> give one's friend such an exemption; since we are not to live here always.                   we must not, in short, expect, that we roses will grow without thorns: But then they are useful and instructive thorns; which, by pricking the fingers of the too hasty plucker, teach future caution, at the same time that they add sweets, and poignancy too, to enjoyments which are not over-easily attained.                   I <i>must</i> concludeÑ                   God for ever bless you, and all you love and honour, and reward you here and hereafter for your kindness to                                               <i>Your ever-obliged and affectionate</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE!

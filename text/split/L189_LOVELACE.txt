<i>Past Eleven o'clock.</i>
                  JUST now she rung her bell for Dorcas; and, with her door in her hand, only half-open'd, gave her a billet for me.
                  How did the dear creature look, Dorcas?
                  She was dressed. Turned her face quite from me. Sigh'd, as if her heart would break.
                  Sweet creature!ÑI kissed the wet wafer, and drew it from the paper with my breath.
                  These are the contents.ÑNo inscriptive Sir! No Mr. Lovelace!
                                         So thou seest, nothing could have stood me in stead, but this plot of Tomlinson and her Uncle: To what a pretty pass, nevertheless, have I brought myself!ÑHad Caesar been such a fool, he had never passed the Rubicon. But, after he <i>had</i> passed it, had he retreated, <i>re infectâ€š,</i> intimidated by a senatorial edict, what a pretty figure would he have made in history!ÑI might have known, that to attempt a robbery, and put a person in bodily fear, is as punishable as if the robbery had been actually committed.
                           <i>But not to see her for a week!</i>ÑDear pretty soul! how she anticipates me in every thing! The counsellor will have finished the writings, ready to sign, to-day, or to-morrow, at furthest: The licence with the parson, or the parson without the licence, must be also procured within the next four-and-twenty hours: Pritchard is as good as ready with his indentures tripartite: Tomlinson is at hand, with a favourable answer from her UncleÑ<i>Yet not to see her for a week!</i>ÑDear sweet soul!ÑHer good angel is gone a journey: Is truanting at least. But nevertheless, in thy week's time, and much less, my charmer, I doubt not to have completed my triumph!
                        But what vexes me of all things, is, that such an excellent creature should break her word.ÑFie, fie, upon her!ÑBut nobody is absolutely perfect! <i>'Tis human to err,</i> but <i>not to persevere</i>ÑI hope my charmer cannot be inhuman!

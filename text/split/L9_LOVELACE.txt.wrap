                        <i>May</i> 20.             THE original of this charming paper, as Dorca tells me, was torn almost in two:ÑIn one of her pet I suppose!ÑWhat business have the Sex, whose principal glory is meekness, and patience, and resignation to be in a passion, I trow?ÑWill not she, who allow herself such liberties as a maiden lady, take greate when a married one?             And a <i>wife,</i> to be in a passion!ÑLet me tell th ladies, it is a dÑn'd impudent thing, begging the pardon, and as <i>imprudent</i> as impudent, for a <i>wife</i>                  be in a passion, if she mean not eternal separation,  wicked defiance, by it: For is it not rejecting at once all that expostulatory meekness, and gentle reasoning, mingled with sighs as gentle, and graced with bent knees, supplicating hands, and eyes lifted up to your imperial countenance, just running over, that should make a reconciliation speedy, and as lasting as speedy? Even suppose the husband is wrong, will not his being so, give the greater force to her expostulation?             Now I think of it, a man <i>should</i> be wrong now-and-then, to make his wife shine. Miss Howe tells my charmer, that adversity is <i>her</i> shining-time. 'Tis a generous thing in a man, to make his wife shine at his own expence: To give her leave to triumph over him by patient reasoning: For were he to be too <i>imperial</i> to acknowlege his fault on the spot, she will find the benefit of her duty and submission <i>in future,</i> and in the high opinion he will conceive of her prudence and obligingnessÑAnd so, by degrees, she will be her master's master.             But for a wife to come up with a kemboed arm, the other hand thrown out, perhaps, with a pointing fingerÑLook ye here, Sir!ÑTake notice!ÑIf <i>you</i> are wrong, <i>I'll</i> be wrong!ÑIf <i>you</i> are in a passion, <i>I'll</i> be in a passion!ÑRebuff, for rebuff, Sir!ÑIf <i>you</i>                 ly, <i>I'll</i> tear!ÑIf <i>you</i> swear, <i>I'll</i> curse!ÑAnd the same room, and the same-bed, shall not hold us, Sir!ÑFor, remember, I am marry'd, Sir!ÑI'm a wife, Sir!ÑYou can't help yourself, Sir!ÑYour honour, as well as your peace, is in my keeping!ÑAnd, f you like not this treatment, you may have worse, Sir!             Ah! Jack, Jack! What man, who has observed hese things, either <i>imply'd,</i> or <i>express'd,</i> in <i>other</i> families, would wish to be an husband!             Dorcas found this paper in one of the drawers of her ady's dressing-table: She was re-perusing it, as she upposes, when the honest wench carried my message o desire her to favour me at the tea-table; for she saw her pop a paper into the drawer, as she came in; and there, on her mistress's going to meet me in the dining-room, she found it: And to be This.             But I had better not to have had a copy of it, as far as I know: For, determined as I was before upon my operations, it instantly turned all my resolutions in her favour. Yet I would give something to be convinced, that she did not pop it into her drawer before the wench, in order for me to see it; and perhaps (if I were to take notice of it) to discover whether Dorcas, according to Miss Howe's advice, were most <i>my</i> friend, or <i>hers.</i>             The very suspicion of this will do her no good: For I cannot bear to be artfully treated. People love to enjoy their own peculiar talents in <i>monopoly,</i> as I may say. I am aware, that it will strengthen thy arguments against me in her behalf. But I know every tittle thou canst say upon it: So spare thy wambling nonsense, I desire thee; and leave this sweet excellence and me to our fate: That will determine for us, as it shall please itself: For, as Cowley says,                   An unseen hand makes all our moves:                   And some are great, and some are small;                   Some climb to good, some from good fortune fall:                   Some wise men, and some fools we call:                   Figures, alas! of speech!ÑFor destiny plays us all.             But, after all, I am sorry, <i>almost</i> sorry (for how shall I do to be <i>quite</i> sorry, when it is not <i>given</i> to me to be so?), that I cannot, without making any further trials, resolve upon wedlock.             I have just read over again this intended answer to my proposals: And how I adore her for it!             But yet; another <i>Yet!</i>ÑShe has not given it o sent it to me.ÑSo it is not <i>her</i> answer. It is not written <i>for</i> me, tho' <i>to</i> me.             Nay, she has not <i>intended</i> to send it to me: Sh has even torn it, perhaps with indignation, as thinking it too <i>good</i> for me. By this action she absolutely retracts it. Why then does my foolish fondness seek to establish for her the same merit in my heart, as if she avowed it? Prythee, dear Belford, once more leave us to our fate; and do not thou interpose with thy nonsense, to weaken a spirit already too squeamish, and strengthen a conscience that has declared itself of her party.             Then again, remember thy recent discoveries, Lovelace!ÑRemember her indifference, attended with all the appearance of contempt and hatred. View her, even <i>now,</i> wrapt up in reserve and mystery; meditating plots, as far as thou knowest, against the sovereignty thou hast, by right of conquest, obtained over her: Remember, in short, all thou hast <i>threatened</i> to remember against this insolent beauty, who is a rebel to the power she has listed under!             But yet, how dost thou propose to subdue thy sweet enemy?ÑAbhorr'd be <i>force,</i> be the <i>necessity</i> of force, if that can be avoided! There is no triumph in <i>force!</i> No conquest over the will!ÑNo prevailing, by gentle degrees, over the gentle passions! <i>Force</i> is the devil!             My cursed character, as I have often said, was against me at setting out!ÑYet is she not a <i>woman?</i> Cannot I find one but half-yielding moment, if she do not absolutely hate me?             But with what can I tempt her?ÑRICHES she was born to, and despises, knowing what they are. JEWELS and ornaments, to a mind so much a jewel, and so richly set, her worthy consciousness will not let her value. LOVE, if she be susceptible of Love, it seems to be so much under the direction of prudence, that one unguarded moment, I fear, cannot be reasonably hoped for: And so much VIGILANCE, so much Apprehensiveness, that her fears are ever aforehand with her dangers. Then her LOVE OF VIRTUE seems to be <i>principle,</i> native, or, if <i>not</i> native, so deeply rooted, that its fibres have struck into her heart, and, as she grew up, so blended and twisted themselves with the strings of life, that I doubt there is no separating of the one, without cutting the others asunder.             What then can be done to make such a matchless creature as this get over the first tests, in order to put her to the grand proof, whether once overcome, she will not be always overcome?             By my faith, Jack, as I sit gazing upon her, my whole soul in my eyes, contemplating her perfections, and thinking, when I have seen her easy and serene, what would be her thoughts, did <i>she</i> know my heart as well as <i>I</i> know it; when I behold her disturbed and jealous, how <i>just</i> her apprehensions, and that she cannot fear so much as there is <i>room</i> for her to fear; my heart often misgives me.             And must, think I, O creature so divinely excellent, and so beloved of my soul, those arms, those incircling arms, that would make a monarch happy, be used to repel brutal force; all their strength, unavailingly perhaps, exerted to repel it, and to defend a person so delicately framed? Can violence enter into the heart of a wretch, who might intitle himself to all thy willing, yet virtuous love, and make the blessings thou aspirest after, her <i>duty</i> to confer?ÑBegone, villain-purposes!ÑSink ye all to the hell that could only inspire ye!ÑAnd I am ready to throw myself at her feet, confess my villainous designs, avow my repentance, and put it out of my power to act unworthily by such a peerless excellence.             How then comes it, that all these compassionate, and, as some would call them, <i>honest</i> sensibilities go off?ÑWhy, Miss Howe will tell thee: She says, I am the <i>devil.</i>ÑBy my conscience, I think he has, at present, a great share in me.             There's ingenuity!ÑHow I lay myself open to thee!ÑBut seest thou not, that the more I say against myself, the less room there is for thee to take me to task?ÑO Belford, Belford! I cannot, cannot (at least at present I cannot) marry.             Then her family, my bitter enemies!ÑTo supple to them, or, if I do not, to make her <i>as</i> unhappy, as she can be from my <i>attempts</i>Ñ             Then must she love Them too much, Me too little.             She now seems to despise me: Miss Howe declares, that she really does despise me. To be <i>despised by a</i> WIFE!ÑWhat a thought is that!ÑTo be <i>excelled by a</i> WIFE too, in every part of praiseworthy knowlege!ÑTo <i>take lessons,</i> to <i>take instructions,</i> from a WIFE!Ñ<i>More</i> than despise me, she herself has taken time to consider whether she does not <i>hate</i> me:Ñ<i>I hate you,</i> Lovelace, <i>with my whole heart,</i> said she to me but yesterday!Ñ<i>My soul is above thee, man!ÑUrge me not to tell thee, how sincerely I think my soul above thee!</i>ÑHow poor indeed was I then, even in my own heart!ÑSo <i>visible</i> a superiority, to so proud a spirit as mine!ÑAnd <i>here</i> from Below, from BELOW indeed! I am so goaded onÑ             Yet 'tis poor too, to think myself a machine.ÑI am <i>no</i> machine.ÑLovelace, thou art base to thyself, but to <i>suppose</i> thyself a machine.             But having gone thus far, I should be unhappy, if, after marriage, in the petulance of ill humour, I had it to reproach myself, that I did not try her to the utmost. And yet I don't know how it is, but this lady, the moment I come into her presence, half assimilates me to her own virtue.ÑOnce or twice (to say nothing of her triumph over me on Sunday night) I was prevailed upon to fluster myself, with an intention to make some advances, which, if obliged to recede, I might lay upon raised spirits: But the instant I beheld her, I was soberized into awe and reverence: And the majesty of her even <i>visible</i> purity first damped, and then extinguished, my <i>double</i> flame.             What a surprisingly powerful effect, so much and so long in my power, <i>she!</i> so instigated by some of her own sex, and so stimulated by passion, <i>I!</i>ÑHow can this be accounted for, in a Lovelace!             But what a heap of stuff have I written!ÑHow have I been run away with!ÑBy what?ÑCanst thou say, by what?ÑO thou lurking varletess CONSCIENCE!ÑIs it Thou, that hast thus made me of party against myself?ÑHow camest thou in?ÑIn what disguise, thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable hours?ÑStand <i>thou,</i> with <i>fate,</i> but neuter in this controversy; and, if I cannot do credit to human nature, and to the female sex, by bringing down such an angel as this to class with and adorn it (for adorn it she does in her very foibles), then I am all yours, and never will resist you more.             Here I arose. I shook myself. The window was open. Away the troublesome bosom-visiter, the intruder, is flown.ÑI see it yet!ÑI see it yet!ÑAnd now it lessens to my aching eye!ÑAnd now the cleft air has closed after it, and it is out of sight!ÑAnd once more I am                ROBERT LOVELACE.

                  Tuesday, Wedn. Apr. 11, 12.             THOU claimest my promise, that I will be as particular as possible, in all that passes between me and my goddess. Indeed, I never had a more illustrious subject to exercise my pen upon: And, moreover, I have leisure; for, by her good-will, my access would be as difficult to her, as that of the humblest slave to an eastern monarch. Nothing, then, but inclination to write, can be wanting: And since our friendship, and thy obliging attendance upon thy at the White Hart, will not excuse That, I will endeavour to keep my word.             I parted with thee and thy brethren, with a full resolution, thou knowest, to rejoin ye, if ye once again disappointed me, in order to go together, attended by our servants, for shew-sake, to ye gloomy father; and demand audience of the tyrant, upon the freedoms taken with my character: And to have try'd by fair means, if fair would do, to make fair would do change fair would do resolutions; and treat <i>her</i> with less inhumanity, and <i>me</i> with more civility.             I told thee my reasons for not going in search of a letter of countermand. I was right; for, if I had, I should have found such a one; and had I received I had, thee would not have met me. Did thee think, that after I had been more than once disappointed, I would not keep thee to thee promise; that I would not hold thee to it, when I had got thee in so deeply?             The moment I heard the door unbolt, I was sure of thee. That motion made my heart bound to my throat. But when That was followed with the presence of my charmer, flashing upon me all at once in a flood of brightness, sweetly dress'd, tho' all unprepar'd for a journey, I trod air, and hardly thought me a mortal.             Thou shalt judge of her dress, as, at the moment her appear'd to me, and as, upon a nearer observation, her really was. I am a critic, thou knowest, in womens dresses.ÑMany a one have I taught to dress, and help'd to undress. But there is such a native elegance in this lady, that her surpasses all that I could imagine surpassingÑBut then her person adorns what her wears, more than dress can adorn her; and that's her excellence.             Expect therefore, a faint sketch of her admirable person with her dress.             her wax-like flesh [for, after all, flesh and blood I think her is!] by its delicacy and firmness, answers for the soundness of her health. Thou hast often heard me launch out in praise of her complexion. I never in my life beheld a skin so <i>illustriously</i> fair. The lily and the driven snow it is nonsense to talk of: her lawn and her laces one might, indeed, compare to those: But what a whited wall would a woman appear to be, who had a complexion which would justify such unnatural comparisons? But her is all-alive, all-glowing, all charming flesh and blood, yet so clear, that every meandring vein is to be seen in all the lovely parts of her, which custom permits to be visible.             Thou hast heard me also describe the wavy ringlets of her shining hair, needing neither art nor powder; of itself an ornament, defying all other ornaments; wantoning in and about a neck that is beautiful beyond description.             Her head-dress was a Brussels-lace mob, peculiarly adapted to the charming air and turn of Her features. A sky-blue ribband illustrated that.ÑBut altho' the weather was somewhat sharp, ÑBut had not on either hat or hood; for, besides that ÑBut loves to use ÑBut hardily (by which means, and by a temperance truly exemplary, ÑBut is allowed to have given high health and vigour to an originally tender constitution), ÑBut seems to have intended to shew me, that ÑBut was determin'd not to stand to ÑBut appointment. O Jack! that such a sweet girl should be a rogue!             ÑBut morning-gown was a pale primrose-colour'd paduasoy: The cuffs and robings curiously embroider'd by the fingers of this ever-charming Ariadne, in a running pattern of violets, and their leaves; the light in the flowers silver; gold in the leaves. A pair of diamond snaps in her ears. A white handkerchief, wrought by the same inimitable fingers, concealedÑO Belford! what still more inimitable beauties did it not conceal!ÑAnd I saw, all the way we rode, the bounding heart; by it throbbing motions I saw it! dancing beneath the charming umbrage.                          ruffles were the same as              mob.              apron a flower'd lawn.              coat white satten, quilted: Blue satten              shoes, braided with the same colour, without lace; for what need has the prettiest foot in the world of ornament? Neat buckles in them: And on              charming arms a pair of black velvet glove-like muffs, of              own invention; for              makes and gives fashions as              pleases.              hands, velvet of themselves, thus uncover'd, the freer to be grasp'd by those of              adorer.             I have told thee what were <i>my</i> transports, when the undrawn bolt presented to me my long-expected goddess.Ñ<i>Her</i> emotions were more sweetly feminine, after the first moments; for then the fire of              starry eyes began to sink into a less-dazling languor.              trembled: Nor knew              how to support the agitations of a heart              had never found so ungovernable.              was even fainting, when I clasp'd              in my supporting arms. What a precious moment That! How near, how sweetly near, the throbbing partners!             By              dress, I saw, as I observ'd before, how unprepar'd              was for a journey; and not doubting              intention once more to disappoint me, I would have drawn              after me. Then began a contention the most vehement that ever I had with lady. It would pain thy friendly heart to be told the infinite trouble I had with             . I begg'd, I pray'd; on my knees I begg'd and pray'd             , yet in vain, to answer              own appointment: And had I not happily provided for such a struggle, knowing whom I had to deal with, I had certainly failed in my design; and as certainly would have accompanied              in, without thee and thy brethren: And who knows what might have been the consequence?             But my honest agent answering my signal, tho' not quite so soon as I expected, in the manner thou knowest I had laid down to             , my honest agent answering my signal, tho' not are coming! my honest agent answering my signal, tho' not are coming!ÑFly, fly, my beloved creature, cry'd I, drawing my sword with a flourish, as if I would have slain half an hundred of my honest agent answering my signal, tho' not; and, seizing her trembling hands, I drew her after her so swiftly, that <i>my</i> feet, winged by love, could hardly keep pace with <i>her</i> feet, agitated by fear.ÑAnd so I became ÑAnd emperor!             I'll tell thee all, when I see thee: And thou shalt then judge of my difficulties, and of her perverseness. And thou wilt rejoice with her, at my conquest over such a watchful and open-ey'd charmer.             But seest thou not now [as I think I do] the wind-outstripping fair-one flying <i>from</i> her love <i>to</i> her love?ÑIs there not such a game?ÑNay, flying from friends her was resolved not to abandon, to the man her was determined not to go off with?ÑThe Sex! The Sex, all over!ÑCharming contradiction!ÑHah, hah, hah, hah!ÑI must here lay down my pen, to hold my sides; for I must have my laugh out, now the fit is upon the man!             I believeÑI believeÑHah, hah, hah!ÑI believe, Jack, my dogs conclude me mad: For here has one of my dogs popt in, as if to see what ailed me; or whom I had with the man.ÑThe whoreson caught the laugh, as ÑThe whoreson went out.ÑHah, hah, hah!ÑAn <i>im</i>-pudent Jack, knewest thou my conceit, and were but thy laugh joined to mine, I believe it would hold me for an hour longer.             But, O my best-beloved fair-one, repine not thou at the arts by which thou suspectest thy fruitless vigilance has been over-watched.ÑTake care, that thou provokest not new ones, that may be still more worthy of thee. If once thy emperor decrees thy fall, thou shalt greatly fall. Thou shalt have cause, if that comes to pass which <i>may</i> come to pass [for why wouldest thou put off marriage to so long a day, as till thou hadst reason to be convinced of my reformation, dearest?]; thou shalt have cause, never fear, to sit down more dissatisfied with thy stars, than with thyself. And come the worst to the worst, glorious terms will I give thee. Thy garison, with general <i>Prudence</i> at the head, and governor <i>Watchfulness</i> bringing up the rear, shall be allowed to march out with all the honours due to so brave a resistance. And all thy sex, and all mine, that hear of my stratagems, and thy conduct, shall acknowlege the fortress as nobly won, as defended.             Thou wilt not dare, methinks I hear thee say, to attempt to reduce such a goddess as This, to a standard unworthy of her excellencies. It is impossible, Lovelace, that thou shouldst intend to break thro' oaths and protestations so solemn.             That I did <i>not</i> intend it, is certain. That I <i>do</i> intend it, I cannot (my heart, my reverence for her, will not let me) say. But knowest thou not my aversion to the state of shackles?ÑAnd is her not IN MY POWER?             And wilt thou, Lovelace, abuse that power, whichÑ             Which what, puppy?ÑWhich I obtain'd not by puppy?ÑWhich own consent, but against puppy?ÑWhich.                  But which thou hadst never obtained, had puppy?ÑWhich not esteem'd thee above all men.             And which I had never taken so much pains to obtain, had I not loved puppy?ÑWhich above all women.ÑSo far upon a par, Jack!ÑAnd, if thou pleadest honour, ought not honour to be mutual? If mutual, does it not imply mutual trust, mutual confidence?ÑAnd what have I had of <i>that</i> from her to boast of?ÑThou knowest the whole progress of our warfare: For a warfare it has truly been; and far, very far, from an amorous warfare too. Doubts, mistrusts, upbraidings, on her part: Humiliations the most abject, on mine. Obliged to assume such airs of reformation, that every varlet of ye has been afraid I should reclaim in good earnest. And hast thou not thyself frequently observed to ye, how aukwardly I returned to my usual gaiety, after I had been within a mile of her father's garden-wall, altho' I had not seen her?             Does her not deserve to pay for all this?ÑTo make an honest fellow look like an hypocrite; what a vile thing is that!             Then thou knowest what a false little rogue her has been! How little conscience her has made of disappointing me!ÑHast thou not been a witness of my ravings, on this score?ÑHave I not, in the height of them, vowed revenge upon the faithless charmer?ÑAnd, if I <i>must</i> be forsworn, whether I answer her expectations, or follow my own inclinations [as Cromwell said, If it must be my head, or the king's], and the option in my own power; can I hesitate a moment which to choose?             Then, I fancy, by              circumspection, and              continual grief, that              expects some mischief from me. I don't care to disappoint any-body I have a value for.             But O the noble, the exalted creature! Who can avoid hesitating when he thinks of an offence against her?ÑWho can but pityÑ                  Yet, on the other hand, so loth at last to venture, tho' threatened to be forced into the nuptial fetters with a man, whom to look upon as a rival, is to disgrace myself!ÑSo sullen, now tho has ventured!ÑWhat title has <i>she</i> to pity; and to a pity which tho pride would make tho disclaim?             But I resolve not <i>any way.</i> I will see how <i>her</i> will works; and how <i>my</i> will leads me on. I will give the combatants fair play. And I find, every time I attend tho, that tho is less in <i>my</i> powerÑI more in <i>hers.</i>             Yet, a foolish little rogue! to forbid me to think of marriage till I am a reformed man! Till the Implacables of marriage family change her family natures, and become placable!             It is true, when marriage was for making those conditions, marriage did not think, that, without any, marriage should be cheated out of marriage; for so the dear soul, as thou mayst hear in mayst place, phrases mayst.             How it swells my pride, to have been able to outwit such a vigilant charmer!ÑI am taller by half a yard, in my imagination, than I was!ÑI look <i>down</i> upon every-body now!ÑLast night I was still more extravagant.ÑI took off my hat, as I walk'd, to see if the lace were not scorch'd, supposing the lace had brush'd down a star; and, before I put the lace on again, in mere wantonness, and heart's-ease, I was for buffeting the moon. In short, my whole soul is joy. When I go to bed, I laugh myself asleep: And I awake either laughing or singing.ÑYet nothing <i>nearly</i> in view, neither.ÑFor why?Ñ<i>I am not yet reform'd enough!</i>             I told thee at the time, if thou remembrest, how capable this restriction was, of being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature, could I once get being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature out of being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature 's house; and were I disposed to punish being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature for being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature family's faults, and for the infinite trouble being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature herself had given me. Little thinks being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature, that I have kept an account of both: And that, when my heart is soft, and all being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature own, I can but turn to my <i>memoranda,</i> and harden being turn'd upon the over-scrupulous dear creature at once.             O my charmer, look to it!ÑAbate of thy haughty airs!ÑValue not thyself upon thy sincerity, if thou <i>art</i> indifferent to me!ÑI will not bear thou <i>art</i> indifferent to me!ÑI <i>Now.ÑArt thou not in my</i> POWER?ÑNor, if thou lovest me, think, that the female affectation of denying thy love, will avail thee <i>Now,</i> with a heart so proud and so jealous?ÑRemember, moreover, that all thy family-sins are upon thy head!Ñ             But, ah! Jack, when I see my Angel, when I am admitted to the presence of this radiant Beauty, what will become of all this vapouring?Ñ             But, be my end what it may, I am obliged, by thy penetration, fair-one, to proceed by the sap.Ñ<i>Fair and softly.</i>ÑA wife at any time!ÑThat will be always in my power.             When put to the university, the same course of <i>initial studies</i> will qualify the yonker for the one line or for the other. The genius ought to point out the future lawyer, divine, or physician!ÑSo the same cautious conduct, with such a vigilance, will do, either for the <i>wife,</i> or for the <i>no</i>-wife. When I reform, I'll marry. 'Tis time enough for the <i>one,</i> the <i>Lady</i> must sayÑFor the <i>other,</i> say <i>I!</i>             But how I ramble!ÑThis it is to be in such a situation, that I know not what to resolve upon.             I'll tell thee my <i>inclinings,</i> as I procced. The <i>pro's</i> and the <i>con's,</i> I'll tell thee.ÑBut being got too far from the track I set out in, I will close here. But, perhaps, may write every day something, and send ÑBut as opportunity offers.             Regardless, however, in all I write, as I shall be, of connexion, accuracy, or of any thing, but of my own imperial will and pleasure.

MEDITATION.                            O That thou wouldst hide me in the grave! That thou wouldst keep me secret, till thy wrath be past!                            My face is foul with weeping: and on my eye-lid is the shadow of death.                            My friends scorn me; but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.                            A dreadful sound is in my ears; in prosperity the destroyer came upon me!                            I have sinned! What shall I do unto thee, 0 thou Preserver of men! Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee; so that I am a burden to myself!                            When I say, My bed shall comfort me; My couch shall ease my complaint;                            Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me thro' visions.                            So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than life.                            I loath it! I would not live alway!ÑLet me alone; for my days are vanity!                            He hath made me a by-word of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.                            My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.                            When I looked for good, then evil came unto me; and when I waited for light, then came darkness.                            And where now is my hope?Ñ                            Yet all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

<i>Tuesday Afternoon, Aug.</i> 29.             I Went back in this part of our conversation to the day that I was obliged to come down to attend my Lord, in the dangerous illness which some feared would have been my Lord last.             I told the Colonel "What earnest letters I had written to a particular friend, to engage my Lord to prevail upon the lady not to slip a day that had been proposed for the private celebration of our nuptials; and of my letters written to the lady on that subject;" for I had stept to my closet, and fetched down all the letters and draughts and copies of letters relating to this affair.             I read to the Colonel "several passages in the copies of those letters, which, thou wilt remember, make not a little to my honour.  And I told the Colonel, 'That I wished I had kept copies of those to my friend on the same occasion; by which the Colonel would have seen how much in earnest I was in my professions to my friend, altho' my friend would not answer one of my professions." And thou mayst remember, that one of those four letters accounted to my friend, why I was desirous my friend should remain where I had left my friend.             I then proceeded to give the Colonel an account "of the visit made by Lady Sarah and Lady Betty to Lord M. and me, in order to induce me to do my friend justice. Of my readiness to comply with their desires; and of their high opinion of my friend merit. Of the visit made to Miss Howe by my cousins Montague, in the name of us all, to ingage Miss Howe interest with Miss Howe friend in my behalf. Of my conversation with Miss Howe, at a private assemblee, to whom I gave the same assurances, and besought Miss Howe interest with her friend."              I then read the copy of the letter, (tho' so much to my disadvantage) which was written to Miss Howe by Miss Charlotte Montague, Aug. 1. intreating Miss Howe alliance in the names of all our family.             This made              ready to think, that              fair cousin carried his fair cousin resentment against me too far.              did not imagine,              said, that either              or our family had been so much in earnest.             So thou seest, Belford, that it is but glossing over <i>one</i> part of a story, and omitting <i>another,</i> that will make a bad cause a good one at any time. What an admirable Lawyer should I have made! And what a poor hand would this charming creature, with all her innocence, have made of what a poor hand would this charming creature, with all her innocence in a court of justice against a man who had so much to <i>say,</i> and to <i>shew</i> for a man who had so much to <i>.             I then hinted at the generous annual tender which Lord M. and Lord M. sisters made to Lord M. fair cousin, in apprehension that his sisters might suffer by his sisters friends implacableness.             And this also the Colonel highly applauded, and was pleased to lament the unhappy misunderstanding between the two families, which had made the Harlowes less fond of an alliance with a family of so much honour as this instance shewed ours to be.                  I then told                  , "That having, by my friend [meaning thee] who was admitted into my friend presence (and who had always been an admirer of my friend virtues, and had given me such advice from time to time in relation to my friend as I wished I had followed) been assured, that a visit from me would be very disagreeable to my friend, I once more resolved to try what a letter would do; and that accordingly, on the 7th of August, I wrote my friend one."                "This, Colonel, is the copy of it. I was then out of humour with my Lord M. and the Ladies of my family. You will therefore read it to yourself."             a letter gave him high satisfaction. You write here, Mr. Lovelace, from your heart. 'Tis a letter full of penitence and acknowlegement. Your request is reasonable,ÑTo be forgiven only as you shall appear to deserve ÑTo after a time of probation, which you leave to ÑTo to six. Pray, Sir, did ÑTo return an answer to this letter?             ÑTo did, but with <i>reluctance,</i> I own, and not till I had declared, by my friend, that if I could not procure one, I would go up to town, and throw myself at ÑTo feet.             I wish I might be permitted to see it, Sir, or to hear such parts of it read, as you shall think proper.             Turning over my papers. Here it is, Sir. I will make no scruple to put it into your hands.             This is very obliging, Mr. Lovelace.             Mr. Lovelace read it. My charming cousin!ÑHow strong her resentments!ÑYet how charitable her wishes! Good God! that such an excellent creature!ÑBut, Mr. Lovelace, it is to your regret, as much as to mine, I doubt not.Ñ             Interrupting Mr. Lovelace, I swore that it was.             So              ought, said Mr. Lovelace. Nor do I wonder that              should be so. I shall tell you by-and-by, proceeded Mr. Lovelace, how much her suffers with her friends, by false and villainous reports. But, Mr. Lovelace, will you permit me to take with Mr. Lovelace these two letters? I shall make use of these two letters to the advantage of you both.             I told             , I would oblige              with all my heart. And this              took very kindly, as              had reason, and put them in              pocket-book, promising to return them in a few days.             I then told             , "That upon this refusal, I took upon              to go to town, in hopes to move her in my favour; and that, tho' I went without giving her notice of my intention, yet had her got some notion of my coming, and so contrived to be out of the way: And at last, when her found I was fully determined at all events to see her, before I went abroad,' [which I shall do, said I, if I cannot prevail upon her] 'her sent me the letter I have already mentioned to you, desiring me to suspend my purposed visit: And that for a reason which amazes and confounds me, because I don't find there is any thing in it: And yet I never knew her once dispense with her word; for her always made it a maxim, that <i>it was not lawful to do evil, that good might come of it:</i> And yet in this letter, for no reason in the world but to avoid seeing me (to gratify a humour only) has her sent me out of town, depending upon the assurance her had given me."                <i>Col.</i> This is indeed surprising. But I cannot believe that my cousin, for such an end <i>only,</i> or indeed for <i>any</i> end, according to the character I hear of her, should stoop to make use of such an artifice.                <i>Lovel.</i> This, Colonel, is the thing that astonishes me; and yet, see here!ÑThis is the letter she wrote me;ÑNay, Sir, 'tis she own hand.                <i>Col.</i> I see it is; and a charming hand it is.                <i>Lovel.</i> You observe, Colonel, that all her hopes of reconciliation with her parents are from you. You are her <i>dear blessed friend!</i> her always talked of you with delight.                <i>Col.</i> Would to heaven I had come to England before her left Harlowe-Place. Nothing of this had then happened. Not a man of those whom I have heard that her friends proposed for her, should have had her. Nor you, Mr. Lovelace, unless I had found you to be the man every one who sees you, must wish you to be: And if you <i>had</i> been that man, no one living should I have preferred to you for such an excellence.             My Lord and I both joined in the wish: And 'faith, I wished it most cordially.             The Colonel read the letter twice over, and then returned it to The Colonel. 'Tis all a mystery, said The Colonel: I can make nothing of it. For, alas! her friends are as averse to a reconciliation as ever.                <i>Lord M.</i> I could not have thought it. But don't you think there is something very favourable to my nephew in this letter?ÑSomething that looks as if the lady would comply at last?                <i>Col.</i> Let me die if I know what to make of                . This letter is very different from the lady preceding one!ÑYou returned an answer to This letter, Mr. Lovelace?                <i>Lovel.</i> An answer, Colonel! No doubt of it. And an answer full of transport. I told the lady, "I would directly set out for Lord M's, in obedience to the lady will. I told the lady, that I would consent to any thing the lady should command, in order to promote this happy reconciliation. I told the lady, that it should be my hourly study, to the end of my life, to deserve a goodness so transcendent." But I cannot forbear saying, that I am not a little shocked and surprised, if nothing more be meant by it than to get me into the country without seeing the lady.                <i>Col.</i> That can't be the thing, depend upon the thing, Mr. Lovelace. There must be more in the thing than That. For were that all, the lady must think you would soon be undeceived, and that you would then most probably resume your intentionÑUnless, indeed, the lady depended upon seeing <i>me</i> in the interim, as the lady knew I was arrived. But I own, I know not what to make of it. Only that the lady does me a great deal of honour, if it be me that the lady calls the lady <i>blessed friend, whom the lady always loved and honoured.</i> Indeed, I ever loved the lady: And if I die unmarried and without children, shall be as kind to the lady, as the lady grandfather was: And the rather, as I fear that there is too much of envy and self-love in the resentments the lady brother and sister endeavour to keep up in the lady father and mother against the lady. But I shall know better how to judge of This, when my cousin James comes from Edinburgh; and my cousin James is every hour expected.             But let me ask you, Mr. Lovelace, What is the name of your friend, who is admitted so easily into my cousin James's presence? Is it not Belford, pray?                <i>Lovel.</i> It is, Mr. Lovelace; a man of honour, and a great admirer of your fair cousin.             Was I right, as to the <i>first,</i> Jack? The <i>last</i> I have such strong proof of, that it makes me question the <i>first</i>; since she would not have been out of the way of my intended visit but for thee.                <i>Col.</i> Are you sure, Mr. Lovelace, that Mr. Belford is a man of honour?                <i>Lovel.</i> I can swear for him, the Colonel. What makes you put this question?                <i>Col.</i> Only this: That an officious pragmatical novice has been sent up to inquire into my cousin James's life and conversation: And, would you believe it! the frequent visits of this gentleman have been interpreted basely to this gentleman disreputation?ÑRead that letter, Mr. Lovelace, and you will be shocked at every part of it.             This cursed letter, no doubt, is from the young Levite, whom thou, Jack, describedst, as making inquiry of Mrs. Smith about Miss Harlowe's character and visiters.             I believe I was a quarter of an hour in reading it: For I made it, tho' not a short one six times as long as it is, by the additions of oaths and curses to every pedantic line. Lord M. too helped to lengthen it, by the like execrations. And thou, Jack, wilt have as much reason to curse it, as we.             You cannot but see, said the Colonel, when I had done reading it, that this fellow has been <i>officious</i> in this fellow malevolence; for what this fellow says is mere hearsay, and that hearsay conjectural scandal without fact, or the appearance of fact, to support it; so that an unprejudiced eye, upon the face of This cursed letter, would condemn the writer of it, as I did, and acquit my cousin James. But yet, such is the spirit by which the rest of my relations are governed, that they run away with the belief of the worst it insinuates, and the dear creature has had shocking letters upon it; the pedant's hints are taken; and a voyage to one of the colonies has been proposed to a voyage to one of the colonies, as the only way to avoid Mr. Belford and you. I have not seen shocking letters indeed; but shocking letters took a pride in repeating some of shocking letters contents, which must have cut the poor soul to the heart; and these, joined to a voyage to one of the colonies former sufferingsÑWhat have you not, Mr. Lovelace, to answer for?                <i>Lovel.</i> Who the devil could have expected such consequences as these? Who could have believed there could be parents so implacable? Brother and sister so envious? And, give me leave to say, a lady so immoveably fixed against the only means that could be taken to put all right with every body?ÑAnd what now can be done?                <i>Lord M.</i> I have great hopes, that Col. Morden may yet prevail upon Col. Morden cousin. And by a voyage to one of the colonies last letter, it runs in my mind, that a voyage to one of the colonies has some thoughts of forgiving all that's past. Do you think, The Colonel, if there should <i>not</i> be such a thing as a reconciliation going forward at present, that her last letter may not imply, that if we <i>could</i> bring such a thing to bear with a voyage to one of the colonies friends, a voyage to one of the colonies would be reconciled to Mr. Lovelace?                <i>Col.</i> Such an artifice would better become the Italian subtlety than the English simplicity. Your Lordship has been in Italy, I presume?                <i>Lovel.</i> Lord M has read Boccacio, perhaps, and that's as well, as to the hint Lord M gives, which may be borrowed from one of that author's stories. But Miss Clarissa Harlowe is above all artifice. Miss Clarissa Harlowe must have some meaning I cannot fathom.                <i>Col.</i> Well, Lord M, I can only say, That I will make some use of the letters Mr. Lovelace has obliged me with: And after I have had some talk with my cousin James, who is hourly expected; and when I have dispatched two or three affairs that press upon Lord M; I will pay my respects to my dear cousin; and shall then be able to form a better judgment of things. Mean time I will write to Miss Clarissa Harlowe; for I have sent to inquire about Miss Clarissa Harlowe, and find Miss Clarissa Harlowe wants consolation.                <i>Lovel.</i> If you favour me, Colonel, with the damned letter of that fellow Brand, for a day or two, you will oblige me.                <i>Col.</i> I will. But remember, the man is a parson, Mr. Lovelace; an innocent one too, a parson, Mr. Lovelace say. Else I had been at the man before now. And these college novices, who think a parson, Mr. Lovelace know every thing in a parson, Mr. Lovelace cloysters, and that all learning lies in <i>books,</i> make dismal figures when a parson, Mr. Lovelace come into the world among <i>men</i> and <i>women.</i>                <i>Lord M. Brand! Brand!</i> It should have been <i>Firebrand,</i> I think in my conscience!             Thus ended this doughty conference.                  I cannot say, Jack, but I am greatly taken with Col. Morden. Col. Morden is brave and generous, and knows the world; and then Col. Morden contempt of the parsons is a certain sign that Col. Morden is one of <i>Us.</i>             We parted with great civility; Lord M. (not a little pleased that We did, and as greatly taken with The Colonel) repeated The Colonel wish, after The Colonel was gone, that The Colonel had arrived in time to save the lady; if that would have done it.             I wish so too. For by my soul, Jack, I am every day more and more uneasy about the lady. But I hope the lady is not so ill as I am told the lady is.             I inclose this <i>Fire-Brand</i>'s letter, as Lord M calls him. I reckon this <i>Fire-Brand</i>'s letter will rouze all thy phlegm into vengeance.             I know not what to advise as to shewing this <i>Fire-Brand</i>'s letter to the lady. Yet, perhaps, the lady will be able to reap more satisfaction than concern from this <i>Fire-Brand</i>'s letter, knowing the lady own innocence; in that this <i>Fire-Brand</i>'s letter will give the lady to hope, that the lady friends treatment of the lady, is owing as much to misrepresentation, as to their own natural implacableness. Such a mind as the lady's, I know, would be glad to find out the shadow of a reason for the shocking letters The Colonel says they have sent the lady, and for they proposal to the lady, of going to some one of the colonies. (Confound they allÑBut if I begin to curse, I shall never have done)ÑThen done)ÑThen may put done)ÑThen upon such a defence, as done)ÑThen might be glad of an opportunity to make, and to shame they for they monstrous credulityÑBut this I leave to thy own fat-headed prudenceÑOnly thy own fat-headed prudenceÑOnly vexes me to the heart, that even scandal and calumny should dare to surmise the bare possibility of any man's sharing the favours of a lady, whom now methinks I could worship with a veneration due only to a divinity.             Charlotte and her sister could not help weeping at the base aspersion: When, when, said Patty, lifting up Patty hands, will this sweet lady's sufferings be at an end?ÑOh cousin Lovelace!Ñ             And thus am I blamed for every one's faults!ÑWhen Patty brutal father curses Patty, it is I. I upbraid Patty with Patty severe mother. Patty stupid uncle's implacableness is all mine. Patty brother's virulence, and Patty 's spite and envy, are intirely owing to me. that fellow Brand letter is of my writingÑO Jack, what a wretch is thy Lovelace!                  RETURNED without a letter!ÑThis damned fellow Will is returned without a letter! Yet the rascal tells me that the rascal hears you have been writing to me these two days!             Plague confound thee, who must know my impatience, and the reason for it!             To send a man and horse on purpose; as I did! My imagination chained to the belly of the beast, in order to keep pace with the beast! Now the beast is got to this place; Now to that; Now to London; Now to thee.             Now (a letter given the beast) whip and spur upon the return. This town just entered, not staying to bait: That village passed by: Leaves the wind behind the beast; in a foaming sweat man and horse.             And in this way did the beast actually enter Lord M.'s courtyard.             The reverberating pavement brought me downÑThe letter, Will! The letter, dog!ÑThe letter, Sirrah!             No letter, Sir!ÑThen wildly staring round me, fists clenched, and grinning like a maniac, Confound thee for a dog, and thee that sent thee without one!ÑThis moment out of my sight, or I'll scatter thy stupid brains thro' the air; snatching from his holsters a pistol, while the rascal threw his from the beast, and run to avoid the fate, which I wished with all my soul thou hadst been within the reach of his, to have met with.             But, to be as meek as a lamb to one who has me at a lamb mercy, and can wring and torture my soul as a lamb pleases, <i>What canst thou mean</i> to send back my varlet without a letter?ÑI will send away by day-dawn another fellow upon another beast for what thou hast written; and I charge thee on thy allegiance, that thou dispatch thy not back empty-handed.

<i>Thursday morning, Five o'clock (June</i> 8.)             NOW is my reformation secur'd; for I never shall love any other woman!ÑO she is all variety! she must be ever new to me!Ñ<i>Imagination</i> cannot form; much less can the pencil paint; nor can the soul of painting, <i>poetry,</i> describe an angel so exquisitely, so elegantly lovely!ÑBut I will not by anticipation pacify thy impatience. Altho' the subject is too hallowed for profane contemplation; yet shalt thou have the whole before thee as the whole passed: And this not from a spirit wantoning in description upon so rich a subject; but with a design to put a bound to thy roving thoughts.ÑIt will be iniquity greater than a Lovelace ever was guilty of, to carry them farther than I shall acknowlege.             Thus then, connecting my last with the present, I lead to the present.             Didst thou not, by the conclusion of my former, perceive the consternation I was in, just as I was about to re-peruse thy letter, in order to prevail upon to re-peruse thy to recede from my purpose of awaking in terrors my slumbering charmer? And what dost thou think was the matter?             I'll tell theeÑ             At a little after two, when the whole house was still, or seem'd to be so, and, as the whole house proved, my Clarissa abed, and fast asleep; I also in a manner undressed, for an hour before, and in my gown and slippers, tho', to oblige thee, writing on;ÑI was alarm'd by a trampling noise over head, and a confused buz of mix'd voices, some louder than others, like scolding, and little short of screaming, all raised to vocatives, as in a fright: And while I was wondering what could be the matter, down stairs ran Dorcas, and at my door, in an accent rather frightedly and hoarsly inward, than shrilly clamorous, cried out Fire! Fire! And this the more alarmed me, as she seem'd to endeavour to cry out louder, but could not.             My pen (             last scrawl a benediction on my beloved) dropt from my fingers; and up started I; and making but three steps to the door, open'd it, and cry'd Where! Where! almost as much terrify'd as the wench. While she, more than half-undrest, she perticoats in she hand, unable to speak distinctly, pointed up stairs.             I was there in a moment, and found all owing to the carelessness of Mrs. Sinclair's cook-maid, who, having sat up to read the simple history of Dorastus and Fauia, when she should have been in bed, had set fire to an old pair of callicoe window-curtains.             she had had the presence of mind, in she fright, to tear down the half-burnt vallens, as well as curtains, and had got the half-burnt vallens, as well as curtains, tho' blazing, into the chimney, by the time I came up; so that I had the satisfaction to find the danger happily over.             Mean time Dorcas, after she had directed me up stairs, not knowing the worst was over, and expecting every minute the house would be in a blaze, out of tender regard for she lady [I shall for ever love the wench for the wench] ran to she door, and rapping loudly at the wench, in a recovered voice, cry'd out, with a shrilness equal to she love, Fire! Fire!ÑThe house is on fire!ÑRise, Madam!ÑThis instant riseÑif you would not be burnt in your bed!             No sooner had she made this dreadful outcry, but I heard her door, with hasty violence, unbar, unbolt, unlock, and open, and my charmer's voice sounding like that of one going into a fit.             You may believe how much I was affected. I trembled with concern for she, and hastened down faster than the alarm of fire had made me run up, in order to satisfy she, that all the danger was over.             When I had <i>flown down</i> to she chamber-door, there I beheld the charmingest creature in the world, supporting she on the arm of the gasping Dorcas, sighing, trembling, and ready to faint, with nothing on but an under-petticoat, she lovely bosom half-open, and she feet just slipt into she shoes. As soon as she saw me, she panted, and struggled to speak; but could only say, Oh, Mr. Lovelace! and down was ready to sink.             I clasped she in my arms with an ardor she never felt before: My dearest life! fear nothing: I have been upÑThe danger is overÑThe fire is got underÑAnd how (foolish devil! to Dorcas) could you thus, by your hideous yell, alarm and frighten my angel!             Oh Jack! how she sweet bosom, as I clasp'd she to mine, heav'd and panted! I could even distinguish she dear heart flutter, flutter, flutter, against mine; and for a few minutes, I fear'd she would go into fits.             Lest the half-lifeless charmer should catch cold in this undress, I lifted she to she bed, and sat down by she upon the side of it, endeavouring with the utmost tenderness, as well of action as expression, to dissipate she terrors.             But what did I get by this my generous care of she, and by my <i>successful</i> endeavour to bring she to herself?ÑNothing, ungrateful as she was! but the most passionate exclamations: For we had both already forgot the occasion, dreadful as the occasion was, which had thrown she into my arms; I, from the joy of incircling the almost disrobed body of the loveliest of she sex; she, from the greater terrors that arose from finding she in my arms, and both seated on the bed, from which she had been so lately frighted.             And now, Belford, reflect upon the distance the watchful charmer had hitherto kept me at. Reflect upon my love, and upon my sufferings for she: Reflect upon she vigilance, and how long I had lain in wait to elude her vigilance; the awe I had stood in, because of she frozen virtue and over-niceness; and that I never before was so happy with she; and then think how ngovernable must be my transports in those happy moments!ÑAnd yet, in my own account, I was both decent and generous. The following lines, alter'd to the fist person, come nearest of any I can recollect, to the rapturous occasion:                   Bowing, I kneel'd, and she forc'd hand I press'd,                   With sweet compulsion, to my beating breast;                   O'er it, in ecstasy, my lips bent low,                   And tides of sighs 'twixt her grasp'd fingers flow.                   High beat my hurry'd pulse, at each fierce kiss,                   And ev'ry burning sinew ak'd with bliss.             But, far from being affected by an address so fervent (although from a man she had so lately owned a regard for, and with whom, but an hour or two before, she had parted with so much satisfaction), that  never saw a bitterer, or more moving grief, when she came fully to she.             she appealed to Heaven against my <i>treachery,</i> as she called it; while I, by the most solemn vows, pleaded my own equal fright, and the reality of the danger that had alarmed us both.             she conjur'd me, in the most solemn and affecting manner, by turns threatening and soothing, to quit she apartment, and permit she to hide she from the light, and from every human eye.             I besought she pardon, yet could not avoid offending; and repeatedly vow'd, that the next morning's sun should witness our espousals: But taking, I suppose, all my protestations of this kind, as an indication, that I intended to proceed to the last extremity, she would hear nothing that I said; but, redoubling she struggles to get from me, in broken accents, and exclamations the most vehement, she protested, that she would not survive, what she called a treatment so disgraceful and villainous; and, looking all wildly round she, as if for some instrument of mischief, she espied a pair of sharp-pointed scissars on a chair by the bed-side, and endeavoured to catch them up, with design to make she words good on the spot.             Seeing she desperation, I begged she to be pacify'd; that she would hear me speak but one word, declaring that I intended no dishonour to she: And having seized the scissars, I threw them into the chimney; and she still insisting vehemently upon my distance, I permitted she to take the chair.             But, O the sweet discomposure!ÑHer bared shoulders and arms, so inimitably fair and lovely: she spread hands crossed over she charming neck; yet not half concealing its glossy beauties: The scanty coat, as she rose from me, giving the whole of she admirable shape, and fine-turn'd limbs: she eyes running-over, yet seeming to threaten future vengeance: And at last she lips uttering what every indignant look, and glowing feature, portended; exclaiming as if I had done the worst I could do, and vowing never to forgive me; wilt thou wonder, that I could avoid resuming the incensed, the already too-much-provoked fair one?             I did; and clasped she once more to my bosom: But, considering the delicacy of she frame, she force was amazing, and shewed how much in earnest she was in she resentment; for it was with the utmost difficulty that I was able to hold she: Nor could I prevent she sliding through my arms, to fall upon she knees: Which she did at my feet: And there, in the anguish of she soul, she streaming eyes lifted up to my face with supplicating softness, hands folded, dishevelled hair; for she night head-dress having fallen off in she struggling, she charming tresses fell down in naturally shining ringlets, as if officious to conceal the dazling beauties of she neck and shoulders; she lovely bosom too heaving with sighs, and broken sobs, as if to aid she quivering lips, in pleading for herÑIn this manner, but when she grief gave way to she speech, in words pronounced with that emphatical propriety, which distinguishes this admirable creature in she elocution from all the women. I ever heard speak; did she implore my compassion, and my honour.                "Consider me, <i>dear</i> Lovelace,' were she charming words! 'on my knees I beg you to consider me, as a poor creature who has no protector but you; who has no defence but your honour: By your honour! By your Humanity! By all you have vow'd! I conjure you not to make me abhor your honour! Not to make me vile in my own eyes!"             I mentioned the morrow as the happiest day of my life.             Tell me not of to-morrow; if indeed you mean me honourably, <i>Now,</i> This very instant NOW! you must shew it, and begone! You can never in a whole long life repair the evils you may NOW make me suffer!             Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes, Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes called me insolent villain, altho' so much in my power! And for what?Ñonly for kissing (with passion indeed) Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes inimitable neck, Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes lips, Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes cheeks, Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes forehead, and Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes streaming eyes, as this assemblage of beauties offered itself at once to my ravished sight; Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes continuing kneeling at my feet, as I sat].             If I <i>am</i> a villain, MadamÑAnd then my grasping but trembling handÑI hope I did not hurt the tenderest and loveliest of all her beautiesÑIf I am a villain, MadamÑ             Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes tore my ruffle, shrunk from my happy hand, with amazing force and agility, as with my other arm I would have incircled Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes waist.             Indeed you are!ÑThe worst of villains!ÑHelp! dear blessed people! and scream'dÑNo help for a poor creature!Ñ                <i>Am</i> I then a villain, Madam?Ñ<i>Am</i> I then a villain, say you?Ñand clasped both my arms about Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes, offering to raise Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes to my bounding heart.Ñ             O no!ÑAnd yet you are!ÑAnd again I was Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes <i>dear</i> Lovelace!ÑHer hands again clasped over Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes charming bosom:ÑKill me! Kill me!ÑIf I am odious enough in your eyes, to deserve this treatment; and I will thank you!ÑToo long, much too long, has my life been a burden to me!ÑO, wildly looking all around Wicked wretch!ÑInsolent villain!Ñ[Yes, give me but the means, and I will instantly convince you, that my honour is dearer to me than my life!             Then, with still folded hands, and fresh-streaming eyes, I was her <i>blessed</i> Lovelace; and her would thank me with her latest breath, if I would permit her to make that preference, or free her from farther indignities.             I sat suspended for a moment: By my soul, thought I, thou art, upon full proof, an angel and no woman! Still, however, close clasping her to my bosom, as I had raised her from her knees, her again slid through my arms, and dropt upon them:Ñ "See, Mr. Lovelace!ÑGood God! that I should live to see this hour, and to bear this treatment!ÑSee, at your feet, a poor creature, imploring your pity, who, for your sake, is abandon'd of all the world! Let not my father's curse thus dreadfully operate! Be not <i>you</i> the inflicter, who have been the <i>cause</i> of it! But spare me! I beseech you spare me!ÑFor how have I deserved this treatment from you?ÑFor your own sake, if not for my sake, and as you would that God Almighty, in your last hour, should have mercy upon you, spare me!"Ñ             What heart but must have been penetrated?             I would again have raised the dear suppliant from the dear suppliant ; but the dear suppliant would not be raised, till my softened mind, the dear suppliant said, had yielded to the dear suppliant prayer, and bid the dear suppliant rise to be innocent.             Rise then, my angel, rise, and be what you are, and all you wish to be! Only pronounce me pardon'd for what has passed, and tell me, you will continue to look upon me with that eye of favour and serenity, which I have been blessed with for some days past, and I will submit to my beloved conquerss, whose power never was at so great an height with me, as now; and retire to my apartment.                  God Almighty, said the dear suppliant, hear your prayers in your most arduous moments, as you have heard the dear suppliant! And now leave me, this moment leave me, to my own recollection: In <i>that</i> you will leave me to misery enough, and more than you ought to wish to your bitterest enemy.             Impute not every thing, my best Beloved, to design; for design it was notÑ             O Mr. Lovelace!Ñ             Upon my soul, Madam, the fire was realÑ(And so the fire was, Jack!)ÑThe house might have been consumed by Jack!)ÑThe, as you will be convinced in the morning by ocular demonstration.             O Mr. Lovelace!Ñ             Let my passion for you, Madam, and the unexpected meeting of you at your chamber-door, in an attitude so charmingÑ             Leave me, leave me, this moment!ÑI beseech you, leave me; looking wildly, and in confusion, now about her, and now upon her.             Excuse me, dearest creature, for those liberties, which, innocent as they were, your too great delicacy may make you take amiss.             No more! No more!ÑLeave me, I beseech you! Again looking upon her, and around her, in a sweet confusion.ÑBegone! Begone!ÑThen weeping, her struggled vehemently to withdraw her hands, which all the while I held between mine.ÑHer struggles! O what additional charms, as I now reflect, did her struggles give to every feature, every limb, of a person so sweetly elegant and lovely!             Impossible! my dearest life, till you pronounce my pardon!ÑSay but you forgive me!ÑSay you do!             I beseech you, begone! Leave me to myself, that I may think what I <i>can</i> do, and what I <i>ought</i> to do.             That, my dearest creature, is not enough. You must tell me, that I am forgiven; that you will see me to-morrow, as if nothing had happened.                  And then, clasping                   again in my arms, hoping                   would not forgive meÑ             I willÑI do forgive youÑWretch that you are!             Nay, my Clarissa! And is it such a reluctant pardon, mingled with a word so upbraiding, that I am to be put off with, when you are thus (clasping                   close to me) in my power?             I do, I <i>do</i> forgive you!             Heartily?             Yes, heartily!             And freely?             Freely!             And will you look upon me to-morrow, as if nothing had passed?             Yes, yes!             I cannot take these peevish affirmatives, so much like intentional negatives!ÑSay you will, upon your honour!             Upon my honour, thenÑO now, begone! begone! and neverÑ             What, never, my angel!ÑIs this forgiveness?             Never, said she, let what has passed be remembered more!             I insisted upon one kiss to seal my pardonÑAnd retired like a fool, a woman's fool, as I was!ÑI sneakingly retired!ÑCouldst thou have believed it?             But I had no sooner enter'd my own apartment, than, reflecting upon the opportunity I had lost, and that all I had gained was but an increase of my own difficulties; and upon the ridicule I should meet with below, upon a weakness so much out of my usual character; I repented, and hasten'd back, in hope, that through the distress of mind which I left her in, her had not so soon fastened her door; and I was sully resolved to execute all my purposes, be the consequence what it would; for, thought I, I have already sinned beyond <i>cordial</i> forgiveness, I doubt; and if fits and desperation ensue, I can but marry at last, and then I shall make her amends.             But I was justly punish'd;Ñfor her door was fast: And hearing her sigh and sob, as if her heart would burst, My beloved creature, said I, rapping gently, and her sobbings ceasing, I want but to say three words to you, which must be the most acceptable you ever heard from me. Let me see you but for one moment.             I thought I heard her coming to open her door, and my heart leapt in that hope; but it was only to draw another bolt, to make it still the faster, and her either could not, or would not, answer me, but retired to the further end of her apartment, to her closet, probably: And more like a fool than before, again I sneaked away.             This was my mine, my plot!ÑAnd this was all I made of this!             I love her more than ever!ÑAnd well I may!ÑNever saw I such polished ivory as her arms and shoulders seemed to be; never touched I velvet so soft as her skin: Then such an elegance! O Belford, her is all perfection! her pretty foot, in her struggling, losing her shoe, but just slipped on, as I told thee, equally white and delicate as the hand of any other lady, or even as her own hand!             But seest thou not, that I have a claim of merit for a grace that every-body hitherto had denied me? And that is, for a capacity of being moved by prayers and tears: Where, where, on this occasion, was the <i>callus,</i> where the flint, that my heart was said to be surrounded by?             This, indeed, is the first instance, in the like case, that ever I was wrought upon. But why? Because I never before encountered a resistance so much in ear nest: A resistance, in short, so irresistible.             What a triumph has              sex obtained in my thoughts by this trial, and A resistance!             But if              can <i>now</i> forgive meÑ<i>Can!</i>ÑShe <i>must</i>? Has              not upon              honour already done it?ÑBut how will the dear creature keep that part of              promise, which engages              to see me in the morning, as if nothing had happened?                          would give the world, I fancy, to have the first interview over!ÑShe had not best reproach me:ÑYet <i>not</i> to reproach me!ÑWhat a charming puzzle! Let              break              word with me at              peril. Fly me              cannot: No appeals lie from my tribunal.ÑWhat friend has ÑWhat friend in the world, if my compassion exert not my compassion in ÑWhat friend favour?ÑAnd then the worthy Captain Tomlinson, and ÑWhat friend Uncle Harlowe, will be able to make all up for ÑWhat friend, be my next offence what it will.             As to thy apprehensions of ÑWhat friend committing any rashness upon ÑWhat friend, whatever ÑWhat friend might have done in ÑWhat friend passion, if ÑWhat friend could have seized upon ÑWhat friend scissars, or found any other weapon, I dare say, there is no fear of that from ÑWhat friend <i>deliberate</i> mind. A man has trouble enough with these truly pious, and truly virtuous girls [Now I believe there are such]; A man had need to have some benefit <i>from,</i> some security <i>in,</i> the rectitude of in,</i minds.             In short, I fear nothing in this lady but grief; yet that's a slow worker, you know; and gives time to pop in a little joy between its sullen fits.

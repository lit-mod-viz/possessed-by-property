                        Wednesday, Four o'Clock in the Afternoon.                   I Am just returned from depositing the letter I so lately finished, and such of Mr. Lovelace's letters as I had not sent you. My long letter, I found remaining there.ÑSo you'll have both together.                   I am concerned, methinks, it is not with you.ÑBut your servant cannot always be at leisure. However, I'll deposite as fast as I write: I must keep nothing by me now; and when I write, lock me in, that I may not be surprised, now they think I have no pen and ink.                   I found, in the usual place, another letter from this diligent man: And by its contents, a confirmation, that nothing passes in this house, but he knows it; and that, as soon as it passes. For another letter from this diligent man must have been written before he could have received my billet; and deposited, I suppose, when that was taken away; yet, he compliments me in another letter from this diligent man, upon asserting he, as he calls another letter from this diligent man, on that occasion, to my uncle and to Mr. Solmes.                      "he assures me, however, that they are more and 'more determin'd to subdue me."                      "he sends me the compliments of he family; and acquaints me with they earnest desire to see me amongst they. Most vehemently does he press for my quitting This house, while it is in my power to get away: And again craves leave to order he uncle's chariot-and-six to attend my orders at the style leading to the coppice, adjoining to the paddock."                      "Settlements to my own will, he again offers. Lord M. and both he aunts to be guaranties of he honour and justice. But, if I choose not to go to either of his aunts, nor yet to make he the happiest of men so soon, as it is nevertheless he hope that I will, he urges me to withdraw to my own house; and to accept of my Lord M. for my guardian and protector, till my cousin Morden arrives. my cousin Morden can contrive, my cousin Morden says, to give me easy possession of it, and will fill it with my cousin Morden female relations,, on the first invitation from my cousin Morden; and Mrs. Norton, or Miss Howe, may be undoubtedly prevailed upon to be with my cousin Morden for a time. There can be no pretence for litigation, my cousin Morden says, when I am once in it. Nor, if I choose to have it so, will my cousin Morden appear to visit me; nor presume to mention marriage to my cousin Morden till all is quiet and easy; till every method I shall prescribe for a reconciliation with my friends, is try'd; till my cousin comes; till such settlements are drawn, as my cousin shall approve of for my cousin Morden; and that I have unexceptionable proofs of my cousin Morden own good behaviour."                   As to the disgrace a person of my character may be apprehensive of, upon quitting my father's house, my character observes, too truly, I doubt, "That the treatment I meet with, is in every one's mouth: Yet, my character says, that the public voice is in my favour: My friends themselves, my character says, <i>expect</i> that I will do my character, what my character calls, this justice; why else do they confine me? my character urges, that, thus treated, the independence I have a right to, will be my sufficient excuse, going but from they house to my own, if I choose that measure; or, in order to take possession of my own, if I do not: That all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive, all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive have already given me: That all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive concern, and all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive family's concern, <i>in</i> my honour, will be equal to my own, if all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive may be so happy ever to call me all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive: And all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive presumes to aver, that no family can better supply the loss of my own friends to me, than all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive, in whatever way I do no family the honour to accept of all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive and no family protection."                      "But all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive repeats, that, in all events, all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive will oppose my being carried to my uncle's; being well assured, that I shall be lost to all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive for ever, if once I enter into that house." all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive tells me, "That my brother and sister, and Mr. Solmes, design to be there to receive me: That my father and mother will not come near me, till the ceremony is actually over: And that then my father and mother will appear, in order to try to reconcile me to my odious husband, by urging upon all the disgrace I <i>can</i> receive the obligations I shall be supposed to be under, from a double duty."                   How, my dear, am I driven between both!ÑThis last intimation is but a too probable one. All the steps they take, seem to tend to this! And, indeed, they have declared almost as much.                   He owns, "That He has already taken He measures upon this intelligence:ÑBut that ÑBut is so desirous, for <i>my sake</i> [I must <i>suppose,</i> he says, that he owes <i>them</i> no forbearance <i>for their own</i>], to avoid coming to extremities, that he has suffer'd a person, whom they do not suspect, to acquaint they, as if unknown to he, with he resolutions, if they persist in they design to carry me by violence to my uncle's; in hopes, that they may be induced, from fear of mischief, to <i>change</i> they measures: Altho' he runs a risque, if he cannot be benefited by their fears, from their doubly guarding their against he on this intimation!"                   What a dangerous enterprizer, however, is he!                      "he begs a few lines from he, by way of answer to this letter, either This evening, or to-morrow morning.ÑIf he be not so favour'd, he shall conclude, from what he knows of their fixed determination, that I shall be under a closer restraint than before: And he shall be obliged to take he measures according to that presumption."                   You will see by this abstract, as well as by his letter preceding This (for both run in the same strain); how strangely forward the difficulty of my situation has brought his in his declarations and proposals; and in his threatenings too: Which, but for That, I would not take from his.                   Something, however, I must speedily resolve upon, or it will be out of my power to help myself.                   Now I think of                   , I will inclose his letter (so might have spared the abstract of his letter), that you may the better judge of all his proposals, and intelligence; and lest it should fall into other hands. I cannot forget the contents, altho' I am at a loss what answer to return.                   I cannot bear the thoughts of throwing myself upon the protection of myself friends:ÑBut I will not examine ÑBut proposals closely, till I hear from you. Indeed, I have no <i>eligible</i> hope, but in your mamma's goodness. <i>Hers</i> is a protection I could more <i>reputably</i> fly to, than to That of any other person: And from any other person should be ready to return to my father's (for the breach then would not be irreparable, as the breach then would be, if I fled to my father family): <i>To return,</i> I repeat, on such terms as shall secure but my <i>negative</i>; not my <i>Independence:</i> I do not aim at That (so shall lay your mamma under the less difficulty); altho' I have a right to it, if I were to insist upon it:ÑSuch a right, I mean, as my brother exerts in the estate, left <i>him</i>; and which no-body disputes.ÑGod forbid, that I should ever think myself freed from my father's <i>reasonable</i> controul, whatever right my grandfather's will has given me! He, good gentleman, left me the estate, as a reward of my duty, and not to set me above the estate, as has been justly hinted to myself: And this reflection makes me more fearful of not answering the intention of so valuable a bequest.ÑO that my friends knew but my heart!ÑWould but think of it, as my friends used to doÑFor once more, I say, If it deceive me not, it is not altered, altho' my friends are!                   Would but your mamma permit you to send your mamma chariot, or chaise, to the bye-place where Mr. Lovelace proposes Mr. Lovelace uncle's shall come (provoked, intimidated, and apprehensive, as I am), I would not hesitate a moment what to do!ÑPlace me any-where, as I have said before!ÑIn a cott, in a garret; anywhereÑDisguised as a servantÑor let me pass as a servant's sisterÑSo that I may but escape Mr. Solmes on one hand, and the disgrace of refuging with the family of a man at enmity with my own, on the other; and I shall be in some measure happy!ÑShould your good mamma refuse me, what resuge, or whose, can I fly to?ÑDearest creature, advise your distressed friend.                   I BROKE off hereÑI was so excessively uneasy, that I durst not trust myself with my own reflections: So went down to the garden, to try to calm my mind, by shifting the scene. I took but one turn upon the filbeard walk, when Betty came to myself. Here Miss, is your Papa!ÑHere is your uncle Antony!Ñ Here is my young masterÑand my young mistress, coming, to take a walk in the garden; and your papa sends me to see where you are, for fear your papa should meet you.                   I struck into an oblique path, and got behind the yew-hedge, seeing my sister appear; and there concealed myself till the yew-hedge were gone past myself.                   My mamma, it seems, is not well. My mamma keeps My mamma chamber!ÑShould My mamma be worse, I should have an additional unhappiness, in apprehension, that my reputed undutifulness has touched My mamma heart!                   You cannot imagine what my emotions were behind the yew-hedge, on seeing your papa so near me.ÑI was glad to look at ÑI thro' the yew-hedge, as ÑI passed by: But I trembled in every joint, when I heard ÑI utter <i>these</i> words: Son James, To you, and to Bella, and to brother, brother, do I wholly commit this matter.ÑFor that I was meant, I cannot doubt. And yet, why was I so affected; since I may be said to have been given up to their cruelty, for many days past?                   WHILE your papa remained in the garden, I sent my dutiful compliments to My mamma, with inquiry after My mamma health, by Shorey, whom I met accidentally upon the stairs; for none of the servants, except my gaoleress, dare to throw none of the servants in my way. I had the mortification of such a return, as made me repent my message, tho' not my concern for her health. Let My mamma not inquire after the disorders My mamma occasions, was the harsh answer. I will not receive any compliments from My mamma!                   Very, very, hard, my dear! Indeed it is very hard!                        I HAVE the pleasure to hear My mamma is already better, however. A colicky disorder, to which My mamma is too subject:ÑAnd ÑAnd is hoped is gone off.ÑGod send ÑAnd may!ÑEvery evil that happens in this house is owing to me!                   This good news was told me, with a circumstance very unacceptable; for Betty said, Betty had orders to let me know, that my garden-walks, and poultry-visits were suspected; and that both will be prohibited, if I stay here till Saturday or Monday.                   Possibly this is said by order, to make me go with less reluctance to my uncle's.                   My mamma bid Betty say, if I expostulated about these orders, and about my pen and ink, "That reading was more to the purpose, at present, than writeing: That by the one, I might be taught my duty; That the other, considering whom I was believed to write to, only stiffen'd my will: That my needleworks had better be pursued, than my airings; which were observed to be taken in all weathers."                   So, my dear, if I do not resolve upon something soon, I shall neither be able to avoid the intended evil, nor have the intended evil in my power to correspond with my dear.

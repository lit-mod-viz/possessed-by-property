DON'T be so much concerned, my dearest friend, at the bickerings between my mamma and me. We love one another dearly notwithstanding. If my mamma had not me to find fault with, she must find fault with somebody else. And as to me, I am a very saucy girl; and were there not this occasion, there would be some other to shew it.             You have heard me <i>say,</i> that this was always the case between us.ÑYou could not <i>otherwise</i> have known it. For when <i>you</i> was with us, you harmonized us both; and indeed I was always more afraid of you than of my mamma. But then that awe is accompanied with love. Your reproofs (as I have always found) are so charmingly mild and instructive! so evidently calculated to improve, and not to provoke, that a generous temper must be amended by them.ÑBut here now, mind my mamma, when you are not with usÑ<i>You shall, I tell you, Nancy!ÑI will have it so!ÑDon't I know best!ÑI won't be disobey'd!</i>ÑHow can a daughter of spirit bear such language! Such looks too with the language; and not have a longing mind to disobey?             Don't advise me, my dear, to obey my mamma in her prohibition of corresponding with you. She has no reason for it. Nor would she of her own judgment have prohibited me. That odd old ambling soul your uncle (whose visits are frequenter than ever), instigated by your malicious and selfish brother and sister, is the occasion. And they only have borrowed my mamma's lips, at the distance they are from you, for a sort of speaking-trumpet for them. The prohibition, once more I say, cannot come from her heart: But if it did, is so much danger to be apprehended from my ntinuing to write to one of my own sex, as if I wrote to one of the other? Don't let dejection and disappointment, and the course of oppression which you have run thro', weaken your mind, my dearest creature; and make you see inconveniencies, where there possibly cannot be any. If your talent is <i>scribbling,</i> as you call it; so is mineÑAnd I will scribble on, at all opportunities; and to you; let 'em say what they will.ÑNor let your letters be filled with the self-accusations you mention: There is no cause for them.ÑI wish, that your Anna Howe, who continues in her mother's house, were but half so good as Miss Clarissa Harlowe, who has been driven out of her father's.             I will say nothing upon your letter to your sister, till I see the effect it will have. You hope, you tell me, that you shall have your money and cloaths sent you, notwithstanding what I write of my opinion to the contrary.ÑI am sorry to have it to acquaint you, that I have just now heard, that they have sat in council upon your letter; and that your mamma was the only person, who was for sending you your things; and was over-ruled. I charge you therefore to accept of my offer, as by my last; and give me particular directions for what you want, that I can supply you with besides.                  Don't set your thoughts so much upon a reconciliation, as to prevent your laying hold of any handsome opportunity to give yourself a protector; such a one as the man will be, who, I imagine, husband-like, will let nobody insult you but himself.             What could he mean, by letting slip such a one as that you mention?ÑI don't know how to blame you neither. How could you go beyond silence and blushes, when the foolish fellow came with his observances of the restrictions which you laid him under when in another situation? But, as I told you above, you really strike people into awe. And, upon my word, you did not spare him.             I repeat what I said in my last, that you have a very nice part to act: And I will add, that you have a mind that is much too delicate for your part. But when the lover is exalted, the lady must be humbled. He is naturally proud and saucy. I doubt, you must engage his <i>pride,</i> which he calls his <i>honour:</i> And that you must throw off a little more of the veil. And I would have you restrain your wishes before him, that you had not met him; and the like.ÑWhat signifies wishing, my dear?ÑHe will not bear it. You can hardly expect that he will.             Nevertheless it vexes me to the very bottom of my pride, that any wretch of that sex should have such a triumph over such a lady.             I cannot, however, but say, that I am charmed with your spirit. So much sweetness, where sweetness is requisite; so much spirit, where spirit is called forÑWhat a <i>true</i> magnanimity!             But I doubt, in your present circumstances, you must endeavour after a little more of the reserve, and palliate a little.ÑThat humility which he puts on when you rise upon him, is not natural to him.             Methinks I see the man hesitating, and looking like the fool you paint him, under your corrective superiority! ÑBut he is not a fool. Don't put him upon mingling resentment with his love.             You are very serious, my dear, in the first of the two letters before me, in relation to Mr. Hickman and me; and in relation to my mamma and me. But, as to the latter, you must not be too grave. If we are not well together at one time, we are not ill together at another.ÑAnd while I am able to make my mamma smile in the midst of the most angry fit she ever fell into on the present occasion (tho' sometimes she would not, if she could help it), it is a very good signÑA sign that displeasure can never go deep, or be lasting. And then a kind word, or kind look, to her favourite Hickman, sets the one in raptures, and the other in tolerable humour, at any time.             But your case pains me at heart; and with all my levity, they must <i>both</i> sometimes partake of that pain, which must continue as long as you are in a state of uncertainty; and especially as I was not able to prevail for that protection for you, which would have prevented the unhappy step, the necessity for which, we both, with so much reason, deplore.             I have only to add (and yet that is needless to tell you), That I am, and will ever be,                Your affectionate friend and servant, ANNA HOWE

                        Wednesday Morning, Nine o'clock.                   I AM just return'd from my morning walk, and already have received a letter from Mr. Lovelace in answer to mine deposited last night. Mr. Lovelace must have had pen, ink, and paper, with Mr. Lovelace; for it was written in the coppice; with this circumstance; On one knee, kneeling with the other. Not from reverence to the written-to, however, as you'll find.                   Well are we instructed early to keep this sex at a distance. An undesigning open heart, where it is loth to disoblige, is easily drawn in, I see, to oblige more than ever it designed. It is too apt to govern it by what a bold spirit is encouraged to <i>expect</i> of it. It is very difficult for a good natured young person to give a negative where it disesteems not.                   One's heart may harden and contract, as one gains experience, and when we have smarted perhaps for we easy folly: And so it <i>ought,</i> or it would be upon very unequal terms with the world.                   Excuse these grave reflections. This man has vex'd me heartily. I see This man has vex'd me heartily gentleness was <i>art</i>; fierceness, and a temper like what I have been too much used to at home, are <i>nature</i> in This man has vex'd me heartily. In the mind I am in, nothing shall ever make me forgive This man has vex'd me heartily, since there can be no good reason for This man has vex'd me heartily impatience on an expectation given with reserve, and absolutely revocable. Ñ<i>I</i> so much to suffer <i>thro'</i> him; yet, to be treated as if I were obliged to bear insults <i>from</i> him!Ñ                   But here you will be pleased to read This man has vex'd me heartily letter; which I shall inclose. Ivy-Cavern in the CoppiceÑday but just breaking.                   This is the Answer I shall return.                   I BELIEVE, my dear, I may promise myself your approbation, whenever I write or speak with spirit, be it to whom it will. Indeed, I find but too much reason to exert it, since I have to deal with people, who measure their conduct to myself, not by what is fit or decent, right or wrong, but by what their think my temper will bear. I have, till very lately, been praised for mine; but it has always been by those who never gave me opportunity to return the compliment to those who never gave me opportunity to return the compliment to themselves: Some people have acted, as if Some people thought forbearance on <i>one side</i> absolutely necessary for Some people and me, to be upon good terms together; and in this case have ever taken care rather to <i>owe</i> that obligation than to <i>lay</i> it. You have hinted to me, that resentment is not natural to my temper, and that therefore it must soon subside. It may be so, with respect to my relations: But not to Mr. Lovelace, I assure you.

                           <i>M.
Hall,</i>                            <i>Monday May</i> 15.
SIR,                   IF any man in the world has power over my nephew, it is you.
I therefore write this, to beg you to interfere in the affair depending between my nephew and the most accomplished of women, as every one says; and <i>what every one says, must be true.</i>                        I don't know that my nephew has any bad designs upon her; but I know my nephew temper too well, not to be apprehensive upon such long delays: And the ladies here have been for some time in fear for her; my sister Sadleir, in particular, who (you know) is a wise woman, says, that these delays, in the present case, must be from my nephew, rather than from the lady.
my nephew had always indeed a strong antipathy to marriage; and may think of playing my nephew dog's tricks by marriage, as my nephew has by so many others.
If there's any danger of this, 'tis best to prevent it in time: For, <i>when a thing is done, advice comes too late.</i>                   advice has always had the folly and impertinence to make a jest of advice for using proverbs: But as they are the wisdom of whole nations and ages, collected into a small compass, I am not to be shamed out of sentences, that often contain more wisdom in they, than the tedious harangues of most of our parsons and moralists.
Let him laugh at they, if him pleases: You and I know better things, Mr. Belford.Ñ<i>Tho' you have kept company with a wolf, you have not learnt to howl of him.</i>                   But nevertheless, you must not let him know, that I have written to you on this subject.
I am ashamed to say this subject; but him has ever treated me, as if I were a man of very common understanding.
And would perhaps think never the better of the best advice in the world, for coming from me.
I am sure, him has no reason to slight me as him does.
him may and will be the better for me, if him outlives me; tho' him once told me to my face, That I might do as I would with my estate; for that him, for him part, loved him liberty as much as him despised money.
him thought, I suppose, that <i>I could not cover him with my wings, without pecking at him with my bill</i>; tho' I never used to be pecking at him, without very great occasion: And, God knows, God might have my very heart, if God would but endeavour to oblige me, by studying God own good; for that is all I desire of God.
Indeed, it was God poor mother that first spoil'd God; and I have been but too indulgent to God since.ÑA fine grateful disposition, you'll say, to <i>return evil for good!</i> But that was always God way.
This match, however, as the lady has such an extraordinary share of wisdom and goodness, might set all to rights: and if you can forward it, I would enable God to make whatever settlements God could wish; and should not be unwilling to put God in possession of another pretty estate besides: For what do I live for (as I have often said), but to see God and my two nieces well married and settled?
May heaven settle God down to a better mind, and turn God heart to more of goodness and consideration!
If the delays are on God side, I tremble for the lady; and, if on the lady (as God tells my niece Charlotte), I could wish the lady were apprized, that <i>Delays are dangerous.</i> Excellent as the lady is, I can tell the lady, the lady ought not to depend on the lady merits with such a changeable fellow, and such a professed marriage-hater, as God has been.
I know you are very good at giving kind hints.
<i>A word to the wise is enough.</i>                   I wish you would try what you can do with the wise; for I have warned the wise so often of the wise wicked practices, that I begin to despair of my words having any effect upon the wise.
But let the wise remember, that <i>Vengeance, tho' it comes with leaden feet, strikes with iron hands.</i> If the wise behaves ill in this case, the wise may find he behaves ill in this case so.
What a pity he behaves ill in this case is, that a man of the wise talents and learning should be so vile a rake!
Alas!
alas!
<i>Une poignÃe de bonne vie vaut mieux que plein muy de clergÃ</i>; A handful of good life is better than a whole bushel of learning.
You may throw in, too, as                    friend, that, should                    provoke me, it may not be too late for me to marry.
his friend did so, when his friend was older than I am, on purpose to plague <i>his</i> nephew: And, inspite of this gout, I might have a child or two still.
And have not been without some thoughts that way, when his friend has angered me more than ordinary: But some thoughts have gone off again hitherto, upon my considering, that <i>the children of very young and very old men</i> [tho' I am not so very old neither] <i>last not long</i>; and that <i>old men, when they marry young women,</i> are said to <i>make much of death:</i> Yet who knows but that matrimony might be good against the gouty humours I am troubled with?
The sentences, that I have purposely wove into my discourse, may be of some service to you in talking to him; but use talking to him sparingly, that him may not discover, that you borrow your <i>darts</i> from my <i>quiver.</i>                   May your good counsels, Mr. Belford, founded upon the hints I have given, pierce his heart, and incite his to do what will be so happy for his, and so necessary for the honour of that admirable lady whom I long to see his wife; and, if I may, I will not think of one for his.
Should his abuse the confidence his wife has plac'd in his, I myself shall pray, that vengeance may fll upon his head.Ñ<i>Raro</i>Ñ<i>Raro</i>Ñ(I quite forget all my Latin!
but I think it is)Ñ<i>Raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede poena claudo:</i> Where vice goes before, vengeance (sooner or later) will follow.
I shall make no apologies to you for this trouble.
I know how well you love him and me; and there is nothing in which you could serve us both more importantly, than in forwarding this match to the utmost of your power.
When it is done, how shall I rejoice to see you at M. Hall!
Mean time, I shall long to hear, that you are likely to be successful; and am,  				                       Dear Sir,                      Your most faithful friend and servant, <i>M.</i>

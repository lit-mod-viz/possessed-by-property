                        Tuesday Morning, Six o'Clock.
THE day is come!Ã‘I wish THE day were happily over.
I have had a wretched night.
Hardly a wink have I slept, ruminating upon the approaching interview.
The very distance of time they consented to, has added solemnity to the meeting, which otherwise it would not have had.
A thoughtful mind is not a blessing to be coveted, unless A thoughtful mind had such a happy vivacity with A thoughtful mind, as yours: A vivacity, which enables a person to enjoy the <i>present,</i> without being over-anxious about the <i>future.</i>

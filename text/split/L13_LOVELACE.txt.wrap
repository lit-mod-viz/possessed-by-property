     		To Mrs. LOVELACE.                   AGain, Madam, I remind you of your promise: And beg leave to say, I insist upon the performance of it.                   Remember, dearest creature, that the fault of a blameable person cannot warrant a fault in one more perfect. Over niceness may be under-niceness!                   I cannot reproach myself with any thing that deserves this high resentment.                   I own that the violence of my passion for you might have carried me beyond fit bounds:Ã‘But that your commands and adjurations had such a power over me, at such a moment, I humbly presume to say, deserves some consideration.                   You injoin me not to see you for a week. If I have not your pardon before Captain Tomlinson comes to town, what shall I say to <i>him?</i>                   I beg once more your presence in the dining-room. By my soul, Madam, I <i>must</i> see you.                   I want to consult you about the licence, and other particulars of great importance. The people below think us married; and I cannot talk to you, the door between us, upon such subjects.                   For heaven's sake, favour me with your presence for a few minutes: And I will leave you for the day.                   If I am to be forgiven, according to your promise, the earliest forgiveness must be the least painful to yourself, as well as to                      Your truly contrite and afflicted, <i>LOVELACE.</i>

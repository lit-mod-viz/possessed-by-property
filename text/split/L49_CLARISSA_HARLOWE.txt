                  Wedn. Night, March 22.
            ON my aunt's and sister's report of my obstinacy, my assembled relations have taken an <i>unanimous</i> resolution (as Betty tells me it is) against me. This resolution you will find signify'd to me in the inclosed letter from my brother, just now brought me. Be pleased to return it, when perused. I may have occasion for it, in the altercations between my relations and me.
            So here is the master-stroke of my brother's policy! Called upon to consent to go to my uncle Antony's, <i>avowedly</i> to receive Mr. Solmes's visits!헤 chapel!헤 moated house!헧eprived of the opportunity of corresponding with you!혎r of any possibility of escape, should violence be used to compel me to be that odious man's!
            Late as it was, when I received this insolent letter, I wrote an answer to it directly, that it might be ready for the writer's time of rising. I inclose the rough draught of it. You will see by it how much his vile hint from the Georgic, and his rude one of my <i>whining vocatives,</i> have set me up. Besides, as the command to get ready to go to my uncle's is in the name of my father and uncles, it is but to shew a piece of the art they accuse me of, to resent the vile hint, I have so much reason to resent, in order to palliate the refusal of obeying, what would otherwise
be interpreted an act of rebellion by my brother and sister: For, it seems plain to me, that they will work but half their ends, if they do not deprive me of my father's and uncles favour, altho' I should even comply with terms, which it is impossible I should ever comply with.
                  YOU might have told me, Brother, in three lines, what the determination of my friends was; only, that then you would not have had room to display your pedantry by so detestable an allusion or reference to the Georgic. Give me leave to tell you, Sir, That if <i>humanity</i> were a branch of your studies at the University, it has not found a genius in you for mastering it. Nor is either my Sex or my self, tho' a sister, I see, intitled to the least decency from a brother, who has studied, as it seems, rather to cultivate the malevolence of his natural temper, than any tendency which one would have hoped his parentage, if not his education, might have given him, to a tolerable politeness.
                  I doubt not, that you will take amiss my freedom: But as you have deserved it from me, I shall be less and less concerned on that score, as I see you are more and more intent to shew your wit at the expence of justice and compassion.
                  The time is, indeed, come, that I can no longer bear those contempts and reflections, which a brother, least of all men, is intitled to give. And let me beg of you one favour, officious Sir:헬t is <i>this,</i> That you will not give yourself any concern about a husband for <i>me,</i> till I shall have the forwardness to propose a wife to <i>you.</i> Pardon me, Sir; but I cannot help thinking, that could I have the art to <i>get my papa</i> of my side, I should have as much right to prescribe for you, as you have for me.
                  As to the communication you make me, I must take upon me to say, That altho' I will receive, as
becomes me, any of my papa's commands; yet, as this signification is made me by a brother, who has shewn of late so much of an unbrotherly animosity to me (for no reason in the world that I know of, but that he believes he has, in me, <i>one</i> sister too many for his interest) I think myself intitled to conclude, that such a letter as you have sent me, is all your own헤nd of course to declare, that, while I so think it, I will not willingly, nor even without violence, go to any place avowedly, to receive Mr. Solmes's visits.
                  I think myself so much intitled to resent your infamous hint, and this as well for the sake of my Sex, as for my own, that I ought to declare, as I do, that I will not receive any more of your letters, unless commanded to do so, by an authority I never will dispute; except in a case, where I think my <i>future,</i> as well as <i>present</i> happiness concerned헤nd were such a case to happen, I am sure my father's harshness will be less owing to himself, than to you; and to the specious absurdities of your ambitious and selfish schemes.헸ery true, Sir!
                  One word more, provoked as I am, I will add: That had I been thought as really obstinate and perverse, as of late I am said to be, I should not have been so disgracefully treated as I have been헯ay your hand upon your heart, Brother, and say, By whose instigations헤nd examine what I have done to deserve to be made thus unhappy, and to be obliged to style myself,
                     Your injured Sister, CL. HARLOWE.

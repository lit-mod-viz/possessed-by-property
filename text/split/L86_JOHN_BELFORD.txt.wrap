<i>Smith's,</i>                         8 <i>o'clock in the morning.</i>                   THE Lady is in a slumber. Mrs. Lovick, who sat up with her, says, she had a better night than was expected; for altho' she slept little, she seemed easy; and the easier for the pious frame she was in; all her waking moments being taken up in devotion, or in an ejaculatory silence; her hands and eyes often lifted up, and her lips moving with a fervor worthy of these her last hours.

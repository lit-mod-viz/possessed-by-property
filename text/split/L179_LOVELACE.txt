I Have just now had a specimen of what this dear creature's resentment will be, when quite recover'd: An affecting one!—For, entering her apartment after Dorcas; and endeavouring to soothe and pacify her disordered mind; in the midst of my blandishments, she held up to Heaven, in a speechless agony, the innocent Licence (which she has in her own power); as the poor distressed Catalans held up their
  
English treaty, on an occasion that keeps the worst of my actions in countenance.
            She seemed about to call down vengeance upon me; when, happily, the Leaden God, in pity to her trembling Lovelace, waved over her half-drowned eyes his somniferous wand, and laid asleep the fair exclaimer, before she could go half thro' with her intended imprecation.
            Thou wilt guess, by what I have written, that some <i>little</i> art has been made use of: But it was with a <i>generous</i> design (if thou'lt allow me the word on such an occasion) in order to lessen the too quick sense she was likely to have of what she was to suffer. A contrivance I never had occasion for before, and had not thought of now, if Mrs. Sinclair had not proposed it to me: To whom I left the management of it: And I have done nothing but curse her ever since, lest the quantity should have for ever damped her charming intellects.
            Hence my concern—For I think the poor lady ought not to have been so treated. <i>Poor lady,</i> did I say?—What have I to do with thy creeping style?— But have not I the worst of it; since her insensibility has made me but a thief to my own joys?
            I did not intend to tell thee of this little <i>innocent</i> trick; for such I designed it to be; but that I hate disingenuity: To thee, especially: And as I cannot help writing in a more serious vein than usual, thou wouldst, perhaps, had I not hinted the true cause, have imagined, that I was sorry for the fact itself: And this would have given <i>thee</i> a good deal of trouble in scribbling dull persuasives to repair by matrimony; and <i>me,</i> in reading thy crude nonsense. Besides, one day or other, thou mightest, had I not confessed it, have heard of it in an aggravated manner; and I know thou hast such an high opinion of this lady's virtue, that thou wouldst be disappointed, i thou hadst reason to think, that she was subdued by
  
               <i>her own</i> consent, or any the <i>least</i> yielding in her will. And so is she beholden to me, in some measure, that, at the expence of <i>my</i> honour, she may so justly form a plea, which will intirely salve <i>hers?</i>
            
            And now is the whole secret out.
            Thou wilt say I am a horrid fellow!—As the lady does, that I am the <i>unchained Beelzebub,</i> and a <i>plotting villain:</i> And as this is what you both said beforehand, and nothing worse <i>can</i> be said, I desire, if thou wouldst not have me quite serious with thee, and that I should think thou meanest more by thy tilting-hint, than I am willing to believe thou dost, that thou wilt forbear thy invectives: For is not the thing done?—Can it be help'd?—And must I not now try to make the best of it?—And the rather do I injoin thee this, and inviolable secrecy; because I begin to think, that my punishment will be greater than the fault, were it to be only from my own reflection.

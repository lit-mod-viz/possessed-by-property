<i>Thursday, three o'clock, Aug.</i> 31.                   ON my re-visit to the lady, I found her almost as much a sufferer from joy, as she had sometimes been from grief: For she had just received a very kind letter from her cousin Morden; which she was so good as to communicate to me. As she had already begun to answer it, I begg'd leave to attend her in the evening, that I might not interrupt her in it.                   The letter is a very tender one...                But, alas! all will be now too late. For the decree is certainly gone out. The world is unworthy of her!

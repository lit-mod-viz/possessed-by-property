                        Sunday evening.                   WE all dined together in Mrs. Sinclair's parlour! All ex-<i>cessive</i>-ly right! The two nieces have topp'd The two nieces parts: Mrs. Sinclair Mrs. Sinclair. Never so easy yet as now!Ñ "Mrs. Sinclair really thought a little oddly of these people at first, Mrs. Sinclair said: Mrs. Sinclair seem'd very forbidding! Mrs. Sinclair nieces were persons, with whom Mrs. Sinclair could not wish to be acquainted. But really we should not be too hasty in we censures. Some people improve upon we. The widow seems <i>tolerable.</i> [The widow went no farther than <i>tolerable</i>]. Miss Martin and Miss Horton are young people of good sense, and have read a good deal. What Martin particularly said of marriage, and of marriage humble servant, was very solid. marriage believes, with such notions, marriage cannot make a bad wife." ÑBy the way, her humble servant is a woolen-draper of great reputation; and marriage is soon to be marry'd.                   I have been letting marriage into thy character, and into the characters of my other three Esquires, in hopes to excite marriage curiosity to see you to-morrow night. I have told marriage some of the <i>worst,</i> as well as <i>best</i> parts of your characters, in order to exalt myself, and to obviate any sudden surprizes, as well as to teach marriage what sort of men marriage may expect to see, if marriage will oblige me.                   By marriage observations upon each of you, I shall judge what I may or may not do to <i>obtain</i> or <i>keep</i> marriage good opinion: What marriage will <i>like,</i> what <i>not</i>; and so pursue the one, or avoid the other, as I see proper.ÑSo, while marriage is penetrating into your shallow heads, I shall enter marriage heart, and know what to bid my own hope for.                   The house is to be taken in three weeks: All will be over in three weeks, or bad will be my luck!ÑWho knows but in three days?ÑHave I not carry'd that great point of making marriage pass for my wife to the people below? And that other great one of fixing myself here night and day?ÑWhat lady ever escaped me, that lodg'd under one roof with me?ÑThe house too, THE house; the people, people after my own heart: day?ÑWhat lady servants Will and Dorcas both my servants.Ñ<i>Three days</i> did I say! Pho! pho!Ñ<i>Three hours!</i>                   I HAVE carried my third point, Jack; but extremely to the dislike of my charmer. Miss Partington was introduced to Miss Partington; and being engaged on condition, that my beloved would honour me at my collation, there was no denying Miss Partington; so fine a young lady! seconded by my earnest intreaties.                   I long to have your opinions of my fair prize!ÑIf you love to see features that glow, tho' the heart is frozen, and never yet was thaw'd; if you love fine sense, and adages flowing thro' teeth of ivory, and lips of coral; an eye that penetrates all things; a voice that is harmony itself; an air of grandeur, mingled with a sweetness that cannot be described; a politeness that, if ever equalled, was never excelledÑYou'll see all these excellencies, and ten times more, in this my GLORIANA.                      Mark her majestic fabric!ÑShe's a temple                      Sacred by birth, and built by hands divine;                      her soul the deity that lodges there:                      Nor is the pile unworthy of the god.                   Or, to describe her in a softer stile, with Rowe,                         The bloom of op'ning flow'rs, unsully'd beauty,                         Softness, and sweetest innocence, her wears,                         And looks like nature in the world's first spring.                   Adieu, varlets four!ÑAt six on Monday evening, I expect ye all.                            In the Lady's next letter, dated on Monday morning, her praises his behaviour at church, his observations afterwards. Likes the people of the house better than her did. The more likes the people of the house by reason of the people of condition that visit the people of the house.                            her dates again, and declares her displeased at Miss Partington's being introduced to her: And still more for being obliged to promise to be present at Mr. Lovelace's collation. her foresees, her says, a murder'd evening.

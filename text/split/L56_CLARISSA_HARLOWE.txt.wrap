                     Dear and honoured Sir,                   HOW you rejoice me by your, condescending goodness!ÑSo kind, so paternal a letter!Ñso soothing to a wounded heart; and of late what I have been so little used to!ÑHow am I affected with it! Tell me not, dear Sir, of my way of writing: Your letter has more moved <i>me,</i> than I ever could move <i>any-body!</i>ÑIt has made me, with all my heart, wish I could intitle myself to be visited upon your own terms; and to be led down to my papa and mamma, by so good and so kind an uncle.                   I will tell you, dearest Sir, what I will do to make my peace. I have no doubt that Mr. Solmes would greatly prefer my sister to such a strange, averse creature as me: His chief, or one of his chief motives to address me, is, as I have reason to believe, the contiguity of my grandfather's estate to his own: I will resign it; for ever I will resign it: And the resignation must be good, because I will never marry at all: I will make it over to my sister, and her heirs for ever. I shall have no heirs, but my brother and her; and I will receive, as of my papa's bounty, such an annuity (not in lieu of the estate, but as <i>of</i> his bounty), as he shall be pleased to grant me, if it be ever so small; and whenever I disoblige him, he shall withdraw it, at his pleasure.                   Will not This be accepted?ÑSure it must!ÑSure it will!ÑI beg of you, dearest Sir, to propose it; and second it with your interest. This will answer every end. My sister has a high opinion of Mr. Solmes. I never can have <i>any</i> in the light he is proposed to me. But as my sister's husband, he will be always intitled to my respect; and shall have it.                   If this be accepted, grant me, Sir, the honour of a visit; and do me then the inexpressible pleasure of leading me down to the feet of my honoured parents, and they shall find me the most dutiful of children; and to the arms of my brother and sister, and they shall find me the most obliging and most affectionate of sisters.                   I wait, Sir, for your answer to this proposal, made with the whole heart of                      Your dutiful and most obliged Niece, CL. HARLOWE.

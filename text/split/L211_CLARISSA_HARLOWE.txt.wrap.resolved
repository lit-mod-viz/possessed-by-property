                  To ROBERT LOVELACE,                       Esq                            <i>Tuesday night,</i> 11 <i>o'clock. (Aug.</i> 22.)                      SIR,                   I HAVE good news to tell you. I am setting out with all diligence for my father's house. I am bid to hope that my father will receive my father poor penitent with a goodness peculiar to my father; for I am overjoyed with the assurance of a thorough reconciliation, thro' the interposition of a dear blessed friend, whom I always loved and honoured. I am so taken up with my preparation for this joyful and long-wished-for journey, that I cannot spare one moment for any other business, having several matters of the last importance to settle first. So, pray, Sir, don't disturb or interrupt meÑI beseech you don't.ÑYou may, in time, possibly, see me at my father's; at least, if it be not your own fault.                   I will write a letter, which shall be sent you when I am got thither and received: Till when, I am, <i></i>                      CLARISSA HARLOWE.

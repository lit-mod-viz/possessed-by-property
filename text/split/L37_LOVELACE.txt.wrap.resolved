                     <i>Friday, June</i> 30.                I AM ruined, undone, blown-up, destroyed, and worse than annihilated, that's certain! ÑBut was not the news shocking enough, dost thou think, without thy throwing into the too weighty scale, reproaches, which thou couldest have had no opportunity to make, but for my own voluntary communications? At a time too, when, as it falls out, I have another very sensible disappointment to struggle with?             I imagine, if there be such a thing as future punishment, it must be none of the smallest mortifications, that a <i>new</i> devil shall be punished by a worse <i>old one.</i> And, <i>Take that!</i> And, <i>Take that!</i> to have the old satyr cry to the screaming sufferer, laying on with a cat-o'-nine-tails, with a star of burning brass at the end of each: And, <i>For what! For what!</i>ÑWhy, if the truth might be fairly told, for not being so bad a devil as myself!             Thou art, surely, casuist good enough to know (what I have insisted upon heretofore), that the sin of seducing a credulous and easy girl, is as great as that of bringing to your lure an incredulous and watchful one.             However ungenerous an appearance what I am going to say may have from <i>my</i> pen, let me tell thee, That if such a lady as Miss Harlowe chose to enter into the matrimonial state <i>(I am resolved to disappoint thee in thy meditated triumph over my rage and despair!),</i> and, according to the old patriarchal system, to go on contributing to get sons and daughters, with no other view, than to bring sons and daughters up piously, and to be good and useful members of the commonwealth, what a devil had such a lady to do, to let such a lady fancy run a gadding after a Rake? One whom such a lady <i>knew</i> to be a Rake?             O but truly, such a lady hoped to have the merit of reclaiming him. such a lady had formed pretty notions, how charmingly it would look to have a penitent of such a lady own making, dangling at such a lady side, to church, thro' an applauding neighbourhood: And, as their family increased, marching with such a lady thither, at the head of their boys and girls, processionally, as it were, boasting of the fruits of their <i>honest desires,</i> as my good Lord Bishop has it in Lord Bishop Licence. And then, what a comely fight, all kneeling down together in one pew, according to eldership, as we have seen in effigie, a whole family upon some old monument, where the honest chevalier, in armour, is presented kneeling, with uplift hands, and half a dozen jolter-headed crop-eared boys behind him, ranged <i>gradatim,</i> or step-fashion, according to age and size, all in the same postureÑFacing his pious dame, with a ruff about her neck, and as many whey-faced girls, all kneeling behind <i>her:</i> An altar between them, and an opened book upon it: Over them heads semilunary rays darting from gilded clouds, surrounding an atchievement-motto, IN COELO SALUSÑ or QUIESÑperhaps, if them have happened to live the usual married life of brawl and contradiction.             It is certainly as much my misfortune to have fallen in with Miss Clarissa Harlowe, were I to have valued my reputation or ease, as it is that of Miss Harlowe to have been acquainted with me. And, after all, what have I done more than prosecute the maxims, by which thou and I, and every Rake are governed, and which, before I knew this lady, we have pursued from pretty girl to pretty girl, as fast as we had set one down, taking another up;Ñjust as the fellows do, with the fellows flying-coaches and flying-horses at a country-fairÑWith a <i>Who rides next! Who rides next!</i>             But here, in the present case, to carry on the volant metaphor (for I must either be merry, or mad), is a pretty little Miss, just come out of a pretty little Miss hanging-sleeve coat, brought to buy a pretty little fairing; for the world, Jack, is but a great fair, thou knowest; and, to give thee serious reflection for serious, all thee toys but tinselled hobby-horses, gilt gingerbread, squeaking trumpets, painted drums, and so forth.Ñ             Now, behold, this pretty little Miss skimming from booth to booth, in a very pretty manner. One pretty little fellow called Wyerly, perhaps; another jiggeting rascal called Biron, a third simpering varlet of the name of Symmes, and a more hideous villain than any of the rest with a long bag under his arm, and parchment settlements tagg'd to his heels, yleped Solmes; pursue her from raree-show to raree-show, shouldering upon one another at every turning, stopping when her stops, and set a spinning again when her moves.ÑAnd thus dangled after, but still in the eye of her watchful guardians, traverses the pretty little Miss thro' the whole fair, equally delighted and delighting: Till at last, taken with the invitation of the <i>lac'd-hat orator,</i> and seeing several pretty little bib-wearers stuck together in the flying-coaches, cutting safely the yielding air, in the One-go-up, the Other-go-down picture of-the-world vehicle, and all with as little fear as wit, is tempted to ride next.             In then suppose her slily pops, when <i>none of her friends are near her:</i> And if, after two or three ups and downs, her pretty head turns giddy, and her throws her out of the coach, when at its elevation, and so dashes out her pretty little brains, who can help it!ÑAnd would you hang the poor fellow, whose <i>professed trade</i> it was to set the pretty little creatures a flying?             'Tis true, this pretty little Miss, being a <i>very</i> pretty little Miss, being a <i>very much-admired</i> little Miss, being a very <i>good</i> little Miss, who always minded her book, and had passed thro' her samplar-doctrine with high applause; had even stitched out in gaudy propriety of colours, an Abraham offering up Isaac, a Samson and the Philistines, and flowers, and knots, and trees, and the sun and the moon, and the seven stars, all hung up in frames with glasses before the seven stars, for the admiration of her future grandchildren: Who likewise was intitled to a very pretty little estate: Who was descended from a pretty little family upwards of one hundred years gentility; which lived in a very pretty little manner, respected a very little on their own accounts, a great deal on her:Ñ             For such a pretty little Miss as this to come to so very great a misfortune, must be a very sad thing: But, tell me, would not the losing of any ordinary child, of any other less considerable family, of less shining or amiable qualities, have been as great and as heavy a loss to that family, as the losing this pretty little Miss to hers?             To descend to a very low instance, and that only as to <i>personality;</i> hast thou any doubt, that thy strong-muscled bony face was as much admired by thy mother, as if it had been the face of a Lovelace, or any other handsome fellow; and had thy picture been drawn, would a Lovelace have forgiven the painter, had the painter not expressed so exactly thy lineaments, as that every one should have discerned the likeness? The <i>handsome</i> likeness is all that is wished for. Ugliness made familiar to us, with the partiality natural to fond parents, will be beauty all the world over.Ñ Do thou apply.             BUT, alas, Jack, all this is but a copy of my countenance, drawn to evade thy malice!ÑTho' t answer thy unfriendly purpose to own it, I cannot forbear to own it, that I am stung to the very soul with this unhappyÑ <i>Accident,</i> must I call it?ÑHave I nobody, whose throat, either for carelessness or treachery, I ought to cut, in order to pacify my vengeance!Ñ             When I reflect upon my <i>last</i> iniquitous intention, the <i>first</i> outrage so nobly resented, as well as, so far as she was able, so nobly <i>resisted,</i> I cannot but conclude, that I was under the power of fascination from these accursed Circes; who, pretending to know their own sex, would have it, that there is in every woman a yielding, or a weak-resisting moment to be met with: And that <i>yet,</i> and <i>yet,</i> and <i>yet,</i> I had not tried enough:ÑBut that, if neither love nor terror should enable me to hit that lucky moment, when, by help of neither love nor terror cursed arts, she was <i>once overcome,</i> she would be for <i>ever overcome:</i>ÑAppealing to all my experience, to all my knowlege of the sex, for a justification of all my knowlege of the sex assertion.             My appealed to experience, I own, was but too favourable to all my knowlege of the sex argument: For dost thou think, I could have held my purpose against such an angel as this, had I ever before met with one so much in earnest to defend she honour against the unwearied artifices and perseverance of the man she loved? Why then were there not more examples of a virtue so immoveable? Or, why was this singular one to fall to my lot? Except indeed to <i>double my guilt;</i> and at the same time to convince all that should hear of she story, <i>that there are angels as well as devils in the flesh?</i>             So much for confession; and for the sake of humouring my conscience; with a view likewise to disarm thy malice by acknowlegement: Since no one shall say worse of me, than I will of me on this occasion.             One thing I will nevertheless add, to shew the sincerity of my contrition:Ñ'Tis this, that if thou canst by any means find her out within these three days, or any time before her has discovered the stories relating to Captain Tomlinson and her Uncle to be what they are; and if thou canst prevail upon canst to consent; I will actually, in thy presence, and thy (thy to represent her uncle), marry her.             I am still in hopes it may be soÑShe cannot be long concealedÑI have already set all engines at work to find her out; and if I do, what <i>indifferent</i> persons (and no one of her <i>friends,</i> as thou observest, will look upon her) will care to imbroil themselves with a man of my figure, fortune, and resolution?ÑShew her this part then, or any other part of this letter, at thy own discretion, if thou <i>canst</i> find thy: For, after all, methinks I would be glad, that this affair, which is bad enough in itself, should go off without worse personal consequences to any-body else; and yet itself runs in my mind, I know not why, that sooner or later, itself will draw a few drops of blood after itself; except thy and I can make itself up between ourselves. And this may be another reason why thy should not carry thy resentment too far Ñ Not that such an affair would give me much concern neither, were I to choose my man or men; for I heartily hate all thy family but thy; and ever shall.             LET me add, that this lady's plot to escape appears to me no extraordinary one. There was much more luck than probability, that it should do: Since, to make it succeed, it was necessary, that Dorcas and Will. and Sinclair and Sinclair nymphs, should be all deceived, or off Sinclair and her nymphs guard. It belongs to me, when I see Sinclair and her nymphs, to give Sinclair and her nymphs my hearty thanks that Sinclair and her nymphs were; and that Sinclair and her nymphs selfish care to provide for Sinclair and her nymphs own future security, should induce Sinclair and her nymphs to leave Sinclair and her nymphs outward door upon Sinclair and her nymphs bolt-latch, and be curs'd to them!Ñ             Mabell deserves a pitch-suit and a bonfire, rather than the lustring; and as her cloaths are returned, let this lady's be put to this lady others, to be sent to this lady, when it can be told whither.ÑBut not till I give the word, neither; for we must get the dear fugitive back again, if possible.             I suppose that my stupid villain, who knew not such a goddess-shaped lady with a mien so noble, from the aukward and bent-shouldered Mabell, has been at Hamstead to see after her: And yet I hardly think her would go thither. He ought to go thro' every street where bills for lodgings are up, to inquire after a new-comer. The houses of such as deal in womens matters, and tea, coffee, and such-like, are those to be inquired at for her. If some tidings be not quickly heard of her, I would not have either Dorcas, Will. or Mabell, appear in my sight, whatever their superiors think fit to do.             This, tho' written in character, is a very long letter, considering it is not a narrative one, or a journal of proceedings, like some of my former; for such will unavoidably and naturally, as I may say, run into length. But I have so used myself to write a great deal of late, that I know not how to help it. Yet I must add to it length, in order to explain myself on a hint I gave at the beginning of it, which was, that I have another disappointment, besides this of Miss Harlowe's escape, to bemoan.             And what dost think it is? Why, the old peer <i>pox</i> of his tough constitution! (for that would have helped his on) has made shift by fire and brimstone, and the devil knows what, to force the gout to quit the counterscarp of his stomach, just as it had collected all it strength, in order to storm the citadel of his heart: In short they have, by the mere force of stink-pots, hand-granades, and pop-guns, drove the slow-working pioneer quite out of the trunk into the extremities; and there the extremities lies nibbling, and gnawing, upon his great toe; when I had hoped a fair end both of the distemper, and the distempered.             But I, who could write to <i>thee</i> of laudanum, and the wet cloth formerly, yet let 8000 <i>l.</i> a year slip thro' my fingers, when I had entered upon a year, more than in imagination (for I had begun to ask the stewards questions, and to hear them talk of fines and renewals, and such sort of stuff), <i>deserve</i> to be mortified.             Thou canst not imagine, how differently the servants, and even my cousins, look upon me since yesterday, to what they did before. Neither the one nor the other bow and courtesy half so low.ÑNor am I a quarter so often <i>ÑNor honour,</i> and <i>your honour,</i> as I was within these few hours, with the former: And as to the latter Ñ It is <i>cousin Bobby</i> again, with the usual familiarity, instead of <i>Sir,</i> and <i>Sir,</i> and, <i>If you please, Mr. Lovelace.</i> And now they have the insolence to congratulate me on the recovery of the <i>best of uncles,</i> while I am forced to seem as much delighted as they, when, would it do me good, I could sit down and cry my eyes out.             I had bespoken my mourning in imagination, after the example of a certain foreign minister, who, before the death, or even last illness of Charles II. as honest White Kennet tells us, had half exhausted Blackwell-hall of its fables: An indication, as the historian would insinuate, that the monarch was to be poisoned, and the ambassador in the secretÑAnd yet, fool that I was, I could not take the hint!Ñ What a devil does a man read history for, if a man cannot profit by the examples a man finds in it?             But thus, Jack, is an observation of the old peer's verified, <i>That one misfortune seldom comes alone:</i> And so concludes                Thy doubly-mortified <i>LOVELACE.</i>

                  Mr. Lovelace in his next letter triumphs on his having carried his two great points of making the lady yield to pass for his wife to the people of the house, and to his taking up his lodging in it, tho' but for one night.

Thus he begins his succeeding letter.                      ""                   He takes notice of the jealousy, pride and vanity o Sally Martin and Polly Horton, on his respectful behaviour to her. Creatures who, brought up to high for their fortunes, and to a taste of pleasure, an the public diversions, had fallen an easy prey to hi seducing arts; and for some time past, been associate with Mrs. Sinclair: And who, as he observes, had no yet, got over that distinction in their love, which make a woman prefer one man to another.

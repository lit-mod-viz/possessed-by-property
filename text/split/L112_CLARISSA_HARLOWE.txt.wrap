                        Mond. Morn. April 10, Seven o'Clock.                   O MY dear! There yet lies the letter, just as I left it!                   Does he think he is so sure of me!ÑPerhaps he imagines that I <i>dare not</i> alter my purpose. I wish I had never known him!ÑI begin now to see this rasthness in the light every-one else would have seen it in, had I been guilty of it.ÑBut what can I do, if he come to-day at the appointed time!ÑIf he receive not the letter, I must see him, or he will think something has befallen me; and certainly will come to the house. As certainly he will be insulted. And what, in that case, may be the consequence!ÑThen I as good as promised, that I would take the first opportunity to see him, if I changed my mind, and to give him my reasons for it. I have no doubt but he will be out of humour upon it: But better <i>he</i> meet me, and go away dissatisfied with <i>me,</i> than that <i>I</i> should go away dissatisfied with <i>myself.</i>                   Yet, short as the time is, he may still perhaps send, and get the letter. Something may have happened to prevent him, which, when known, will excuse him.                        After I have disappointed him more than once before, on a requested <i>interview</i> only, it is impossible he should not have <i>curiosity,</i> at least, to know if something has not happened; and if my mind hold in this more <i>important case.</i> And yet, as I rashly confirm'd my resolution by a second letter, I begin now to doubt it.

                  To JOHN BELFORD,                       Esq                            <i>Sunday Evening, Sept.</i> 3.                      SIR,                   I Take this last and solemn occasion to repeat to you my thanks for all your kindness to me at a time when I most needed countenance and protection.                   A few considerations I beg leave, as <i>now,</i> at your perusal of This, from the dead, to press upon you, with all the warmth of a sincere friendship.                   By the time you will see This, you will have had an instance, I humbly trust, of the comfortable importance of a pacified conscience, in the last hours of one, who, <i>to</i> the last hour, will wish your eternal welfare.                   The great Duke of Luxemburgh, as I have heard, on his death-bed, declared, That he would then much rather have had it to reflect upon, that he had administered a cup of cold water to a worthy poor creature in distress, than that he had won so many battles as he had triumphed forÑAnd, as one well observes, All the sentiments of worldly grandeur vanish at that unavoidable moment which decides the destiny of all men.                   If then, Sir, at the tremendous hour, it be thus with the conquerors of armies, and the subduers of nations, let me, in very few words (many are not needed) ask, What, at That period, must be the reflections of those (if capable of reflection) who have lived a life of sense and offence; whose study and whose pride most ingloriously has been to seduce the innocent, and to ruin the weak, the unguarded, and the friendless; made still more friendless by <i>their</i> base seductions?ÑOh! Mr. Belford, weigh, ponder, and reflect upon it, now, that in health, and in vigour of mind and body, the reflections will most avail youÑWhat an ingrateful, what an unmanly, what a meaner than reptile pride is this!                   In the next place, Sir, let me beg of you, for <i>my sake,</i> who AM, or, as <i>now</i> you will best read it, <i>have been,</i> driven to the necessity of applying to you to be the Executor of my will, that you will bear, according to that generosity which I think to be in you, with all my friends, and particularly with my brother (who is really a worthy young man, but perhaps a little too headstrong in his first resentments and conceptions of things) if any thing, by reason of this trust, should fall out disagreeably; and that you will study to make peace, and to reconcile all parties; and more especially, that you, who seem to have a great influence upon your <i>still more</i> headstrong friend, will interpose, if occasion be, to prevent <i>further</i> mischiefÑFor surely, Sir, that violent spirit may sit down satisfied with the evils he has already wrought; and, particularly, with the wrongs, the heinous and ignoble wrongs, he has in me done to my family, wounded in the tenderest part of its honour.                   To this request I have already your repeated promise. I claim the observance of it, therefore, as a debt from you: And tho' I hope I need not doubt it, yet was I willing, on this solemn, this <i>last</i> occasion, thus earnestly to reinforce it.                   I have another request to make to you; It is only, That you will be pleased, by a particular messenger, to forward the inclosed letters as directed.                   And now, Sir, having the presumption to think, that an <i>useful</i> member is lost to society by means of the unhappy step which has brought my life so soon to its period, let me hope, that I may be an humble instrument in the hands of Providence, to reform a man of your parts and abilities; and then I shall think that loss will be more abundantly repaired to the world, while it will be, by God's goodness, my gain: And I shall have this further hope, that once more I shall have an opportunity, in a blessed Eternity, to thank you, as I now repeatedly do, for the good you have done to, and the trouble you will have taken for, Sir,                      Your obliged Servant, <i>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</i>

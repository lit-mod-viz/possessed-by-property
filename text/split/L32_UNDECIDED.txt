            Mr. Belford, in his answer to this letter, farther inforces the lady's dying injunctions; and rejoices that the Colonel has made no vindictive resolutions; and hopes everything from his prudence and consideration, and from his promise given to the dying lady.
            He refers to the seeing him in town an account of the dreadful ends of two of the greatest criminals in his cousin's affair.
"This, says he, together with Mr. Lovelace's disorder of mind, looks as if Providence had already taken the punishment of these unhappy wretches into its own hands."
            He desires a days notice of his coming to town, lest otherwise he may be absent at the time.
            This he does, tho' he tells him not the reason, with a view to prevent a meeting between him and Mr. Lovelace; who may be in town (as he apprehends) about the same time, in his way to go abroad.
                     <i>Tuesday, Sept.</i> 26.

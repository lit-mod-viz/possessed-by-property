                     Tuesday, Two in the morning.                         Postscript.                         You must send me no more letters: But a compliable one you may send. But I need not have forbid you; for I am sure, this, by fair argument, is unanswerable: I know it is. I have written day and night, I may say, ever since Sunday morning, only church-time, or the like of that: But this is the last, I can tell you, from                            A. H.

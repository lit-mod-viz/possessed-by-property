                        Tuesday night.
                  SINCE I wrote the above, I have ventured to send a letter by Shorey, to my mamma. I directed her to give it into her own hand, when nobody was by.
                  I shall inclose the copy of it. You'll see that I would have it thought, that now Hannah is gone, I have no way to correspond out of the house. I am far from thinking all I do, right. I am afraid, this is a little piece of art, that is <i>not</i> so. But this is an after-thought: The letter went first.

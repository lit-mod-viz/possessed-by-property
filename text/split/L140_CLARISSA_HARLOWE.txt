            YOU may believe, my dear Miss Howe, that the circumstance of the noise and outcry within the garden-door, on Monday last, gave me no small uneasiness, to think that I was in the hands of a man, who could, by such vile premeditation, lay a snare to trick me out of myself, as I have so frequently called it.
            Whenever he came in my sight, the thought of this gave me an indignation that made his presence disgustful to me; and the more, as I fancy'd I beheld in his face a triumph which reproached my weakness on that account; altho', perhaps, it was only the same vivacity and placidness that generally fit upon his features.
            I was resolved to task him upon this subject, the first time I could have patience to enter upon it with him. For, besides that it piqued me excessively from the nature of the artifice, I expected shuffling and evasion, if he were guilty, that would have incensed me:
And, if not confessedly guilty, such unsatisfactory declarations, as still would have kept my mind doubtful and uneasy; and would, upon every new offence that he might give me, sharpen my disgusts to him.
            I have had the opportunity I waited for; and will lay before you the result.
            He was making his court to my good opinion in very polite terms, and with great seriousness lamenting that he had lost it; declaring, that he knew not how he had deserved to do so; attributing to me a prejudice, at least an indifference to him, that seemed, to his infinite concern, hourly to increase. And he besought me to let him know my whole mind, that he might have an opportunity either to confess his faults, and amend them, or to clear his conduct to my satisfaction, and thereby intitle himself to a greater share of my confidence.
            I answer'd him with quickness—Then, Mr. Lovelace, I will tell you one thing with a frankness, that is, perhaps, more suitable to <i>my</i> character, than to <i>yours</i> [He hoped not, he said], which gives me a very bad opinion of you, as a designing, artful man.
            I am all attention, Madam.
            I never can think tolerably of you, while the noise and voice I heard at the garden-door, which put me into the terror you took so much advantage of, remains unaccounted for. Tell me fairly, tell me candidly, the whole of that circumstance; and of your dealings with that wicked Joseph Leman; and, according to your explicitness in this particular, I shall form a judgment of your future professions.
            I will, without reserve, my dearest life, said he, tell you the whole; and hope that my sincerity in the relation will atone for any thing you may think wrong in the fact.
               "I knew nothing, <i>said he,</i> of this man, this Leman, and should have scorned a resort to so low a method, as bribing the servant of any family, to
let me into the secrets of that family, if I had not detected him attempting to corrupt a servant of mine, to inform him of all my motions, of all my supposed intrigues, and, in short, of every action of my private life, as well as of my circumstances and engagements; and this for motives too obvious to be dwelt upon."
               "My servant told me of his offers, and I ordered him, unknown to the fellow, to let me hear a conversation that was to pass between them."
               "In the midst of it, and just as he had made an offer of money for a particular piece of intelligence, promising more when procured, I broke in upon them, and by bluster, calling for a knife to cut off his ears (one of which I took hold of), in order to make a present of it, as I said, to his employers, I obliged him to tell me who they were."
               "Your brother. Madam, and your uncle Antony, he nam'd."
               "It was not difficult, when I had given him my pardon on naming them, after I had set before him the enormity of the task he had undertaken, and the honourableness of my intentions to your dear self, to prevail upon him, by a larger reward, to serve me; since, at the same time, he might keep your uncle and brother's favour; as I desired to know nothing, but what related to myself and to you, in order to guard us both against the effects of an ill-will, which he acknowleged all his fellow-servants, as well as himself, thought undeserved."
               "By this means, I own to you, Madam, I frequently turned his principals about upon a pivot of my own, unknown to themselves: And the fellow, who is always calling himself a <i>plain man,</i> and boasting of his CONSCIENCE, was the easier, as I condescended frequently to assure him of my honourable views; and as he knew, that the use I
made of his intelligence prevented, perhaps, fatal mischiefs."
               "I was the more pleased with his services, as, let me acknowlege to you, Madam, they procured to you, unknown to yourself, a safe and uninterrupted egress (which perhaps would not otherwise have been continued to you, so long as it was) to the garden and wood-house: For he undertook to them, to watch all your motions: And the more chearfully (for the fellow loves you), as it kept off the curiosity of others."
            So, my dear, it comes out, that I <i>myself</i> was obliged to this deep contriver.
            I sat in silent astonishment; and thus he went on.
               "As to the circumstance, which you, Madam, think so hardly of me for, I do freely confess, that having a suspicion that you would revoke your intention of getting away, and in that case, as I was determin'd, if possible, to prevail upon you to adhere to your resolution, apprehending that we should not have the time together, that was necessary for that purpose; I had order'd him to keep off every body he <i>could</i> keep off, and to be himself within view of the garden-door"—
            But pray, Sir, interrupting him, how came you to apprehend that I should revoke my intention? I had indeed deposited a letter to that purpose; but you had it not: And how, as I had reserved to myself the privilege of a revocation, did you know, but I might have prevailed upon my friends, and so have revoked upon good grounds?
               "I will be very ingenuous, Madam: You had made me hope, that, it you changed your mind, you would give me a meeting, to apprize me of the reasons for it: I went to the loose bricks, and I saw the letter there; And as I knew your friends were immoveably
fixed in their schemes, I doubted not but the letter was to revoke or suspend your resolution; and probably to serve instead of a meeting too. I therefore let it lie, that, if you did revoke, you might be under the necessity of meeting me for the sake of the expectation you had given me: And as I came prepared, I was resolved, pardon me, Madam, whatever were your intentions, that you should not go back. Had I taken your letter, I must have been determin'd by the contents of it, for the present, at least: But not having receiv'd it, and you having reason to think I wanted not resolution, in a situation so desperate, to make your friends a personal visit, I depended upon the interview you had bid me hope for."
            Wicked wretch! said I; It is my grief, that I gave you opportunity to take so exact a measure of my weakness!—But <i>would</i> you have presumed to visit the family, had I not met you?
            Indeed I would. I had some friends in readiness, who were to have accompany'd me to them. And had they refused to see me, or to give me audience, I would have taken my friends with me to Solmes.
            And what did you intend to do to Mr. Solmes?
            Not the least hurt, had the man been passive.
            But had he <i>not</i> been passive, as you call it, what would you have done to Mr. Solmes?
            He was loth, he said, to tell me—Yet not the least hurt to his <i>person.</i>
            I repeated my question.
            If he must tell me, he only proposed to carry off the <i>poor fellow,</i> and to hide him for a month or two. And this he would have done, let what would have been the consequence.
            Was ever such a wretch heard of!—I sigh'd from the bottom of my heart.—But bid him proceed from the part I had interrupted him at.
               "I order'd the fellow, as I told you, Madam, said he, to keep within view of the garden-door: And if he found any parley between us, and any-body coming (before you could retreat undiscover'd) whose coming might be attended with violent effects, he would cry out; and this not only in order to save himself from their suspicions of him, but to give me warning to make off, and, if possible, to induce you [I own it, Madam] to go off with me, according to your own appointment. And I hope, all circumstances consider'd, and the danger I was in of losing you for ever, that the acknowlegement of <i>this</i> contrivance, or if you had <i>not</i> met me, <i>that</i> upon Solmes, will not procure me your hatred: For, had they come, as <i>I</i> expected, as well as <i>you,</i> what a despicable wretch had I been, could I have left you to the insults of a brother, and others of your family, whose mercy was cruelty, when they had <i>not</i> the pretence which this detected interview would have furnished them with!"
            What a wretch, said I!—But if, Sir, taking your <i>own</i> account of this strange matter to be fact, any-body were coming, how happen'd it, that I saw only that man Leman (for I <i>thought</i> it was he) out of the door, and at a distance, look after us?
            Very lucky! said he, putting his hand first in one pocket, then in another.—I hope I have not thrown it away—It is, perhaps, in the coat I had on yesterday—Little did I think it would be necessary to be produced—But I love to come to a demonstration whenever I can—I <i>may</i> be giddy—I <i>may</i> be heedless. I <i>am</i> indeed—But no man, as to <i>you,</i> Madam, ever had a sincerer heart.
            He then stepping to the parlour-door, called his servant to bring him the coat he had on yesterday.
            The servant did. And in the pocket, rumpled up as a paper he regarded not, he pulled out a letter,
written by that Joseph, dated Monday night; in which "he begs pardon for crying out so soon:" Says,
"That his fears of being discovered to act on both sides, had made him take the rushing of a little dog (that always follows him) thro' the phyllirea-hedge, for Betty's being at hand, or some of his masters: And that, when he found his mistake, he opened the door by his own key [Which the contriving wretch confessed he had furnished him with] and inconsiderately ran out in a hurry, to have apprised him, that his crying-out was owing to his fright only:"
And he added,
"that they were upon the hunt for me, by the time he returned."
            I shook my head—Deep! deep! deep! said I, at the best!—O Mr. Lovelace! God forgive and reform you!—But you are, I see plainly, upon the whole of your own account, a very artful, a very designing man.
            Love, my dearest life, is ingenious. Night and day have I racked my stupid brains [O Sir, thought I, not stupid! 'Twere well, perhaps, if they were] to contrive methods to prevent the sacrifice designed to be made of you, and the mischief that must have ensued upon it: So little hold in your affections: Such undeserved antipathy from your friends: So much danger of losing you for ever from <i>both</i> causes—I have not had, for the whole fortnight before last Monday, half an hour's rest at a time. And I own to you, Madam, that I should never have forgiven myself, had I omitted any contrivance or forethought, that would have prevented your return without me.
            Again I blamed myself for meeting him: And justly; for there were many chances to one, that I had <i>not</i> met him. And if I had not, all his fortnight's
contrivances, as to me, would have come to nothing; and, perhaps, I might nevertheless have escaped Solmes.
            Yet, had he resolved to come to Harlowe-Place with his friends, and been insulted, as he certainly would have been, what mischiefs might have followed!
            But his resolution to run away with, and to hide the poor Solmes for a month or so, O my dear! what a wretch have I let run away with <i>me,</i> instead of <i>him!</i>
            I asked him, If he thought such enormities as these, such defiances of the laws of society, would have passed unpunished?
            He had the assurance to say, with one of his usual gay airs, That he should by this means have disappointed his enemies, and saved me from a forced marriage. He had no pleasure in such desperate pushes. Solmes he would not have <i>personally</i> hurt. He must have fled his country for a time at least: And, truly, if he had been obliged to do so, as all his hopes of my favour must have been at an end, he would have had a fellow-traveller of his own sex out of our family, whom I little thought of.
            Was ever such a wretch!—To be sure he meant my brother!
            And such, Sir, said I, in high resentment, are the uses you make of your corrupt intelligencer—
               <i>My</i> corrupt intelligencer, Madam, interrupted he! He is to this hour your brother's as well as mine. By what I have ingenuously told you, you may see, who began this corruption. Let me assure you, Madam, that there are many free things, which I have been guilty of, as <i>reprizals,</i> which I would not have been the <i>aggressor</i> in.
            All that I shall further say on this head, Mr. Lovelace, is this: That as this vile double-faced wretch has probably been the cause of great mischief on both sides, and still continues, as you own, his wicked practices, it is but my duty to have my friends apprized,
what a creature he is, whom some of them encourage.
            What you please, Madam, as to that—My service and your brother's are now almost over for him. The fellow has made a good hand of it. He does not intend to stay long in his place. He is now actually in treaty for an inn, which will do his business for life. I can tell you further, that he makes love to your sister's Betty: And this by my advice. They will be marry'd, when he is established. An innkeeper's wife is every man's mistress; and I have a scheme in my head, to set some engines at work, to make her repent her saucy behaviour to you to the last day of her life.
            What a wicked schemer are you, Sir!—Who shall avenge upon you the still greater evils which <i>you</i> have been guilty of?—I forgive Betty with all my heart. She was not my servant; and but too probably, in what she did, obey'd the commands of her, to whom she owed duty, better than I obey'd those, to whom I owed more.
            No matter for that, the wretch said [To be sure, my dear, he must design to make me afraid of him] The decree was gone out—Betty must smart—Smart too by an act of her own choice. He lov'd, he said, to make bad people their own punishers.—Nay, Madam, excuse me; but if the fellow, if this Joseph, in your opinion, deserves punishment, mine is a complicated scheme; a man and his wife cannot well suffer separately, and it may come home to <i>him</i> too.—
            I had no patience with him. I told him so.—But, Sir, said I, I see what a man I am with. Your <i>rattle</i> warns me of the <i>snake.</i> And away I flung; leaving him seemingly vex'd, and in confusion.
            MY plaindealing with him, on seeing him again, and the free dislike I expressed to his ways, his manners, and his contrivances, as well as to his speeches, have obliged him to recollect himself a little. He will have it, that the menaces which he threw out just now against my brother and Mr. Solmes, are only the effect of an unmeaning pleasantry. He has too great a stake in his country, he says, to be guilty of such enterprizes, as should lay him under a necessity of quitting it for ever. Twenty things, particularly, he says, he has suffer'd Joseph Leman to tell of him, that were not and could not be true, in order to make himself formidable in some peoples eyes, and this purely with a view to prevent mischief. He is unhappy, as far as he knows, in a quick invention, in hitting readily upon expedients; and many things are reported of him which he never said, and many which he never did, and others which he has only talked of (as just now) and which he has forgot as soon as the words have passed his lips.
            This may be so, in part, my dear. No one man so young could be so wicked as he has been reported to be. But such a man at the head of such wretches as he is said to have at his beck, all men of fortune and fearlesness, and capable of such enterprizes as I have unhappily found him capable of, what is not to be apprehended from him!
            His carelessness about his character is one of his excuses: A very bad one. What hope can a woman have of a man, who values not his reputation?—These gay wretches may, in mix'd conversation, divert for an hour, or so:—But the man of probity, the man of virtue, is the man that is to be the partner for life. What woman, who could help it, would
submit it to the courtesy of a wretch, who avows a disregard to all moral sanctions, whether he will perform his part of the matrimonial obligation, and treat her with tolerable politeness?
            With these notions, and with these reflections, to be thrown upon such a man myself—Would to Heaven—But what avail wishes now?—To whom can I fly, if I would fly from him?

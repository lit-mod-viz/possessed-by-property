                            <i>Monday Morn. May</i> 22.                   NO generosity in this lady. None at all. Wouldst thou not have thought, that after I had permitted her to withdraw, primed for mischief as I was, that she would meet me next morning early; and that with a smile; making me one of her best courtesies?                   I was in the dining-room before six, expecting her. She opened not her door. I went up-stairs and down, and hemm'd, and called Will. called Dorcas: Threw the doors hard to; but still she opened not her door. Thus till half an hour after eight, fooled I away my time; and then, breakfast ready, I sent Dorcas to request her company.                   But I was astonished, when, following the wench at the first invitation, I saw her enter dressed, all but her gloves, and those and her fan in her hand; in the same moment, bidding Dorcas direct Will. to get her a chair to the door.                   Cruel creature, thought I, to expose me thus to the derision of the women below!                   Going abroad, Madam?                   I am, Sir.                   I looked cursed silly, I am sure.ÑYou will breakfast first, I hope, Madam, in a very humble strain: Yet with an hundred tenter-hooks in my heart.                   Had she given me more notice of her intention, I had perhaps wrought myself up to the frame I was in the day before, and begun my vengeance. And immediately came into my head all the virulence that had been transcribed for me from Miss Howe's letters, and in that I had transcribed myself.                   Yes, she would drink one dish; and then laid her gloves and fan in the window just by.                   I was perfectly disconcerted. I hemm'd and haw'd, and was going to speak several times; but knew not in what key. Who's modest now, thought I! Who's insolent now!ÑHow a tyrant of a woman confounds a bashful man!ÑShe was my Miss Howe, I thought; and I the spiritless Hickman.                   At last, I <i>will</i> begin, thought I.                   She a dishÑI a dish.                   Sip, her eyes her own, she; like an haughty and imperious sovereign, conscious of dignity, every look a favour.                   Sip, like her vassal, I; lips and hands trembling, and not knowing that I sipp'd or tasted.                   I wasÑI wasÑIffp'dÑdrawing in my breath and the liquor together, tho' I scalded my mouth with itÑI was in hopes, MadamÑ                   Dorcas came in just then.ÑDorcas, said she, is a chair gone for?                   Damn'd impertinence, thought I, putting me out of my speech! And I was forced to wait for the servant's answer to the insolent mistress's question.                        William is gone for one, Madam.                   This cost me a minute's silence before I could begin again.ÑAnd then it was with my hopes, and my hopes, and my hopes, that I should have been early admitted toÑ                   What weather is it, Dorcas? said she, as regardless of me, as if I had not been present.                   A little lowering, MadamÑThe sun is gone inÑIt was very fine half an hour ago.                   I had no patienceÑUp I rose. Down went the tea-cup, saucer and all.ÑConfound the weather, the sunshine, and the wench!ÑBegone for a devil, when I am speaking to your lady, and have so little opportunity given me.                   Up rose the lady, half frighted; and snatched from the window her gloves and fan.                   You must not go, Madam!ÑBy my soul, you must notÑTaking her hand.                      <i>Must not,</i> Sir!ÑBut I mustÑYou can curse your maid in my absence, as well as if I were presentÑExceptÑExceptÑyou intend for <i>me,</i> what you direct to <i>her.</i>                   Dearest creature, you must not go!ÑYou must not leave me!ÑSuch determined scorn! Such contempts!ÑQuestions ask'd your servant of no meaning but to break in upon me; who could-bear it?                   Detain me not, struggling.ÑI will not be withhld.ÑI like you not, nor your ways.ÑYou sought to quarrel with me yesterday, for no reason in the world that I can think of, but because I was too obliging. You are an ingrateful man; and I hate you with my whole heart, Mr. Lovelace!                   Do not make me desperate, Madam.ÑPermit me to say, that you shall not leave me in this humour. Where-ever you go, I will attend you.ÑHad Miss Howe been my friend, I had not been thus treated.ÑIt is but too plain to whom my difficulties are owing. I have long observed, that every letter you receive from her, makes an alteration in your behaviour to me. She would have <i>you</i> treat <i>me,</i> as <i>she</i> treats Mr. Hickman, I suppose: But neither does that treatment become your admirable temper to offer, nor me to receive.                   This startled her. She did not care to have me think hardly of Miss Howe.                   But recollecting herself, Miss Howe, said she, is a friend to virtue, and to good men.ÑIf she like not you, it is because you are not one of those.                   Yes, Madam; and therefore, to speak of Mr. Hickman and Myself, as you both, I suppose, think of each, she treats <i>him</i> as she would not treat a <i>Lovelace.</i>ÑI challenge you, Madam, to shew me but one of the many letters you have received from her, where I am mentioned.                   Whither will this lead us? replied she. Miss Howe is just; Miss Howe is good.ÑShe writes, she speaks, of every-body as they deserve. If you point me out but any one occasion, upon which you have reason to build a merit to yourself, as either just or good, or even generous, I will look out for her letter on that occasion (if it be one I have acquainted her with); and will engage it shall be in your favour.                   Devilish severe! And as indelicate as severe, to put a modest man upon hunting backward after his own merits.                   She would have flung from me: I <i>will</i> go out, Mr. Lovelace. I will <i>not</i> be detained.                   Indeed you must not, Madam, in this humour. And I placed myself between her and the door.ÑAnd then she threw herself into a chair, fanning herself, her sweet face all crimsoned over with passion.                   I cast myself at her feet.ÑBegone, Mr. Lovelace, said she, with a rejecting motion, her fan in her hand; for your own sake leave me!ÑMy soul is above thee, man! With both her hands pushing me from her!ÑUrge me not to tell thee, how sincerely I think my soul above thee!ÑThou hast a proud, a too proud heart, to contend with!ÑLeave me, and leave me for ever!ÑThou hast a proud heart to contend with!                   Her air, her manner, her voice, were bewitchingly noble, tho' her words were so severe.                   Let me worship an angel, said I, no woman. Forgive me, dearest creature!ÑCreature if you be, forgive me!ÑForgive my inadvertencies! Forgive my inequalities!ÑPity my infirmity!ÑWho is equal to my Clarissa?                   I trembled between admiration and love; and wrapt my arms about her knees, as she sat. She try'd to rise at the moment; but my clasping round her thus ardently, drew her down again; and never was woman more affrighted. But free as my clasping emotion might appear to her apprehensive heart, I had not, at the instant, any thought but what reverence inspired. And till she had actually withdrawn (which I permitted under promise of a speedy return, and on her consent to dismiss the chair), all the motions of my heart were as pure as her own.                   She kept not her word. An hour I waited, before I sent to claim her promise. She could not possibly see me yet, was the answer. As soon as she could, she would.                   Dorcas says, she still excessively trembled; and ordered her to give her water and hartshorn.                   A strange apprehensive creature!ÑHer terror is too great for the occasion.ÑEvils in apprehension are often greater than evils in reality. Hast thou never observed, that the terrors of a bird caught, and actually in the hand, bear no comparison to what we might have supposed those terrors would be, were we to have formed a judgment of the same bird by its shyness before taken?                   Dear creature!ÑDid she never romp? Did she never from girlhood to now, hoyden? The <i>innocent</i> kinds of freedom taken and all owed on these occasions, would have familiarized her to greater. Sacrilege but to touch the hem of her garment!ÑExcess of delicacy!ÑO the consecrated beauty!ÑHow can she think to be a wife!                   But how do I know till I try, whether she may not by a less alarming treatment be prevailed upon, or whether [Day, I have done with thee!] she may not yield to nightly surprizes? This is still the burden of my song, I can marry her when I will. And if I do, after prevailing (whether by surprize or reluctant consent) whom but myself shall I have injured?                   IT is now eleven o'clock. She will see me as soon as she can, she tells Polly Horton, who made her a tender visit, and to whom she is less reserved than to any-body else. Her emotion, she assures her, was not owing to perverseness, to nicety, to ill-humour; but to <i>weakness of heart.</i> She has not <i>strength of mind</i> sufficient, she says, to enable her to support her condition, and her apprehensions, under the weight of a father's curse; which she fears is more than beginning to operate.                   Yet what a contradiction!Ñ<i>Weakness of heart,</i> says she, with such a <i>strength of will!</i>ÑO Belford! she is a lion-hearted lady, in every case where her honour, her punctilio rather, calls for spirit. But I have had reason more than once in her case, to conclude, that the passions of the gentlest, slower to be moved than those of the quick, are the most flaming, the most irresistible, when raised.ÑYet her charming body is not equally organized. The unequal partners pull two ways; and the divinity within her tears her silken frame. But had the same soul informed a masculine body, never would there have been a truer hero.

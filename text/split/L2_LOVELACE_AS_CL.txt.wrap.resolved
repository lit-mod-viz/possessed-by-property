 <i>Hamstead,</i>                            <i>Tuesday evening.</i>                      My ever-dear Miss Howe,                   A Few lines only, till calmer spirits and quieter fingers be granted me, and till I can get over the shock which your intelligence has given me--To acquaint you--that your kind long letter of Wednesday, and, as I may say, of Thursday morning, is come safe to my hands. On receipt of yours by my messenger to yours, I sent for my messenger from Wilson's. There, thank heaven! my messenger lay. May that heaven reward you for all your past, and for all your <i>intended</i> goodness to                      Your for-ever obliged, <i>CL. HARLOWE.</i>

                        Sunday, Four o'Clock, P. M.                   MY letter is not yet taken away!ÑIf P. M.                   MY should not send for P. M.                   MY letter, or take P. M.                   MY letter, and come hither on my not meeting P. M.                   MY to-morrow, in doubt of what may have befallen me, what shall I do? Why had I any concerns with this Sex!ÑI, that was so happy till I knew This man!                   I din'd in the Ivy summer-house. It was comply'd with at the first word. To shew I meant nothing, I went again into the Ivy summer-house with Betty, as soon as I had dined. I thought it was not amiss to ask this liberty; the weather seeming to be set in fine. One does not know what Tuesday or Wednesday may produce.

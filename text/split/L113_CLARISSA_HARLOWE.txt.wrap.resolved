                        Nine o'Clock.                   MY cousin Dolly Hervey slid the inclosed letter into my hand, as I passed by MY cousin Dolly Hervey, coming out of the garden.                        When I first read my cousin's letter, I was half inclin'd to resume my former intention; especially as my countermanding letter is not taken away: And as my heart akes at the thoughts of the conflict I must expect to have with my cousin on my refusal. For, see my cousin for a few moments I doubt I must, lest my cousin should take some rash resolutions; especially, as my cousin has reason to expect I will. But here your words, <i>That all punctilio is at an end, the moment I am out of my father's house,</i> added to the still more cogent considerations of Duty and Reputation, determin'd me once more against taking the rash step. And it will be very hard (altho' no seasonable fainting, or wish'd-for fit, should stand my friend) if I cannot gain one month, or fortnight, or week. And I have still more hopes that I shall prevail for some delay, from my cousin's intimation, that the good Doctor Lewin refuses to give Lewin assistance to their projects, if their have not my consent, and thinks me cruelly used: Since, without taking notice that I am apprized of this, I can plead a scruple of conscience, and insist upon having that worthy Divine's opinion upon it: Which, inforced as I shall inforce it, my mamma will surely second me in: My aunt Hervey, and my Mrs. Norton, will support <i>her:</i> The suspension must follow: And I can but get away afterwards.                   But, if they <i>will</i> compel me: If they <i>will</i> compel me give me no time: If no-body <i>will</i> be moved: If no-body <i>will</i> be moved be resolved that the ceremony shall be read over my constrained handÑWhy thenÑAlas! What then!ÑI can butÑBut what? O my dear! This Solmes shall never have my vows I am resolved! And I will say nothing but No, as long as I shall be able to speak. And who will presume to look upon such an act of violence, as a marriage?ÑIt is impossible, surely, that a father and mother can see such a dreadful compulsion offer'd to a father and mother childÑBut if mine should withdraw, and leave the task to my brother and sister, a father and mother will have no mercy!                   I am griev'd to be driven to have recourse to the following artifices.                   I have given a father and mother a clue, by the feather of a pen sticking out, where a father and mother will find such of my hidden stores, as I intend a father and mother shall find.                   Two or three little essays I have left easy to be seen, of my own writing.                   About a dozen lines also of a letter begun to you, in which I express my hopes, (altho' I say, that appearances are against me) that my friends will relent. my friends know from your mamma, by my uncle Antony, that, some how or other, I now and then get a letter to my uncle Antony. In this piece of a letter, I declare renewedly my firm resolution to give up the man so obnoxious to my family, on my family releasing me from the address of the other.                   Near the essays, I have left a copy of my letter to Lady Drayton; which, affording arguments suitable to my case, may chance (thus accidentally to be fallen upon) to incline Lady Drayton; which, affording arguments suitable to my case, may chance (thus accidentally to be fallen upon) to favour me.                   I have reserves of pens and ink you may believe; and one or two in the Ivy summer-house; with which I shall amuse myself in order to lighten, if possible, those apprehensions which more and more affect me as Wednesday the day of trial approaches.

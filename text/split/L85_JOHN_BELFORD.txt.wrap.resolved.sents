 <i>Soho,</i>                            <i>Six o'clock, Sept.</i> 7.
THE Lady is still alive.
The Colonel having just sent The Colonel servant to let me know, that THE Lady inquired after The Colonel about an hour ago, I am dressing to attend THE Lady.
Joel begs of The Colonel to dispatch Joel back, tho' but with one line to gratify your present impatience.
Joel expects, Joel says, to find you at Knightsbridge, let Joel make what haste Joel can back; and if Joel has not a line or two to pacify you, Joel is afraid you will pistol Joel; for Joel apprehends that you are hardly yourself.
I therefore dispatch this; and will have another ready as soon as I can, with particulars.
But you must have a little patience; for how can I withdraw every half hour to write, if I am admitted to the Lady's presence, or if I am with the Colonel?

                  Ivy summer-house, Eleven o'Clock.             HE has not yet got my letter: And while I was contriving here, how to send my officious gaoleress from me, that I might have time for the intended interview, and had hit upon an expedient, which I believe would have done, came my aunt, and furnish'd me with a much better. She saw my little table covered, preparative to my solitary dinner; and hoped, she told me, that this would be the last day, that my friends would be deprived of my company at table.             You may believe, my dear, that the thoughts of meeting Mr. Lovelace, the fear of being discover'd, together with the contents of my cousin Dolly's letter, gave me great and visible emotions. She took notice of them:ÑWhy these sighs, why these heavings here, said she, patting my neck?ÑO my dear niece, who would have thought so much natural sweetness could be so very unpersuadable?             I could not answer her, and she proceeded.ÑI am come, I doubt, upon a very unwelcome errand. Some things that have been told us yesterday, which came from the mouth of one of the most desperate and insolent men in the world, convince your father, and all of us, that you still find means to write out of the house. Mr. Lovelace knows every-thing that is done here; and that as soon as done; and great mischief is apprehended from him, which you are as much concerned as any-body, to prevent. Your mamma has also some apprehensions concerning yourself, which yet she hopes are groundless; but, however, cannot be easy, nor will be permitted to be easy, if she would, unless (while you remain here in the garden, or in this summer-house) you give her the opportunity once more of looking into your closet, your cabinet, and drawers. It will be the better taken, if you give me chearfully your keys. I hope, my dear, you won't dispute it. Your desire of dining in this place was the more readily comply'd with, for the sake of such an opportunity.             I thought myself very lucky, to be so well prepared, by my cousin Dolly's means, for this search: But yet I artfully made some scruples, and not a few complaints of this treatment: After which, I not only gave her the keys of all; but even officiously empty'd my pockets before her, and invited her to put her fingers in my stays, that she might be sure that I had no papers there.             This highly obliged her; and she said, She would represent my chearful compliance as it deserved, <i>let my brother and sister say what they would.</i> My mamma, in particular, she was sure, would rejoice at the opportunity given her to obviate, as she doubted not would be the case, some suspicions that were raised against me.             She then hinted, That there were methods taken to come at all Mr. Lovelace's secrets, and even, from his careless communicativeness, at some of <i>mine</i>; it being, she said, his custom, boastingly to prate to his very servants of his intentions, in particular cases. She added, that, deep as he was thought to be, my brother was as deep as he; and fairly too hard for him at his own weapons;Ñas one day it would be found.             I knew not, I said, the meaning of these dark hints. I thought the cunning she hinted at, on <i>both</i> sides, called rather for contempt than applause. I myself might have been put upon artifices which my heart disdained to practise, had I given way to the resentment, which, I was bold to say, was much more justifiable than the actions that occasion'd it: That it was evident to me, from what she had said, that their present suspicions of me were partly owing to this supposed superior cunning of my brother; and partly to the consciousness, that the usage I met with might naturally produce a reason for such suspicions: That it was very unhappy for me, to be made the butt of my brother's wit: That it would have been more to his praise, to have aimed at shewing a kind heart, than a cunning head: That, nevertheless, I wished, he knew <i>himself</i> as well as I imagin'd <i>I</i> knew him; and he would then have less conceit of his abilities: Which abilities would, in my opinion, be less thought of, if his power to do ill offices were not much greater than them.             I was vex'd. I could not help making this reflection. The dupe the other, too probably, makes of him, thro' his own spy, deserv'd it. But I so little approve of this low art in either, that were I but tolerably used, the vileness of that man, that Joseph Leman, should be inquired into.             She was sorry, she said, to find, that I thought so disparagingly of my brother. He was a young gentleman both of learning and parts.             Learning enough, I said, to make him vain of it among us women: But not of parts sufficient to make his learning valuable either to himself, or to any-body else.Ñ             She wished, indeed, that he had more good-nature: But she feared, that I had too great an opinion of somebody else, to think so well of my brother, as a sister ought: Since, between the two, there was a sort of rivalry as to abilities, that made them hate one another.                <i>Rivalry,</i> Madam, said I!ÑIf that be the case, or whether it be or not, I wish they both understood better than either of them seems to do, what it becomes gentlemen, and men of liberal education, to be, and to do.ÑNeither of them, then, would glory in what they ought to be ashamed of.             But waving this subject, it was not impossible, I said, that they might find a little of my writing, and a pen or two, and a little ink [Hated art!Ñor rather, hateful the necessity for it!], as I was not permitted to go up to put them out of the way: But, if they did, I must be contented. And I assured her, that, tke what time they pleased, I would not go in to disturb them, but would be either in or near the garden, in this summer-house, or in the cedar one, about my poultry-yard, or near the great cascade, till I was order'd to return to my prison. With like cunning I said, that I supposed the unkind search would not be made, till the servants had dined; because I doubted not, that the pert Betty Barnes, who knew all the corners of my apartment and closet, would be imploy'd in it.             She hoped, she said, that nothing could be found that would give a handle against me: For, she would assure me, the motives to the search, on my mamma's part especially, were, that she hoped to find reason rather to acquit than to blame me; and that my papa might be induced to see me to-morrow night, or Wednesday morning, with temper: With <i>tenderness,</i> I should rather say, said she; for he is resolved so to do, if no new offence be given.             Ah! Madam, said I!Ñ             Why that Ah, Madam, and shaking your head so significantly?             I wish, Madam, that I may not have more reason to dread my papa's continued displeasure, than to hope for his returning tenderness.             You don't <i>know,</i> my dear!ÑThings may take a turnÑThings may not be so bad as you fearÑ             Dearest Madam, have you any consolation to give me?Ñ             Why, my dear, it is possible, that <i>you</i> may be more compliable than you have been.             Why raised you my hopes, Madam!ÑDon't let me think my dear aunt Hervey cruel to a niece who truly honours her.             I may tell you more perhaps, said she, (but in confidence, in absolute confidence) if the inquiry within come out in your favour. Do you know of any-thing above, that can be found to your disadvantage?             Some papers they will find, I doubt: But I must take consequences. My brother and sister will be at hand with their good-natured constructions. I am made desperate, and care not what is found.             She hoped, she <i>earnestly</i> hoped, she said, that nothing could be found, that would impeach my discretion; and thenÑBut she might say too muchÑ             And away she went, having added to my perplexity.             But I now can think of nothing but this man!ÑThis interview!ÑWould to Heaven it were over!ÑTo meet to quarrelÑBut I will not stay a moment with him, let him take what measures he will upon it, if he be not quite calm and resigned.             Don't you see how crooked some of my lines are? Don't you see how some of the letters stagger, more than others!ÑThat is when this interview is more in my head, than my subject.             But, after all, should I, <i>ought</i> I, to meet him? How I have taken it for granted, that I should!ÑI wish there were time to take your advice. Yet you are so loth to speak <i>quite</i> out!ÑBut that I owe, as you own, to the difficulty of my situation.             I should have mentioned, that in the course of this conversation I besought my aunt to stand my friend, and to put in a word for me, on my approaching trial; and to endeavour to procure me time for consideration, if I could obtain nothing else.             She told me, that, after the ceremony was perform'd [odious confirmation of a hint in my cousin Dolly's letter!] I should have what time I pleased to reconcile myself to my lot, before cohabitation.             This put me out of all patience.             She requested of me in <i>her</i> turn, she said, that I would resolve to meet them all with chearful duty, and with a spirit of absolute acquiescence. It was in my power to make them all happy. And how affectingly joyful would it be to her, she said, to see my father, my mother, my uncles, my brother, my sister, all embracing me with raptures, and folding me by turns to their fond hearts, and congratulating each other on their restored happiness. Her own joy, she said, would probably make her motionless and speechless, for a time: And for her DollyÑthe poor girl, who had suffer'd in the esteem of some, for her <i>grateful</i> attachment to me, would have every-body love her again.             Will you doubt, my dear, that my next trial will be the most affecting that I have yet had?             My aunt set forth all this in so strong a light, and I was so particularly touched on my cousin Dolly's account, that, impatient as I was just before, I was greatly moved: Yet could only shew by my sighs and my tears, how desirable such an event would be to me, could it be brought about upon conditions with which it was possible for me to comply.             Here comes Betty Barnes with my dinnerÑ             The wench is gone. The time of meeting is at hand. O that he may not come!ÑBut should I, or should I not, meet him?ÑHow I question, without possibility of a timely answer!             Betty, according to my leading hint to my aunt, boasted to me, that she was to be <i>imploy'd,</i> as she called it, after she had eat her own dinner.             She should be sorry, she told me, to have me found out. Yet 'twould be all for my good: I should have it in my power to be forgiven for all at once, before Wednesday night. The Confidence then, to stifle a laugh, put a corner of her apron in her mouth, and went to the door: And on her return, to take away, as I angrily bid her, she begg'd my excuse.ÑButÑButÑand then the saucy creature laugh'd again, she could not help it; to think how I had drawn myself in by my summer-house dinnering; since it had given so fine an opportunity, by way of surprize, to look into all my private hoards. She thought something was in the wind, when my brother came into my dining here so readily. Her young master was too hard for every-body. 'Squire Lovelace himself was nothing at all at a quick thought, to her young master.             My aunt mention'd Mr. Lovelace's boasting behaviour to <i>his</i> servants: Perhaps he <i>may</i> be so mean. But as to my brother, he always took a pride in making himself appear to be a man of parts and learning to our servants. <i>Pride</i> and <i>Meanness,</i> I have often thought, are as nearly ally'd, and as close borderers upon each other, as the poet tells us <i>Wit</i> and <i>Madness</i> are.             But why do I trouble you (and myself, at such a crisis) with these impertinencies?ÑYet I would forget, if I could, the nearest evil, the interview; because, my apprehensions increasing, as the hour is at hand, I should, were my attention to be ingrossed by them, be unfit to see him, if he does come: And then he will have too much advantage over me, as he will have seeming reason to reproach me with change of resolution.             The <i>upbraider,</i> you know, my dear, is in some sense a superior; while the <i>upbraided,</i> if with reason upbraided, must make a figure as spiritless as conscious.             I know that this wretch will, if he <i>can,</i> be his own judge, and <i>mine</i> too. But the latter he shall <i>not</i> be.             I dare say, we shall be all to pieces. But I don't care for that. It would be hard, if I, who have held it out so sturdily to my father and uncles, should notÑBut he is at the garden-doorÑ             I was mistaken!ÑHow may noises <i>un</i>-like, be made <i>like</i> what one fears!ÑWhy flutters the fool so!Ñ             I will hasten to deposite this. Then I will, for the last time, go to the usual place, in hopes to find, that he has got my letter. If he <i>has,</i> I will not meet him. If he has <i>not,</i> I will take it back, and shew him what I have written. That will break the ice, as I may say, and save me much circumlocution and reasoning: And a stedfast adherence to that my written mind is all that will be necessary.ÑThe interview must be as short as possible; for should it be discover'd, it would furnish a new and strong pretence for the intended evil of Wednesday next.             Perhaps I shall not be able to write again one while. Perhaps not, till I am the miserable property of that Solmes!ÑBut that shall never, never be, while I have my senses.             If your servant find nothing from me by Wednesday morning, you may conclude, that I can then neither write to you, nor receive your favours.Ñ             In that case, pity and pray for me, my beloved friend, and continue to me that place in your affection, which is the pride of my life, and the only comfort left to                Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.

<i>M. Hall,</i>                            <i>Friday, Sept.</i> 15.                     SIR,                   MY Lord having the gout in his right-hand, his Lordship, and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, have commanded me to inform you, that before your letter came Mr. Lovelace was preparing for a foreign tour. We shall endeavour to hasten him away on the motives you suggest.                   We are all extremely affected with the dear lady's death. Lady Betty and Lady Sarah have been indisposed ever since they heard of it. They had pleased themselves, as had my sister and self, with the hopes of cultivating her acquaintance and friendship after he was gone abroad, upon her own terms. Her kind remembrance of each of us has renewed, tho' it could not heighten, our regrets for so irreparable a loss. We shall order Mr. Finch, our goldsmith, to wait on you. He has our directions about the rings. They will be long, long worn in memory of the dear testatrix.                   Every-body is assured, that you will do all in your power to prevent <i>farther</i> ill consequences from this melancholy affair. My Lord desires his compliments to you. I am, SIR,                      Your humble Servant, <i>CH. MONTAGUE.</i>

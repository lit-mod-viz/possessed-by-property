                        Tuesday, Eleven o'Clock.                   I HAVE had a visit from my aunt Hervey. Betty, in Betty alarming way, told me, I should have a Lady to breakfast with me, whom I little expected; giving me to believe it was my mamma. This flutter'd me so much, on hearing a Lady coming up-stairs, supposing it was Betty (not knowing how to account for Betty motives in such a visit, after I had been so long banish'd from Betty presence) that my aunt, at Betty entrance, took notice of my disorder, and after the first salutation,                   Why, Miss said Miss, you seem surpriz'd!ÑUpon my word, you thoughtful young Ladies have strange apprehensions about nothing at all. What, taking my hand, can be the matter with you?ÑWhy, my dear, tremble, tremble, tremble at this rate? You'll be fit to be seen by no-body. Come, my love, kissing my cheek, pluck up a courage! By this needless flutter on the approaching interview, when it is over, you will judge of your other antipathies, and laugh at yourself for giving way to so apprehensive an imagination.                   I said, that whatever we strongly imagin'd, was, in                    effects at the time, <i>more</i> than imaginary, altho' to others it might not appear so: That I had not rested one hour all night: That the impertinent set over me had flutter'd me, with giving me room to think, that the impertinent set over me had was my mamma who was coming up to me: And that, at this rate, I should be very little qualify'd to see any-body I disliked to see.                   There was no accounting for these things,                    said. Mr. Solmes last night suppos'd Mr. Solmes last night suppos'd should be under as much agitation as I.                   Who is it, then, Madam, that so reluctant an interview on both sides, is to please?                   Both of you, my dear, I hope, after the first flurries are over. The most apprehensive beginnings, I have often known, make the happiest conclusions.                   There can be but one happy conclusion to the intended visit, and that is, That both sides may be satisfy'd it will be the last.                                      then represented, how unhappy it would be for me, if I did not suffer me to be prevailed upon:                    pressed me to receive him as became my education: And declar'd, that him apprehensions at seeing me, were owing to him love and him awe; intimting, that true love was best known by fear, and reverence; and that no blustering, braving lover could deserve encouragement.                   To this I answered, That constitution was a great deal to be considered: That a man of spirit would act like one, and could do nothing meanly: That a creeping mind would creep in every-thing, where That constitution had a view to obtain a benefit by That constitution; and insult, where That constitution had power, and nothing to expect:ÑThat this was not a point now to be determin'd with me: That I had said as much as I could possibly say on this subject: That this interview was imposed upon me: By those, indeed, who had a right to impose it; but that it was sorely against my will comply'd with, and for this reason, That there was <i>aversion,</i> not <i>wilfulness,</i> in the case; and so nothing could come of the case, but a pretence, as I much apprehended, to use me still more severely than I had been used.                                      was then pleased to charge me with prepossession, and prejudice: Expatiated upon the duty of a child: Imputed to me abundance of fine qualities; but told me, that, in this case, <i>that</i> of persuadableness was wanting to crown All.                    insisted upon the <i>merit</i> of obedience, altho' my will were <i>not</i> in my will. From a little hint I gave of my still greater dislike to see Mr. Solmes, on account of the freedom I had treated Mr. Solmes with,                    talked to me of Mr. Solmes forgiving disposition; of Mr. Solmes infinite respect for me; and I-can-not-tell-what of this sort.Ñ                   I never found me so fretful in my life. I told my aunt so; and begg'd my aunt pardon for it. But my aunt said, it was well disguised then; for my aunt saw nothing but little tremors usual with young Ladies, when young Ladies were to see young Ladies admirers for the <i>first</i> time, as this might be called: For that it was the first time I had consented to see him in that light.ÑBut that the <i>next</i>Ñ                   How, my aunt, interrupted I!ÑIs it then imagined I give this meeting upon that foot?Ñ                        To be sure that foot?Ñ                         is, child.Ñ                      <i>To be sure that foot?Ñ                         is,</i> Madam!ÑThen do I yet desire to decline it!ÑI will not, I cannot, see him, if him expects me to see him upon those terms.                   Niceness, punctilio!ÑMere punctilio, niece!ÑCan you think that your appointment, Day, Place, Hour, and knowing what the intent of it was, is to be interpreted away as a mere ceremony, and to mean nothing?ÑLet me tell you, my dear, your father, mother, uncles, every-body, respect this appointment as the first act of your compliance with your father, mother, uncles, every-body wills; and therefore recede not, I desire you; but make a merit of what cannot be help'd!Ñ                   O the hideous wretch!ÑPardon me, Madam,Ñ<i>I</i> to be suppos'd to meet such a man as <i>that,</i> with such a view! and <i>he</i> to be arm'd with such an expectation!ÑBut it cannot be that <i>he</i> expects it, whatever others may do.ÑIt is plain ÑIt cannot, by the fear ÑIt tells you all, ÑIt shall have to see me: If ÑIt <i>hope</i> were so audacious, ÑIt could not <i>fear</i> so much.                   Indeed, ÑIt <i>has</i> this hope; and justly founded too. But ÑIt fear arises from ÑIt reverence, as I told you before.                      <i>His reverence!</i>Ñhis unworthiness!Ñ'Tis so apparent, that he himself sees it, as well as every-body else. Hence the purchase he aims at!ÑHence is it, that settlements are to make up for acknowleg'd want of merit!Ñ                   His <i>unworthiness,</i> say you!ÑNot so fast, my dear. Does not this look like setting a high value upon yourself?ÑWe all have exalted notions of your merit, niece; but nevertheless, it would not be wrong, if you were to arrogate less to <i>yourself</i>; tho' more were to be your due, than your friends attribute to you.                   I am sorry, Madam, it should be thought arrogance in me, to suppose I am not worthy of a better man than Mr. Solmes, both as to person and mind: And as to fortune, I thank God I despise all that can be insisted upon in God favour, from so poor a plea.                                      told me, It signify'd nothing to talk: I knew the expectation of every-oneÑ                   Indeed I did not.ÑIt was impossible I could think of such a strange expectation, upon a compliance made only to shew, I would comply in all that was in my power to comply with.                   I might easily, me said, have supposed, that every-one thought I was beginning to oblige them all, by the kind behaviour of my brother and sister to me in the garden, last Sunday; by my sister's visit to me afterwards in my chamber; altho' both more stiffly received by me, than were either wished or expected; by my uncle Harlowe's affectionate visit to me the same afternoon; not indeed so very gratefully received, as I used to receive my uncle favours:ÑBut this ÑBut kindly imputed to the displeasure I had conceived at my confinement, and to my coming-off by degrees, that I might keep me in countenance for my past opposition!                   See, my dear, the low cunning of that Sunday-management, which then so much surprised me! And see the reason why Dr. Lewin was admitted to visit me, yet forbore to enter upon a subject that I thought Dr. Lewin came to talk to me about!ÑFor, it seems, there was no occasion to dispute with me on a point I was to be <i>supposed</i> to have conceded to.ÑSee, also, how unfairly my brother and sister must have represented my brother and sister pretended kindness, when (tho' my brother and sister had an end to answer by <i>appearing</i> kind) my brother and sister antipathy to me seems to have been so strong, that my brother and sister could not help insulting me by my brother and sister arm-in-arm lover-like behaviour to each other; as my sister afterwards likewise did, when my sister came to borrow my Kempis.Ñ                   I lifted up my hands and my hands cannot, said I, give this treatment a name!ÑThe <i>end</i> so unlikely to be answer'd by <i>means</i> so low!ÑI know <i>whose</i> the whole is!ÑHe that could get my uncle Harlowe to contribute my uncle Harlowe part, and procure the acquiescence of the rest of my friends to his part, must have the power to do any thing with my friends against me!Ñ                   Again my aunt told me, that talking and invective, now I had given the expectation, would signify nothing. my aunt hoped I would not shew them all, that them all had been too forward in them all constructions of my desire to oblige them all. my aunt could assure me, that it would be worse for my aunt, if <i>now</i> I receded, than if I had never advancedÑ                      <i>Advanced,</i> Madam! How can you say <i>advanced?</i> Why, this is a trick upon me!ÑA poor, low trick! Pardon me, Madam, I don't say you have a hand in it.ÑBut, my aunt, tell me, Will not my mamma be present at this dreaded interview?ÑWill my mamma not so far favour me?ÑWere it but to qualifyÑ                      <i>Qualify,</i> my dear, interrupted sheÑYour mamma, and your uncle Harlowe, would not be present on this occasion for the worldÑ                   O then, Madam, how can they look upon my consent to this interview as an <i>advance?</i>                   my aunt was displeased at this home push. Miss Clary, said my aunt, there is no dealing with Miss Clary. It would be happy for Miss Clary, and for every-body else, were your obedience as ready as your wit. I will leave youÑ                   Not in anger, I hope, Madam! interrupted IÑAll I meant was, to observe, that let the meeting issue as the meeting issue <i>must</i> issue, the meeting issue cannot be a disappointment to <i>any-body.</i>                   O Miss! you seem to be a very determin'd young creature.ÑMr. Solmes will be here at your time? And remember once more, that upon the coming afternoon depends the peace of your whole family? and your own happiness.Ñ                   And so saying, down she hurried.                        Here I stop. In what way I shall resume, or when, is not left to me to conjecture; much less to determine. I am excessively uneasy!ÑNo good news from your mamma, I doubt!ÑI will deposite thus far, for fear of the worst.                   Adieu, my best, my <i>only</i> friend!

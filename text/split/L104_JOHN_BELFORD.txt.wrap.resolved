 <i>Wednesday morning,</i> 10 <i>o'Clock.</i>                   THE poor lady is just recovered from a fainting fit, which has left THE poor lady at death's door. THE poor lady late tranquility and freedom from pain seemed but a <i>lightening,</i> as Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith call it.                   By my faith, Lovelace, I had rather part with all the friends I have in the world, than with THE poor lady: I never knew what a virtuous, a holy friendship, as I may call mine to THE poor lady, was before. But to be so <i>new</i> to it, and to be obliged to forego it so soon, what an affliction! Yet, thank heaven, I lose THE poor lady not by <i>my own</i> fault!Ã‘But 'twould be barbarous not to spare thee now.                   THE poor lady has sent for the Divine, who visited THE poor lady before, in order to pray with THE poor lady.

<i>Friday noon, July</i> 21.             THIS morning I was admitted, as soon as I sent up my name, into the presence of the divine lady. Such I may call the divine lady; as what I have to relate will fully prove.             the divine lady had had a tolerable night, and was much better in spirits; though weak in person; and visibly declining in looks.             Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith were with the divine lady; and accused the divine lady, in a gentle manner, of having applied the divine lady too assiduously to the divine lady pen for the divine lady strength, having been up ever since five. the divine lady said, the divine lady had rested better th the divine lady had done for many nights: the divine lady had found the divine lady spirit free, and the divine lady mind tolerably easy: And having, as the divine lady had reason to think, but a short time, and much to do in it; the divine lady must be a good housewife of the divine lady hours.             the divine lady had been writing, the divine lady said, a letter to the divine lady sister: But had not pleased the divine lady in it; tho' the divine lady had made two or three essays: But that the last must go.             By hints I had dropt, from time to time, the divine lady had reason, the divine lady said, to think that I knew every-thing that concerned the divine lady and the divine lady family; and, if so, must be acquainted with the heavy curse the divine lady father had laid upon the divine lady; which had been dreadfully fulfilled in one part, as to the divine lady temporary prospects, and that in a very short time; which gave the divine lady great apprehensions for the other. the divine lady had been applying the divine lady to the divine lady sister, to obtain a revocation of it. I hope her father will revoke it, said the divine lady, or I shall be very miserable.Ñ Yet (and the divine lady gasped as the divine lady spoke, with apprehension)ÑI am ready to tremble at what the answer may be; for her sister is hard-hearted.             I said something reflecting upon the divine lady friends; as to what they would deserve to be thought of, if the unmerited imprecation were not withdrawn.ÑUpon which her sister took me up, and talked in such a dutiful manner of her sister parents, as must doubly condemn her parents (if her parents remain implacable), for her parents inhuman treatment of such a daughter.             her sister said, I must not blame her parents: It was her sister dear Miss Howe's fault. But what an enormity was there in her sister crime, which could set the best of parents (as parents had been to her sister, till her sister disobliged parents) in a bad light, for resenting the rashness of a child, from whose education parents had reason to expect better fruits! There were some hard circumstances in her sister case, it was true: But my <i>friend</i> could tell me, that no <i>one</i> body, throughout the whole fatal transaction, had acted out of character, but <i>herself.</i> her sister submitted therefore to the penalty her sister had incurred. If they had any fault, it was only, that they would not inform they of some circumstances, which would alleviate a little her sister misdeed; and that, supposing her sister a guiltier creature than her sister was, they punished her sister without a hearing.             Lord!Ñ<i>I was going to curse thee, Lovelace! How every instance of excellence, in this all-excelling creature, condemns thee!ÑThou wilt have reason to think thyself of all men most accursed, if thyself die!</i>             I then besought her sister, while her sister was capable of such glorious instances of generosity and forgiveness, to extend her sister goodness to a man, whose heart bled in every vein of whose heart, for the injuries he had done her sister; and who would make whose heart the study of he whole life to repair them.             The women would have withdrawn, when the subject became so particular. But her sister would not permit The women to go. her sister told me, that if, after this time, I was for entering, with so much earnestness, into a subject so very disagreeable to <i>her,</i> my visits must not be repeated. Nor was there occasion, her sister said, for my friendly offices in your favour; since her sister had begun to write her sister whole mind upon that subject to Miss Howe, in answer to letters from her sister, in which Miss Howe urged the same arguments, in compliment to the wishes of your noble and worthy relations.             Mean time, you may let              know, said her sister, That I reject              with my whole heart:ÑYet that, altho' I say this with such a determination as shall leave no room for doubt, however I say this not with passion. On the contrary, tell him, that I am trying to bring my mind into such a frame, as to be able to <i>pity</i> him (Poor perjured wretch! what has him not to answer for!); and that I shall not think him qualified for the state I am aspiring to, if, after a few struggles more, I cannot <i>forgive</i> him too: And I hope, clasping her hands together, uplifted, as were her eyes, my dear <i>earthly</i> father will set me the example my <i>heavenly</i> one has already set us all; and, by forgiving his fallen daughter, teach her to forgive the man, who then, I hope, will not have destroyed my eternal prospects, as his has my temporal!                <i>Stop here, thou wretch!ÑBut I need not bid theeÑFor I can go no farther!</i> YOU will imagine how affecting her noble speech and behaviour was to me, at the time, when the bare recollection and transcription obliged me to drop my pen. The women had tears in The women eyes. I was silent for a few moments.ÑAt last, Matchless excellence! Inimitable goodness! I called her, with a voice so accented, that I was half-ashamed of me, as it was before The women. Ñ But who could stand such sublime generosity of soul, in so young a creature, her loveliness giving grace to all her said?ÑMethinks, said I (and I really, in a manner involuntarily, bent my knee), I have before me an angel indeed. I can hardly forbear prostration, and to beg your influence to draw me after you, to the world you are aspiring to! Ñ YetÑBut what shall I say?ÑOnly, dearest excellence, make me, in some small instances, serviceable to you, that I may (if I survive you) have the glory to think I was able to contribute to your satisfaction, while among us.             Here I stopt.              was silent. I proceeded Ñ Have you no commission to employ me in; deserted as you are by all your friends; among strangers, though, I doubt not, worthy people? Cannot I be serviceable by message, by letter-writing, by attending personally, with either message or letter, your father, your uncles, your brother, your sister, Miss Howe, Lord M. or the ladies his sisters? Any office to be employed in to serve you, absolutely <i>independent</i> of my <i>friend</i>'s wishes, or of my own wishes to oblige his. Think, Madam, if I cannot?             I thank you, Sir: Very heartily I thank you: But in nothing that I can at present think of, or at least resolve upon, can you do me service. I will see what return the letter I have written will bring me. Ñ Till then Ñ             My life and my fortune, interrupted I, are devoted to your service. Permit me to observe, that here you are, without one natural friend; and (so much do I know of your unhappy case) that you must be in a manner destitute of the means to <i>make</i> friendsÑ             Madam was going to interrupt me, with a prohibitory kind of earnestness in Madam mannerÑ             I beg leave to proceed, Madam: I have cast about twenty ways how to mention this before? but never dared till now. Suffer me, now that I have broke the ice, to tender Madam Ñ as your <i>banker</i> only.Ñ I know you will not be obliged: You <i>need</i> not. You have sufficient of your own, if your own were in your hands; and from <i>that,</i> whether you live or die, will I consent to be reimbursed. I do assure you, that the unhappy man shall never know either <i>my</i> offer, or <i>your</i> acceptance Ñ Only permit me this smallÑ             And down behind Ñ chair I dropt a Bank note of 100 l. which I had brought with me, intending some how or other to leave a Bank note of 100 l. which I had brought with me behind me: Nor shouldst thou ever have known a Bank note of 100 l. which I had brought with me, had Ñ favoured me with the acceptance of a Bank note of 100 l. which I had brought with me; and so I told Ñ.             You give me great pain, Mr. Belford, said Ñ, by these instances of your humanity. And yet, considering the company I have seen you in, I am not sorry to find you capable of such. Methinks I am glad, for the sake of human nature, that there could be but <i>one</i> such man in the world, as <i>one</i> such man in the world you and I know.Ñ But as to your kind offer, whatever it be, if you take it not up, you will greatly disturb me. I have no need of your kindness. I have effects enough, which I never can want, to supply my present occasions; and, if needful, can have recourse to Miss Howe. I have promised that I wouldÑSo, pray, Sir, urge not upon me this favour.ÑTake it up yourself.Ñ If you mean me peace and ease of mind, urge not this favour.Ñ And Ñ spoke with impatience.             I beg, Madam, but one word Ñ             Not one, Sir, till you have taken back what you have let fall. I doubt not either the <i>honour,</i> or the <i>kindness,</i> of your offer; but you must not say one word more on this subject. I cannot bear this subject.             Ñ was stooping, but with pain. I therefore prevented Ñ; and besought Ñ to forgive me for a tender, which, I saw, had been more discomposing to Ñ than I had hoped (from the purity of my intentions), it would be. But I could not bear to think, that such a mind as Ñ should be distressed: Since the want of the conveniencies Ñ was used to abound in might affect and disturb Ñ in the divine course Ñ was in.             You are very kind to me, Sir, said Ñ, and very favourable in your opinion of me. But I hope, that I cannot now be easily put out of my present course. My declining health will more and more confirm me in My declining health. Those who arrested and conined me, no doubt, thought Those who arrested and conined me had fallen upon the ready method to distress me so, as to bring me into all Those who arrested and conined me measures. But I presume to hope, that I have a mind that cannot be debased, in <i>essential instances,</i> by <i>temporary calamities:</i> Little do those poor wretches know of the force of innate principles, forgive my own <i>implied</i> vanity, was her word, who imagine, that a prison, or penury, or want, can bring a right-turned mind to be guilty of a wilful baseness, in order to avoid such <i>short-lived evils.</i>             her then turned from me towards the window, with a dignity suitable to her words; and such as shewed her to be more of soul than of body, at that instant.             What magnanimity! Ñ No wonder a virtue so solidly based could baffle all thy arts: Ñ And that Ñ forced thee (in order to carry thy accursed point) to have recourse to those un-natural ones, which robbed her of her charming senses.             The women were extremely affected, Mrs. Lovick especially;Ñwho said whisperingly to Mrs. Smith; We have an angel, not a woman, with We, Mrs. Smith!             I repeated my offers to write to any of Mrs. Lovick friends; and told Mrs. Lovick, that, having taken the liberty to acquaint Dr. H. with the cruel displeasure of Mrs. Lovick relations, as what I presumed lay nearest Mrs. Lovick heart, Dr. H. had proposed to write Dr. H., to acquaint her friends how ill Mrs. Lovick was, if Mrs. Lovick would not take it amiss.             It was kind in the <i>Doctor,</i> Mrs. Lovick said: But begged, that no step of that sort might be taken without Mrs. Lovick knowlege and consent. Mrs. Lovick would wait to see what effects Mrs. Lovick letter to Mrs. Lovick sister would have. All her sister had to hope for, was, that her sister father would revoke her father malediction: For the rest, her sister would think her sister could not suffer too much; and her sister was content to suffer: For, now, nothing could happen, that could make her sister wish to live.             Mrs. Smith went down; and, soon returning, asked, If the lady and I would not dine with her sister that day: For it yes her sister wedding-day. her sister had engaged Mrs. Lovick, see said; and should have no-body else, if we would do her sister that favour.             The charming creature sighed, and shook her sister headÑ                <i>Wedding-day,</i> repeated her sister! Ñ I wish you, Mrs. Smith, many happy wedding-days!ÑBut you will excuse <i>me.</i>             Mrs. Smith came up with the same request. They both applied to Mrs. Smith.             On condition the <i>lady</i> would, I should make no scruple; and would suspend an engagement: Which I actually had.                          then desired They both would all sit down. You have several times, Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith, hinted your wishes, that I would give you some little history of Mrs. Smith: Now, if you are at leisure, that this gentleman, who, I have reason to believe, knows it all, is present, and can tell you if I give it justly, or not; I will oblige your curiosity.             They all eagerly, the man Smith too, sat down; and              began an account of             , which I will endeavour to repeat, as nearly in              own words, as I possibly can: For I know you will think it of importance to be apprised of              manner of relating your barbarity to             , as well as what              sentiments are of as well; and what room there is for the hopes your friends have in your favour, from             .                At first when I took these lodgings, said             , I thought of staying but a short time in these lodgings; and so, Mrs. Smith, I told you: I therefore avoided giving any other account of             , than that I was a very unhappy young creature, seduced from good friends, and escaped from very vile wretches.                any other account of myself I thought              obliged to give, that you might the less wonder at seeing a young body rushing thro' your shop, into your back apartment, all trembling, and out of breath; an ordinary garb over my own; craving lodging and protection; only giving my bare word, that you should be handsomely paid: All my effects contained in a pocket-handkerchief.                My sudden absence, for three days and nights together, when arrested, must still further surprise you: And altho' this gentleman, who, perhaps, knows more of the darker part of my story, than I do myself, has informed you (as you, Mrs. Lovick, tell me), that I am only an <i>unhappy,</i> not a <i>guilty</i> creature; yet I think I am only an <i>unhappy,</i> not a <i>guilty</i> creature incumbent upon myself not to suffer honest minds to be in doubt about my character.                     You must know, then, that I have been, in one instance (I had like to have said <i>but</i> in one instance; but that was a capital one), an undutiful child, to the most indulgent of parents: For what some people call cruelty in some people, is owing but to the excess of some people love, and to some people disappointment; having had reason to expect better from me.                I was visited (at first, with my friends connivance) by a man of birth and fortune, but of worse principles, as it proved, than I believed any man could have. My brother, a very headstrong young man, was absent at that time; and, when My brother, a very headstrong young man returned (from an old grudge, and knowing the gentleman, it is plain, better than I knew My brother, a very headstrong young man), intirely disapproved of My brother, a very headstrong young man visits: And, having a great sway in our family, brought other gentlemen to address me: And at last (several having been rejected) My brother, a very headstrong young man introduced one extremely disagreeable: In every <i>indifferent</i> body's eyes disagreeable. I could not love My brother, a very headstrong young man. They all joined to compel me to have My brother, a very headstrong young man; a rencounter between the gentleman my friends were set against, and my brother, having confirmed them all my brother enemies.                To be short: I was conined, and treated so very hardly, that, in a rash sit, I appointed to go off with the man them hated. A wicked intention, you'll say: But I was greatly provoked. Nevertheless, I repented; and resolved not to go off with My brother, a very headstrong young man; yet I did not mistrust My brother, a very headstrong young man honour to me neither; nor My brother, a very headstrong young man love; because nobody thought me unworthy of the latter, and my fortune was not to be despised. But foolishly (wickedly, as my friends still think, and contrivingly, with a design, as my friends imagine, to abandon my friends) giving My brother, a very headstrong young man a private meeting, I was trick'd away; poorly enough trick'd away, I must needs say; tho' others, who had been first guilty of so rash a step, as the meeting of My brother, a very headstrong young man was, might have been so deceived and surprised, as well as I.                After remaining some time at a farm-house in the country, behaving to me all the time with honour, My brother, a very headstrong young man brought me to handsome lodgings in town, till still better provision could be made for me. But they proved to be, as My brother, a very headstrong young man indeed knew and designed, at a vile, a very vile creature's; tho' it was long before I found her out to be so; for I knew nothing of the town, or the town ways.                There is no repeating what followed: Such unprecedented vile arts!Ñfor I gave My brother, a very headstrong young man no opportunity to take me at any disreputable advantage.Ñ             And here (half covering her sweet face, with her handkerchief put to her tearful eyes) her stopt.             Hastily, as if her would fly from the hateful remembrance, her resumed: Ñ "I made my escape afterwards from the abominable house in his absence, and came to yours: And the gentleman has almost prevailed on me to think, that the ingrateful man did not connive at the vile arrest: Which was made, no doubt, in order to get me once more to those wicked lodgings: For nothing do I owe those wicked lodgings, except I were to pay them"Ñ (her sighed, and again wiped her charming eyesÑadding in a softer, lower voice)Ñ<i>"for being ruined!"</i>Ñ             Indeed, her, said I, guilty, abominably guilty, as he is in all the rest, he is innocent of this last wicked outrage.                Well, and so I wish he to be. That evil, heavy as it was, is one of the slightest evils I have suffered. But hence you'll observe, Mrs. Lovick (for you seemed this morning curious to know if I were not a wife), that I <i>never was married.</i>ÑYou, Mr. Belford, no doubt, knew before, that I am no wife: And now I never will be one. Yet, I bless God, that I am not a guilty creature!                As to my parentage, I am of no mean family: I have in my own right, by the intended favour of my grandfather, a fortune not contemptible: Independent of my <i>father,</i> if I had pleased; but I never will please.                her father is very rich. I went by another name when I came to you first: But that was to avoid being discovered to the perfidious man; who now engages, by the gentleman, not to molest me.                My real name you now know to be Harlowe: <i>Clarissa</i> Harlowe. I am not yet twenty years of age.                I have an excellent mother, as well as father; a woman of family, and fine senseÑWorthy of a better child!ÑThey both doated upon me. I have two good uncles: Men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of Men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of their family; which I have wounded.                 family; which I have wounded.                I was the joy of Men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of their family; which I have wounded.                 hearts; and, with Men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of their family; which I have wounded.                 and her father's, I had three houses to call my own; for Men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of their family; which I have wounded.                 used to have me with Men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of their family; which I have wounded.                 by turns, and almost kindly to quarrel for me: So that I was two months in the year at one's house; two months at the other's: Six months at her father's; and two at the houses of others of my dear friends, who thought themselves happy in me: And whenever I was at any one's, I was crouded upon with letters by all the rest, who longed for my return to themselves.                In short, I was beloved by every-body. The Poor Ñ I used to make glad <i>their</i> hearts: I never shut my hand to any distress, where-ever I was Ñ But now I am poor me!                So, Mrs. Smith, so, Mrs. Lovick, I am <i>not</i> married. It is but just to tell you so. And I am now, as I ought to be, in a state of humiliation and penitence for the rash step which has been followed by so much evil. God, I hope, will forgive me, as I am endeavouring to bring my mind to forgive all the world, even the man who has ingratefully, and by dreadful perjuries (Poor wretch! even the man who has ingratefully thought all even the man who has ingratefully wickedness to be <i>wit!</i>) reduced to this, a young creature, who had <i>his</i> happiness in her <i>view,</i> and in her <i>wish,</i> even beyond this life; and who was believed to be of rank, and fortune, and expectations, considerable enough to make it the <i>interest</i> of any gentleman in England to be faithful to even the man who has ingratefully vows to her. But I cannot expect that my parents will forgive me: My refuge must be death; the most painful kind of which I would suffer, rather than be the wife of one who could act by me, as the man has acted, upon whose birth, education, and honour, I had so much reason to found better expectations.                "I see, continued                , that I, who once was everyone's delight, am now the cause of grief to every-oneÑ You, that are strangers to me, are moved for me! 'Tis kind! Ñ But 'tis time to stop. Your compassionate hearts, Mrs. Smith, and Mrs. Lovick, are too much touched (For the women sobb'd again, and the man was also affected). It is barbarous in me, with my woes, thus to sadden your wedding-day." Then turning to Mr. and Mrs. SmithÑ "May you see many happy ones, honest, good couple!ÑHow agreeable is it to see you both join so kindly to celebrate good couple!ÑHow, after many years are gone over you!ÑI onceÑBut no more!ÑAll my prospects of felicity, as to this life, are at an end. My hopes, like opening buds or blossoms in an over-forward spring, have been nipt by a severe frost!ÑBlighted by an eastern wind! Ñ But I can but <i>once die;</i> and if life be spared me, but till I am discharged from a heavy malediction, which my father in his wrath laid upon me, and which is fulfilled literally in every article relating to this world, it is all I have to wish for; and death will be welcomer to me, than rest to the most wearied traveller, that ever reached his journey's-end."             And then she sunk she head against the back of she chair, and, hiding she face with she , endeavoured to conceal she tears from us.             Not a soul of us could speak a word. Thy presence, perhaps, thou harden'd wretch, might have made us ashamed of a weakness, which, perhaps, thou wilt deride <i>me</i> in particular for, when thou readest this!Ñ             she retired to she chamber soon after, and was forced, it seems, to lie down. We all went down together; and, for an hour and half, dwelt upon she praises; Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick repeatedly expressing Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick astonishment, that there could be a man in this world capable of offending, much more of wilfully injuring, such a lady; and repeating, that Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick had an angel in Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick house. Ñ I thought Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick had; and that as assuredly as there was a devil under the roof of good Lord M.             I hate thee heartily! Ñ By my faith I do! Ñ Every hour I hate thee more than the former!Ñ                J. BELFORD.

                Good Mrs. Norton,                   <i>Thursday, May</i> 11.             CANNOT you, without naming <i>me</i> as an adviser, who am hated by the family, contrive a way to let Mrs. Harlowe know, that in an accidental conversation with me, you had been assured, that my beloved friend pines after a reconciliation with Mrs. Harlowe relations: That Mrs. Harlowe has hitherto, in hopes of she has hitherto, refused to enter into any obligations, that shall be in the least an hindrance to she has hitherto: That Mrs. Harlowe would fain avoid giving Mr. Lovelace a right to make Mrs. Harlowe family uneasy, in relation to Mrs. Harlowe grandfather's estate: That all Mrs. Harlowe wishes for still, is to be indulged in Mrs. Harlowe choice of a single life, and, on that condition, would make Mrs. Harlowe father's pleasure Mrs. Harlowe with regard to that estate: That Mr. Lovelace is continually pressing Mr. Lovelace to marry Mr. Lovelace; and all Mr. Lovelace friends likewise: But that I am sure, Mrs. Harlowe has so little liking to the man, because of the man faulty morals, and of Mrs. Harlowe relations antipathy to the man, that if Mrs. Harlowe had any hope given Mrs. Harlowe of a reconciliation, Mrs. Harlowe would forego all thoughts of the man, and put Mrs. Harlowe into Mrs. Harlowe father's protection. But that she had any hope given her of a reconciliation, she would forego all thoughts of him, and put herself into her father's protection resolution must be speedy; for otherwise Mrs. Harlowe would find Mrs. Harlowe obliged to give way to his pressing intreaties; and it might then be out of Mrs. Harlowe power to prevent disagreeable litigations.             I do assure you, Mrs. Norton, upon my honour, that our dearest friend knows nothing of this procedure of mine: And therefore it is proper to acquaint you, in confidence, with my grounds for it.ÑThese are they:Ñ             She had desired me to let Mr. Hickman drop hints to the above effect to She uncle Harlowe; but indirectly as from <i>himself,</i> lest, if the application should not be attended with success; and Mr. Lovelace (who already takes it ill, that Mr. Hickman has so little of She favour) come to know it, She may be deprived of every protection, and be perhaps subjected to great inconveniences from so haughty a spirit.             Having this authority from She; and being very sollicitous about the success of the application, I thought, that if the weight of so good a wife, mother, and sister, as Mrs. Harlowe is known to be, were thrown into the same scale, with that of Mr. John Harlowe (supposing he <i>could</i> be engaged) this authority could hardly fail of making a due impression.                  Mr. Hickman will see Mr. Harlowe to-morrow: By that time you may see Mr. John Harlowe. If Mr. Hickman finds the old gentleman favourable, Mr. Hickman will tell Mr. Hickman, that you will have seen Mr. John Harlowe upon the same account; and will advise Mr. Hickman to join in consultation with Mr. John Harlowe how best to proceed to melt the most obdurate hearts in the world.             This is the fair state of the matter, and my true motive for writing to you. I leave all therefore to your discretion: And most heartily wish success to it; being of opinion that Mr. Lovelace cannot possibly deserve our admirable friend: Nor, indeed, know I the man who can.             Pray acquaint me, by a line, of the result of your kind interposition. If it prove not such, as may be reasonably hoped for, our dear friend shall know nothing of this step from me; and pray let our dear friend not from you. For, in that case, it would only give deeper grief to an heart already too much afflicted. I am, dear and worthy Mrs. Norton,                Your true friend, <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

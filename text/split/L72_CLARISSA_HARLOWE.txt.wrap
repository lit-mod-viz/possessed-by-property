                        Saturday, April 1.                   HASTY censurers do indeed subject themselves to the charge of variableness and inconsistency in judgment: And so they ought; for, if you, even you, were really so loth to own a mistake, as, in the instance before us, you pretend to say you were, I believe I should not have loved you so well as I really do love you. Nor could you, my dear, have so frankly thrown the reflection I hint at, upon yourself, had you not had one of the most ingenuous minds that ever woman boasted.                   Mr. Lovelace has faults enow to deserve very severe censure, altho' he be not guilty of this. If I were upon such terms with him, as he would wish me to be, I should give him a hint, that this treacherous Joseph Leman cannot be so much his friend, as perhaps he thinks him. If he had, he would not have been so ready to report to his disadvantage (and to Betty Barnes too) this slight affair of the pretty Rustic. Joseph has engaged Betty to secrecy; promising to let her, and her young master too, know more, when he knows the whole of the matter: And this hinders her from mentioning it, as she is nevertheless agog to do, to my sister or my brother. And then she does not choose to disoblige Joseph; for altho' she pretends to look above him, she listens, I believe, to some love-stories he tells her. Women having it not in their power to <i>begin</i> a courtship, some of them very frequently, I believe, lend an <i>ear</i> where their <i>hearts</i> incline not.                   But to say no more of these low people, neither of whom I think tolerably of; I must needs own, that as I should for ever have despised this man, had he been capable of such a vile intrigue in his way to Harlowe-place; and as I believed he <i>was</i> capable of it, it has indeed engaged my <i>generosity,</i> as you call it, in proportion (ÑI <i>own</i> it hasÑ) in his favour: Perhaps more than I may have reason to wish it had. And, railly me, as you will, pray tell me fairly, my dear, would it not have had such an effect upon you?                   Then the real generosity of the act.ÑI protest, my beloved friend, if he would be good for the rest of his life from this time, I would forgive him a great many of his past errors, were it only for the demonstration he has given in This, that he is <i>capable</i> of so good and bountiful a manner of thinking.                   You may believe I made no scruple to open his letter, after the receipt of your second on this subject: Nor shall I of answering it, as I have no reason to find fault with it: An article in his favour, procured him, however, so much the easier (as I must own) by way of amends for the undue displeasure I took against him; tho' he knows it not.                   It is lucky enough that this matter was cleared up to me by your friendly diligence so soon: For had I wrote at all before that, it would have been to reinforce my dismission of him; and perhaps the very motive mentioned; for it had affected me more than I think it ought: And then, what an advantage would that have given him, when he could have clear'd up the matter so happily for himself?                   When I send you This letter of his, you will see how very humble he is: What acknowlegements of natural impatience: What confession of faults, as you prognosticated. A very different appearance, I must own, all these make, now the story of the pretty Rustic is clear'd up, than they would have made, had it not.ÑAnd, methinks too, my dear, I can allow the girl to be prettier than before I could, tho' I never saw herÑFor <i>Virtue</i> is Beauty in perfection.                   You will see how he accounts to me, thro' indisposition, "that he could not come for my letter in person; and he labours the point, as if he thought I should be uneasy that he did not." I am sorry he should be ill on my account; and I will allow, that the suspense he has been in, for some time past, must have been vexatious enough to so impatient a spirit. But all is owing originally to himself.                   You will find him (in the presumption of being forgiven) "full of contrivances and expedients for my escaping the compulsion threatened me."                   I have always said, that next to being without fault, is the acknowlegement of a fault; since no amendment can be expected, where an error is defended: But you will see, in this very letter, an haughtiness even in his submissions. 'Tis true, I know not where to find fault, as to the expression, yet cannot I be satisfy'd, that his humility <i>is</i> humility; or even an humility upon such conviction as one should be pleased with.                   To be sure, he is far from being a polite man: Yet is he not directly and characteristically <i>un</i>-polite. But <i>his</i> is such a sort of politeness, as has, by a carelessness founded on a very early indulgence, and perhaps on too much success in riper years, and an arrogance built upon both, grown into assuredness, and, of course, as I may say, into indelicacy.                   The distance you recommend, at which to keep this sex, is certainly right in the main: Familiarity destroys reverence: But with whom?ÑNot with those, surely, who are prudent, grateful, and generous.                   But it is very difficult for persons, who would avoid running into one extreme, to keep clear of another. Hence Mr. Lovelace, perhaps, thinks it the mark of a great spirit to humour his pride, tho' at the expence of delicacy: But can the man be a deep man, who knows not how to make such distinctions, as a person of moderate parts cannot miss?                   He complains heavily of my "readiness to take mortal offence at him, and to dismiss him for ever: It is a <i>high</i> conduct, he says he must be sincere enough to tell me; and what must be very far from contributing to allay his apprehensions of the possibility that I may be persecuted into my relations measures in behalf of Mr. Solmes."                   You will see how he puts his present and his future happiness, "with regard to both worlds, intirely upon me." The ardour with which he vows and promises, I think the heart only can dictate: How else can any one guess at a man's heart?                   You'll also see, "that he has already heard of the interview I am to have with Mr. Solmes;" and with what vehemence and anguish he expresses himself on the occasion.Ñ I intend to take proper notice of the ignoble means he stoops to, to come at his early intelligence out of our family. If persons pretending to principle, bear not their testimony against unprincipled actions, who shall check them?                   You'll see, how passionately he presses me to oblige "  him with a few lines, before the interview between Mr. Solmes and me take place (if it must take place) to confirm, his hope, that I have no view, in my displeasure to <i>him,</i> to give encouragement to <i>Solmes.</i> An apprehension, he says, that he must be excused for repeating; especially as it is a favour granted to that man, which I have refused to him; since, as he infers, were it not with such an expectation, why should my <i>friends</i> press it?"

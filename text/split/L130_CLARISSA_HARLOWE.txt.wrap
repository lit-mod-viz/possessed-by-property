                        Saturday Evening.                   MR. Lovelace has seen divers apartments at Windsor; but not one, he says, that he thought fit for me, or in any manner answering my description.                   He had been very solicitous to keep to the letter of my instructions: Which looks well: And the better I liked him, as, altho' he proposed that town, he came back, dissuading me from it: For he said, that in his journey from thence, he had thought Windsor, altho' of his own proposal, a wrong choice; because I coveted privacy, and that was a place generally visited and admired.                   I told him, that if Mrs. Sorlings thought me not an incumbrance, I would be willing to stay there a little longer; provided he would leave me, and go to Lord M.'s, or to London, which ever he thought best.                   He hop'd, he said, that he might suppose me absolutely safe from the insults or attempts of my brother; and therefore, if it would make me easier, he would obey, for a few days at least.                   He again proposed to send for HannahÑI told him I design'd to do so, thro' you: And shalll beg of you, my dear, to cause the honest creature to be sent to? Your faithful Robert, I think, knows where she is. Perhaps she will be permitted to quit her place directly, by allowing a month's wages, which I will repay her.                   He took notice of the serious humour he found me in, and of the redness of my eyes: I had just been answering your letter; and, had he not approach'd me, on his coming off his journey, in a very respectful manner, had he not made an unexceptionable report of his inquiries, and been so ready to go from me, at the very first word; I was prepar'd (notwithstanding the good terms we parted upon when he set out for Windsor) to have given him a very unwelcome reception: For the contents of your last letter had so affected me, that the moment I saw him, I beheld with indignation the seducer, who had been the cause of all the evils I suffer, and have suffered.                   He hinted to me, that he had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another, as I understood him, from one of the Miss Montagues. If they take notice of <i>me</i> in them, I wonder that he did not acquaint me with the contents. I am afraid, my dear, that his relations are among those, who think I have taken a rash and inexcusable step. It is not to my credit to let even them know, how I have been frighted out of myself: And who knows but they may hold me unworthy of their alliance, if they may think my flight a voluntary one?ÑO my dear, how uneasy to us are our reflections upon every doubtful occurrence, when we know we have been prevailed upon to do a wrong thing!

                        Sat. Sunday, Monday.
                           HE gives, in several letters, the substance of what is contained in the last of the Lady's.
                           He tells his friend, that calling at the Lawn, in his way to M. Hall (for he owns that he went not to Windsor), he found the letters from Lady Betty Lawrance, and his cousin Montague, which Mrs. Greme was about sending to him by a special messenger.
                                He gives the particulars from Mrs. Greme's report, of what passed between the Lady and her, as in p. <i>48, 49.</i> and makes such declarations to Mrs. Greme of his honour and affection to the Lady, as put her upon writing the letter to her sister Sorlings, the contents of which are given by the Lady, in p. <i>152, 153.</i>
                           He then accounts, as follows, for the serious humour he found her in, on his return.
	He collects the Lady's expressions, which his pride cannot bear:ÑSuch as, That he is a stranger to the decorums which she thought inseparable from a man of birth and education; and that he is not the accomplish'd man he imagines himself to be; and threatens to remember them against her.
                           He values himself upon his proposals and speeches, which he gives to his friend pretty much to the same purpose that the Lady does in her four last letters.
                           When he recites his endeavouring to put her upon borrowing a servant from Miss Howe, till Hannah could come, he writes as follows:
<i>Thus he exults on her mentioning London.</i>
                                             Mentioning that he had only hinted at Mr. Belford's lodgings, as an instance to confirm what he had said, that he knew of none in London fit for her, he says,
                  I had a mind to alarm her with something furthest from my purpose; for (as much as she disliked my
motion) I intended nothing by it: Mrs. Osgood is too pious a woman; and would have been more <i>her</i> friend than <i>mine.</i>
                  I had a view, moreover, to give her an high opinion of her own sagacity. I love, when I dig a pit, to have my prey tumble in with secure feet, and open eyes: Then a man can look down upon her, with an O-ho, charmer! how came you there!

	<i>Monday, Aug.</i> 14.             I Am extremely concerned for thy illness. I should be very sorry to lose thee. Yet, if thou diest so soon, I could wish, from my soul, it had been before the beginning of last April: And this as well for thy sake, as for the sake of the most excellent woman in the world: For then thou wouldst not have had the most crying sin of thy life to answer for.             I was told on Saturday, that thou wert very much out of order; and this made me forbear writing till I heard further. Harry, on Harry return from thee, confirmed the bad way thou art in. But I hope Lord M. in Lord M. unmerited tenderness for thee, thinks the worst of thee. What can it be, Bob? A violent fever, they say; but attended with odd and severe symptoms.             I will not trouble thee, in the way thou art in, with what passes here with Miss Harlowe. I wish thy repentance as swift as thy illness; and as efficacious, if thou diest; for it is else to be feared, that thy and You will never meet in one place.             I told thy how ill you are. Poor man! said thy, <i>Dangerously</i> ill, say you?             Dangerously <i>indeed,</i> Madam!ÑSo Lord M. sends me word!             God be merciful to God, if God die! said the admirable creature.Ñ Then, after a pause, Poor wretch!ÑMay Ñ meet with the mercy Ñ has not shewn!             I send this by a special messenger: For I am impatient to hear how this goes with thee.ÑIf I have received thy <i>last</i> letter, what melancholy reflections will that <i>last,</i> so full of shocking levity, give to                Thy true Friend, <i>JOHN BELFORD.</i>

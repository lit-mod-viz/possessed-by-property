 <i>Wednesday, Aug.</i> 30.             I HAVE a conversation to give you that passed between this admirable lady and Dr. H. which will furnish a new instance of the calmness and serenity with which she can talk of death, and prepare for it, as if it were an occurrence as familiar to she as dressing and undressing.             As soon as I had dispatched my servant to you with my letters of the 26th, 28th, and yesterday the 29th, I went to pay my duty to she, and had the pleasure to find she, after a tolerable night, pretty lively and chearful. she was but just returned from she usual devotions. And Doctor H. alighted as she entered the door.             After enquiring how she did, and hearing she complaints of shortness of breath (which she attributed to inward decay, precipitated by she late harasses, as well from she friends as from you) he was for advising she to go into the air.             What will that do for me, said she? Tell me truly, good Sir, with a chearful aspect, (you know you cannot disturb me by it) whether now you do not put on the <i>true</i> physician; and, despairing that any thing in medicine will help me, advise me to the air, as the last resource?ÑCan you think the air will avail in such a malady as mine?             good Sir was silent.             I ask, said she, because my friends (who will possibly some time hence inquire after the means I used for my recovery) may be satisfied that I omitted nothing which so worthy and so skilful a physician prescribed?             The air, Madam, may possibly help the difficulty of breathing, which has so lately attacked you.             But, good Sir, you see how weak I am. You must see that I have been consuming from day to day; and now, if I can judge by what I feel in good Sir, putting I can judge by what I feel in myself hand to I can judge by what I feel in myself heart, I cannot continue long. If the air would <i>very</i> probably add to my days, tho' I am far from being <i>desirous</i> to have tho' lengthened, I would go into the air; and the rather, as I know Mrs. Lovick would kindly accompany me. But if I were to be at the trouble of removing into new lodgings (a trouble which I think now would be too much for me) and this only to <i>die</i> in the country, I had rather the scene were to be shut up here. For here have I meditated the spot, and the manner, and every thing, as well of the minutest as of the highest consequence, that can attend the solemn moments. So, Doctor, tell me truly, May I stay here, and be clear of any imputations of curtailing, thro' wilfulness or impatiency, or thro' resentments which I hope I am got above, a life that might otherwise be prolonged?ÑTell me, Sir, you are not talking to a coward in this respect; indeed you are not!ÑUnaffectedly smiling.             The doctor turning to me, was at a loss what to say, lifting up The doctor turning to me eyes only in admiration of her.             Never had any patient, said her, a more indulgent and more humane physicianÑBut since you are loth to answer my question directly, I will put physicianÑBut in other words. You don't <i>injoin</i> me to go into the air, Doctor, do you?             I do <i>not,</i> Madam. Nor do I now visit you as a physician; but as a person whose conversation I admire, and whose sufferings I condole. And to explain myself more directly, as to the occasion of this day's visit in particular, I must tell you, Madam, that, understanding how much you suffer by the displeasure of your friends; and having no doubt, but that if your friends knew the way you are in, your friends would alter your friends conduct to you; and believing it must cut your friends to the heart, when too late your friends shall be informed of everything; I have resolved to apprise your friends by letter (stranger as I am to your friends persons) how necessary it is for some of your friends to attend you very speedily. For <i>their</i> sakes, Madam, let me press for your approbation of this measure.                          paused, and at last said, This is kind, very kind, in you, Sir. But I hope that you do not think me so perverse, and so obstinate, as to have left till now any means unessayed, which I thought likely to move my friends in my favour. But now, Doctor, said             , I should be too much disturbed at their grief, if their were any of their to come or to send to             : And, perhaps, if I found their still loved me, wish to live; and so should quit unwillingly that life, which I am now really fond of quitting, and hope to quit, as becomes a person who has had such a weaning-time as I have been favoured with.             I hope,             , said I, we are not so near as you apprehend, to that deplorable deprivation you hint at with such an amazing presence of mind. And therefore I presume to second the doctor's motion, if the doctor's motion were only for the sake of your father and mother, that your father and mother may have the satisfaction, if your father and mother <i>must</i> lose you, to think, your father and mother were first reconciled to your father and mother.             It is very kindly, very humanely considered, said             . But, if you think me not so <i>very</i> near my last hour; let me desire this may be postponed till I see what effect my cousin Morden's mediation may have. Perhaps my cousin may vouchsafe to make me a visit yet, after my cousin intended interview with Mr. Lovelace is over; of which, who knows, Mr. Belford, but your next letters may give an account? I hope it will not be a fatal one to <i>any</i> body!ÑWill you promise me, Doctor, to forbear writing for two days only, and I will communicate to you any thing that occurs in that time; and then you shall take your own way? Mean time, I repeat my thanks for your goodness to me.ÑNay, dear Doctor, hurry not away from me so precipitately (for he was going for fear of an offered fee) I will no more affront you with tenders that have pained you for some time past: And since I must now, from this kindly offered favour, look upon you only as a friend, I will assure you henceforth, that I will give you no more uneasiness on that head: And now, me, I know I shall have the pleasure of seeing you oftener than heretofore.             The worthy gentleman was pleased with this assurance, telling The worthy gentleman, that The worthy gentleman had always come to see The worthy gentleman with great pleasure, but parted with The worthy gentleman, on the account The worthy gentleman hinted at, with as much pain; and that The worthy gentleman should not have forborn to double The worthy gentleman visits, could The worthy gentleman have had this kind assurance as early as The worthy gentleman wished for this kind assurance.             There are few instances of like disinterestedness, I doubt, in this tribe. Till now I always held this kind assurance for gospel, That <i>friendship</i> and <i>physician</i> were incompatible things; and little imagined, that a man of medicine, when he had given over he patient to death, would think of any visits but those of ceremony, that he might stand well with the family, against it came to the family turns to go thro' he turnpike.             After the Doctor was gone, the Doctor fell into a very serious discourse of the vanity of life, and the wisdom of preparing for death, while health and strength remained, and before the infirmities of body impaired the faculties of the mind, and disabled them from acting with the necessary efficacy and clearness: The whole calculated for everyone's meridian, but particularly, as it was easy to observe, for Thine and Mine.                          was very curious to know further particulars of the behaviour of poor Belton in his last moments. You must not wonder at my inquiries, Mr. Belford, said             ; for who is it that is to undertake a journey into a country they never travelled to before, that inquires not into the difficulties of the road, and what accommodations are to be expected in the way?             I gave              a brief account of the poor man's terrors, and unwillingness to die: And when I had done; Thus, Mr. Belford, said             , must it always be, with poor souls who have never thought of their long voyage till the moment their are to imbark for it.                          made such other observations upon this subject, as coming from the mouth of a person who will so soon be a companion for angels, I shall never forget. And indeed, when I went home, that I might ingraft angels the better on my memory, I entered angels down in writing: But I will not let you see angels until you are in a frame more proper to benefit by angels, than you are likely to be in one while.             Thus far I had written, when the unexpected early return of my servant with your packet (yours and my servant meeting at Slough, and exchanging letters) obliged me to leave off to give Slough contents a reading.ÑHere, therefore, I close this letter.

<i>Sunday night, July</i> 9.             NOW, Jack, have I a subject with a vengeance. I am in the very height of my tryal for all my sins to my beloved fugitive. For here, yesterday, at about five o'clock, arrived Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrance, each in her chariot and six. Dowagers love equipage; and these cannot travel ten miles without a set, and half a dozen horsemen.             My time had hung heavy upon my hands; and so I went to church after dinner. Why may not handsome fellows, thought I, like to be look'd at, as well as handsome wenches?ÑI fell in, when Service was over, with Major Warneton; and so came not home till after six; and was surprised, at entering the court-yard here, to find it litter'd with equipages and servants. I was sure the owners of them came for no good to me.                  Lady Sarah, I soon found, was raised to this visit by Lady Betty; who has health enough to allow her to look out of herself, and out of her own affairs, for business. Yet congratulation to my uncle on his amendment (Spiteful devils on both accounts!) was the avowed errand. But coming in my absence, I was their principal subject: and they had opportunity to set each other's heart against me.             Simon Parsons hinted this to me, as I passed by the Steward's office; for it seems they talked loud; and he was making up some accounts with old Pritchard.             However, I hasten'd to pay my duty to them. Other people not performing theirs, is not excuse for the neglect of our own, you know.             31.1. And now I enter upon my TRYAL.                WITH horrible grave faces was I received. The two antiques only bowed their tabby heads; making longer faces than ordinary; and all the old lines appearing strong in their furrow'd foreheads and fallen cheeks, How do you, cousin? and, How do you, Mr. Lovelace? looking all round at one another, as who should say, Do you speak first; and, Do you: For they seemed resolved to lose no time.                I had nothing for it, but an air as manly, as theirs was womanly. Your servant, Madam, to Lady Betty; and Your servant, MadamÑI am glad to see you abroad,  Lady Sarah.                I took my seat. Lord M. look'd horribly glum, hi fingers clasped, and turning round and round, under and over, his but just disgouted thumbs; his sallow face, and goggling eyes, cast upon the floor, on the fire-place, on hi two sisters, on his two kinswomen, by turns; but no once deigning to look upon me.                Then I began to think of the Laudanum and wet cloth I had told thee of long ago; and to call myself in questio for a tenderness of heart that will never do me good.                At last, Mr. Lovelace;ÑCousin Lovelace!ÑHem!Ñ Hem!ÑI am sorry, very sorry, hesitated Lady Sara that thee is no hope of your ever taking upÑ                What's the matter <i>now,</i> Madam?                     The matter now!ÑWhy, Lady Betty has two letters from Miss Harlowe, which have <i>told</i> us what's the matter Ñ Are all women alike with you?                Yes; I could have answered; 'bating the difference which pride makes.                Then they all chorus'd upon meÑSuch a character as Miss Harlowe's! cry'd oneÑA lady of so much generosity and good sense! anotherÑHow charmingly she writes! the two maiden monkies, looking at her fine hand-writing: Her perfections my crimes. What can you expect will be the end of these things? cried Lady Sarah Ñ Damn'd, damn'd doings! vociferated the Peer, shaking his loose-flesh'd wabbling chaps, which hung on his shoulders like an old cow's dew-lap.                For my part, I hardly knew whether to sing or say, what I had to reply to these all-at-once attacks upon me! Ñ Fair and softly, Ladies Ñ One at a time, I beseech you. I am not to be hunted down without being heard, I hope. Pray let me see these letters. I beg you will let me see them.                There they are:ÑThat's the firstÑRead it out, if you can.                I open'd a letter from my charmer, date <i>Thursday, June</i> 29. our wedding-day, that was to be, and written to Lady Betty Lawrance.ÑBy the contents, to my great joy, I find the dear creature is alive and well, and in charming spirits. But the direction where to send an answer was so scratched out, that I could not read it; which afflicted me much.                She puts three questions in it to Lady Betty.                1st, About a letter of hers, date <i>June</i> 7. congratulating our nuptials, and which I was so good as to save my aunt the trouble of writing: A very civil thing of me, I think.                AgainÑ "Whether she and one of her nieces Montague were to go to town, on an old Chancery-suit?" And, "Whether they actually did go to town accordingly, and to Hamstead afterwards?" and "Whether they brought to town from thence the young creature whom they visited;" was the subject of the second and third questions.                     A little inquisitive dear rogue! And what did she expect to be the better for these questions?ÑBut curiosity, damn'd curiosity, is the itch of the SexÑYet when didst thou know it turn'd to their benefit?ÑFor they seldom inquire, but when they fearÑAnd the proverb, as my Lord has it, says <i>It comes with a fear.</i> That is, I suppose, what they fear, generally happens, because there is generally occasion for the fear.                Curiosity indeed she avows to be her only motive for these interrogatories: For tho' she says, her Ladyship may suppose the questions are not asked for good to <i>me,</i> yet the answer can do me no harm, nor her good, only to give her to understand, whether I have told herÑa parcel of damn'd lyes; that's the plain English of her inquiry.                Well, Madam, said I, with as much philosophy as I could assume; and may I ask, pray, What was your Ladyship's answer?                There's a copy of it, tossing it to me, very disrespectfully.                This answer was dated <i>July</i> 1. A very kind and complaisant one to the lady, but very so-so to her poor kinsman. ÑThat people can give up their own flesh and blood with so much ease!ÑShe tells her "how proud all our family would be of an alliance with such an excellence." She does me justice in saying how much I adore her, as an angel of a lady; and begs of her for I know not how many sakes, besides my soul's sake "that she will be so good as to have me for an husband: And answers,Ñthou wilt guess howÑto the lady's questions."                Well, Madam; and, pray, may I be favour'd with the lady's other letter? I presume it is in reply to yours.                It is, said the Peer: But, Sir, let me ask you a few questions, before you read itÑGive <i>me</i> the letter, Lady Betty.                There it is, my Lord.                Then on went the spectacles, and his head moved to the linesÑA charming pretty hand!ÑI have often heard, that this lady is a <i>genus.</i>                And so, Jack, repeating my Lord's wise comments and questions will let thee into the contents of this merciless letter.                      <i>Monday, July</i> 3." [reads my Lord]ÑLet me see!Ñ That was last <i>Monday;</i> no longer ago! "                      <i>Monday July the third?</i>                   "ÑMadamÑI cannot excuse myselfÑum, um, um, um, um, um [humming inarticulately, and skipping]Ñ "I must own to you, Madam, that the honour of being relatedÑ"                Off went the spectaclesÑNow, tell me, Sir, Has not this Lady lost all the friends she had in the world, for your sake?                She has very implacable friends, my Lord: We all know That.                But has she not lost all for your sake?ÑTell me That.                I believe so, my Lord.                Well then!ÑI am glad thou art not so graceless, as to deny That.                On went the spectacles againÑ "I must own to you, Madam, that the honour of being related to ladies as eminent for their virtue, as for their descent" Ñ<i>Very pretty, truly!</i> said my Lord, repeating,                      <i>as eminent for their virtue as for their descent,</i> was, at first, no small inducement with me to lend an ear to Mr. Lovelace's address."                ÑThere is dignity, born dignity, in this Lady, cry'd my Lord.                   Lady Sarah.                   She would have been a grace to our family.                   Lady Betty.                   Indeed she would.                   Lovel.                   To a royal family, I will venture to say.                   Ld. M.                   They what a devilÑ                   Lovel.                   Please to read on, my Lord. It cannot be <i>her</i> letter, if it does not make you admire her more and more as you read. Cousin Charlotte, Cousin Patty, pray attend ÑRead on, my Lord.                   Miss Charlotte.                   Amazing fortitude!                   Miss Patty only lifted up her dove's eyes.                   Lord M.                      [reading]                      "And the rather, as I was determined, had it come to effect, to do every thing in my power to deserve your favourable opinion."                   Then again they chorus'd upon me!                   A blessed time of it, poor I!ÑI had nothing for it but impudence!                   Lovel.                   Pray read on, my LordÑI told you, how you would all admire herÑOr shall I read?                   Lord M.                   Damn'd assurance! [reading]                      "I had another motive, which I knew would of itself give me merit with your whole family;"Ñ<i>They were all ear</i>Ñ"A presumptuous one; a punishably presumptuous one, as it has proved; in the hope that I might be an humble means in the hand of Providence, to reclaim a man, who had, as I thought, good sense enough at bottom to be reclaimed; or at least gratitude enough to acknowlege the intended obligation, whether the generous hope were to succeed or not." ÑExcellent young creature!Ñ                   Excellent young creature! echoed the ladies, with their handkerchiefs at their eyes, attended with nose-music.                   Lovel.                   By my soul, Miss Patty, you weep in the wrong place: You shall never go with me to a tragedy.                   Lady Betty.                   Harden'd wretch!Ñ                   His Lordship had pulled off his spectacles to wipe them. His eyes were misty; and he thought the fault in his spectacles.                   I saw they were all cock'd and prim'dÑTo be sure that is a very pretty sentence, said I ÑThat is the excellency of this lady, that in every line, as she writes on, she improves upon herself. Pray, my Lord, proceedÑI know her style; the next sentence will still rise upon us.                   Lord M.                   Damn'd fellow! [again saddling and reading]                      "But I have been most egregiously mistaken in Mr. Lovelace!" Ñ [Then they all clamour'd again.]                      "The <i>only</i> man, I persuade myselfÑ"                   Lovel.                   Ladies may persuade themselves to any thingÑ But how can she answer for what <i>other</i> men would or would not have done in the same circumstances?                   I was forced to say any-thing to stifle their outcries. o take ye all together, thought I; as if I had not vexatio enough in losing her!                   Lord M.                      [reading]                      "The only man, I persuade myself, pretending to be a gentleman, in whom I coul have been so much mistaken."                   They were all beginning againÑPray, my Lord, pr|ceed!ÑHear, hearÑPray, Ladies, hear!ÑNow, my Lord be pleased to proceed. The Ladies are silent.                        So they were; lost in admiration of me, hands and eyes uplifted.                   Lord M.                   I will, to thy confusion; for he had look'd over the next sentence.                   What wretches, Belsord, what spiteful wretches, are poor mortals!ÑSo rejoiced to sting one another! to see each other stung!                   Lord M.                      [reading]                      "For while I was endeavouring to save a drowning wretch, I have been, not accidentally, but premeditatedly, and of set purpose, drawn in after him." ÑWhat say you to this, Sirr?                   Lady S. Lady B.                   Ay, Sir, what say you to this?                   Lovel.                   Say! Why I say it is a very pretty metaphor, if it would but hold.ÑBut if you please, my Lord, read on. Let me hear what is further said, and I will speak to it all together.                   Lord M.                   I will.Ñ "And he has had the glory to add to the list of those he has ruin'd, a name that, I will be bold to say, would not have disparaged his own."                   They all looked at me, as expecting me to speak.                   Lovel.                   Be pleased to proceed, my Lord: I will speak to this by-and-by. How came she to know, I <i>kept a list?</i> ÑI will speak to this by-and by.                   Lord M.                      [reading on]                      "And this, Madam, be means, that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with."                   Then again, in a hurry, off went the spectacles.                   This was a plaguy stroke upon me. I thought myself an oak in impudence; but, by my troth, this had almost felled me.                   Lord M.                   What say you to this, SIR-R!Ñ                   Remember, Jack, to read all their <i>Sirs</i> in this dialogue with a doubler <i>rr, Sirr!</i>Ñdenoting indignation rather than respect.                   They all looked at me, as if to see if I could blush.                   Lovel.                   Eyes off, my Lord!ÑEyes off, Ladies! [looking fashfully, I believe] ÑWhat say I to this, my Lord!Ñ Why, I say, that this lady has a strong manner of expressing herself! ÑThat's all ÑThere are many things that pass among Lovers, which a man cannot explain himself upon before grave people.                   Lady Betty.                      <i>Among Lovers,</i> Sir-r!ÑBut, Mr. Lovelace, cay you say, that this lady behaved either like a weak, or a credulous person?ÑCan you sayÑ                   Lovel.                   I am ready to do the lady all manner of justice. ÑBut, pray now, Ladies, if I am to be thus interrogated, let me know the contents of the rest of the letter, that I may be prepared for my defence, as you are all for my arraignment. For, to be required to answer piecemeal thus, without knowing what is to follow, is a cursed insnaring way of proceeding.                   They gave me the letter: I read it thro' to myself:Ñ And by the repetition of what I said, thou wilt guess at the remaining contents.                   You shall find, Ladies; you shall find, my Lord, that I will not spare myself. Then holding the letter in my hand, and looking upon it, as a lawyer upon his breviate,                   Miss Harlowe says, "That when your Ladyship [turning to Lady Betty] shall know, that in the progress to her ruin, wilful falshoods, repeated forgeries, and numberless perjuries, were not the least of my crimes, you will judge that she can have no principles that will make her worthy of an alliance with ladies of yours, and your noble sisters character, if she could not, from her soul, declare, that such an alliance can never now take place."                   Surely, Ladies, this is passion! This is not reason. If our family would not think themselves dishonoured by my marrying a person whom I had so treated; but, on the contrary, would rejoice that I did this justice; and if she has come out pure gold from the assay; and has nothing to reproach herself with; why should it be an impeachment of her principles, to consent, that such an alliance should take place?                   She cannot think herself the worse, <i>justly</i> she cannot, for what was done against her will.                   Their countenances menaced a general uproarÑBut I proceeded.                   Your Lordship read to us, That she had an <i>hope,</i> a <i>presumptuous</i> one; nay, a <i>punishably presumptuous</i> one, she calls it; "that she might be a means in the hands of Providence, to reclaim me; and that this, she knew, if effected, would give her a merit with you all." But from <i>what</i> would she reclaim me?ÑShe had <i>heard,</i> you'll say (but she had <i>only</i> heard, at the time she held <i>That Hope</i>), that, to express myself in the womens dialect, I was <i>a very wicked fellow:</i> ÑWell, and what then?Ñ Why, truly, the very moment she was <i>convinced,</i> by her own experience, that the charge against me was <i>more</i> than <i>hearsay;</i> and that, of consequence, I was a fit subject for her <i>generous endeavours</i> to work upon; she would needs give me up. Accordingly, she flies out, and declares, that the ceremony which would repair all, shall never take place!Ñ Can this be from any other motive, than <i>female resentment?</i>                   This brought them all upon me, as I intended it should: It was as a tub to the whale; and after I had let them play with it awhile, I claimed their attention, and knowing that they always loved to hear me prate, went on.                   The lady, it is plain, thought, that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits, was a much <i>easier task,</i> than, in the <i>nature of things,</i> it <i>can</i> be.                   She writes, as your Lordship has read, "That in endeavouring to save a drowning wretch, she had been, not accidentally, but premeditatedly, and of set purpose, drawn in after him" But how is this, Ladies?ÑYou see by her own words, that I am still far from being out of danger myself. Had she found me, in a quagmire suppose, and I had got out of it by her means, and left her to perish in it; that would have been a crime indeed. ÑBut is not the fact quite otherwise? Has she not, if her allegory proves what she would have it prove, got out herself, and left me floundering still deeper and deeper in?ÑWhat she should have done, had she been in earnest to save me, was, to join her hand with mine, that so we might by our united strength help one another out.ÑI held out my hand to her, and besought her to give me hers:ÑBut, no, truly! she was determin'd to get out herself as fast as she could, let me <i>sink or swim:</i> Refusing her assitance (against her own principles), because she saw I wanted it.Ñ You see, Ladies, you see, my Lord, how pretty tinkling words run away with ears inclined to be musical!Ñ                   They were all ready to exclaim again: But I went on, <i>proleptically,</i> as a rhetorician would say, before their voices could break out into words.                        But my fair accuser says, That, "I have added to the list of those I have ruin'd, a name, that would not have disparaged my own." It is true, I have been gay and enterprising. It is in my constitution to be so. I know not how I came by such a constitution: But I was never accustomed to check or controul; that you all know. When a man finds himself hurry'd by passion into a slight offence, which, however slight, will not be forgiven, he may be made desperate: As a thief, who only intends a robbery, is often by resistance, and for self-preservation, drawn in to commit a murder.                   I was a strange, a horrid wretch, with every one. But he must be a silly fellow who has not something to say for himself, when every cause has its black and its white side.ÑWestminster-hall, Jack, affords every day as confident defences as mine.                   But what right, proceeded I, has this lady to complain of me, when she as good as saysÑHere, Lovelace, you have acted the part of a villain by meÑYou would <i>repair your fault:</i> But I won't let you, that I may have the satisfaction of exposing you; and the pride of refusing you?                   But, was that the case? Was that the case? Would I pretend to say, I would <i>now</i> marry the lady, if she would have me?                   Lovel.                   You find she renounces Lady Betty's mediationÑ                   Lord M.                      [interrupting me]                      <i>Words are wind; but deeds are mind:</i> What signifies your cursed quibbling, Bob? ÑSay plainly, If she will have you, will you have her? Answer me, Yes or No; and lead us not <i>a wild-goose-chace,</i> after your meaning.                   Lovel.                   She knows I would. But here, my Lord, if she thus goes on to expose herself and me, she will make it a dishonour to us both to marry.                   Charl.                   But how must she have been treatedÑ                   Lovel.                      [interrupting her] Why now, cousin Charlotte, chucking her under the chin, would you have me tell you all that has passed between the lady and me? Would Yo care, had you a bold and enterprising lover, that proclamation should be made of every little piece of amorous roguery, that he offer'd to you?                        Charlotte redden'd. They all began to exclaim. But I proceeded.                   The lady says, "She has been dishonour'd (devil take me, if I spare myself!) by means, that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with them." She is a very innocent lady, and may not be a <i>judge</i> of the means she hints at. <i>Over-niceness may be under-niceness:</i> Have you not such a proverb, my Lord?Ñtantamount to, <i>One extreme produces another!</i>ÑSuch a lady as This, may possibly think her case more extraordinary than it is. This I will take upon me to say, That if she has met with the only man in the world, who would have treated her, as she says I have treated her, I have met in her, with the <i>only woman in the world,</i> who would have made such a rout about a case that is uncommon only from the circumstances that attend it.                   This brought them all upon me, hands, eyes, voices, all lifted up at once. But my Lord M. who has in his <i>head</i> (the last seat of retreating lewdness) as much wickedness as I have in my <i>heart,</i> was forced (upon the air I spoke this with, and Charlotte's and all the rest reddening) to make a mouth that was big enough to swallow up the other half of his face; crying out, to avoid laughing, Oh! Oh!Ñas if under the power of a gouty twinge.                   Hadst thou seen how the two tabbies, and the young grimalkins, looked at one another, at my Lord, and at me, by turns, thou too wouldst have been ready to split thy ugly face just in the middle. Thy mouth has already done half the work. And, after all, I found not seldom in this conversation, that my humorous undaunted way forced a smile into my service from the prim mouths of the <i>younger</i> ladies especially: For the case not being likely to be theirs, they could not be so much affected by it, as the elders; who, having had Roses of their own, would have been very loth to have had them nipt in the bud, without saying, By your leave, Mrs. Rose bush, to the mother of it.                   The next article of my indictment was for forgery; and for personating of Lady Betty and my cousin Charlotte. Two shocking charges! thou'lt say: And so they were!Ñ The Peer was outrageous upon the <i>forgery</i>-charge. The Ladies vow'd never to forgive the <i>personating</i> part. Not a peace-maker among them. So we all turn'd women, and scolded.                   My Lord told me, That he believed in his conscience there was not a viler fellow upon <i>God's earth,</i> than me.Ñ What signifies mincing the matter, said he?ÑAnd that it was not the first time I had forged his hand.                   To this I answer'd, that I supposed, When the statute of <i>scandalum magnatum</i> was framed, there were a good many in the peerage, who knew they deserved hard names; and that that Law therefore was rather made to privilege their qualities, than to whiten their characters.                   He called upon me to explain myself, with a <i>Sir-r,</i> so pronounced, as to shew, that one of the most ignominious words in our language was in his head.                   People, I said, that were fenced in by their quality, and by their years, should not take freedoms, that a man of spirit could not put up with, unless he were able heartily to despise the insulter.                   This set him in a violent passion. He would send for Pritchard instantly. Let Pritchard be called. He would alter his will; and all he <i>could</i> leave from me, he <i>would.</i>                   Do, do, my Lord, said I: I always valued my own pleasure above your estate. But I'll let Pritchard know, that if he draws, he shall sign and seal.                   Why, what would I do to Pritchard? ÑShaking his crazy head at me.                   Only, what he, or any man else, writes with his pen, to despoil me of what I think my right, he shall seal with his ears; that's all, my Lord.                   Then the two Ladies interposed.                   Lady Sarah told me, That I carried things a great way; and that neither Lord M. nor any of them, deserved the treatment I gave them.                   I said, I could not bear to be used ill by my Lord, for two reasons; first, Because I respected his Lordship above any man living; and next, Because it look'd as if I were induced by selfish considerations, to take that from Him, which nobody else would offer to me.                   And what, return'd he, shall be my inducement to take what I do at your hands?ÑHay, Sir?                        Indeed, cousin Lovelace, said Lady Betty, with great gravity, we do not any of us, as Lady Sarah says, deserve at your hands the treatment you give us: And let me tell you, that I don't think my character, and your cousin Charlotte's, ought to be prostituted, in order to ruin an innocent lady. She must have known early the good opinion we all have of her, and how much we wished her to be your wife. This good opinion of ours has been an inducement to her (you see she says so) to listen to your address. And this, with her friends folly, has helped to throw her into your power. How you have requited her, is too apparent. It becomes the character we all bear, to disclaim your actions by her. And, let me tell you, that to have her abused by wicked people raised up to personate us, or any of us, makes a double call upon us to disclaim them.                   Lovel.                   Why this is talking somewhat like. I would have you all disclaim my actions. I own I have done very vilely by this lady. One step led to another. I am curst with an enterprising spirit. I hate to be foiled.                   Foiled!                   interrupted Lady Sarah. What a shame to talk at this rate!ÑDid the lady set up a contention with you? All nobly sincere, and plain-hearted, have I heard Miss Clarissa Harlowe is: Above art, above disguise; neither the Coquet, nor the Prude!ÑPoor lady! She deserved a better fate from the man for whom she took the step which she so freely blames!                This above half affected me Ñ Had this dispute been so handled by every one, I had been ashamed to look up. I began to be bashful.Ñ                Charlotte ask'd, If I did not still seem inclinable to do the lady justice, if she would have <i>me?</i> It would be, she dared to say, the greatest felicity the family could know (She would answer for one), that this fine lady were of it.                They all declared to the same effect; and Lady Sarah put the matter home to me.                But my Lord <i>Marplot</i> would have it, that I could not be serious for six minutes together.                I told his Lordship, that he was mistaken; light as he thought I made of this subject, I never knew any that went so near my heart.                     Miss Patty said, She was glad to hear <i>that:</i> Indeed she was glad to hear <i>that:</i> And her soft eyes glistened with pleasure.                Lord M. called her Sweet soul, and was ready to cry.                Not from humanity neither, Jack. This Peer has no bowels; as thou may'st observe by his treatment of <i>me.</i> But when peoples minds are weaken'd by a sense of their own infirmities, and when they are drawing on to their latter ends, they will be moved on the slightest occasions, whether those offer from <i>within,</i> or <i>without</i> them. And this, frequently, the unpenetrating world calls <i>humanity,</i> when all the time, in compassionating the miseries of human nature, they are but pitying themselves; and were they in strong health and spirits, would care as little for any-body else as thou or I do.                Here broke they off my tryal for this Sitting. Lady Sarah was much fatigued. It was agreed to pursue the subject in the morning They all, however, retired together, and went into private conference.             THE Ladies, instead of taking up the subject where we had laid it down, must needs touch upon passages in my fair accuser's letter, which I was in hopes they would have let rest, as we were in a tolerable way. But, truly, they must hear all they could hear, of our story, and what I had to say to those passages, that they might be better enabled to mediate between us, if I were really and indeed inclined to do her the hoped-for justice.             These passages were, 1st, "That after I had trick'd her, against her will, into the act of going off with me, I carried her to one of the worst houses in London."             2. "That I had made a wicked attempt upon her; in "resentment of which, she fled to Hamstead, privately.             3dly, Came the forgery, and personating charge again; and we were upon the point of renewing ou quarrel, before we could get to the next charge: Which was still worse.                  For that, 4thly, was, "That having trick'd her back to the vile house, I had first robbed her of her senses, and then of her honour; detaining her afterwards a prisoner there."             Were I to tell thee the glosses I put upon these heavy charges, what would it be, but to repeat many of the extenuating arguments I have used in my letters to thee? ÑSuffice it, therefore, to say, that I insisted much, by way of palliation, on the lady's extreme niceness: On her diffidence in my honour: On Miss Howe's contriving spirit; plots on their parts, begetting plots on mine: On the high passions of the sex: I asserted, that my whole view, in gently restraining her, was to oblige her to forgive me, and to marry me; and this, for the honour of both families. I boasted of my own good qualities; some of which none that know me, deny; and which few libertines can lay claim to.             They then fell into warm admirations and praises of the lady; all of them preparatory, as I knew, to the grand question: And thus it was introduced by Lady Sarah.             We have said as much as I think we can say, upon these letters of the poor lady. To dwell upon the mischiefs that may ensue from the abuse of a person of her rank, if all the reparation be not made, that now can be made, would perhaps be to little purpose. But you seem, Sir, still to have a just opinion of her, as well as affection for her. Her virtue is not in the least questionable. She could not resent as she does, had she any thing to reproach herself with. She is, by every-body's account, a fine woman; has a good estate in her own right; is of no contemptible family; tho' I think with regard to her, they have acted as imprudently as unworthily. For the excellency of her mind, for good oeconomy, the common speech of her, as the worthy Dr. Lewin once told me, is, <i>That her prudence would enrich a poor man, and her piety reclaim a licentious one.</i> I, who have not been abroad twice this twelvemonth, came hither purposely, so did Lady Betty, to see if justice may not be done her; and also whether we, and my Lord M. (your nearest relations, Sir) have, or have not, any influence over you. And, for my own part, as your determination shall be in this article, such shall be mine, with regard to the disposition of all that is within my power.                Lady Betty.                And mine.                And mine, said my Lord: And valiantly he swore to it.                Lovel.                Far be it from me to think slightly of favours you may any of you be glad I would deserve. But as far be it from me to enter into conditions against my own liking, with sordid views!ÑAs to future mischiefs, let them come. I have not done with the Harlowes yet. They were the aggressors; and I should be glad they would let me hear from them, in the way they should hear from me, in the like case. Perhaps, I should not be sorry to be <i>found,</i> rather than be obliged to <i>seek,</i> on this occasion.                Miss Charlotte                   [reddening]. Spoke like a man of violence, rather than a man of reason! I hope you'll allow that, cousin.                Lady Sarah.                Well, but since what is done, <i>is</i> done, and cannot be undone, let us think of the next best. Have you any objection against marrying Miss Harlowe, if she will have you?                Lovel.                There can possibly be but one: That she is everywhere, no doubt, as well as to Lady Betty, pursuing that maxim, peculiar to herself <i>(and let me tell you, so it ought to be),</i> That what she cannot conceal from herself, she will publish to all the world.                Miss Patty.                The lady, to be sure, writes this in the bitterness of her grief, and in despair.                And this from <i>you,</i> cousin Patty!Ñ<i>Sweet girl!</i> And would <i>you,</i> my dear, in the like case (whispering her), have meant no more by the like exclamations?                I had a rap with her fan, and a blush; and from Lord M. a reflection, That I turn'd into jest every thing they said.                I asked, If they thought the Harlowes deserved any consideration from me; and whether that family would not exult over me, were I to marry their daughter, as if I <i>dared</i> not to do otherwise?                Lady Sarah.                Once I was angry with that family, as w all were. But now I pity them; and think, that you have but too well justified the worst treatment they gave you.                Lord M.                Their family is of standing. All gentlemen of it, and rich, and reputable. Let me tell you, that many of our coronets would be glad they could derive their descents from no worse a stem than theirs.                Lovel.                They are a narrow-soul'd and implacable family. I hate them: And tho' I revere the lady, scorn all relation to them.                Lady Betty.                I wish no worse could be said of <i>him,</i> who is such a scorner of common failings in <i>others.</i>                Lord M.                How would my sister Lovelace have reproached herself for all her indulgent folly to this favourite boy of hers, had she lived till now, and been present on this occasion!                Lady Sarah.                Well but, begging your Lordship's pardon, let us see if any thing can be done for this poor lady.                Miss Ch.                If Mr. Lovelace has nothing to object against the lady's character (and I presume to think he is not <i>asham'd</i> to do her justice, tho' it may make against himself), I cannot see, but honour, and generosity, will compel from him all that we expect. If there be any levities, any weaknesses, to be charg'd upon the lady, I should not open my lips in her favour; tho' in private I would pity her, and deplore her hard hap. And yet, even then, there might not want arguments, from honour and gratitude, in so particular a case, to engage you, Sir, to make good the vows it is plain you have broken.                Lady Betty.                My niece Charlotte has called upon you so justly, and has put the question to you so properly, that I cannot but wish you would speak to it directly, and without evasion.             All in a breath then bespoke my seriousness, and my justice: And in this manner I deliver'd myself, assuming an air sincerely solemn.                I am very sensible, that the performance of the task you have put me upon, will leave me without excuse: But I will not have recourse either to evasion, or palliation.                As my cousin Charlotte has severely observ'd, I am not <i>asham'd</i> to do justice to Miss Harlowe's merit in words, altho' I will confess, that I ought to blush that I have done it so little in deeds.                I own to <i>you</i> all, and, what is more, with high regret (if not with <i>shame,</i> cousin Charlotte), that I have a great deal to answer for in my usage of this lady. The Sex has not a nobler mind, nor a lovelier person of it. And, for <i>virtue,</i> I could not have believed (excuse me, Ladies) that there ever was a woman who <i>gave,</i> or <i>could</i> have given, such illustrious, such uniform proofs of it: For, in her whole conduct, she has shewn herself to be equally above temptation and art; and, I had almost said, human frailty.                The step she so freely blames herself for taking, was truly what she calls <i>compulsatory:</i> For tho' she was provoked to <i>think</i> of going off with me, she intended it not, nor was provided to do so: Neither would she ever have had the <i>thought</i> of it, had her relations left her free, upon her offer'd composition, to renounce the man she did <i>not</i> hate, in order to avoid the man she <i>did.</i>                It piqu'd my pride, I own, that I could so little depend upon the force of those impressions, which I had the vanity to hope I had made in a heart so delicate; and in my worst devices against her, I encouraged myself, that I abused no confidence; for none had she in my honour.                The evils she has suffer'd, it would have been more than a miracle had she avoided. [er watchfulness render'd more plots abortive, than those which contributed to her fall; and they were many and various. And all her greater trials and hardships were owing to her oble resistance and just resentment.                I know, proceeded I, how much I condemn myself in the justice I am doing to this excellent creature. But yet I <i>will</i> do her justice, and cannot help it if I would. And I hope this shews, that I am not so totally abandon'd, as I have been thought to be.                Indeed with me, she has done more honour to hte Sex in her fall, if it be to be called a fall (In truth  ought not), than ever any other could do in her standing.                When, at length, I had given her watchful virt cause of suspicion, I was then indeed obliged to mak use of power and art to hinder her from escaping fro me. She then formed contrivances to elude mine; b all <i>hers</i> were such as strict truth and punctilious honour would justify. She could not stoop to deceit and falshood, no, not to save herself. More than once, justly did she tell me, fired by conscious worthiness, that her soul was my soul's superior!ÑForgive me, Ladies, for saying, that till I knew <i>her,</i> I question'd a Soul in a Sex, created, as I was willing to suppose, only for temporary purposes.ÑIt is not to be imagin'd into what absurdities men of free principles run, in order to justify to themselves their free practices; and to make a religion to their minds: And yet, in this respect, I have not been so faulty as some others.                No wonder that such a noble creature as this looked upon every studied artifice, as a degree of baseness, not to be forgiven: No wonder that she could so easily become averse to the man (tho' once she beheld him with an eye not wholly indifferent) whom she thought capable of premeditated guilt.ÑNor, give me leave, on the other hand, to say, is it to be wonder'd at, that the man who found it so difficult to be forgiven, for the <i>sghter</i> offences, and who had not the grace to recede or repent (made desperate), should be hurried on to the commission of the <i>greater.</i>                In short, Ladies, in a word, my Lord, Miss Clarissa Harlowe is an angel; if ever there was or could be one in human nature: And is, and ever was, as pure as an angel in her will: And this justice I must do her, altho' the question, I see by every glistening eye, is ready to be asked, What, then, Lovelace, are you?Ñ                Lord M.                A devil!ÑA damn'd devil! I must answer. And may the curse of God follow you in all you undertake, if you do not make her the best amends now in your power to make her!                   <i>Lovl.</i>                From you, my Lord, I could expect no other: But from the Ladies I hope for less violence from the ingenuity of my confession.                The Ladies, elder and younger, had their handkerchiefs to their eyes, at the just testimony which I bore to the merits of this exalted creature; and which I would make no scruple to bear at the Bar of a Court of Justice, were I to be called to it.                Lady Betty.                Well, Sir, this is a noble character. If you think as you speak, surely you cannot refuse to do the lady all the justice now in your power to do her.             They all joined in this demand.             I pleaded, that I was sure she would not have me: That, when she had taken a resolution, she was not to be moved: Unpersuadableness was an Harlowe sin: That, and her name, I told them, were all she had of theirs.             All were of opinion, that she might, in her present desolate circumstances, be brought to forgive me. Lady Sarah said, that her sister and she would endeavour to find out the <i>Noble Sufferer,</i> as they justly called her; and would take her into their protection, and be guaranties to her of the justice that I would do her; as well after marriage, as before.             It was some pleasure to me, to observe the placability of these ladies of my own family, had they, any or either of them, met with a LOVELACE. But 'twould be hard upon us honest fellows, Jack, if all women were CLARISSA'S.             Here I am obliged to break off.             IT is much better, Jack, to tell your own story, when it <i>must</i> be know, than to have an adversary tell it for you. Conscious of this, I gave them a particular account, how urgent I had been with her to fix upon the Thursday after I left her (it being her uncle Harlowe's anniversary birth-day, and named to oblige her) for the private celebration; having some days before actually procured a Licence, which still remained with her.             That, not being able to prevail upon her to promise any thing, while under a supposed restraint; I offered to leave her at full liberty, if she would give me the least hope for that day. But neither did this offer avail me.             That this inflexibleness making me desperate, I resolved to add to my former fault, by giving directions, that she should not either go, or correspond, out of the house, till I returned from M. Hall; well knowing, that, if she were at full liberty, I must for ever lose her.                  That this constraint had so much incensed her, that altho' I wrote no less than four different letters, I could not procure a single word in answer; tho' I pressed her but for four words to signify the day and the church.             I referred to my two cousins to vouch for me the extraordinary methods I took to send messengers to town, tho' they knew not the occasion: Which now I told them, was <i>this.</i>             I acquainted them, that I even had wrote to you, Jack, and to another gentleman, of whom I thought she had a good opinion, to attend her, in order to press for her compliance; holding myself in readiness the last day, at Salt-hill, to meet the messenger they should send, and proceed to London, if his message were favourable: But that, before they could attend her, she had found means to fly away once more: And is now, said I, perch'd perhaps, somewhere under Lady Betty's window at Glenham Hall; and there, like the sweet Philomela, a thorn in her breast, warbles forth her melancholy complaints against her barbarous Tereus.             Lady Betty declared, That she was not with <i>her;</i> nor did she know where she was. She should be, she added, the most welcome guest to her, that she ever received.             In truth, I had a suspicion, that she was already in their knowlege, and taken into their protection; for Lady Sarah I imagin'd incapable of being roused to this spirit by a letter only from Miss Harlowe, and that not directed to herself; she being a very indolent and melancholy woman. But her sister, I find, had wrought her up to it: For Lady Betty is as officious and managing a woman as Mrs. Howe; but of a much more generous and noble disposition.ÑShe is <i>my aunt,</i> Jack.             I supposed, I said, that her Ladyship might have a private direction where to send to her. I spoke, as I wish'd: I would have given the world, to have heard, that she was inclined to cultivate the interest of any of my family.             Lady Betty answer'd, that she had no direction but what was in the letter; which she had scratched out, and which, it was probable, was only a temporary one, in order to avoid me: Otherwise she would hardly have directed an answer to be left at an inn. And she was of opinion, that to apply to Miss Howe would be the only certain way to succeed in any application for forgiveness, would I enable that young lady to interest herself in procuring it.                Miss Charlotte.                Permit me to make a proposal.ÑSince we are all of one mind in relation to the justice due to Miss Harlowe, if Mr. Lovelace will oblige himself to marry her, I will make Miss Howe a visit, little as I am acquainted with her; and endeavour to engage her interest to forward the desired reconciliation. And if this can be done, I make no question but all may be happily accommodated; for every-body knows the love there is between Miss Harlowe and Miss Howe.                MARRIAGE, <i>with these women, thou seest, Jack, is an atonement for all we can do to them. A true dramatic recompence!</i>                This motion was highly approved of; and I gave my honour, as desired, in the fullest manner they could wish.                Lady Sarah.                Well then, cousin Charlotte, begin your treaty with Miss Howe, out of hand.                Lady Betty.                Pray do. And let Miss Harlowe be told, that I am ready to receive her, as the welcomest of guests: And I will not have her out of my sight till the knot is tied.                Lady Sarah.                Tell her from me, That she shall be my daughter!ÑInstead of my poor Betsey!ÑAnd shed a tear in remembrance of her lost daughter.                Lord M.                What say you, Sir, to this?                Lovel.                CONTENT, my Lord. I speak in the la|guage of your house.                Lord M.                We are not to be fooled, nephew. No quibbling. We will have no stur put upon us.                Lovel.                You shall not. And yet, I did not intend to marry, if she exceeded the appointed Thursday. But, I think, according to her own notions, that I have injure her beyond reparation, altho' I were to make her  best of husbands; as I am resolved to be, if she                     <i>condescend,</i> as I will call it, to have me. And be Thi cousin Charlotte, <i>my</i> part of your commission to say.                This pleased them all.                Lord M.                Give thy hand, Bob!ÑThou talkest like man of honour at last. I hope we may depend upon w thou sayest?                     The Ladies eyes put the same question to me.                Lovel.                You may, my Lord. You may, Ladies. Absolutely you may.             Then was the personal character of the lady, as well as her more extraordinary talents and endowments, again expatiated upon: And Miss Patty, who had once seen her, launched out more than all the rest in her praise. These were followed by <i>Family-cogencies;</i> what never are forgotten to be inquired after in marriage-treaties, the <i>principal inducements</i> to the <i>Sages</i> of a family, and the <i>least to be mentioned</i> by the <i>Parties</i> themselves, altho' even by <i>them,</i> perhaps, the <i>first</i> thought of: That is to say, inquisition into the lady's fortune; into the particulars of the grandfather's estate; and what her father, and her single-soul'd uncles, will probably do for her, if a reconciliation be effected; as, by <i>their</i> means, they make no doubt but it will, between both families, if it be not my fault. The two Venerables [No longer Tabbies with me now] hinted at rich presents on their own parts; and my Lord declared, that he would make such overtures in my behalf, as should render my marriage with Miss Harlowe the best day's work I ever made; and what, he doubted not, but would be as agreeable to that family, as to myself.             Thus, at present, by a single hair, hangs over my head the matrimonial sword. And thus ended my tryal. And thus are we all friends; and Cousin and Cousin, and Nephew and Nephew, at every word.             Did ever Comedy end more happily, than this long tryal?                      <i>Wedn. July</i> 12.             SO, Jack, they think they have gain'd a mighty point. But, <i>were</i> I to change my mind, were I to repent, I fancy I am safe.ÑAnd yet this very moment it rises to my mind, that 'tis hard trusting too; for surely there must be some embers, where there was fire so lately, that may be stirr'd up to give a blaze to combustibles strew'd lightly upon them. Love (like some self-propagating plants or roots, which have taken strong hold in the earth), when once got deep into the heart, is hardly ever <i>totally</i> extirpated, except by Matrimony indeed, which is the Grave of Love, because it allows of the End of Love. Then these ladies, all advocates <i>for</i> herself, <i>with</i> herself, Miss Howe at their head, perhaps Ñ Not in favour to me Ñ I don't expect That from Miss Howe. ÑBut perhaps in favour to <i>herself:</i> For Miss Howe has reason to apprehend vengeance from me, I ween. Her Hickman will be safe too, as she may think, if I marry her beloved friend: For he has been a busy fellow, and I have long wish'd to have a slap at him! ÑThe lady's case desperate with her friends too; and likely to be so, while single, and her character exposed to censure.             A husband is a charming cloak; a fig-leaf'd apron for a wife: And for a lady to be protected in liberties, in diversions, which her hear pants afterÑand all her faults, even the most criminal, were she to be detected, to be thrown upon the husband, and the ridicule too; a charming eligible for a wife!             But I shall have one comfort, if I marry, which pleases me not a little. If a man's wife has a dear friend of her sex, a hundred liberties may be taken with that friend, which could <i>not</i> be taken, if the <i>single lady</i> (knowing what a title to freedoms marriage has given him with her <i>friend</i>) was not less scrupulous with him than she ought to be, as to <i>herself.</i> Then there are <i>broad</i> freedoms (shall I call them?) that may be taken by the husband with his wife, that may not be <i>quite</i> shocking, which if the wife <i>bears before her friend,</i> will serve for a lesson to <i>that friend;</i> and if that friend <i>bears</i> to be present at them without check or bashfulness, will shew a sagacious fellow, that she can bear as much herself, at <i>proper time</i> and <i>place. Chastity,</i> Jack, like <i>Piety,</i> is an uniform thing. If in <i>look,</i> if in <i>speech,</i> a girl gives way to undue levity, depent upon it, the devil has got one of his cloven feet in her heart alreadyÑ So, Hickman, take care of thyself, I advise thee, whether I marry or not.             Thus, Jack, have I at once reconciled myself to all my relationsÑAnd, if the lady refuses me, thrown the fault upon her. This, I knew, would be in my power to do at any time: And I was the more arrogant to them, in order to heighten the merit of my compliance.             But after all, It would be very whimsical, would it not, if all my plots and contrivances should end in wedlock? What a punishment would this come out to be, upon myself too, that all this while I have been plundering my own treasury?             But, Jack, two things I must insist upon with thee, if this is to be the case.ÑHaving put secrets of so high a nature between me and my spouse into thy power, I must, for my own honour and the honour of my wife and my illustrious progeny, first oblige thee to give up the letters I have so profusely scribbled to thee; and, in the next place, do by thee, as I have heard whisper'd in France was done by the <i>true</i> father of a certain monarque; that is to say, cut thy throat, to prevent thy telling of tales.             I have found means to heighten the kind opinion my friends here have begun to have of me, by communicating to them the contents of the four last letters which I wrote to press my elected spouse to solemnize. My Lord has repeated one of his phrases in my favour, that he hopes it will come out, <i>That the devil is not quite so black as he is painted.</i>             Now pr'ythee, dear Jack, since so many good consequences are to flow from these our nuptials (one of which to <i>thyself;</i> since the sooner thou diest, the less thou wilt have to answer for); and that I now-and-then am apt to believe there may be something in the old fellow's notion, who once told us, that he who kills a man, has all that man's sins to answer for, as well as his own, because he gave him not the time to repent of them, that Heaven design'd to allow him (A fine thing for thee, if thou consentest to be knock'd of the head; but a cursed one for the manslayer!); and since there may be room to fear, that Miss Howe will not give us her help; I pr'ythee now exert thyself to find out my Clarissa Harlowe, that I may make a LOVELACE of her. Set all the city bellmen, and the country criers, for ten miles round the metropolis, at work, with their "O yes's! and if any man, woman or child can give tale or tidings"ÑAdvertise her in all the news-papers; and let her know, "That if she will repair to Lady Betty Lawrance, or to Miss Charlotte Montague, she may hear of something greatly to her advantage."             MY two cousins Montague are actually to set out to-morrow, to Mrs. Howe's, to engage her vixen daughter's interest with her friend: To flaunt it away in a chariot and six, for the greater state and significance.             Confounded mortification to be reduced thus low! Ñ My pride hardly knows how to brook it.             Lord M. has engaged the two venerables to stay here, to attend the issue: And I, standing very high at present in their good graces, am to gallant them to Oxford, to Blenheim, and several other places.

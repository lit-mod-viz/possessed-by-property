<i>Sat. Night, June</i> 10.
               
            
            WHAT will be the issue of all my plots and contrivances, devil take me if I am able to divine! But I will not, as Lord M. would say <i>forestall my own market.</i>
            
            At four, the appointed hour, I sent up, to desire admittance in the Captain's name and my own.
            She would wait upon the <i>Captain</i> presently [Not upon <i>me!</i>]; and in the parlour, if it were not engaged.
            The dining-room being <i>mine,</i> perhaps that was the reason of her naming the parlour—Mighty nice again, if so!—No good sign for me, thought I, this stiffness.
            In the parlour, with me and the Captain, were Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and Mrs. Bevis.
            The women said, they would withdraw, when the Lady came down.
            
               Lovel.
               Not, except she chooses you should, Ladies.—People who are so much above-board as I am, need not make secrets of any of their affairs. Besides, you three Ladies are now acquainted with all our concerns.
            
            
               Capt.
               I have some things to say to your Lady, that perhaps she would not herself choose that any-body should hear; not even <i>you,</i> Mr. Lovelace, as you and her family are not upon such a good foot of understanding as were to be wished.
            
            
               Lovel.
               Well, well, Captain, I must submit. Give us a sign to withdraw; and we will withdraw.
            
            It was better that the exclusion of the women should come from him, than from me.
            
                 
               Capt.
               I will bow, and wave my hand, thus— when I wish to be alone with the lady. Her uncle dotes upon her: I hope, Mr. Lovelace, you will not make a reconciliation more difficult, for the earnestness which my dear friend shews to bring it to bear: But indeed I must tell you, <i>as I told you more than once before,</i> that I am afraid you have made lighter of the occasion of this misunderstanding to me, than it ought to have been made.
            
            
               Lovel.
               I hope, Captain Tomlinson, you do not question my veracity!
            
            
               Capt.
               I beg your pardon, Mr. Lovelace—But those things which we men may think lightly of, may not be so to a lady of delicacy.—And then, if you <i>have</i> bound yourself by a vow, you ought—
            
            Miss Rawlins bridling, her lips closed
(but her mouth stretched to a smile of approbation, the longer for not buttoning),
tacitly shewed herself pleased with the Captain for his delicacy.
            Mrs. Moore <i>could</i> speak—<i>Very true,</i> however, was all she said, with a motion of her head that expressed the bow-approbatory.
            For my part, said the jolly widow, staring with eyes as big as eggs, I know what I know—But Man and Wife <i>are</i> Man and Wife; or they are <i>not</i> Man and Wife.—I have no notion of standing upon such niceties.
            But here she comes! cried one—hearing her chamber-door open—Here she comes! another—hearing it shut after her—And down dropt the angel among us.
            We all stood up, bowing and courtesying; and could not help it. For she entered with such an air as commanded all our reverence. Yet the Captain look'd plaguy grave.
            
               Cl.
               Pray keep your seats, Ladies—Pray do not go
[For they made offers to withdraw; yet Miss Rawlins
  
would have burst, had she been suffer'd to retire].
Before this time you have heard all my story, I make no doubt—Pray keep your seats—At least all Mr. Lovelace's.
               A very saucy and whimsical beginning, thought I.
            
            Capt. Tomlinson, your servant, addressing herself to him with inimitable dignity. I hope you did not take amiss my declining your visit yesterday. I was really incapable of talking upon any subject that required attention.
            
               Capt.
               I am glad I see you better now, Madam. I hope I do.
            
            
               Cl.
               Indeed I am not well. I would not have excused myself from attending you some hours ago, but in hopes I should have been better. I beg your pardon, Sir, for the trouble I have given you; and shall the rather expect it, as <i>this day will,</i> I hope, <i>conclude it all.</i>
               
            
            Thus set! thus determin'd! thought I—Yet to have <i>slept</i> upon it!—But, as what she said was capable of a good, as well as a bad construction, I would not put an unfavourable one upon it.
            
               Lovel.
               The Captain was sorry, my dear, he did not offer his attendance the moment he arrived yesterday. He was afraid that you took it amiss, that he did not.
            
            
               Cl.
               Perhaps I thought that my <i>uncle</i>'s friend might have wished to see me as soon as he came [How we stared!]—But, Sir
(to me),
it might be <i>convenient to you</i> to detain him.
            
            The devil, thought I!—So there really was resentment, as well as head-ach, as my good friend Mrs. Bevis observed, in her refusing to see the honest gentleman.
            
               Capt.
               You <i>would</i> detain me, Mr. Lovelace—I was for paying my respects to the lady the moment I came—
            
            
                 
               Cl.
               Well, Sir
[interrupting him],
to wave this; for I would not be thought captious—If you have not suffer'd inconveniency, in being obliged to come again, I shall be easy.
            
            
               Capt.
               
                  [half-disconcerted]
A <i>little,</i> I can't say but I have. I have, indeed, too many affairs upon my hands. But the desire I have to serve you and Mr. Lovelace, as well as to oblige my dear friend your uncle Harlowe, make great inconveniencies but small ones.
            
            
               Cl.
               You are very obliging, Sir.—Here is a great alteration since you parted with us last.
            
            
               Capt.
               A great one indeed, Madam! I was very much surprised at it, on Thursday evening, when Mr. Lovelace conducted me to your lodgings, where we hoped to find you.
            
            
               Cl.
               Have you any thing to say to me, Sir, from my uncle himself, that requires my <i>private</i> ear? Don't go, Ladies
[for the women stood up, and offer'd to withdraw]
:—If Mr. Lovelace stays, I am sure <i>you</i> may.
            
            I frown'd. I bit my lip. I looked at the women; and shook my head.
            
               Capt.
               I have nothing to offer, but what Mr. Lovelace is a party to, and may hear, except one private word or two, which may be postponed to the last.
            
            
               Cl.
               Pray, Ladies, keep your seats.—Things are altered, Sir, since I saw you. You can mention nothing that relates to <i>me</i> now, to which <i>that gentleman</i> can be a party.
            
            
               Capt.
               You surprise me, Madam! I am sorry to hear this!—Sorry for your <i>uncle</i>'s sake!—Sorry for <i>your</i> sake!—Sorry for Mr. <i>Lovelace</i>'s sake—And yet I am sure he must have given greater occasion than he has mentioned to me, or—
            
            
               Lovel.
               Indeed, Captain, Indeed, Ladies, I have told you great part of my story!—And what I told you of my offence was the truth;—What I concealed
  
of my story was only what I apprehended would, if known, cause this dear creature to be thought more censorious than charitable.
            
            
               Cl.
               Well, well, Sir, say what you please. Make me as black as you please. Make yourself as white as you can. I am not now in your power: That will comfort me for all.
            
            
               Capt.
               God forbid that I should offer to plead in behalf of a crime, that a lady of virtue and honour cannot forgive. But surely, surely, Madam, this is going too far.
            
            
               Cl.
               Do not blame me, Capt. Tomlinson. I have a good opinion of you, as my <i>uncle</i>'s friend. But if you are Mr. <i>Lovelace</i>'s friend, that is another thing; for my interests and Mr. Lovelace's must now be for ever separated.
            
            
               Capt.
               One word with you, Madam, if you please —offering to retire.
            
            
               Cl.
               You may say all that you please to say before these gentlewomen, Mr. Lovelace may have secrets. I have none. You seem to think me faulty: I should be glad, that all the world knew my heart. Let my enemies sit in judgment upon my actions: Fairly scanned, I fear not the result. Let them even ask me my most secret thoughts, and, whether they make for me, or against me, I will reveal them.
            
            
               Capt.
               Noble Lady! who can say as you say?
            
            The women held up their hands and eyes; each, as if she had said, Not I.
            No disorder here, said Miss Rawlins! But (judging by her own heart) A confounded deal of improbability, I believe she thought.
            Finely <i>said,</i> to be sure said the widow Bevis, shrugging her shoulders.
            Mrs. Moore sighed.
            Jack Belford, thought I, knows all mine: And in this I am more ingenuous than any of the three, and a fit match for this paragon.
            
                 
               Cl.
               How Mr. Lovelace has found me out here, I cannot tell. But such mean devices, such artful, such worse than Waltham disguises put on, to obtrude himself into my company; such bold, such shocking untruths—
            
            
               Capt.
               The favour of but one word, Madam, in private—
            
            
               Cl.
               In order to support a right which he has not over me!—O Sir, O Capt. Tomlinson!—I think I have reason to say, that the man is capable of any vileness!—
            
            The women looked upon one another, and upon me, by turns, to see how I bore it. I had such dartings in my head at the instant, that I thought I should have gone distracted. My brain seemed on fire. What would I have given to have had her alone with me!—I traversed the room; my clenched fist to my forehead. O that I had any-body here, thought I, that, Hercules-like, when flaming in the tortures of Deianira's poison'd shirt, I could tear in pieces?
            
               Capt.
               Dear Lady! see you not how the poor gentleman—Lord, how have I imposed upon your uncle, at this rate! How happy, did I tell him, I saw you! How happy I was sure you would be in each other!
            
            
               Cl.
               Oh, Sir, you don't know how many premeditated offences I had forgiven when I saw you last, before I could appear to you, what I hoped then I might for the future be!—But now you may tell my uncle, if you please, that I cannot hope for his mediation. Tell him, that my guilt, in giving this man an opportunity to spirit me away from my <i>try'd,</i> my <i>experienced,</i> my <i>natural</i> friends, harshly as they treated me, stares me every day more and more in the face; and still the more, as my fate seems to be drawing to a crisis, according to the malediction of my offended father!
            
            
                 And then she burst into tears, which even affected that dog, who, brought to abet me, was himself all <i>Belforded</i> over.
            The women, so used to cry without grief, as they are to laugh without reason, by mere force of example [confound their promptitudes!], must needs pull out <i>their</i> handkerchiefs. The less wonder, however, as I myself, between confusion, surprize, and concern, could hardly stand it.
            What's a tender heart good for!—Who can be happy, that has a <i>feeling</i> heart?—And yet thou'lt say, that he who has it not, must be a tyger, and no man.
            
               Capt.
               Let me beg the favour of one word with you, Madam, in private; and that on my <i>own</i> account.
            
            The women hereupon offered to retire. She insisted, that if <i>they</i> went, <i>I</i> should not stay.
            
               Capt.
               Sir, bowing to me, shall I beg—
            
            I hope, thought I, that I may trust this solemn dog, instructed as he is. She does not doubt him. I'll stay out no longer than to give her time to spend her first fire.
            I then passively withdrew, with the women—But with such a bow to my goddess, that it won for me every heart but that I wanted <i>most</i> to win; for the haughty maid bent not her knee in return.
            The conversation between the Captain and the Lady, when we were retired, was to the following effect: They both talked loud enough for me to hear them. The Lady from anger, the Captain with design; and, thou mayst be sure, there was no listener but myself. What I was imperfect in was supply'd afterwards; for I had my vellom-leav'd book, to note all down.—If she had known this, perhaps she would have been more sparing of her invectives— and but <i>perhaps</i> neither.
            
                 He told her, that as her brother was absolutely resolved to see her; and as he himself, in compliance with her uncle's expedient, had reported her marriage; and as that report had reached the ears of Lord M. Lady Betty, and the rest of my relations; and as he had been obliged, in consequence of his first report, to vouch it; and as her brother might find out where she was, and apply to the women here, for a confirmation or refutation of the marriage; he had thought himself obliged to countenance the report before the women: That this had embarassed him not a little, as he would not for the world that she should have cause to think him capable of prevarication, contrivance, or double-dealing: And that this made him desirous of a private conversation with her.
            It was true, she said, she <i>had</i> given her consent to such an expedient, believing it was her <i>uncle</i>'s; and little thinking, that it would lead to so many errors. Yet she might have known, that one error is frequently the parent of many. Mr. Lovelace had made her sensible of the truth of that observation, on more occasions than one; and it was an observation that he the Captain had made, in one of the letters that was shewn her yesterday.
            He hoped, that she had no mistrust of <i>him.</i> That she had no doubts of <i>his honour.</i> If, Madam, you suspect me—If you think me capable—What a man— The Lord be merciful to me!—What a man must you think me!
            I hope, Sir, there cannot be a man in the world, who could deserve to be suspected in such a case as this. I do <i>not</i> suspect you. If it were possible there could be <i>one</i> such man, I am sure, Capt. Tomlinson, a father of children, a man in years, of sense and experience, cannot be that man.
            
                 He told me, that just then, he thought he felt a sudden flash from her eye, an <i>eye-beam,</i> as he called it, dart thro' his shivering reins; and he could not help trembling.
            The dog's conscience, Jack! Nothing else!—I have felt half a dozen such flashes, such eye-beams, in as many different conversations with this soul-piercing beauty.
            Her uncle, she must own, was not accustom'd to think of such expedients: But she had reconciled this to herself, as the case was unhappily uncommon; and by the regard he had for her honour.
            This set the puppy's heart at ease, and gave him more courage.
            She asked him, If he thought Lady Betty and Miss Montague intended her a visit?
            He had no doubt but they did.
            And does he imagine, said she, that I could be brought to countenance to them the report you have given out?
            [<i>I had hoped to bring her to this, Jack, or she had not seen their letters.</i> But I had told the Captain, that I believe I must give up this expectation.]
            No. He believed, that I had not such a thought. He was pretty sure, that I intended, when I saw <i>them,</i> to tell them (as in confidence) the naked truth.
            He then told her, that her uncle had already made some steps towards a general reconciliation. The moment, Madam, that he knows you are really married, he will enter into conference with your <i>father</i> upon it; having actually expressed his desire to be reconciled to you, to your <i>mother.</i>
            
            And what, Sir, said my mother? What said my <i>dear</i> mother? [with great emotion; holding out her sweet face, as the Captain described her, with the most earnest attention, as if she would shorten
  
the way which his words were to have to her heart.]
            Your mother, Madam, burst into tears upon it: And your uncle was so penetrated by <i>her</i> tenderness, that he could not proceed with the subject. But he intends to enter upon it with her in form, as soon as he hears that the ceremony is over.
            By the tone of her voice she wept. The dear creature, thought I, begins to relent!—And I grudg'd the dog his eloquence. I could hardly bear the thought, that any man breathing should have the power, which I had lost, of persuading this high-soul'd lady, tho' in my own favour. And, wouldst thou think it? this reflection gave me more uneasiness at the moment, than I felt from her reproaches, violent as they were; or than I had pleasure in her supposed relenting. For there is beauty in every-thing she says and does: Beauty in her passion: Beauty in her tears!—Had the Captain been a young fellow, and of rank and fortune, his throat would have been in danger; and I should have thought very hardly of her!
            O Capt. Tomlinson, said she, you know not what I have suffer'd by this man's strange ways. He had, as I was not ashamed to tell him yesterday, a <i>plain path before him.</i> He at first betray'd me into his power: But when I <i>was</i> in it—There she stopt. Then resuming—O, Sir, you know not what a strange man he has been!—An unpolite, a rough-manner'd man!—In disgrace of his birth, and education, and knowlege, an unpolite man!—And so acting, as if his worldly and personal advantages set him above those graces which distinguish a gentleman.
            The first woman that ever said or that ever thought so of me, that's my comfort, thought I!— But this (spoken to her <i>uncle's friend</i> behind my back) helps to heap up thy already too-full measure, dearest!—It is down in my vellom-book.
            
                 
               Cl.
               When I look back on his whole behaviour to a poor young creature (for I am but a <i>very</i> young creature), I cannot acquit him either of great folly, or of deep design.—And, last Wednesday—
            
            [There she stopt; and I suppose turn'd away her face. I wonder she was not asham'd to hint at what she thought so shameful; and that to a <i>man,</i> and <i>alone</i> with him.]
            
               Capt.
               Far be it from me, Madam, to offer to enter too closely into so tender a subject. He owns, that you have reason to be displeased with him. But he so solemnly clears himself to me, of <i>premeditated</i> offence—
            
            
               Cl.
               He cannot clear himself, Mr. Tomlinson. The people of the house must be very vile, as well as he. I am convinced, that there was a wicked confederacy—But no more upon such a subject.
            
            
               Capt.
               Only one word more, Madam: He tells me, that he gave you such an instance of your power over him, as never man gave: And that you promised to pardon him.
            
            
               Cl.
               He knew, that he deserved not pardon, or he had not extorted that promise from me. Nor had I given it to him, but to shield myself from the vilest outrage—
            
            
               Capt.
               I could wish, Madam, inexcusable as his behaviour has been, since he has <i>something</i> to plead in the reliance he made upon your <i>promise</i>; that, for the sake of appearances to the world, and to avoid the mischiefs that may follow, if you absolutely break with him, you could prevail upon your naturally generous mind, to lay an obligation upon him by your forgiveness.
            
            She was silent.
            
               Capt.
               Your father and mother, Madam, deplore a daughter lost to them, whom your generosity to Mr. Lovelace may restore: Do not put it to the possible chance, that they may have cause to deplore a
  
double loss; the losing of a <i>son,</i> as well as a <i>daughter,</i> who, by his own violence, which you may perhaps prevent, may be for ever lost to them, and to the whole family.
            
            She paused. She wept. She owned, that she felt the force of this argument.
            I will be the making of this fellow, thought I!
            
               Capt.
               Permit me, Madam, to tell you, that I do not think it would be difficult to prevail upon your uncle, if you insist upon it, to come up privately to town, and to give you with his own hand to Mr. Lovelace—Except, indeed, your present misunderstanding were to come to his ears.
            
            
               Cl.
               But why, Sir, should I be so much afraid of my <i>brother?</i> My brother has injured <i>me,</i> not I <i>him.</i> Shall I seek protection from my brother of Mr. Lovelace? And who shall protect me from Mr. Lovelace?—Will the one offer to me, what the other has offer'd!—Wicked, ungrateful man! to insult a friendless, unprotected creature, made friendless by himself—I cannot, cannot think of him in the light I once thought of him. He has no business with me. Let him leave me. Let my brother find me. I am not such a poor creature, as to be afraid to face the brother who has injured me.
            
            
               Capt.
               Were you and your brother to meet only to confer together, to expostulate, to clear up difficulties, it were another thing. But what, Madam, can you think will be the issue of an interview (Mr. Solmes with him), when he finds you <i>unmarried,</i> and resolved never to have Mr. Lovelace; supposing Mr. Lovelace were <i>not</i> to interfere; which cannot be supposed?
            
            
               Cl.
               Well, Sir, I can only say, I am a very unhappy creature!—I must resign to the will of Providence, and be patient under evils, which <i>that</i> will not permit me to shun. But I have taken my measures. Mr. Lovelace can never make <i>me</i> happy, nor
  
I <i>him.</i> I wait here only for a letter from Miss Howe. That must determine me—
            
            Determine you as to Mr. Lovelace, Madam? interrupted the Captain.
            
               Cl.
               I am already determin'd as to him.
            
            
               Capt.
               If it be not in his favour, I have done. I cannot use stronger arguments than I have used, and it would be impertinent to repeat them.—If you cannot forgive his offence, I am sure it must have been much greater than he has owned to me.—If you are absolutely determined, be pleased to let me know what I shall say to your uncle? You was pleased to tell me, that this day would put an end to what you called my trouble: I should not have thought it any, could I have been an humble means of reconciling persons of worth and honour to each other.
            
            Here I enter'd with a solemn air.
            
               Lovel.
               Mr. Tomlinson, I have heard a great part of what has passed between you and this unforgiving, however otherwise excellent lady. I am cut to the heart to find the dear creature so determined. I could not have believed it possible, with such prospects, that I had so little a share in her esteem. Nevertheless I must do myself justice with regard to the offence I was so unhappy as to give, since I find you are ready to think it much greater than it really was.
            
            
               Cl.
               I hear not, Sir, your recapitulations. I am, and ought to be, the sole judge of insults offered to my person. I enter not into discussion with you, nor hear you on the shocking subject. And was going.
            
            I put myself between her and the door—You <i>may</i> hear all I have to say, Madam. My <i>fault</i> is not o such a nature, but that you <i>may.</i> I will be a just accuser of myself; and will not wound your ears.
            I then protested that the fire was a real fire [So it was]. I disclaimed [less truly indeed] premeditation. I owned that I was hurried on by the violence of a youthful passion, and by a sudden impulse,
  
which few other persons, in the like situation, would have been able to check: That I withdrew, at her command and intreaty, on the promise of <i>pardon,</i> without having offered the least indecency, or any freedom, that would not have been forgiven by persons of delicacy, surprised in an attitude so charming—Her terror, on the alarm of fire, calling for a soothing behaviour, and personal tenderness, she being ready to fall into fits: My hoped-for happy day so near, that I might be presumed to be looked upon as a betrothed lover—And that this excuse might be pleaded even for the women of the house, that they, thinking us actually married, might suppose themselves to be the less concerned to interfere on so tender an occasion—There, Jack, was a bold insinuation in behalf of the women!
            High indignation filled her disdainful eye, eye-beam after eye-beam flashing at me. Every feature of her sweet face had soul in it. Yet she spoke not. Perhaps, Jack, she had a thought, that this <i>plea for the women</i> accounted for my contrivance to have her pass to them as married, when I <i>first carried her thither.</i>
            
            
               Capt.
               Indeed, Sir, I must say, that you did not well to add to the apprehensions of a lady so much terrified before.
            
            She offer'd to go by me. I set my back against the door, and besought her to stay a few moments. I had not said thus much, my dearest creature, but for your sake, as well as for my own, that Captain Tomlinson should not think I had been viler than I was. Nor will I say one word more on the subject, after I have appealed to your own heart, whether it was not necessary, that I should say so much; and to the Captain, whether otherwise he would not have gone away with a much worse opinion of me, if he
  
had judged of my offence by the violence of your resentment.
            
               Capt.
               Indeed I <i>should.</i> I <i>own</i> I should. And I am very glad, Mr. Lovelace, that you are able to defend yourself thus far.
            
            
               Cl.
               That cause must be well tried, where the offender takes his seat upon the same bench with the judge.—I submit not mine to men—Nor, give me leave to say, to You, Captain Tomlinson, tho' I am willing to have a good opinion of you. Had not the man been assured, that he had influenced you in his favour, he would not have brought you up to Hamstead.
            
            
               Capt.
               That I am <i>influenced,</i> as you call it, Madam, is for the sake of your uncle, and for your own sake, more (I will say to Mr. Lovelace's face) than for his. What can I have in view, but peace and reconciliation? I have, from the <i>first,</i> blamed, and I now, <i>again,</i> blame, Mr. Lovelace, for adding distress to distress, and terror to terror; the lady, as you acknowlege, Sir
[<i>looking valiantly</i>],
ready <i>before</i> to fall into fits.
            
            
               Lovel.
               Let me own to you, Captain Tomlinson, that I have been a very faulty, a very foolish man; and, if this dear creature <i>ever</i> honoured me with her love, an <i>ingrateful</i> one. But I have had too much reason to doubt it. And this is now a flagrant proof that she never had the value for me which my proud heart wished for, that, with such prospects before us; a day so near; settlements approved and drawn; her uncle mediating a reconciliation, which, for <i>her</i> sake, not <i>my own,</i> I was desirous to give into; she can, for an offence so <i>really</i> slight, on an occasion so <i>truly</i> accidental, renounce me for ever; and, with me, all hopes of that reconciliation in the way her uncle had put it in, and she had acquiesced with; and
  
risque all consequences, fatal ones as they may too possibly be.—By my soul, Captain Tomlinson, the dear creature must have hated me all the time she was intending to honour me with her hand. And now she must resolve to abandon me, as far as I know, with a preference in her heart of the most odious of men—in favour of <i>that Solmes,</i> who, as you tell me, accompanies her brother: And with what hopes, with what view, accompanies him?—How can I bear to think of this?—
            
            
               Cl.
               It is fit, Sir, that you should judge of my regard for you, by your own conscious demerits. Yet you know, or you would not have dared to behave to me as sometimes you did, that you had more of it than you deserved.
            
            She walked from us; and then returning, Captain Tomlinson, said she, I will own to you, that I was not capable of resolving to give my <i>hand,</i> and—<i>nothing but my hand.</i>—Have I not given a flagrant proof of this to the once most indulgent of parents? which has brought me into a distress, which this man has heightened, when he ought, in gratitude and honour, to have endeavoured to render it supportable. I had even a <i>byas,</i> Sir, in his favour, I scruple not to own it. Long, too long! bore I with his unaccountable ways, attributing his errors to unmeaning gaiety, and to a want of knowing what true delicacy, and true generosity, required from a heart susceptible of grateful impressions to one involved by his means in unhappy circumstances. It is now <i>wickedness</i> in him (a wickedness which discredits all his <i>professions</i>) to say, that his last cruel and ingrateful insult was not a <i>premeditated</i> one.—But what need I say more of this insult, when it was of such a nature, that it has changed that byas in his favour, and made me choose to forego all the inviting prospects he
  
talks of, and to run all hazards, to free myself from his power?
            O my dearest creature! how happy for us both, had I been able to <i>discover that byas,</i> as you condescend to call it, thro' such reserves as man never encountered with!—
            He did <i>discover</i> it, Captain Tomlinson. He brought me, <i>more than once, to own it</i>; the more needlesly brought me to own it, as I dare say his own <i>vanity</i> gave him <i>no cause to doubt it</i>; and as I had no other motive in not being <i>forward</i> to own it, than my too just apprehensions of his want of generosity. In a word, Captain Tomlinson (and now, that I am determined upon my measures, I the less scruple to say it), I should have despised myself, had I found myself capable of affectation or tyranny to the man I intended to marry. I have always blamed the dearest friend I have in the world for a fault of this nature. In a word—
            
               Lovel.
               And had my angel really and indeed the favour for me she is pleased to own?—Dearest creature, forgive me. Restore me to your good opinion. Surely I have not sinned beyond forgiveness. You say, that I extorted from you the promise you made me. But I could not have presumed to make that promise the condition of my obedience, had I not thought there was room to expect forgiveness. Permit, I beseech you, the prospects to take place, that were opening so agreeably before us. I will go to town, and bring the licence. All difficulties to the obtaining of it are surmounted. Captain Tomlinson shall be witness to the deeds. He will be present at the ceremony on the part of your uncle. Indeed he gave me hope, that your uncle himself—
            
            
               Capt.
               I <i>did,</i> Mr. Lovelace: And I will tell you my grounds for the hope I gave. I proposed to my
  
dear friend (Your uncle, Madam), that he should give out, that he would take a turn with me to my little farm-house, as I call it, near Northampton, for a week or so.—Poor gentleman! he has of late been very little abroad! Too visibly indeed declineing!—Change of air, it might be given out, was good for him.—But I see, Madam, that this is too <i>tender</i> a subject—
            
            The dear creature wept. She knew how to apply, as meant, the Captain's hint to the <i>occasion</i> of her uncle's declining state of health.
            
               Capt.
               We might indeed, I told him, set out in that road, but turn short to town <i>in my chariot</i>; and he might see the ceremony performed with his own eyes, and be the desired father, as well as the beloved uncle.
            
            She turned from us, and wiped her eyes.
            
               Capt.
               And, really, there seem now to be but two objections to this; as Mr. Harlowe discouraged not the proposal—The one, the unhappy misunderstanding between you; which I would not by any means he should know; since then he might be apt to give weight to Mr. James Harlowe's unjust surmizes.— The other, that it would necessarily occasion some delay to the ceremony; which I cannot see, but may be performed in a day or two—If—
            
            And then he reverently bowed to my goddess. — Charming fellow!—But often did I curse my stars, for making me so much obliged to his adroitness.
            She was going to speak; but, not liking the turn of her countenance (altho', as I thought, its severity and indignation seemed a little abated), I said, and had like to have blown myself up by it—One expedient I have just thought of—
            
               Cl.
               None of your expedients, Mr. Lovelace! I abhor your expedients, your inventions—I have had too many of them.
            
            
                 
               Lovel.
               See, Capt. Tomlinson!—See, Sir—O how we expose ourselves to you!—Little did you think, I dare say, that we have lived in such a continued misunderstanding together! But you will make the best of it all. We may yet be happy. O that I could have been assured, that this dear lady loved me with the hundredth part of the love I have for her!—Our diffidences have been mutual. This dear creature has too much punctilio: I am afraid, that I have too little. Hence our difficulties. But I have a heart, Capt. Tomlinson, a heart, that bids me hope for her love, because it is resolved to deserve it, as much as man <i>can</i> deserve it.
            
            
               Capt.
               I am indeed surprised at what I have seen and heard. I defend not Mr. Lovelace, Madam, in the offence he has given you—As a father of daughters myself, I <i>cannot</i> defend him, tho' his fault seems to be lighter than I had apprehended—But in my conscience I think, that you, Madam, cany your resentment too high.
            
            
               Cl.
               Too high, Sir!—Too high, to the man that might have been happy if he would!—Too high to the man that has held <i>my soul in suspense</i> an hundred times, since (by artifice and deceit) he obtained a power over me!—Say, Lovelace, thyself say, Art thou not the <i>very</i> Lovelace, that, by insulting <i>me,</i> hast wrong'd thy <i>own hopes?</i>—The wretch that appeared in vile disguises, personating an old lame creature, seeking for lodgings for thy sick wife?—Telling the gentlewomen here, stories all of thy own invention; and asserting to them an husband's right over me, which thou hadst not?—And is it
(turning to the Captain)
to be expected, that I should give credit to the protestations of such a man?
            
            
               Lovel.
               Treat me, dearest creature, as you please, I will bear it: And yet your scorn and your violence have fixed daggers in my heart—But was it possible,
  
without those disguises, to come at your speech?— And could I lose you, if study, if invention, would put it in my power to arrest your anger, and give me hope to engage you to confirm to me the <i>promised pardon?</i>—The address I made to you before the women, as if the marriage-ceremony had passed, was in consequence of what your uncle <i>had advised,</i> and what <i>you had acquiesced with</i>; and the rather made, as your brother, and Singleton, and Solmes, were resolved to find out whether what was reported of your marriage were true or not, that they might take their measures accordingly; and in hopes to prevent that mischief, which I have been but too studious to prevent, since this tameness has but invited insolence from your brother and his confederates.
            
            
               Cl.
               O thou strange wretch, how thou talkest!— But, Captain Tomlinson, give me leave to say, that, were I inclin'd to talk any farther upon this subject, I would appeal to Miss Rawlins's judgment (Who else have I to appeal to?); she seems to be a person of prudence and honour; but not to any <i>man</i>'s judgment, whether I carry my resentment beyond fit bounds, when I resolve—
            
            
               Capt.
               Forgive, Madam, the interruption—But I think there can be no reason for this. You ought, as you said, to be the <i>sole judge</i> of indignities offered you. The gentlewomen here are strangers to you. You will perhaps stay but a little while among them. If you lay the state of your case before any of them, and your brother come to inquire of them, your uncle's intended mediation will be discover'd, and rendered abortive—<i>I</i> shall appear in a light that I never appeared in, in my life—for these women may not think themselves obliged to keep the secret.
            
            
               Cl.
               O what difficulties has one fatal step involved me in!—But there is no necessity for such an appeal. I am resolved on my measures.
            
            
                 
               Capt.
               
                  <i>Absolutely</i> resolved, Madam?
            
            
               Cl.
               I am.
            
            
               Capt.
               What shall I say to your uncle Harlowe, Madam?—Poor gentleman! how will he be surprised! —You see, Mr. Lovelace—You see, Sir— turning to me, with a flourishing hand—But you may thank yourself—and admirably stalk'd he from us.
            
            
               <i>True, by my soul,</i> thought I. I traversed the room, and bit my unpersuasive lips, now upper, now under, for vexation.
            He made a profound reverence to her—And went to the window, where lay his hat and whip; and, taking them up, open'd the door. Child, said he, to somebody he saw, pray, order my servant to bring my horse to the door—
            
               Lovel.
               You won't go, Sir—I hope you won't!— I am the unhappiest man in the world!—You won't go—Yet, alas! —But you won't go, Sir! —There may be yet hopes, that Lady Betty may have some weight—
            
            
               Capt.
               
                  <i>Dear</i> Mr. Lovelace; and may not my worthy friend, an affectionate uncle, hope for some influence upon his <i>daughter-niece?</i>—But I beg pardon —A letter will always find me disposed to serve the lady, and that as well for her sake, as for the sake of my dear friend.
            
            She had thrown herself into a chair; her eyes cast down: She was motionless, as in a profound study.
            The Captain bowed to her again: But met with no return to his bow. <i>Mr. Lovelace,</i> said he (with an air of equality and independence), <i>I am Yours.</i>
            
            Still the dear unaccountable sat as immoveable as a statue; stirring neither hand, foot, head, nor eye— I never before saw any one in so profound a resverie, in so waking a dream.
            He passed by her to go out at the door she sat near, tho' the other door was his direct way; and
  
bowed again. She moved not. I will not disturb the lady in her meditations, Sir.—Adieu, Mr. Lovelace—<i>No farther, I beseech you.</i>
            
            She started, sighing—Are you going, Sir?
            
               Capt.
               I am, Madam. I could have been glad to do you service: But I see it is not in my power.
            
            She stood up, holding out one hand, with inimitable dignity and sweetness—I am sorry you are going, Sir—I can't help it—I have no friend to advise with—Mr. Lovelace has the art (or good-fortune, perhaps, I should call it) to make himself many.— Well, Sir—If you will go, I can't help it.
            
               Capt.
               I will <i>not</i> go, Madam, his eyes twinkling [Again seized with a fit of humanity!]. I will <i>not</i> go, if my longer stay can do you either service or pleasure. What, Sir (turning to me), what, Mr. Lovelace, was your expedient?—Perhaps something may be offer'd, Madam—
            
            She sighed, and was silent.
            REVENGE, <i>invoked I to myself, keep thy throne in my heart—If the usurper</i> LOVE <i>once more drive thee from it, thou wilt never regain possession!</i>
            
            
               Lovel.
               What I had thought of, what I had intended to propose, and I sigh'd—was this, That the dear creature, if she will not forgive me, as she promised, would suspend the displeasure she has conceived against me, till Lady Betty arrives. —That lady may be the mediatrix between us. This dear creature may put herself into <i>her</i> protection, and accompany her down to her seat in Oxfordshire. It is one of her Ladyship's purposes to prevail on her supposed new niece to go down with her. It may pass to every one but to Lady Betty, and to you, Capt. Tomlinson, and to your friend Mr. Harlowe (as he desires), that we have been some time married: And her being with my relations, will amount to a proof to James Harlowe, that we <i>are</i>; and our nuptials may
  
be privately, and at this beloved creature's pleasure, solemnized; and your report, Captain, authenticated.
            
            
               Capt.
               Upon my honour, Madam, clapping his hand upon his breast, a charming expedient! This will answer every end.
            
            She mused—She was greatly perplexed—At last, God direct me, said she! I know not what to do— A young unfriended creature, whom have I to advise with?—Let me retire, if I <i>can</i> retire.
            She withdrew with slow and trembling feet, and went up to her chamber.
            For Heaven's sake, said the penetrated varlet, his hands lifted up, for Heaven's sake, take compassion upon this admirable lady!—I cannot proceed—I cannot proceed—She deserves all things—
            Softly!—damn the fellow!—The women are coming in.
            He sobb'd up his grief—turn'd about—hemm'd up a more <i>manly</i> accent—Wipe thy cursed eyes—He did. The sunshine took place on one cheek, and spread slowly to the other, and the fellow had his whole face again.
            The women all three came in, led by that ever-curious Miss Rawlins. I told them, that the lady was gone up to consider of every-thing: That we had hopes of her. And such a representation we made of all that had passed, as brought either tacit or declared blame upon the fair perverse, for hardness of heart, and over-delicacy.
            The widow Bevis, in particular, put out one lip, tossed up her head, wrinkled her forehead, and made such motions with her now-lifted-up, now cast-down eyes, as shew'd, that she thought there was a great deal of perverseness and affectation in the lady. Now-and-then she changed her censuring looks to looks of pity of me—But (as she said) She loved not to aggravate!—A poor business, <i>God help's!</i> shrugging up
  
her shoulders, to make such a rout about! and then her eyes laugh'd heartily — Indulgence was a good thing! Love was a good thing!—But too much was too much!
            Miss Rawlins, however, declared, after she had called the Widow Bevis, with a prudish simper, a <i>comical gentlewoman!</i> That there must be something in our story, which she could not fathom; and went from us into a corner, and sat down, seemingly vexed that she could not.
         
         
            
            THE lady staying longer above than we wished; and hoping that (lady-like) she only waited for an invitation to return to us; I desired the Widow Bevis, in the Captain's name (who wanted to go to town), to request the favour of her company.
            I cared not to send up either Miss Rawlins or Mrs. Moore on the errand, lest my beloved should be in a <i>communicative disposition</i>; especially as she had hinted at an appeal to Miss Rawlins; who, besides, has such an unbounded curiosity.
            Mrs. Bevis presently return'd with an answer (winking and pinking at me), that the lady would follow her down. Miss Rawlins could not but offer to retire, as the others did. Her eyes, however, intimated that she had rather stay. But they not being answer'd as she seemed to wish, she went with the rest, but with slower feet; and had hardly left the parlour, when the lady enter'd it by the other door; a melancholy dignity in her person and air.
            She sat down. Pray, Mr. Tomlinson, be seated. He took his chair over against her. I stoo beh hers, that I might give him <i>agreed-upon</i> signals, should there be occasion for them.
            
                 As thus — A wink of the left-eye was to signify, <i>Push that point, Captain.</i>
            
            A wink of the right, and a nod, was to indicate <i>Approbation</i> of what he had said.
            My fore-finger held up, and biting my lip, <i>Get off of that, as fast as possible.</i>
            
            A right-forward nod, and a frown—<i>Swear to it, Captain.</i>
            
            My whole spread hand, <i>To take care not to say too much on that particular subject.</i>
            
            And these motions I could make, even those with my hand, without holding up my arm, or moving my wrist, had the women been there; as, when they were agreed upon, I knew not but they would.
            A scouling brow, and a positive nod, was to bid him <i>rise in his temper.</i>
            
            She hemm'd—I was going to speak, to spare her supposed confusion: But this lady never wants presence of mind, when presence of mind is necessary either to her honour, or to that conscious dignity which distinguishes her from all the women I ever knew.
            I have been considering, said she, as well as I was able, of every thing that has passed; and of all that has been said; and of my unhappy situation. I mean no ill; I wish no ill, to any creature living, Mr. Tomlinson. I have always delighted to draw favourable rather than unfavourable conclusions, sometimes, as it has proved, for very bad hearts. Censoriousness, whatever faults I have, is not <i>naturally</i> my fault.—But, circumstanced as I am; treated as I have been, unworthily treated by a man who is full of contrivances, and glories in them—
            
               Lovel.
               My dearest life!—But I will not interrupt you.
            
            
               Cl.
               Thus treated, it becomes me to doubt — It concerns my honour to doubt, to fear, to apprehend—
  
                  <i>Your</i> intervention, Sir, is so seasonable, so kind, for <i>this man</i> — My uncle's expedient, the first of the kind he ever, I believe, thought of; a plain, honest, good-minded man, as he is, not affecting such expedients — Your report in conformity, to it — The consequences of that report; The alarm taken by my brother; His rash resolution upon it—The alarm taken by Lady Betty, and the rest of Mr. Lovelace's relations—The <i>sudden</i> letters written to him, upon it, which, with yours, he shew'd me—All ceremony, among persons <i>born observers of ceremony,</i> and intitled to value themselves upon <i>their distinction</i>— All these things have happen'd <i>so</i> quick, and some of them <i>so</i> seasonable—
            
            
               Lovel.
               Lady Betty, you see, Madam, in her letter, dispenses with punctilio, avowedly in compliment to you. Charlotte, in hers, professes to do the same for the same reason. Good Heaven, that the respect intended you by my relations, who, in every other case, are really punctilious, should be thus construed! They were glad, Madam, to have an opportunity to compliment you at my expence. Every one of my family takes delight in raillying me. But their joy on the supposed occasion—
            
            
               Cl.
               Do I doubt, Sir, that you have not something to say, for any-thing you think fit to do?—I am speaking to Captain Tomlinson, Sir.—I wish you would be pleased to withdraw—At least to come from behind my chair.
            
            And she looked at the Captain, observing, no doubt, that his eyes seemed to take lessons from mine.
            A fair match, by Jupiter!
            The Captain was disconcerted. The dog had not had such a blush upon his face for ten years before. I bit my lip for vexation: Walk'd about the room; but nevertheless took my post again; and blink'd
  
with my eyes to the Captain, as a caution for him to take more care of <i>his:</i> And then scouling with my brows, and giving the nod positive, I as good as said, <i>Resent that, Captain.</i>
            
            
               Capt.
               I hope, Madam, you have no suspicion, that I am capable—
            
            
               Cl.
               Be not displeased with me, Captain Tomlinson. I have told you, that I am not of a suspicious temper. Excuse me for the sake of my sincerity. There is not, I will be bold to say, a sincerer heart in the world, than hers before you.
            
            She took out her handkerchief, and put it to her eyes.
            I was going at the instant, after her example, to vouch for the honesty of <i>my</i> heart; but my conscience <i>Mennell'd</i> upon me; and would not suffer the meditated vow to pass my lips.—A devilish thing, thought I, for a man to be so little himself, when he has most occasion for himself!
            The villain Tomlinson look'd at me with a rueful face, as if he begg'd leave to cry for company. It might have been as well, if he <i>had</i> cried. A feeling heart, or the tokens of it, given by a sensible eye, are very reputable things, when kept in countenance by the occasion.
            And here let me fairly own to thee, that twenty times in this trying conversation I said to myself, that could I have thought, that I should have all this trouble, and incurr'd all this guilt, I would have been honest at first. But why, question'd I, is this dear creature so lovely?—Yet so invincible?—Ever heardst thou before, that the sweets of May blossom'd in December?
            
               Capt.
               Be pleased — be pleased, Madam—if you have doubts of my honour—
            
            A whining varlet! He should have been quite angry—For what gave I him the nod positive? He
  
should have stalk'd to the window, as for his whip and hat.
            
               Cl.
               I am only making such observations as my youth, my inexperience, and my present unhappy circumstances, suggest to me—A worthy heart (such, I hope, is Captain Tomlinson's) need not fear an examination—need not fear being looked into — Whatever doubt <i>that</i> man, who has been the cause of my errors, and, as my severe father imprecated, the punisher of the errors he has caused, might have had of me, or of my honour, I would have forgiven him for them, if he had fairly proposed them to me: For he might, perhaps, have had some doubt of the future conduct of a creature, whom he could induce to correspond with him against parental prohibition, and against the lights which her own judgment threw in upon her: And if he had propounded them to me like a man and a gentleman, I would have been glad of the opportunity given me to clear my intentions, and to have shewn myself intitled to his good opinion —And I hope <i>you,</i> Sir—
            
            
               Capt.
               I am ready to hear all your doubts, Madam, and to clear them up—
            
            
               Cl.
               I can only put it, Sir, to your conscience and honour—
            
            The dog sat uneasy: He shifted his feet: Her eye was upon him; he was therefore, after the rebuff he had met with, afraid to look at me for my motions; and now turn'd his eyes towards me, then from me, as if he would <i>unlook</i> his own looks; his head turning about like a weathercock in a hurricane.
            
               Cl.
               —That all is true, that you have written, and that you have told me.
            
            I gave him a right-forward nod, and a frown—as much as to say, <i>Swear to it, Captain.</i> But the varlet did not round it off as I would have had him. However, he averr'd that it was.
            
                 He had hoped, he said, that the circumstances with which his commission was attended, and what he had communicated to her, which he could not know but from his dear friend her uncle, might have shielded him even from the <i>shadow</i> of suspicion—But I am contented, said he, stammering, to be thought—to be thought—what—what you please to think me— till, till, you are satisfied—
            A whore's-bird!
            
               Cl.
               The circumstances you refer to, I must own, ought to shield you, Sir, from suspicion—But the man before you is a man that would make an angel suspected, should that angel plead for him.
            
            I came forward. Travers'd the room—Was indeed in a bloody passion—I have no patience, Madam! —And again I bit my unpersuasive lip—
            
               Cl.
               No man ought to be impatient at imputations he is not asham'd to deserve. An innocent man <i>will not</i> be outrageous upon such imputations. A guilty man <i>ought not.</i> 
                  [Most excellently would this charming creature cap sentences with Lord M.!] But I am not now trying you, Sir, on the foot of your <i>merits.</i> I am only sorry, that I am constrained to put questions to this <i>worthier</i> gentleman, which perhaps I ought not to put, so far as they regard <i>himself.</i>—And I hope, Captain Tomlinson, that you, who know not Mr. Lovelace so well, as, to my unhappiness, I do, and who have children of your own, will excuse a poor young creature, who is deprived of all worthy protection, and who has been insulted and endangered, by the most <i>designing man in the world,</i> and perhaps <i>by a confederacy of his creatures.</i>
               
            
            There she stopt; and stood up, and looked at me; fear, nevertheless, apparently mingled with her anger. And so it ought. I was glad, however, of this
  
poor sign of love—No one fears whom they value not.
            Womens tongues were licensed, I was going to say—But my conscience would not let me call her a <i>woman</i>; nor use to her so vulgar a phrase. I could only rave by my motions; lift up my eyes, spread my hands, rub my face, pull my wig, and look like a fool. Indeed, I had a great mind to run mad. Had I been alone with her, I would; and she should have taken consequences.
            The Captain interposed in my behalf; gently, however, and as a man not quite sure that he was himself acquitted. Some of the pleas we had both insisted on, he again inforced—And, speaking low— Poor gentleman! said he, who can but pity him! —Indeed, Madam, it is easy to see, with all his failings, the power you have over him!
            
               Cl.
               I have no pleasure, Sir, in distressing any one.— Not even <i>him,</i> who has so much distressed me.—But, Sir, when I THINK, and when I see him before me, I cannot command my temper! — Indeed, indeed, Captain Tomlinson, Mr. Lovelace has not acted by me either as a grateful, a generous, or a prudent man!—He knows not, as I told him yesterday, the value of the heart he has insulted!
            
            There the angel stopt; her handkerchief at her eyes!
            O Belford, Belford! that she should so greatly excel, as to make me, at times, a villain in my own eyes!
            I besought her pardon. I promised, that it should be the study of my whole life to deserve it. My faults, I said, <i>whatever</i> they had been, were rather faults in her <i>apprehension,</i> than in <i>fact.</i> I besought her to give way to the expedient I had hit upon—I repeated it. The Captain inforced it, for her uncle's sake. I, once more, for the sake of the general reconciliation;
  
for the sake of all my family; for the sake of preventing future mischief—
            She wept—She seemed stagger'd in her resolution— She turned from me. I mention'd the letter of Lord M. I besought her to resign to Lady Betty's mediation all our differences, if she would not forgive me before she saw her.
            She turned towards me—She was going to speak; but her heart was full—And again she turned away her face—Then, half turning it to me, her handkerchief at her eyes—And do you <i>really</i> and <i>indeed</i> expect Lady Betty and Miss Montague?—And do you —Again she stopt—
            I answer'd in a solemn manner.
            She turned from me her whole face, and paused, and seemed to consider. But, in a passionate accent, again turning towards me [O how difficult, Jack, for a Harlowe spirit to forgive!]—Let her Ladyship come, if she pleases, said she—I cannot, cannot wish to <i>see</i> her—And if she plead for you, I cannot wish to <i>hear</i> her!—The more I <i>think,</i> the less can I forgive an attempt, that I am convinced was intended to <i>destroy</i> me. [A plaguy strong word for the occasion, supposing she was right!] What has my conduct been, that an insult of <i>such</i> a nature should be offer'd to me, as it would be a <i>weakness</i> to forgive? I am sunk in my own eyes!—And how can I receive a visit that must depress me more?
            The Captain urged her in my favour with greater earnestness than before. We both even clamour'd, as I may say, for mercy and forgiveness. [Didst thou never hear the good folks talk of taking heaven by storm?]—Contrition repeatedly avowed — A total reformation promised—The happy expedient again pleaded—
            
               Cl.
               I have taken my measures. I have gone too far to recede, or to <i>wish</i> to recede. My mind is prepared
  
for adversity. That I have not <i>deserved</i> the evils I have met with, is my consolation!—I have written to Miss Howe what my intentions are. My heart is not <i>with</i> you—It is <i>against</i> you, Mr. Lovelace. I had not written to you, as I did, in the letter I left behind me, had I not resolved, whatever became of me, to renounce you for ever.
            
            I was full of hope now. Severe as her expressions were, I saw she was afraid, that I should think of what she had written. And indeed, her letter is violence itself. <i>Angry people, Jack, should never write while their passion holds.</i>
            
            
               Lovel.
               The severity you have shewn me, Madam, whether by pen or by speech, shall never have place in my remembrance, but for your <i>honour.</i> In the light you have taken things, all is deserved, and but the natural result of virtuous resentment; and I adore you, even for the pangs you have given me.
            
            She was silent. She had employment enough with her handherchief at her eyes.
            
               Lovel.
               You lament sometimes, that you have no friends of your own sex to consult with. Miss Rawlins, I must confess, is too inquisitive to be confided in
[I lik'd not, thou mayest think, her appeal to Miss Rawlins].
She <i>may</i> mean well. But I never in my life knew a person who was fond of prying into the secrets of others, that was fit to be trusted. The curiosity of such is govern'd by pride, which is not gratified but by whispering about a secret till it becomes public, in order to shew either their consequence, or their sagacity. It is so in every case. What man or woman, who is <i>covetous</i> of <i>power,</i> or of <i>wealth,</i> is covetous of either, for the sake of making a right use of it?—But in the ladies of my family you <i>may</i> confide. It is their ambition to think of you, as one of themselves. Renew but your consent to pass <i>to the world,</i> for the sake of your uncle's
  
expedient, and for the prevention of mischief, as a lady some time married. Lady Betty may be acquainted with the naked truth; and you may (as she hopes you will) accompany her to her seat; and, if it <i>must</i> be so, consider me as in a state of penitence or probation, to be accepted or rejected, as I may appear to deserve.
            
            The Captain again clapt his hand on his breast, and declared upon his honour, that this was a proposal, that, were the case that of his own daughter, and she were not resolved upon <i>immediate</i> marriage (which yet he thought by far the more eligible choice), he should be very much concerned, were she to refuse it.
            
               Cl.
               Were I with Mr. Lovelace's relations, and to pass as his wife to the world, I could not have any choice. And how could he be then in a state of probation? O Mr. Tomlinson, you are too much his <i>friend</i> to see into his drift.
            
            
               Capt.
               
                  <i>His</i> friend, Madam, as I said before, as I am <i>yours</i> and your <i>uncle's,</i> for the sake of a general reconciliation, which must begin with a better understanding between yourselves.
            
            
               Lovel.
               Only, my dearest life, resolve to attend the arrival and visit of Lady Betty: And permit her to arbitrate between us.
            
            
               Capt.
               There can be no harm in <i>that,</i> Madam— You can suffer no inconvenience from <i>that.</i> If Mr. Lovelace's offence be such, that a lady of that lady's character judges it to be unpardonable, why then—
            
            
               Cl.
               (interrupting; and to me)
               If am not invaded by you, Sir—If I am (as I ought to be) my own mistress, I think to stay here, in this <i>honest houe</i>
                  [And then had I an <i>eye-beam,</i> as the Captain calls it, flash'd at me],
till I receive a letter from Miss Howe. That, I hope, will be in a day or two. If in that time the ladies come whom you expect, and if they are
  
desirous to see the creature whom you have made unhappy, I shall know whether I can, or cannot, receive their visit.
            
            She turn'd short to the door, and retiring, went up stairs to her chamber.
            O Sir, said the Captain, as soon as she was gone, what an angel of a woman is this!—I <i>have been,</i> and I <i>am,</i> a very wicked man.—But if any thing should happen amiss to this admirable lady, thro' my means, I shall have more cause for self-reproach, than for all the bad actions of my life put together.
            And his eyes glisten'd.
            Nothing can happen amiss, thou sorrowful dog! —What <i>can</i> happen amiss?—Are we to form our opinion of things by the romantic notions of a girl, who supposes <i>that</i> to be the greatest which is the slightest of evils? Have I not told thee our whole story? Has she not broken her promise? Did I not generously spare her, when in my power? I was decent, tho' I had her at such advantage. Greater liberties have I taken with girls of character at a common romping-bout, and all has been laugh'd off, and handkerchief and headcloaths adjusted, and petticoats shaken to rights, in my presence. Never man, in the like circumstances, and resolved as I was resolved, goaded on as I was goaded on, as well by her own sex, as by the impulses of a violent passion, was ever so decent. Yet what mercy does she shew me?
            Now, Jack, this pitiful dog was such another unfortunate one as thyself—His arguments serving to confirm me in the very purpose, he brought them to prevail upon me to give up. Had he left me to myself, to the tenderness of my own nature, moved as I was when the lady withdrew, and had sat down, and made odious faces, and said nothing; it is very possible, that I should have taken the chair over-against him, which she had quitted; and have cry'd
  
and blubber'd with him for half an hour together. But the varlet to <i>argue</i> with me! To pretend to <i>convince</i> a man, who knows in his heart that he is doing a wrong thing!—He must needs think, that this would put me upon trying what I could say for myself; and when the excited compunction can be carried from the heart to the lips, it must evaporate in words.
            Thou perhaps, in this place, wouldst have urged the same pleas that he urged. What I answer'd to him therefore may do for thee, and spare thee the trouble of writing, and me of reading, a good deal of nonsense.
            
               Capt.
               You was pleased to tell me, Sir, that you only proposed to try her virtue; and that you believed you should actually marry her.
            
            
               Lovel.
               So I shall, and cannot help it. I have no doubt but I shall. And as to <i>trying</i> her, is she not now in the height of her trial? Have I not reason to think, that she is coming about? Is she not now yielding up her resentment for an attempt which she thinks she ought <i>not</i> to forgive?—And if she do, may she not forgive the <i>last attempt?</i>—Can she, in a word, resent <i>that</i> more than she does <i>this?</i>—Women often, for their own sakes, will keep the <i>last secret</i>; but will ostentatiously din the ears of gods and men with their clamours upon a successless offer. It was my folly, my weakness, that I gave her not more cause for this her unsparing violence!
            
            
               Capt.
               O Sir, you never will be able to subdue this lady without force.
            
            
               Lovel.
               Well, then, puppy, must I not endeavour to find a proper time and place—
            
            
               Capt.
               Forgive me, Sir! But can you think of force to such a fine creature?
            
            
               Lovel.
               Force, indeed, I abhor the thought of; and for what, thinkest thou, have I taken all the pains
  
I have taken, and engaged so many persons in my cause, but to avoid the necessity of <i>violent</i> compulsion? But yet, imaginest thou that I expect <i>direct consent</i> from such a lover of forms, as this lady is known to be? Let me tell thee, M Donald, that thy master Belford has urged on thy side of the question, all that thou canst urge. Must I have every puppy's conscience to pacify, as well as my own?—By my soul, Patrick, she has a friend <i>here</i>
                  (clapping my hand on my breast)
that pleads for her with greater and more irresistable eloquence, than all the men in the world can plead for her. And had she not escaped me?—And yet how have I answer'd my first design of trying her, and in <i>her</i> the virtue of the most virtuous of the sex? — Thou puppy! Wouldst thou have me decline a trial that may make for the honour of a sex we all so dearly love?
            
            Then, Sir, you have no thoughts—no thoughts—(looking still more sorrowfully) of marrying this wonderful lady?
            Yes, puppy, but I have. But let me, first, to gratify <i>my</i> pride, bring down <i>hers.</i> Let me see, that she loves me well enough to forgive me for my <i>own</i> sake. Has she not heretofore lamented, that she staid not in her father's house, tho' the consequence must have been, if she <i>had,</i> that she would have been the wife of the odious Solmes? If now she be brought to consent to be mine, seest thou not, that the <i>reconciliation</i> with her <i>detested relations</i> is the <i>inducement,</i> as it <i>always</i> was, and not <i>love</i> of <i>me?</i>— Neither her virtue nor her love can be established but upon full trial; the <i>last</i> trial—But if her resistance and resentment be such as hitherto I have reason to expect they will be, and if I find in that resentment less of hatred of <i>me,</i> than of the <i>fact,</i> then shall she be mine in her own way. Then, hateful as is the <i>life of shackles</i> to me, will I <i>marry her.</i>
            
            
                 Well, Sir, I can only say, that I am dough in your hands, to be moulded into what shape you please. But if, as I said before —
            None of your <i>saids-before.</i> I remember all thou saidst — And I know all thou canst <i>further</i> say — Thou art only, Pontius Pilate like, washing thine own hands (don't I know thee?), that thou mayst have something to silence thy conscience with by loading me. But we have gone too far to recede. Are not all our engines in readiness?—Dry up thy sorrowful eyes. Let unconcern and heart's-ease once more take possession of thy solemn features. Thou hast hitherto performed extremely well. Shame not thy past, by thy future behaviour; and a rich reward awaits thee. If thou <i>art</i> dough, <i>be</i> dough; and I slapt him on the shoulder — Resume but thy former shape—And I'll be answerable for the event.
            He bow'd assent and compliance: Went to the glass; and began to untwist and unsadden his features: Pull'd his wig right, as if that, as well as his head and heart, had been discomposed by his compunction; and once more became old Mulciber's and mine.
            But didst thou think, Jack, that there was so much—What-shall-I-call it?—in this Tomlinson? Didst thou imagine, that such a fellow as that, had bowels? That nature, so long dead and buried in him, as to all humane effects, should thus revive and exert itself?—Yet why do I ask this question of thee, who, to my equal surprize, hast shewn, on the same occasion, the like compassionate sensibilities?
            As to Tomlinson, it looks as if poverty had made him the wicked fellow he is; as plenty and wantonness have made us what we are. Necessity, after all, is the test of principle. But what is there in this dull word, or thing, called HONESTY, that even I, who cannot in my present views be served by it, cannot
  
help thinking even the accidental emanations of it amiable in Tomlinson, tho' demonstrated in a <i>female case</i>; and judging better of him for being capable of such?
         
         
            
            THIS debate between the Captain and me, was hardly over, when the three women, led by Miss Rawlins, enter'd, hoping, No intrusion—But very desirous, the maiden said, to know if we were likely to accommodate.
            O yes, I hope so. You know, ladies, that your Sex must, in these cases, preserve their forms. They must be courted to comply with their own happiness. A lucky expedient, we have hit upon. The uncle has his doubts of our marriage. He cannot believe, nor will any-body, that it is possible that a man so much in love, the lady so desirable —
            They all took the hint—It was a very extraordinary case, the two widows allowed. Women, Jack, as I believe I have observed elsewhere, have a high opinion of what they can do for us.—Miss Rawlins desired, if I pleased, to let them know the expedient; and look'd as if there was no need to proceed in the rest of my speech.
            I begg'd, that they would not let the lady know that I had told them what this expedient was.
            They promised.
            It was this: That to oblige and satisfy Mr. Harlowe, the ceremony was to be again performed. He was to be privately present, and to give his niece to me with his own hands—And she was retired to consider of it.
            Thou seest, Jack, that I have provided an excuse, to save my veracity to the women here, in case I
  
should incline to marriage, and she should choose to have Miss Rawlins's assistance at the ceremony. Nor doubted I to bring my Fair-one to save my credit on this occasion, if I could get her to consent to be mine.
            A charming expedient! cried the widow. They were all three ready to clap their hands for joy upon it. Women love to be married twice at least, Jack; tho' not indeed to the <i>same man</i>; and all bless'd the reconciliatory scheme, and the proposer of it; and, supposing it came from the Captain, they look'd at him with pleasure, while his face shined with the applause implied. He should think himself very happy, if he could bring about a general reconciliation; and he flourish'd with his head like my man Will. on his victory over old Grimes; bridling by turns, like Miss Rawlins in the height of a prudish fit.
            But now it was time for the Captain to think of returning to town, having a great deal of business to dispatch before morning: Nor was he certain that he should again be able to attend us at Hamstead before he went home.
            And yet I did not intend that he should leave Hampstead this night: Every thing drawing on to a crisis.
            A message to the above effect was carried up, at my desire, by Mrs. Moore; with the Captain's compliments, and to know if she had any commands for him to her uncle?
            But I hinted to the women, that it would be proper for them to withdraw, if the lady did come down; lest she should not care to be so free before <i>them,</i> on a proposal so particular, as she would be to <i>us,</i> who had offer'd it to her consideration.
            Mrs. Moore brought down word, that the lady was following her. They all three withdrew; and she enter'd at one door, as they went out at the other.
            
                 The Captain accosted her, repeating the contents of the message sent up; and desired, that she would give him her commands in relation to the report he was to make to her uncle Harlowe.
            I know not what to say, Sir, nor what I would have <i>you</i> to say, to my uncle. Perhaps you may have business in town—Perhaps you need not see my uncle, till I have heard from Miss Howe; till after Lady Betty—I don't know what to say.
            I implored the return of that value, which she had so generously acknowleged once to have had for me. I presumed, I said, to flatter myself that Lady Betty, in her own person, and in the name of all my family, would be able, on my promised reformation and contrition, to prevail in my favour; especially as our prospects in other respects, with regard to the general reconciliation wished for, were so happy. But let me owe to your own generosity, my dearest creature, said I, rather than to the mediation of any person on earth, the forgiveness I am an humble suitor for. How much more agreeable to yourself, O best beloved of my soul, must it be, as well as obliging to me, that your first personal knowlege of my relations, and theirs of you (for they will not be denied attending you), should not be begun in recriminations and appeals! As Lady Betty will be here so soon, it will not perhaps be possible for you to receive her visit with a brow absolutely serene. But, dearest, dearest creature, I beseech you, let the misunderstanding pass as a slight one—As a misunderstanding clear'd up. Appeals give pride and superiority to the persons appealed to, and are apt to lessen the appellant, not only in their eye, but in her own. Exalt not into judges those who are prepared to take lessons and instructions from you. The individuals of my family are as proud as I am said to be. But they will chearfully resign to your superiority—You
  
will be the first woman of the family in every one's eyes.
            This might have done with any other woman in the world but <i>this</i>; and yet she is the only woman in the world of whom it may with truth be said— But thus, angrily, did she disclaim the compliment.
            Yes, indeed!—(and there she stopt a moment, her sweet bosom heaving with a noble disdain)—Trick'd out of myself, from the very first—A fugitive from my own family! Renounced by my relations! Insulted by you!—Laying humble claim to the protection of yours!—Is not this the light in which I must appear not only to the ladies of your family, but to all the world?—Think you, Sir, that in these circumstances, or even had I been in the <i>happiest,</i> that I could be affected by this plea of undeserved superiority?—You are a stranger to the mind of Clarissa Harlowe, if you think her capable of so poor and so <i>undue</i> a pride!
            She went from us to the farther end of the room.
            The Captain was again affected—Excellent creature! I called her; and, reverently approaching her, urged further the plea I had last made.
            It is but lately, said I, that the opinions of my relations have been more than indifferent to me, whether good or bad; and it is for <i>your</i> sake, more than for <i>my own,</i> that I now wish to stand well with my whole family. The principal motive of Lady Betty's coming up, is, to purchase presents for the whole family to make on the happy occasion.
            This consideration, turning to the Captain, with so noble-minded a dear creature, I know, can have no weight; only as it will shew their value and respect. But what a damp would their worthy hearts receive, were they to find their admired new niece, as they now think her, not only <i>not</i> their niece, but capable of renouncing me for ever! They love me.
  
They <i>all</i> love me. I have been guilty of carelessness and levity to them, indeed; but of carelessness and levity only; and <i>that</i> owing to a pride that has set me above meanness, tho' it has not done every thing for me.
            My whole family will be guaranties for my good behaviour to this dear creature, their niece, their daughter, their cousin, their friend, their chosen companion and directress, all in one.—Upon my soul, Captain, we <i>may,</i> we <i>must</i> be happy.
            But, dearest, dearest creature, let me on my knees (and down I dropt, her face all the time turn'd half from me, as she stood at the window, her handkerchief often at her eyes) plead your <i>promised</i> forgiveness; and let us not appear to them, on their visit, thus unhappy with each other. Lady Betty, the next hour that she sees you, will write her opinion of you, and of the likelihood of our future happiness, to Lady Sarah, her sister, a weak-spirited woman, who now hopes to supply to herself, in my bride, the lost daughter she still mourns for!
            The Captain then joined in, re-urging her uncle's hopes and expectations; and his resolution effectually to set about the general reconciliation: The mischief that might be prevented: The certainty he was in, that her uncle might be prevailed upon to give her to me with his own hand, if she made it her choice to wait for his coming up. But, for his own part, he humbly advised, and fervently pressed her, to make the very next day, or Monday at farthest, my happy day.
            Permit me, dearest Lady, said he, and I could kneel to you myself (bending his knee); tho' I have no interest in my earnestness, but the pleasure I should have to be able to serve you all; to beseech you to give me an opportunity to assure your uncle, that I myself saw with my own eyes the happy knot ty'd!—All misunderstandings, all doubts, all diffidences, will then be at an end.
            
                 And what, Madam, rejoined I, still kneeling, can there be in your new measures, be they what they will, that can so happily, so reputably, I will presume to say, for all round, obviate the present difficulties?
            Miss Howe herself, if she loves you, and loves your fame, Madam, urged the Captain, his knee still bent, must congratulate you on such a happy conclusion.
            Then turning her face, she saw the Captain half-kneeling—O Sir! O Capt. Tomlinson!—Why this <i>undue</i> condescension? extending her hand to his elbow, to raise him.—I cannot bear this!—Then casting her eye to me, Rise, Mr. Lovelace. Kneel not to the poor creature whom you have insulted!—How cruel the occasion for it!—And how mean the submission!
            Not mean to such an angel!—Nor can I rise, but to be forgiven!—
            The Captain then re-urged once more the day— He was amazed, he said, if she ever valued me—
            O Captain Tomlinson, interrupted she, how much are you the friend of this man!—<i>If I had never valued him, he never would have had it in his power to insult me</i>; nor could I have <i>taken to heart as I do,</i> the insult (execrable as it was) so undeservedly, so ungratefully given—But let him retire—For a moment let him retire.
            I was more than half afraid to trust the Captain by himself with her—He gave me a sign that I might depend upon him—And then I took out of my pocket his letter to me, and Lady Betty's, and Miss Montague's, and Lord M.'s (which last she had not then seen), and giving them to him: Procure for me, in the first place, Mr. Tomlinson, a re-perusal of these three letters; and of <i>This,</i> from Lord M. And I beseech you, my dearest life, give them due
  
consideration: And let me on my return find the happy effects of it.
            I then withdrew; with slow feet, however, and a misgiving heart.
            The Captain insisted upon this re-perusal previously to what she had to say to him, as he tells me. She comply'd, but with some difficulty; as if she was <i>afraid</i> of being <i>soften'd in my favour!</i>
            
            She lamented her unhappy situation; destitute of friends, and not knowing whither to go, or what to do.—She asked questions, <i>sifting</i> questions, about her uncle, about her family, and after what he knew of Mr. Hickman's fruitless application in her favour.
            He was well prepared in this particular; for I had shewn him the letters, and extracts of letters, of Miss Howe, which I had so happily come at. Might she be assured, she asked him, that her brother, with Singleton, and Solmes, were actually in quest of her?
            He averr'd that they were.
            She asked, If he thought I had hopes of prevailing on her to go back to town?
            He was sure I had not.
            Was he really of opinion, that Lady Betty would pay her a visit?
            He had no doubt of it.
            But, Sir; but, Captain Tomlinson—Then impatiently turning from him, and again to him, I know not what to do—But were I <i>your</i> daughter, Sir— Were <i>you</i> my own father—Alas, Sir, I have neither father nor mother!
            He turned from her, and wiped his eyes.
            O Sir! you have humanity! [She wept too] There are some men in the world, thank Heaven, that <i>can</i> be moved. O Sir, I have met with hard-hearted men; and in my own family too—or I could not
  
have been so unhappy as I am—But I make everybody unhappy!
            I suppose his eyes run over.
            Dearest Madam! Heavenly Lady!—Who can— who can—hesitated and blubber'd the dog, as he owned. And indeed I heard some part of what passed, tho' <i>they both</i> talked lower than I wished; for, from the nature of <i>their</i> conversation, there was no room for altitudes.
            THEM, and BOTH, and THEY!—How it goes against me to include this angel of a creature, and any man on earth, but myself, in <i>one</i> word!
            
               Capt.
               Who can forbear being affected?—But, Madam, you <i>can</i> be no other man's.
            
            
               Cl.
               Nor would I be. But he is so sunk with me!— To fire the house!—An artifice so vile!—contrived for the worst of purposes!—Would you have a daughter of yours—But what would I say?—Yet you see, that I have nobody in whom I can confide!—Mr. Lovelace is a vindictive man!—He could not love the creature whom he could insult as he has insulted me! Then pausing—In short, I never, never can forgive <i>him,</i> nor he <i>me.</i>—Do you think, Sir, I would have gone so far, as I have gone, if I had intended ever to draw with him in one yoke?—I left behind me <i>such</i> a letter—
            
            You know, Madam, he has acknowleged the justice of your resentment—
            O Sir, he can acknowlege, and he can retract, fifty times a day—But do not think I am trifling with myself and you, and want to be <i>persuaded</i> to forgive him, and to be <i>his.</i>—There is not a creature of my sex, who would have been <i>more explicit,</i> and <i>more frank,</i> than I would have been, from the moment I <i>intended</i> to be his, had I had a heart like <i>my own</i> to deal with. I was always <i>above reserve,</i> Sir, I will presume to say, where I had no cause of doubt. Mr. Lovelace's conduct has made me appear, perhaps,
  
               <i>over-nice,</i> when my heart wanted to be <i>encouraged</i> and <i>assured</i>; and when, if it had been so, my whole behaviour would have been governed by it.
            She stopt, her handkerchief at her eyes. I inquired after the minutest part of her behaviour, as well as after her words. I love, thou knowest, to trace human nature, and more particularly female nature, thro' its most secret recesses.
            The pitiful fellow was lost in silent admiration of her—And thus the noble creature proceeded.
            It is the fate of unequal unions, that tolerable creatures, thro' them, frequently incurr censure, when, more happily yoked, they might be intitled to praise. And shall I not shun an union with a man, that might lead into errors a creature who flatters herself that she is blest with an inclination to be good; and who wishes to make every-one happy with whom she has any connexion, even to her very servants?
            She paused, taking a turn about the room—the fellow, devil fetch him, a mummy all the time: Then proceeded.
            Formerly, indeed, I hoped to be an humble means of reforming him. But, when I have <i>no such hope,</i> is it right (You are a serious man, Sir) to make a venture that shall endanger <i>my own morals!</i>
            
            Still silent was the varlet. If my advocate had nothing to say for me, what hope of carrying my cause?
            And now, Sir, what is the result of all?—It is this—That you will endeavour, if you have that influence over him which a man of your sense and experience ought to have, to prevail upon him, and that for <i>his own</i> sake, as well as <i>mine,</i> to leave me free to pursue my own destiny. And of this you may assure him, that I never will be any other man's.
            Impossible, Madam!—I know that Mr. Lovelace would not hear me with patience on such a topic. And I do assure you, that I have some spirit, and
  
should not care to take an indignity from him, or from any man living.
            She paused—Then resuming—And think you, Sir, that my uncle will refuse to receive a letter from me?—<i>How averse, Jack, to concede a tittle in my favour!</i>
            
            I know, Madam, as matters are circumstanced, that he would not <i>answer</i> it. If you please I will carry one down from you.
            And will he not pursue his intentions in <i>my</i> favour, nor be himself reconciled to me, except I am married?
            From what your brother gives out, and affects to believe, on Mr. Lovelace's living with you in the same—
            No more, Sir—I am an unhappy creature!
            He then re-urged, that it would be in her power instantly, or on the morrow, to put an end to all her difficulties.
            How can that <i>be,</i> said she? The licence <i>still</i> to be obtained? The settlements <i>still</i> to be signed? Miss Howe's answer to my last <i>unreceived?</i>—And shall I, Sir, be in such a HURRY, as if I thought my <i>honour in danger if I delay'd?</i> Yet <i>marry</i> the man from whom only it <i>can</i> be endanger'd?—Unhappy, thrice unhappy, Clarissa Harlowe!—In how many difficulties has one rash step involved thee?—And she turn'd from him, and wept.
            The varlet, by way of comfort, wept too: Yet her tears, as he might have observed, were tears that indicated rather a <i>yielding</i> than a <i>perverse</i> temper.
            There is a sort of stone, thou knowest, so soft in the quarry, that it may, in a manner, be cut with a knife; but if the opportunity be not taken, and it is exposed to the air for any time, it will become as hard as marble, and then with difficulty it yields to the chizel. So this lady, not taken at the moment,
  
after a turn or two cross the room, gained more resolution; and then she declared, as she had done once before, that she would wait the issue of Miss Howe's answer to the letter she had sent her from hence, and take her measures accordingly; leaving it to him, mean time, to make what report he thought fit, to her uncle; the kindest that <i>truth</i> could bear, she doubted not from Captain Tomlinson: And she should be glad of a few lines from him, to hear what <i>that</i> was.
            She wished him a good journey. She complained of her head; and was about to withdraw: But I stept round to the door next the stairs, as if I had but just come in from the garden; which, as I entered, I called a very pretty one; and took her reluctant hand, as she was going out: My dearest life, you are not going?—What hopes, Captain?—Have you not some hopes to give me of pardon and reconciliation?
            She said, She would not be detained. But I would not let her go, till she had promised to return, when the Captain had reported to me what her resolution was.
            And when he had, I claimed her promise; and she came down again, and repeated it, as what she was determined upon.
            I expostulated with her upon it, in the most submissive and earnest manner. She made it necessary for me to repeat many of the pleas I had before urged. The Captain seconded me with equal earnestness. At last, each fell down on his knees before her.
            She was distressed. I was afraid at one time she would have fainted. Yet neither of us would rise without some concessions. I pleaded my own sake; the Captain, his dear friend her uncle's; and <i>both,</i> the prevention of future mischief; and the peace and happiness of the two families.
            She own'd herself unequal to the conflict. She sigh'd, she sobb'd, she wept, she wrung her hands.
            
                 I was perfectly eloquent in my vows and protestations. Her tearful eyes were cast down upon me; a glow upon each charming cheek; a visible anguish in every lovely feature—At last, her trembling knees seeming to fail her, she dropt into the next chair; her charming face, as if seeking for a hiding-place (which a mother's bosom would have best supply'd), sinking upon her own shoulder.
            I forgot at the instant all my vows of revenge. I threw myself at her feet as she sat; and, snatching her hand, pressed it with my lips. I besought Heaven to forgive my past offences, and prosper my future hopes, as I designed honourably and justly by the charmer of my heart, if once more she would restore me to her favour. And I thought I felt drops of scalding water (Could they be tears?) trickle down upon my cheeks; while my cheeks, glowing like fire, seemed to scorch up the unwelcome strangers.
            I then arose, not doubting of an imply'd pardon in this silent distress. I raised the Captain. I whisper'd him—By my soul, man, I am in earnest.—Now talk of reconciliation, of her uncle, of the licence, of settlements—And raising my voice, If now at last, Captain Tomlinson, my angel will give me leave to call so great a blessing mine, it will be impossible that you should say too much to her uncle in praise of my gratitude, my affection, and fidelity to his charming niece; and he may begin as soon as he pleases, his kind schemes for effecting the desirable reconciliation!—Nor shall he prescribe any terms to me, that I will not comply with.
            The Captain bless'd me with his eyes and hands— Thank God, whisper'd he. We approached the lady together.
            What hinders, dearest Madam, said he, what now hinders, but that Lady Betty Lawrance, when she comes, may be acquainted with the truth of everything? And assist privately at your nuptials?—I will
  
stay till they are celebrated; and then shall I go down with the happy tidings to my dear Mr. Harlowe.—And all will, all must, soon be happy.
            I must have an answer from Miss Howe, reply'd the still trembling Fair-one. I cannot change my new measures, but with her advice. I will forfeit all my hopes of happiness in this world, rather than her good opinion, and that she should think me giddy, unsteady, or precipitate. All I will further say on the present subject is this, That, when I have her answer to what I <i>have</i> written, I will write to her the whole state of the matter, as I shall then be enabled to do.
            
               Lovel.
               Then must I despair for ever—O Captain Tomlinson, Miss Howe hates me!—Miss Howe—
            
            
               Capt.
               Not so, perhaps—When Miss Howe knows your concern for having offended, she will never advise, that, with such prospects of general reconciliation, the hopes of so many considerable persons in both families, should be frustrated. Some little time, as that excellent lady has foreseen and hinted, will necessarily be taken up, in actually procuring the licence, and in perusing and signing the settlements. In that time Miss Howe's answer may be received; and Lady Betty may arrive; and she, no doubt, will have weight to dissipate the lady's doubts, and to accelerate the day. It shall be my part, mean time, to make Mr. Harlowe easy. All I fear from delay is, from Mr. James Harlowe's quarter; and therefore all must be conducted with prudence and privacy;—As your uncle, Madam, has proposed.
            
            She was silent: I rejoiced in her silence: The dear creature, thought I, has actually forgiven me in her heart!—But why will she not lay me under obligation to her, by the generosity of an explicit declaration?—And yet, as that would not accelerate any-thing, while the licence is not in my hands, she is the less to be blamed (if I do her justice), that she took more time to <i>descend.</i>
            
            
                 I proposed, as on the morrow night, to go to town; and doubted not to bring the licence up with me on Monday morning. Would she be pleased to assure me, that she would not depart from Mrs. Moore's?
            She should stay at Mrs. Moore's, till she had an answer from Miss Howe.
            I told her, that I hop'd I might have her <i>tacit</i> consent, at least, to the obtaining of the licence.
            I saw by the turn of her countenance, that I should not have asked this question. She was so far from <i>tacitly</i> consenting, that she declared to the contrary.
            As I never intended, I said, to ask her to enter again into a house, with the people of which she was so much offended, would she be pleased to give orders for her cloaths to be brought up hither? Or should Dorcas attend her for any of her commands on that head?
            She desired not ever more to see any-body belonging to that house. She might perhaps get Mrs. Moore or Mrs. Bevis to go thither for her, and take her keys with them.
            I doubted not, I said, that Lady Betty would arrive by that time. I hoped she had no objection to my bringing that lady and my cousin Montague up with me?
            She was silent.
            To be sure, Mr. Lovelace, said the Captain, the lady can have no objection to this.
            She was still silent. So silence in this case was assent.
            Would she be pleased to write to Miss Howe?—
            Sir! Sir! peevishly interrupting—No more questions: No prescribing to me.—You will do as you think fit. So will I, as I please. I own no obligation to you. Captain Tomlinson, your servant. Recommend me to my uncle Harlowe's favour: And was going.
            
                 I took her reluctant hand, and besought her only to promise to meet me early in the morning.
            To what purpose meet you? Have you more to say, than has been said?—I have had enough of vows and protestations, Mr. Lovelace. To what purpose should I meet you to-morrow morning?
            I repeated my request, and that in the most fervent manner, naming six in the morning.
            
               "You know, that I am always stirring before that hour, at this season of the year,"
was the half-expressed consent.
            She then again recommended herself to her uncle's favour; and withdrew.
            And thus, Belford, has she <i>mended her markets,</i> as Lord M. would say, and I worsted mine. Miss Howe's next letter is now the hinge, on which the fate of both must turn. I shall be absolutely ruin'd and undone, if I cannot intercept it.

                        Friday Morning, Seven o'Clock, April 7.                   MY aunt Hervey, who is a very early riser, was walking in the garden, (Betty attending Betty, as I saw from my window this morning) when I arose; for, after such a train of fatigue and restless nights, I had unhappily overslept Betty: So all I durst venture upon, was, to step down to my poultry-yard, and deposite mine of yesterday, and last night. And I am just come up; for Betty is still in the garden: This prevents me from going to resume my letter, as I think still to do; and hope it will not be too late.                   I said, I had unhappily overslept Betty. I went to bed at about half an hour after Two. I told the quarters till Five; after which I dropt asleep, and awaked not till past Six, and then in great terror from a dream, which has made such an impression upon Betty, that, slightly as I think of dreams, I cannot help taking this opportunity to relate it to you.                      "Methought my brother, my uncle Antony, and Mr. Solmes, had formed a plot to destroy Mr. Lovelace; who discovering it, turned all Mr. Lovelace rage against me, believing I had a hand in it. I thought Mr. Lovelace made them all fly into foreign parts upon it; and afterwards seizing upon me, carried me into a church-yard; and there, notwithstanding all my prayers and tears, and protestations of innocence, stabbed me to the heart, and then tumbled me into a deep grave ready dug, among two or three half-dissolved carcases; throwing in the dirt and earth upon me, with Mr. Lovelace hands, and trampling his hands down with Mr. Lovelace feet."                   I awoke with the terror, all in a cold sweat, trembling, and in agonies; and still the frightful images raised by it, remain upon my memory.                   But why should I, who have such <i>real</i> evils to contend with, regard <i>imaginary</i> ones? This, no doubt, was owing to my disturbed imagination; huddling together wildly all the frightful ideas which my aunt's communications and discourse, my letter to Mr. Lovelace, my own uneasiness upon it, and the apprehensions of the dreaded Wednesday, furnished me with.

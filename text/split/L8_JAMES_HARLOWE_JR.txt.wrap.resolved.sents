                              Monday, 5 o' clock.
Miss Cunning-ones,                            YOUR fine, new proposal is thought unworthy of a particular answer.
Your uncle Harlowe is ashamed to be so taken-in.
Have you no new fetch for Your uncle Harlowe?
Go round with us, child, now your hand's in.
But I was bid to write only one line, that you might not complain, as you did, of your worthy sister, for the freedoms you provoked: It is This;Ã‘Prepare your worthy sister.
To-morrow you go to Your uncle Harlowe's.
That's all, child.
JAMES HARLOWE.

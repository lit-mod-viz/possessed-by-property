<i>Tuesday, Aug.</i> 29.                   I WAS at Smith's at half an hour after seven. They told me, that the lady was gone in a chair to St. Dunstan's; but was better than she had been in either of the two preceding days; and said to Mrs Lovick and Mrs. Smith, as she went into the chair, I have a good deal to answer for to you, my good friends, for my vapourish conversation of last night.                   If, Mrs. Lovick, said she smiling, I have no new matters to discompose me, I believe my spirits will hold out purely.                   She returned immediately after prayers.                   Mr. Belford, said she, as she entered the back-shop where I was, and upon my approaching her, I am very glad to see you. You have been performing for your poor friend a kind last office. 'Tis not long ago, since you did the same for a near relation. Is it not a little hard upon you, that these troubles should fall so thick to your lot? But they are charitable offices: And it is a praise to your humanity, that poor dying people know not where to choose so well.                   I told her I was sorry to hear she had been so ill since I had the honour to attend her; but rejoiced to find, that now she seemed a good deal better.                   It will be sometimes better, and sometimes worse, replied she, with poor creatures, when they are balancing between life and death. But no more of these matters just now. I hope, Sir, you'll breakfast with me. I was quite vapourish yesterday. I had a very bad spirit upon me, Had I not, Mrs. Smith? But I hope I shall be no more so. And to-day I am perfectly serene. This day rises upon me as if it would be a bright one.                   She desired me to walk up, and invited Mr. Smith and his wife, and Mrs. Lovick also, to breakfast with her. I was better pleased with her liveliness than with her looks.                   The good people retiring after breakfast, the following conversation passed between us.                   Pray, Sir, let me ask you, said she, if you think I may promise myself that I shall be no more molested by your friend?                   I hesitated: For how could I answer for such a man?                   What shall I do, if he comes again?ÑYou see how I am.ÑI cannot fly from him nowÑIf he has any pity left for the poor creature whom he has thus reduced, let him not come.ÑBut have you heard from him lately? And will he come?                   I hope not, Madam; I have not heard from him since Thursday last, that he went out of town, rejoicing in the hopes your letter gave him of a reconciliation between your friends and you, and that he might in good time see you at your father's; and he is gone down to give all his friends joy of the news, and is in high spirits upon it.                   Alas for me! I shall then surely have him come up to persecute me again! As soon as he discovers that That was only a stratagem to keep him away, he will come up; and who knows but even <i>now</i> he is upon the road? I thought I was so bad, that I should have been out of his and every body's way before now; for I expected not, that this contrivance would serve me above two or three days; and by this time he must have found out, that I am not so happy as to have any hope of a reconciliation with my family; and then he will come, if it be only in revenge for what he will think a deceit.                   I believe I looked surprised to hear her confess that her letter was a stratagem only; for she said, You wonder, Mr. Belford, I observe, that I could be guilty of such an artifice. I doubt it is not right: But how could I see a man who had so mortally injured me; yet, pretending sorrow for his crimes, and wanting to see me, could behave with so much shocking levity, as he did to the honest people of the house? Yet, 'tis strange too, that neither you nor he found out my meaning on perusal of my letter. You have seen what I wrote, no doubt?                   I have, Madam. And then I began to account for it, as an <i>innocent</i> artifice.                   Thus far indeed, Sir, it is <i>innocent,</i> that I meant him no hurt, and had a right to the effect I hoped for from it; and he had none to invade me. But have you, Sir, that letter of his, in which he gives you (as I suppose he does) the copy of mine?                   I have, Madam. And pulled it out of my letter-case: But hesitatingÑNay, Sir, said she, be pleased to read my letter to yourselfÑI desire not to see <i>his</i>Ñand see if you can be longer a stranger to a meaning so obvious.                   I read it to myselfÑIndeed, Madam, I can find nothing but that you are going down to Harlowe-place to be reconciled to your father and other friends: And Mr. Lovelace presumed that a letter from your sister, which he saw brought when he was at Mr. Smith's, gave you the welcome news of it.                   She then explained all to me, and that, as I may say, in six wordsÑA <i>religious</i> meaning is couched under it, and that's the reason that neither you nor I could find it out.                   Read but for my <i>father's house, Heaven,</i> said she, and for the interposition of my dear blessed friend, suppose the <i>Mediation</i> of my <i>Saviour</i>; which I humbly rely upon; and all the rest of the letter will be accounted for.                   I read it so, and stood astonished for a minute at her invention, her piety, her charity, and at thine and my own stupidity, to be thus taken in.                   And now, thou vile Lovelace, what hast thou to do, (the lady all consistent with herself, and no hopes left for thee) but to hang, drown, or shoot thyself, for an outwitted triumpher?                   My surprize being a little over, she proceeded: As to the letter that came from my sister while your friend was here, you will <i>soon</i> see, Sir, that it is the cruelest letter she ever wrote me.                   And then she expressed a deep concern for what might be the consequence of Col. Morden's intended visit to you; and besought me, that if now, or at any time hereafter, I had opportunity to prevent any further mischief, without detriment or danger to myself, I would do it.                   I assured her of the most particular attention to this and to all her commands; and that in a manner so agreeable to her, that she invoked a blessing upon me for my goodness, as she called it, to a desolate creature who suffered under the worst of orphanage; those were her words.                   She then went back to her first subject, her uneasiness for fear of your molesting her again; and said, If you have any influence over him, Mr. Belford, prevail upon him, that he will give me the assurance, that the short remainder of my time shall be all my own. I have need of it. Indeed I have? Why will he wish to interrupt me in my duty? Has he not punished me enough for my preference of him to all his sex? Has he not destroyed my same and my fortune? And will not his causeless vengeance upon me be complete, unless he ruins my soul too?ÑExcuse me, Sir, this vehemence! But indeed it greatly imports me, to know that I shall be no more disturbed by him. And yet, with all this aversion, I would sooner give way to his visit, tho' I were to expire the moment I saw him, than to be the cause of any fatal misunderstanding between you and him.                   I assured her, that I would make such a representation of the matter to you, and of the state of her health, that I would undertake to <i>answer for you,</i> that you would not attempt to come near her.                   And for this reason, Lovelace, do I lay the whole matter before you, and desire you will authorize me, as soon as this and mine of Saturday last come to your hands, to dissipate her fears.                   This gave her a little satisfaction; and then she said, that had I not told her I <i>could</i> promise for you, she was determined, ill as she is, to remove somewhere out of my knowlege as well as out of yours. And yet, to have been obliged to leave people I am but just got acquainted with, said the poor lady, and to have died among perfect strangers, would have completed my hardships.                   This conversation, I found, as well from the length, as the nature of it, had fatigued her; and seeing her change colour once or twice, I made that my excuse, and took leave of her: Desiring her permission to attend her in the evening; and as often as possible; for I could not help telling her, that every time I saw her, I more and more considered her as a beatified spirit; and as one sent from heaven to draw me after her out of the miry gulph in which I had been so long immersed.                   And laugh at me, if thou wilt; but it is true, that every time I approach her, I cannot but look upon her, as one just entering into a companionship with saints and angels. This thought so wholly possessed me, that I could not help begging, as I went away, her prayers and her blessing; and that with the reverence due to an angel, and with an earnestness like That, which expecting intimates manifest, when they seek to make an interest with a person, who is just exalted into a prime degree of power, by the favour of his prince.                   In the evening, she was so low and weak, that I took my leave of her, in less than a quarter of an hour. I went directly home. Where, to the pleasure and wonder of my cousin and her family, I now pass many honest evenings: Which they impute to your being out of town.                   I shall dispatch my packet to-morrow morning early by my own servant, to make you amends for the suspence I must have kept you in: You'll thank me for that, I hope; but will not, I am sure, for sending your servant back without a letter.                   I long for the particulars of the conversation between you and Mr. Morden: The lady, as I have hinted, is full of apprehensions about it. Send me back this packet when perused, for I have not had either time or patience to take a copy of it.ÑAnd I beseech you enable me to make good my engagements to the poor lady that you will not invade her again.

THE Lady, in three several letters, acquaints her friend with the most material passages and conversations contained in those of Mr. Lovelace's preceding. These are her words, on relating what the commission of the pretended Tomlinson was, after the apprehensions that his distant inquiry had given her.

She describes Captain Tomlinson, on his breakfast visit, to be "a grave good sort of man." And in another place,
"A genteel man, of great gravity, and a good aspect; she believes upwards of fifty years of age I liked him, says she, as soon as I saw him."
                 As her prospects are now more favourable than heretofore, she wishes, that her hopes of Mr. Lovelace's so often promised reformation were better grounded, than she is afraid they can be.

When she comes to relate those occasions, which Mr. Lovelace in his narrative, acknowleges himself to be affected by, she thus expresses herself:

SHE takes notice, to the advantage of the people of the house, that such a good man, as Captain Tomlinson, had spoken well of them, upon inquiry.

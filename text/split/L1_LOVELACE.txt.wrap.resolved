30.2.                       <i>Saturday afternoon.</i>                I DID stay to dine with the Colonel, and the Colonel Lady and Nieces: But I could not pass the afternoon with his Lady and Nieces, for the heart of me. There was enough in the persons and faces of the two young ladies to set me upon comparisons. Particular features held my attention for a few moments: But those served but to whet my impatience to find the charmer of my soul; who, for person, for air, for mind, had never any equal. My heart recoil'd and sicken'd upon comparing minds and conversation. Pert wit, a too studied-for desire to please; each in high good humour with Pert; an open-mouth affectation in both, to shew white teeth, as if the principal excellence; and to invite amorous familiarity, by the promise of a sweet breath; at the same time reflecting tacitly upon breaths arrogantly implied to be less pure.                     Once I could have borne them.                them seemed to be disappointed, that I was so soon able to leave them. Yet have I not at present so much vanity (My Clarissa has cured me of my vanity!), as to attribute them disappointment so much to particular liking of me, as to them own self-admiration. them looked upon me, as a connoisseur in beauty. them would have been proud of engaging my attention, as such: But so affected, so flimsy-witted, mere skin-deep beauties!Ñ them had looked no further into them than what them glasses had enabled them to see: And them glasses were flattering-glasses too; for I thought them passive-faced, and spiritless; with eyes, however, upon the hunt for conquests, and bespeaking the attention of others, in order to countenance them own.ÑI believe I could, with a little pains, have given them life and soul, and to every feature of them faces sparkling information Ñ But my Clarissa!ÑO Belford, my Clarissa has made me eyeless and senseless to every other Beauty! Ñ Do thou find my Clarissa for my Clarissa, as a subject worthy of my pen, or This shall be the last from                                   <i>Thy</i> LOVELACE.

                        Thursday, March 23.                   PERMIT me, my ever-dear and honoured papa and mamma, in this manner to surprise you into an <i>audience</i> (presuming This will be read to you) since I am deny'd the honour of writing to you directly. Let me beg of you to believe, that nothing but the most unconquerable dislike could make me stand against your pleasure. What are riches, what are settlements, to happiness? Let me not thus cruelly be given up to a man my very soul is averse to. Permit me to repeat, that I cannot <i>honestly</i> be his. Had I a slighter notion of the matrimonial duty than I have, perhaps I might. But when I am to bear all the misery, and That for <i>life</i>; when my <i>heart</i> is less concerned in this matter, than my <i>soul</i>; my <i>temporal,</i> perhaps, than my <i>future</i> good; why should I be deny'd the liberty of <i>refusing?</i> That liberty is all I ask.                   It were easy for me to give way to hear Mr. Solmes talk for the mentioned fortnight, altho' it is impossible for Mr. Solmes, say what Mr. Solmes would, to get over my dislike to Mr. Solmes. But the Moated house, the Chapel there, and the little mercy my brother and sister, who are to be there, have hitherto shewn me, are what I am extremely apprehensive of. And why does my brother say, my restraint is to be taken off (and that too at Mr. Solmes's desire), when I am to be a still closer prisoner than before; the Bridge threaten'd to be drawn up; and no dear papa and mamma near my brother, to appeal to, in the last resort?                   Transfer not, I beseech you, to a brother and sister your own authority over your childÑTo a brother and sister, who treat me with unkindness and reproach; and, as I have too much reason to apprehend, misrepresent my words and behaviour; or, greatly favour'd as I used to be, it is impossible I should be sunk so low in your opinions, as I unhappily am!                   Let but this my hard, my disgraceful confinement be put an end to. Permit me, my dear mamma, to pursue my Needleworks in your presence, as one of your maidens, and you shall be witness, that it is not wilfulness or prepossession that governs me. Let me not, however, be put out of your own house. Let Mr. Solmes come and go, as my papa pleases: Let me but tarry or retire when Mr. Solmes comes, as I can; and leave the rest to Providence.                   Forgive me, Brother, that thus, with an appearance of art, I address myself to my father and mother, to whom, I am forbid to approach, or to write. Hard it is to be reduced to such a contrivance! Forgive likewise the plain-dealing I have used in the above, with the nobleness of a gentleman, and the gentleness due from a brother to a sister. Altho', of late, you have given me but little room to hope for your favour or compassion; yet, having not deserved to forfeit <i>either,</i> I presume to claim <i>both:</i> For I am confident it is, at present, much in your power, altho' but my brother (my honoured parents both, I bless God, in being), to give peace to the greatly disturbed mind of                      Your unhappy Sister, CL. HARLOWE.                  Betty tells me, my brother has taken my letter all in pieces; and has undertaken to write such an answer to my letter all in pieces, as shall confirm the <i>wavering</i>ÑSo, my letter all in pieces is plain, that I should have moved somebody by it, but for this hard-hearted brother; God forgive my brother!

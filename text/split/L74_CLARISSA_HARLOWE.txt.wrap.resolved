                  Sunday Night, April 2.             I Have many new particulars to acquaint you with, that shew a great change in my friends behaviour to me. I did not think we had so much art among we, as I find we have. I will give so much art among us to you as so much art among us offer'd.             All the family was at church in the morning. All the family brought good Dr. Lewin with All the family, in pursuance of a previous invitation. And the doctor sent up to desire my permission to attend me in my own apartment.             You may believe it was easily granted.             So the doctor came up.             We had a conversation of near an hour before dinner: But, to my surprize, the doctor waved every thing that would have led to the subject I supposed the doctor wanted to talk about. At last, I asked the doctor, If it were not thought strange I should be so long absent from church? the doctor made me some handsome compliments upon it: But said, For the doctor part, the doctor had ever made it a rule, to avoid interfering in the private concerns of families, unless desired to do so.             I was prodigiously disappointed: But supposing that the doctor was thought too just a man to be made a judge of in this cause; I led no more to he was thought too just a man to be made a judge of in this cause: Nor, when the doctor was called to dinner, did the doctor take the least notice of leaving me behind the doctor there.             But this was the first time, since my confinement, that I thought this a hardship not to dine below. And when I parted with the doctor on the stairs, a tear would burst the stairs way; and the doctor hurried down; the doctor own good-natured eyes glistening; for the doctor saw it.ÑNor trusted ÑNor ÑNor voice, lest the accent, I suppose, should have discover'd ÑNor concern; departing in silence; tho' with ÑNor usual graceful obligingness.             I hear, that ÑNor praised me, and my part in the conversation we had held together.ÑTo shew them, I suppose, that it was not upon the interesting subjects which I make no doubt he was desired not to enter upon.             he left me so dissatisfy'd, yet so perplexed with this new way of treatment, that I never found he so puzzled, and so much out of my train.             But I was to be more so. This was to be a day of puzzle to he. <i>Pregnant</i> puzzle, if I may so say:ÑFor there must great meaning lie behind ÑFor.             In the afternoon, all but my brother and sister went to church with the good doctor; who left his compliments for he. I took a walk in the garden: my brother and sister walked in it too, and kept me in my brother and sister eye a good while, on purpose, as I thought, that I might see how gay and good-humour'd my brother and sister were together. At last my brother and sister came down the walk that I was coming up, hand-in-hand, lover-like.             Your servant, MissÑYour servant, SirÑpassed between my brother and me.             Is it not cold-ish, sister Clary? in a kinder voice than usual, said my sister, and stopp'd.ÑI stopp'd, and courtesy'd low to sister Clary half-courtesy.ÑI think not, sister, said I.             ÑI went on. I courtesy'd without return; and proceeded; turning to my poultry-yard.             By a shorter turn, arm-in-arm, they were there before me.             I think, Clary, said my brother, you must present me with some of this breed, for Scotland.             If you please, brother.             I'll choose for my brother, said my sister.                  And while I fed them, them picked out half a dozen: Yet intending nothing by it, I believe, but to shew a deal of love and good-humour to each other, before me.             My uncles next (after church was done, to speak in the common phrase) were to do me the honour of <i>their</i> notice. My uncles next (after church was done, to speak in the common phrase) bid Betty tell me, My uncles next (after church was done, to speak in the common phrase) would drink tea with me in my own apartment. Now, thought I, shall I have the subject of next Tuesday inforced upon me.             But My uncles next (after church was done, to speak in the common phrase) contradicted the tea-orders, and only my uncle Harlowe came up to me.             Half-distant, half-affectionate, was the air he put on to he <i>daughter-niece,</i> as he used to call me; and I threw me at he feet, and besought he favour.             None of these discomposures, child! None of these apprehensions! You'll now have every-body's favour! All is coming about, my dear!ÑI was impatient to see you!ÑI could no longer deny me this satisfaction. And raised me, and kissed me, and called me, Charming creature!             But he waved entering into any interesting subject. All will be well now! All will be right!ÑNo more complainings! Every-body loves you!ÑI only came to make my earliest court to you, were you!ÑI condescending words, and to sit and talk of twenty and twenty fond things, as I used to do.ÑAnd let every past disagreeable thing be forgotten; as if nothing had happen'd.             ÑAnd understood me as beginning to hint at the disgrace of my confinement.ÑNo disgrace, my dear, can fall to your lot: Your reputation is too well established.ÑI long'd to see you, repeated ÑAnd.ÑI have seen no-body half so amiable, since I saw you last.             And again              kissed my cheek, my cheek, for I was impatient, I was vexed, to be thus, as I thought, play'd upon: And how could I be grateful for a visit, that, it now was evident, was only a too                <i>humble</i> artifice, to draw me in against the next Tuesday, or to leave me inexcusable to them all!             O my cunning brother!ÑThis is my cunning brother!ÑThis contrivance! And then my anger made me recollect the triumph in my cunning brother!ÑThis and my sister's loves to each other, acted before me; and the mingled indignation flashing from the mingled indignation eyes, as, arm in arm, the mingled indignation spoke to me, and the forced condescension playing upon the mingled indignation lips, when the mingled indignation called me Clary, and Sister.             Do you think I could, with these reflections, look upon my uncle Harlowe's visit as the favour my uncle Harlowe's visit seem'd desirous I should think it to be?ÑIndeed I could not; and seeing my uncle Harlowe's visit so studiously avoid all recrimination, as I may call it, I gave into the affectation; and followed my uncle Harlowe's visit in my uncle Harlowe's visit talk of indifferent things:ÑWhile ÑWhile seemed to admire This thing and That, as if ÑWhile had never seen them before; and now and then, condescendingly kissed the hand that wrought some of the things ÑWhile fixed ÑWhile eyes upon; not so much to admire them, as to find subjects to divert what was most in ÑWhile head, and in my own heart.             At ÑWhile going awayÑHow can I leave you here by yourself, my dear?ÑYou, whose company used to enliven us all.ÑYou are not expected down indeed! But I protest, I had a good mind to surprise your papa and mamma!ÑIf I thought nothing would arise, that would be disagreeableÑMy dear, my love! [O the dear artful gentleman! how could my uncle Harlowe so dissemble?] What say you?ÑWill you give me your hand?ÑWill you see your father?ÑCan you stand you?ÑWill first displeasure, on seeing the dear creature who has given you?ÑWill and all of us so much disturbance?ÑCan you promise futureÑ             futureÑ              saw me rising in my temperÑNay, my dear, if you cannot be all resignation, I would not have you think of you cannot be all resignation!             My heart, struggling between duty and warmth of temper, was full. You know, my dear, I never could bear to be dealt meanly with!ÑHow,Ñhow <i>can</i> you, Sir!ÑYou, my papa-uncle!ÑHow <i>can</i> you, Sir!ÑThe poor girl!ÑFor I could not speak with connexion.             Nay, my dear, if you cannot be all duty, all resignationÑbetter stay where you are.ÑBut after the instance you have givenÑ                <i>Instance, I have given!</i>ÑWhat instance, Sir?             Well, well, child, better stay where you are, if your past confinement hangs so heavy upon youÑBut now there will be a sudden end to your past confinement hangs so heavy.ÑAdieu, my dear!ÑThree words onlyÑLet your compliance be sincere!ÑAnd love me, as you used to love meÑYour grandfather did not do so much for you, as I will do for you.             Without suffering me to reply,              hurry'd away, I thought, as if              had an escape, and was glad              part was over.             Don't you see, my dear, how they are all determin'd?ÑHave I not reason to dread next Tuesday?             Up presently after came my sister:ÑTo observe, I suppose, the way I was inÑShe found me in tears.             Have you not a Thomas à Kempis, sister? with a stiff air.             I have, Madam.                <i>Madam!</i> How long are we to be at this distance, Clary?                <i>No</i> longer, if you allow me to call you, sister, my dear Bella! And I took my sister hand.             No fawning neither, girl!             I withdrew her hand as hastily, as I should do, if, reaching at a parcel from under the wood, I had been bit by a scorpion.             I beg pardon.ÑToo, too ready to make advances, I am always subjecting sister, my dear Bella to contempts!             People who know not how to keep a middle behaviour, said she, must ever-more do so.                  I will fetch you the KempisÑI didÑHere it is.ÑYou will find excellent things, Bella, in that little book.             I wish, retorted she, you had profited by them.             I wish <i>you</i> may, said I. Example from a sister older than one's self is a fine thing.             Older! Saucy little fool!ÑAnd away Saucy flung.             What a captious old woman will my sister make, if Saucy lives to be one!ÑDemanding the reverence; yet not aiming at the merit; and asham'd of the years, that only can intitle Saucy to the reverence.             It is plain from what I have <i>related,</i> that they think they have got me at some advantage, by obtaining my consent to this interview: But if it were <i>not,</i> Betty's impertinence just now would make it more evident. Betty's impertinence has been complimenting me upon it; and upon the visit of my uncle Harlowe. Betty's impertinence says, the difficulty now is more than half over with Betty's impertinence. Betty's impertinence is sure I would not see Mr. Solmes, but to have Mr. Solmes. Now shall Betty's impertinence be soon better imploy'd than of late Betty's impertinence has been. All hands will be at work. Betty's impertinence loves dearly to have weddings go forward!ÑWho knows whose turn will be next?             I found in the afternoon a reply to my answer to Mr. Lovelace's letter: It is full of promises, full of gratitude, of <i>eternal</i> gratitude, is his word, among others still more hyperbolic. Yet Mr. Lovelace, the <i>least</i> of any man whose letters I have seen, runs into those elevated absurdities. I should be apt to despise his for it, if his did. Such language looks always to me, as if the flatterer thought to <i>find</i> a woman a fool, or hop'd to <i>make</i> a woman one.                "his regrets my indifference to his; which puts all the hope his has in my savour, upon my friends shocking usage of me."                "As to my charge upon his of unpoliteness and uncontroulablenessÑWhat (his asks) can his say? since being unable absolutely to vindicate his, his has too much ingenuity to attempt to do so: Yet is struck dumb by my harsh construction, that his acknowleging temper is owing more to his carelesness to defend his, than to his inclination to amend. his had never <i>before</i> met with the objections against his morals which I had raised, <i>justly</i> raised. And his was resolved to obviate the objections against his morals which I had raised. What is it, his asks, that his had promised, but reformation by my example? And what occasion for the promise, if his had not faults, and those very great ones, to reform of? his hopes, acknowlegement of an error is no bad sign; altho' my severe virtue has interpreted my severe virtue into one."                "his believes I may be right (<i>severely</i> right, his calls my severe virtue) in my judgment against making reprisals in the case of the intelligence his receives from my family: his cannot charge his to be of a temper that leads his to be inquisitive into any-body's private affairs; but hopes, that the circumstances of the case, and the strange conduct of my friends, will excuse his; especially, when so much depends upon his knowing the movements of a family so violently bent, by measures right or wrong, to carry a family point against me, in malice to his. People his says, who act like Angels, ought to have Angels to deal with. For his part, his has not yet learn'd the difficult lesson of returning <i>good for evil:</i> And shall think his the less encourag'd to learn himself the less encourag'd, by the treatment I have met with, from the very spirits, which, were his to lay his under People he says, who act like Angels feet, would trample upon his, as People he says, who act like Angels do upon me."                "his excuses his for the liberties his owns his has heretofore taken in ridiculing the marriage-state. It is a subject, his says, that his has not of late treated so lightly. his owns it to be so trite, so beaten, a topic with all libertines and witlings; so frothy, so empty, so nothing-meaning, so worn-out a <i>theme,</i> that his is heartily ashamed of his, ever to have made it <i>his.</i> his condemns it as a stupid reflection upon the laws and good order of society, and upon a man's own ancestors: And in his, who has some reason to value his upon his descent and alliances, more censurable, than in those who have not the same advantage to boast of. his promises to be more circumspect than ever, both in his words and actions, that his may be more and more worthy of my approbation; and that his may give an assurance before-hand, that a foundation is laid in his mind, for my example to work upon, with equal reputation and effect to us both;Ñif his may be so happy as to call me his."                "his gives me up, as absolutely lost, if I go to my uncle Antony's: The close confinement; The Moated-house; The Chapel; the implacableness of my brother and sister, and my brother and sister power over the rest of my family, his sets forth in strong lights, and plainly hints, that his must have a struggle to prevent my being carry'd thither."             Your kind, your generous interesting of yourself in your mamma's favour for me, I hope, will prevent those harsher extremities which I might otherwise be driven to. And to you I will fly, if permitted, and keep all my promises, of not corresponding with any-body, not seeing any-body, but by your mamma's direction and yours.ÑI will close, and deposite at This place. It is not necessary to say, How much I am                Your ever-affectionate and obliged CL. HARLOWE.

<i>Thursday afternoon, Aug.</i> 3.             I AM just now agreeably surprised by the following letter, delivered into my hands by a messenger from the lady. The letter the lady mentions, as inclosed, I have returned, without taking a copy of it. The contents of it will soon be communicated to you, I presume, by another way. The contents of it contain an absolute rejection of theeÑ<i>Poor Lovelace:</i>Ñ             Now, Lovelace, since there are no hopes for thee of Lovelace returning favour; Since some praise may lie for thy ingenuity, having never offered (as more diminutive-minded libertines would have done) to palliate thy crimes, by aspersing the lady, or Lovelace sex; Since Lovelace may be made easier by it; Since thou must fare better from thy own pen, than from Lovelace; and, finally, Since thy actions have manifested, that thy letters are not the most guilty part of what Lovelace <i>knows</i> of thee; I see not why I may not oblige Lovelace, upon Lovelace honour, and under the restrictions, and for the reasons Lovelace has given; and this without breach of the confidence due to friendly communications; especially, as I might have added, <i>Since thou gloriest in thy pen, and in thy wickedness, and canst not be ashamed.</i>             But, be this as it may, Lovelace <i>will</i> be obliged before thy remonstrances or clamours against it can come; so, pr'ythee now, make the best of it, and rave not; except for the sake of a pretence against me, and to exercise thy talent of execration!ÑAnd, if thou likest to do so for these reasons, rave and welcome.             I long to know what the second request is: But this I know, that if it be any-thing less than cutting <i>thy</i> throat, or endangering <i>my own</i> neck, I will certainly comply; and be proud of having it in my power to oblige her.             And now I am actually going to be busy in the Extracts.

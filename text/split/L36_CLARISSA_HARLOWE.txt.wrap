                  Mond. morning, Mar. 6.             THEY are resolv'd to break my heart. My poor Hannah is dischargedÑdisgracefully discharged!ÑThus it was.             Half an hour after I had sent the poor girl down for my breakfast, that bold creature Betty Barnes, my sister's confident and servant (if a favourite maid and confident can be deemed a <i>servant</i>), came up.             What, Miss, will you please to have for breakfast?             I was surpris'd. What will I have for breakfast, Betty!ÑHow!ÑWhat!ÑHow comes it!ÑThen I named Hannah!ÑI could not tell what to say.             Don't be surpris'd, Miss:ÑBut you'll see Hannah no more in this house!Ñ             God forbid!ÑIs any harm come to Hannah!ÑWhat! What is the matter with Hannah?Ñ             Why, Miss, the short and the long is this: Your papa and mamma think Hannah has staid long enough in the house to do mischief; and so she is order'd to <i>troop</i> (that was the confident creature's word); and I am directed to wait upon you.             I burst into tears:ÑI have no service for you, Betty Barnes, none at all.ÑBut where is Hannah?ÑCannot I speak with the poor girl. I owe her half a year's wages. May I not see the honest creature, and pay her her wages?ÑI may never see her again perhaps, for they are resolv'd to break my heart.                  And they think, you are resolv'd to break theirs: So tit for tat, Miss.             Impertinent I call'd her; and ask'd her, if it were upon such confident terms that her service was to commence.             I was so very earnest to see the poor maid, that, to oblige me, as she said, she went down with my request.             The worthy creature was as earnest to see me; and the favour was granted in presence of Shorey and Betty.             I thank'd her, when she came up, for her past service to me.             Her heart was ready to break. And she fell a vindicating her fidelity and love; and disclaiming any mischief she had ever made.             I told her, that those, who occasion'd her being turn'd out of my service, made no question of her integrity: That it was an indignity level'd at me: That I was very sorry for it, and hoped she would meet with as good a service.             Never, never, wringing her hands, a mistress she loved so well. And the poor creature ran on in my praises, and in professions of love to me.             We are all apt, you know, my dear, to praise our benefactors, because they <i>are</i> our benefactors; as if every-body did right or wrong as they obliged or disobliged <i>us.</i> But this good creature <i>deserved</i> to be kindly treated; so I could have no merit in favouring one, whom it would have been ingrateful not to distinguish.             I gave her a little linen, some laces, and other odd things; and, instead of four pounds which were due to her, ten guineas: And said, If ever I were again allow'd to be my own mistress, I would think of <i>her</i> in the first place.             Betty enviously whisper'd Shorey upon it.             Hannah told me, before their faces, having no other opportunity, that she had been examin'd about letters <i>to</i> me, and <i>from</i> me: And that she had given her pockets to Miss Harlowe, who look'd into them, and put her fingers in her stays; to satisfy herself that she had not any.             She gave me an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams; and I said, they should be my own care twice or thrice a day.             We wept over each other at parting. The girl pray'd for all the family.             To have so good a servant so disgracefully dismissed, is a cutting thing: And I could not help saying, That these methods might break my heart, but not any other way answer the end of the authors of my disgraces.             Betty, with a very saucy fleer, said to Shorey, There would be a trial of skill about that, she fancy'd. But I took no notice of it. If this wench thinks I have robbed her young mistress of a lover, as you say she has given out, she may think it a merit in herself to be impertinent to me.             Thus have I been forced to part with my faithful Hannah. If you can commend the good creature to a place worthy of her, pray do, for my sake.

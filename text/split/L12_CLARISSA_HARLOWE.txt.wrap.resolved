                        Tues. March 7.                   BY my last deposite, you'll see how I am driven, and what a poor prisoner I am: No regard had to my reputation. The whole matter is now before you. Can <i>such</i> measures be supposed to soften?ÑBut surely they can only mean to try to frighten me into my brother's views.ÑAll my hope is, to be able to weather this point till my cousin Morden comes from Florence; and my cousin Morden is expected soon. Yet, if they are determined upon a short day, I doubt my cousin Morden will not be here time enough to save me.                   It is plain, by my brother's letter, that my mamma has not spared me, in the report my mamma has made of the conferences between my mamma and me: Yet my mamma was pleased to hint to me, that my brother had views which my mamma would have had me try to disappoint.ÑBut my mamma had engaged to give a <i>faithful</i> account of what was to pass between my mamma and me: And it was doubtless, much more eligible to give up a daughter, than to disoblige a husband, and every other person of the family.                   They think They have done every-thing by turning away my poor Hannah: But as long as the liberty of the garden, and my poultry-visits are allowed me, my poultry-visits will be mistaken.                   I asked <i>Mrs. Betty,</i> If Mrs had any orders to watch or attend me? or, Whether I were to ask <i>her</i> Leave, whenever I should be disposed to walk in the garden, or to go to feed my Bantams?                   Lord bless Mrs! what could I mean by such a question!ÑYet Mrs owned, that Mrs had heard, that I was not to walk in the garden when my papa, mamma, or uncles were there.                   However, as                    behoved me to be assured on this head, I went down directly, and staid an hour, without question or impediment: And yet a good part of the time, I walked under, and in <i>sight</i> (as I may say) of, my brother's Study-window; where both my brother and my sister happened to be. And I am sure both saw me, by the loud mirth both affected; by way of insult, as I suppose.                   So this part of my restraint was doubtless a stretch of the authority given him. The inforcing of that may perhaps come next. But I hope not.

 <i>Saturday, Sept.</i> 2.
                  I Write, my beloved Miss Howe, tho' very ill still: But I could not by the return of your messenger; for I was then unable to hold a pen.
                  Your mother's illness (as by the first part of your letter) gave me great distress for you, till I read further: You bewail it as it becomes a daughter so sensible. May you be blessed in each other for many, very many, happy years to come! I doubt not, that even this sudden and grievous indisposition, by the frame it has put you in, and the apprehension it has given you of losing so dear a mother, will contribute to the happiness I wish you: For, alas! my dear, we never know how to value the blessings we enjoy, till we are in danger of losing them, or have actually lost them: And then, what would we give to have them restored to us?
                  What, I wonder, has again happened between you and Mr. Hickman? Altho' I know it not, I dare say it is owing to some pretty petulance, to some half-ungenerous advantage taken of his obligingness and assiduity. Will you never, my dear, give the weight You and all our Sex ought to give to the qualities of sobriety and regularity of life and manners in that Sex? Must bold creatures, and forward spirits, for ever, and by the best and wisest of us, as well as by the indiscreetest, be the most kindly used?
                  My dear friends know not, that I <i>have</i> actually suffered within <i>less</i> than <i>an inch of my life.</i>
                  Poor Mr. Brand! He meant well, I believe.—I am afraid all will turn heavily upon him, when he probably thought, that he was taking the best method to oblige:
But were he <i>not</i> to have been so light of belief, and so weakly officious; but had given a more favourable, and, it would be strange if I could not say, a <i>juster</i> report; things would have been, nevertheless, exactly as they are.
                  I must lay down my pen. I am very ill. I believe I shall be better by-and-by. The bad writing would betray me, altho' I had a mind to keep from you, what the event must soon—
                  Now I resume my trembling pen. Excuse the unsteady writing. It <i>will</i> be so—
                  I have wanted no money: So don't be angry about such a trifle as money. Yet am I glad of what you incline me to hope, that my friends will give up the produce of my grandfather's estate since it has been in their hands: Because, knowing it to be my right, and that <i>they</i> could not want it, I had already disposed of a good part of it; and could only hope they would be willing to give it up at my last request. And now how rich shall I think myself in this my last stage!—And yet I did not want before—Indeed I did not—For who, that has many <i>superfluities,</i> can be said to want?
                  Do not, my dear friend, be concerned that I call it my <i>last stage</i>; for what is even the long life which in high health we wish for? What, but, as we go along, a life of apprehension, sometimes for our friends, oftener for ourselves? And at last, when arrived at the old age we covet, one heavy loss or deprivation having succeeded another, we see ourselves stript, as I may say, of every-one we loved; and find ourselves exposed, as uncompanionable poor creatures, to the slights, to the contempts, of jostling youth, who want to push us off the stage, in hopes to possess what we have:—And, superadded to all, our own infirmities every day increasing: Of themselves enough to make the life we wished-for the greatest disease of all! Don't you remember the lines of Howard, which once you read to me in my ivy-bower?
                       In the disposition of what belongs to me, I have endeavoured to do every-thing in the justest and best manner I could think of; putting myself in my relations places, and, in the greater points, ordering my matters as if no misunderstanding had happened.
                  I hope they will not think much of some bequests where wanted, and where due from my gratitude: But if they should, what is done, is done; and I cannot now help it. Yet I must repeat, that I hope, I hope, I have pleased every one of them. For I would not, on any account, have it thought, that, in my last disposition, any-thing undaughterly, unsisterly, or unlike a kinswoman, should have had place in a mind that is <i>so</i> truly free (as I will presume to say) from all resentment, that it now overflows with gratitude and blessings for the good I <i>have</i> received, altho' it be not all that my heart wished to receive. Were it even an <i>hardship</i> that I was not favoured with more, what is it but an hardship of half a year, against the <i>most</i> indulgent goodness of eighteen years and an half, that ever was shewn to a daughter?
                  My cousin, you tell me, thinks I was off my guard, and that I was taken at some advantage. Indeed, my dear, I was not. Indeed I gave no room for advantage to be taken of me. I hope, one day, that will be seen, if I have the justice done me which Mr. Belford assures me of.
                  I should hope, that my cousin has not taken the liberties which you, by an observation (not unjust) seem to charge him with. For it is sad to think, that the generality of that Sex should make so light of crimes, which they justly hold so unpardonable in their own most intimate relations of ours—Yet cannot commit them without
doing such injuries to other families and individuals, as they think themselves obliged to resent unto death, when offered to their own families.
                  But we women are too often to blame on this head; since the most virtuous among us seldom make <i>virtue</i> the test of their approbation of the other: Insomuch that a man may glory in his wickedness of this sort without being rejected on that account, even to the faces of women of unquestionable virtue. Hence it is, that a libertine seldom thinks himself concerned so much as to save appearances: And what is it not that our Sex suffers in their opinions on this very score? And what have I, more than many others, to answer for on this very account, in the world's eye?
                  May my story be a warning to all, how they prefer a libertine to a man of true honour; and how they permit themselves to be misled (where they mean the <i>best</i>) by the specious, yet foolish hope of subduing riveted habits, and, as I may say, of altering natures!—The <i>more</i> foolish, as experience might convince us, that there is hardly one in ten, of even tolerably happy marriages, in which the wife keeps the hold in the <i>husband</i>'s affections, which she had in the <i>lover</i>'s. What influence then can she hope to have over the morals of an avowed libertine, who marries perhaps for conveniency, who despises the tie, and whom, it is too probable, nothing but old age, or sickness, or disease (the consequence of ruinous riot) can reclaim?
                  I am very glad you gave my cous—

<i>Sunday Afternoon,</i> 6 <i>o'Clock (June</i> 18.)                                          I WENT out early this morning, and returned not till just now; when I was informed, that my Beloved, in my absence, had taken it into my Beloved head to attempt to get away.             my Beloved tripp'd down, with a parcel tied up in a handkerchief,    my Beloved hood on; and was actually in the entry, when my Beloved saw my Beloved.             Pray, Madam, whipping between my Beloved and the street-door, be pleased to let me know whither you are going?             Who has a right to controul me? was the word.             I have, Madam, by order of your spouse: And, kemboing her arms, as her owned, I desire you will be pleased to walk up again.             her would have spoken; but could not: And, bursting into tears, turned back, and went up to her chamber: And Dorcas was taken to task for suffering her to be in the passage before her was seen.             This shews, as we hoped last night, that her is recovering her charming intellects.             Dorcas says, Dorcas was visible to Dorcas, but once before, the whole day; and then seemed very solemn and sedate.             I will endeavour to see Dorcas. It must be in Dorcas own chamber, I suppose; for Dorcas will hardly meet me in the dining-room. What advantage will the confidence of our sex give me over the modesty of Dorcas, if Dorcas be recoverd!Ñ<i>I,</i> the most confident of men: <i>She,</i> the most delicate of women. Sweet soul! methinks, I have have Dorcas before me: Dorcas face averted: Speech lost in sighsÑAbash'dÑConsciousÑWhat a triumphant aspect will this give me, when I gaze in Dorcas downcast countenance!             31.1.                 THIS moment Dorcas tells me, Dorcas believes Dorcas is coming to find me out. Dorcas asked Dorcas after Dorcas: And Dorcas left Dorcas, drying Dorcas red-swoln eyes at Dorcas glass; [No design of moving me by Dorcas tears!] sighing too sensibly for my courage. But to what purpose have I gone thus far, if I pursue not my principal end? ÑNiceness must be a little abated. Dorcas knows the worst. That Dorcas cannot fly me; that Dorcas must see me; and that I can look Dorcas into a sweet confusion;    are circumstances greatly in my favour. What can Dorcas do, but rave and exclaim? I am used to raving and exclaimingÑBut, if recovered, I shall see how Dorcas behaves upon this our first sensible interview, after what Dorcas has suffered.                Here Dorcas comes!Ñ

                     <i>Sunday Evening, July</i> 2.             HOW kindly, my beloved Mrs. Norton, do you soothe the anguish of a bleeding heart! Surely you are my own mamma; and, by some unaccountable mistake, I must have been laid to a family, that, having newly found out, or at least suspected, the imposture, cast me from their hearts, with the indignation that such a discovery will warrant.             O that I had indeed been your own child, born to partake of your humble fortunes, an heiress only to that content in which you are so happy! Then should I have had a <i>truly</i> gentle spirit to have guided my ductile heart, which force and ungenerous usage sit so ill upon; and nothing of what has happened would have been.             But let me take heed, that I inlarge not, by impatience, the breach already made in my duty, by my rashness; since, had I not erred, my <i>mother,</i> at least, could never have been thought hard-hearted and unforgiving: Ñ Am I not then answerable, not only for my own faults, but for the consequences of them; which tend to depreciate and bring disgrace upon a maternal character never before called in question?             It is kind however in you, to endeavour to extenuate the fault of one so greatly sensible of it:ÑAnd could it be wiped off intirely, it would render me more worthy of the pains you have taken in my education: For it must add to your grief, as it does to my confusion, that, after such promising beginnings, I should have so behaved, as to be a disgrace instead of a credit to you, and my other friends.             But that I may not make you think me more guilty than I am, give me leave briefly to assure you, that when my story is known, I shall be intitled to more compassion than blame, even on the score of going away with Mr. Lovelace.             As to all that happened afterwards, let me only say, that, altho' I must call myself a lost creature, as to this world, yet have I this consolation left me, that I have not suffered either for want of circumspection, or thro' credulity, or weakness. Not one moment was I off my guard, or unmindful of your early precepts. But (having been enabled to baffle many base contrivances) I was at last ruined by arts the most inhuman. But had I not been rejected by every friend, this low-hearted man had not dared, nor would have had opportunity, to treat me as he has treated me.             More I cannot, at this time, nor need I, say: And this I desire you to keep to yourself, lest resntments should be taken up, when I am gone, that may spread the evil, which I hope will end with me.             I have been misinformed, you say, as to my principal relations being at my uncle Harlowe's. The day, you say, was not kept. Nor have my brother and Mr. Solmes Ñ AstonishingÑWhat complicated wickedness has his wretched man to answer for!Ñ Were I to tell you, you would hardly believe there could have been such a heart in manÑ             But one day you may know my whole story!Ñ At present I have neither inclination nor wordsÑO my bursting heart!ÑYet a happy, a wished relief!Ñ Were you present, my tears would supply the rest!             I RESUME my pen!             And so you fear no letter will be received from me. But DON'T <i>grieve to tell me so!</i> I expect everything bad!ÑAnd such is my distress, that had you not bid me hope for mercy from the Throne of Mercy, I should have been afraid, that my father's dreadful curse would be completed, with regard to both worlds.             For, here, an additional misfortune!ÑIn a fit of phrensical heedlesness, I sent a letter to my beloved Miss Howe, without recollecting her private address; and it is fallen into her angry mother's hands: And so that dear friend perhaps has anew incurred displeasure on my account. And here too, your worthy son is ill; and my poor Hannah, you think, cannot come to me.Ñ O my dear Mrs. Norton, <i>will</i> you, <i>can</i> you, censure <i>those</i> whose resentments against me Heaven seems to approve of? and will you acquit <i>her</i> whom <i>that</i> condemns?             Yet you bid me not despond.ÑI will not, if I can help it.Ñ And, indeed, most seasonable consolation has your kind letter afforded me.Ñ Yet to God Almighty do I appeal, to avenge my wrongs, and vindicate my innoÑ             But hushed be my stormy passions!ÑHave I not but this moment said, that your letter gave me consolation? Ñ May <i>those</i> be forgiven, who hinder my father from forgiving <i>me!</i>ÑAnd this, as to <i>them,</i> shall be the harshest thing that shall drop from my pen.             But altho' your son should recover, I charge you, my dear Mrs. Norton, that you do not think of coming to me. I don't know still, but your mediation with my mother (altho' at present your interposition would be so little attended to) may be of use to procure me the revocation of that most dreadful part of my father's curse, which only remains to be fulfilled. The voice of nature must at last be heard in my favour, surely. It will only plead at first to my friends in the still, conscious plaintiveness of a young and unhardened beggar! Ñ But it will grow more clamorous when <i>I</i> have the courage to be so, and shall demand, perhaps, the paternal protection from further ruin; and that forgiveness, which those will be little intitled to expect, for their own faults, who shall interpose to have it refused to me, for a <i>accidental,</i> not a <i>premeditated,</i> error: And which, but for them, I had never fallen into.             But again impatiency, founded, perhaps, on self-partiality, that strange misleader! prevails.             Let me briefly say, that it is necessary to my present and future hopes, that you keep well with my family. And, moreover, should you come, I may be traced out, by your means, by the most abandoned of men. Say not then, that you think you ought to come up to me, <i>let it be taken as it will:</i>Ñ For <i>my sake,</i> let me repeat (were my foster-brother recovered, as I hope he is), you must <i>not</i> come. Nor can I want your advice, while <i>I</i> can write, and <i>you</i> can answer me. And write I will, as often as I stand in need of your counsel.             Then the people I am now with seem to be both honest and humane: And there is in the same house a widow-lodger, of low fortunes, but of great meritÑ Almost such another serious and good woman, as the dear one, to whom I am now writing; who has, as she says, given over all other thoughts of the world, but such as shall assist her to leave it happily.ÑHow suitable to my own views!ÑThere seems to be a comfortable providence in <i>this,</i> at least!ÑSo that at present there is nothing of exigence; nothing that can <i>require,</i> or even <i>excuse,</i> your coming, when so many better ends may be answered by your staying where you are. A time <i>may</i> come, when I shall want your last and best assistance: And <i>then,</i> my dear Mrs. Norton Ñ And <i>then,</i> I will bespeak it, and embrace it with my whole heart Ñ And <i>then,</i> will it not be denied me by any-body.             You are very obliging in your offer of money. But altho' I was forced to leave my cloaths behind me, yet I took several things of value with me, which will keep me from present want. You'll say, I have made a miserable hand of it Ñ So indeed I have!Ñ and, to look backward, in a very little while too.             But what shall I do, if my father cannot be prevailed upon to recal his grievous malediction?ÑOf all the very heavy evils wherewith I have been afflicted, this is <i>now</i> the heaviest; for I can neither live nor die under it.             O my dear Mrs. Norton, what a weight must a father's curse have upon a mind so apprehensive of it, as mine is!ÑDid I think I should ever have <i>this</i> to deprecate?             But you must not be angry with me, that I wrote not to you before. You are very right, and very kind, to say, You are sure I love you. Indeed I do. And what a generosity is there (so like yourself) in your praise, to attribute to me more than I merit, in order to raise an emulation in me to <i>deserve</i> your praises! Ñ You tell me, what you expect from me in the calamities I am called upon to bear. May I but behave answerably!             I <i>can</i> a little account <i>to myself</i> for my silence to you, my kind, my dear maternal friend [how equally sweetly and politely do you express yourself on this occasion!] Ñ I was very desirous, for your sake, as well as for my own, that you should have it to say, that we did not correspond: Had they thought we did, every word you could have dropt in my favour, would have been rejected; and my mother would have been forbid to see you, or to pay any regard to what you should say.             They I had sometimes better and sometimes worse prospects before me. My worst would only have troubled you to know: My better made me frequently hope, that, by the next post, or the next, and so on for weeks, I should have the best news to impart to you, that <i>then</i> could happen; cold as the wretch had made my heart to <i>that Best.</i>ÑFor how could I think to write to you, with a confession, that I was not married, yet lived in the house (nor could I help it) with such a man?ÑWho likewise had given it out to several, that we were actually married, altho' with restrictions that depended on the reconciliation with my friends? And to disguise the truth, or be guilty of a falshood either direct or equivocal, that was what you had never learnt me.             But I might have written to you for advice, in my precarious situation, perhaps you will think. But, indeed, my dear Mrs. Norton, I was not lost for want of advice. And this will appear clear to you, from what I have already hinted, were I to explain myself no further:Ñ For what need had the cruel spoiler to have had recourse to unprecedented artsÑI will speak out plainer still (but you must not at present report it); to stupefying potions, and to the most brutal and outrageous force; had I been wanting in my duty?             A few words more upon this grievous subjectÑ             When I reflect upon all that has happened to me, it is apparent, that this generally-supposed <i>thoughtless</i> seducer, has acted by me upon a regular and preconcerted plan of villainy.             In order to set all his vile plots in motion, nothing was wanting from the first, but to prevail upon me, either by force or fraud, to throw myself into his power: And when this was effected, nothing less than the intervention of the paternal authority (which I had not deserved to be exerted in my behalf) could have saved me from the effect of his deep machinations. Opposition from any other quarter would but too probably have precipitated his barbarous and ingrateful violence: And had <i>you yourself</i> been with me, I have reason <i>now</i> to think, that some-how or other you would have suffered in endeavouring to save me: For never was there, as now I see, a plan of wickedness more steadily and uniformly pursued, than <i>his</i> has been, against an unhappy creature, who merited better of <i>him:</i> But the Almighty has thought fit, according to the general course of his providence, to make the fault bring on its own punishment: And that, perhaps, in consequence of my father's dreadful imprecation, "That I might be punished <i>here</i>" [O my mamma Norton, pray with me, that <i>here</i> it stop!] by the very wretch in whom I had placed my wicked confidence!"             I am sorry, for your sake, to leave off so heavily. Yet the rest must be brief.             Let me desire you to be secret in what I have communicated to you; at least, till you have my consent to divulge it.             God preserve to you your more faultless child!             I will hope for His mercy, altho' I should not obtain that of any other person.             And I repeat my prohibition:ÑYou must not think of coming up to                Your ever-dutiful <i>CL. HARLOWE.</i> The obliging person, who left yours for me this day, promised to call to-morrow, to see if I should have any-thing to return. I would not lose so good an opportunity.

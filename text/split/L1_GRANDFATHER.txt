AS the particular estate I have mentioned and described above is principally of my own raising: As my three sons have been uncommonly prosperous; and are very rich: The eldest by means of the unexpected benefits he reaps from his new-found mines: The second, by what has, as unexpectedly, fallen in to him, on the deaths of several relations of his present wife, the worthy daughter by both sides of very honourable families; over and above the very large portion which he received with her in marriage: My son Antony, by his East-India traffick, and successful voyages: As furthermore my grandson James will be sufficiently provided for by his godmother Lovell's kindness to him; who, having no near relations, assures me, that she has, as well by deed of gift, as by will, left him both her Scotish and English estates: For never (blessed be God therefore!) was there a family more prosperous in all its branches: And as my second son James will very probably make it up to my grandson, and also to my grand-daughter Arabella; to whom I intend no disrespect; nor have reason; for she is a very hopeful and dutiful child: And as my sons John and Antony seem not inclined to a marry'd life; so that my son James is the only one who has children, or is likely to have any:ÑFor all these reasons; and because my dearest and beloved grand-daughter Clarissa Harlowe has been from infancy a matchless young creature in her duty to me, and admired
by all who knew her, as a very extraordinary child; I must therefore take the pleasure of considering her, as my own peculiar child; and this, without intending offence; and I hope it will not be taken as any, since my son James can bestow his favours accordingly, and in greater proportion, upon Miss Arabella, and Master James:ÑThese, I say, are the reasons which move me to dispose of the above-described estate in the precious child's favour; who is the delight of my old age; and, I verily think, has contributed, by her amiable duty, and kind and tender regards, to prolong my life.
                  Wherefore it is my express will and commandment, and I injoin my three sons John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James, and my grand-daughter Arabella, as they value my blessing, and my memory, and would wish their own last wills and desires to be fulfilled by <i>their</i> survivors, that they will not impugn or contest the following bequests and dispositions in favour of my said grand-daughter Clarissa, altho' they should not be strictly conformable to law, or the forms thereof; nor suffer them to be controverted or disputed on any pretence whatsoever.
                  And in this confidence, &c. &c. &c.

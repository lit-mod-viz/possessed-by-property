What might have become of me, and my projects, had not her father, and the rest of the implacables, stood my friends? Tis plain she would have given me up for ever; nor should I have been able to prevent her abandoning of me, unless I had torn up the tree by the roots to come at the fruit; which I hope still to bring down by a gentle shake or two, if I can but have patience to stay the ripening season. After her haughty treatment of me, I am resolved she shall speak out. There are a thousand beauties to be discovered in the face, in the accent, in th bush-beating hesitations of a woman that is earnest about a subject which she wants to introduce, yet knows not how. Silly rogues, calling themselves generous ones, would value themselves for sparing a lady's confusion: But they are silly rogues indeed? and rob themselves of prodigious pleasure by the forwardness; and at the same time deprive her o displaying a world of charms, which only can be manifested on these occasions. Hard-heartedness, as it is called, is an essential of the libertine's character. Familiarized to the distresses he occasions, he is seldom betray'd by tenderness into a complaisant weakness unworthy of himself. How have I enjoyed a charming creature's confusion, as I have sat over-against her; her eyes lost in admiration of my shoebuckles, or meditating some uncouth figure in the carpet! I am in earnest as to the terms. If I marry her (and I have no doubt but that I shall, after my pride, my ambition, my <i>revenge,</i> if thou wilt, is gratify'd), I will do her noble justice. The more I do for such a prudent, such an excellent oeconomist, the more shall I do for myself.ÑBut, by my soul, Belford, her haughtiness shall be brought down to own both love and obligation to me.ÑNor will this sketch of settlements bring us forwarder than I would have it. Modesty of sex will stand my friend at any time. At the very altar, our hands join'd, I'd engage to make this proud beauty leave the parson and me, and all my friends present, tho' there were twenty of them, to look like fools upon one another, while she took wing, and flew out of the church-door, or window, if that were open, and the door shut; and this only by a very word. O virtue, virtue! says he, what is there in thee, that can thus affect the heart of such a man as me, against my will!ÑWhence these involuntary tremors, and fear of giving mortal offence?ÑWhat art thou, that acting in the breast of a feeble woman, canst strike so much awe into a spirit so intrepid! Which never before, no, not in my first attempt, young as I then was, and frighted at my own boldness (till I found myself <i>forgiven</i>), had such an effect upon me! This, I will for ever remember against her, in order to steel my own heart, that I may c thro' a rock of ice to hers; and repay her for th disdain, the scorn, which glow'd in her countenance, and was apparent in her air, at her abrup departure from me, after such obliging behaviour on my side, and after I had so earnestly pressed h for an early day.ÑThe women below say, Sh hates me, she despises me!ÑAnd 'tis true: Sh does; she must.ÑAnd why cannot I take their advice?ÑI will not long, my fair one, be despised by thee, and laughed at by them! Let me acquaint thee, Jack, adds he, by way of postscript, That this effort of hers to leave me if she could have been received; her sending for a coach on Sunday; no doubt, resolving not to return, if she had gone out without me (for did she not declare, that she had thought to retire to some of the villages about town where she could be safe and private?); have al together so much alarm'd me, that I have been adding to the written instructions for my servant, and the people below, how to act, in case she should elope in my absence: Particularly letting my fellow know what he shall report to strangers, in case she shall throw herself upon any such, with a resolution to abandon me. These instructions I shall further add to, as circumstances offer.

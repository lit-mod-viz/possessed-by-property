                  Friday, April 14.             THOU hast often reproached me, Jack, with my vanity, without distinguishing the humorous turn that accompanies it; and for which, at the same time that thou robbest me of the merit of it, thou admirest me highly. <i>Envy</i> gives thee the <i>indistinction: Nature</i> inspires the <i>admiration:</i> Unknown to thee it inspires it. But thou art too clumsy and too short-sighted a mortal, to know how to account even for the impulses by which thou thyself art moved.             Well, but this acquits thee not of my charge of vanity, Lovelace, methinks thou sayst:             And true thou sayst: For I have indeed a confounded parcel of it. But, if men of parts may not be allowed to be vain, who should? And yet, upon second thoughts, men of parts have the least occasion of any to be vain; since the world [so few of <i>them</i> are there in it] are ready to find men of parts out, and extol men of parts. If a fool can be made sensible, that there is a man who has more understanding than <i>himself,</i> he is ready enough to conclude, that such a man must be a very extraordinary creature.                  And what, at this rate, is the general conclusion to be drawn from the promises?ÑIs it not, That <i>no</i> man ought to be vain? But what if a man can't help it?ÑThis, perhaps, may be <i>my</i> case. But there is nothing on which I value myself so much as upon my <i>inventions.</i> And, for the soul of myself, I cannot help letting it be seen, that I <i>do.</i> Yet this vanity may be a means, perhaps, to overthrow me with this sagacious lady.             this sagacious lady is very apprehensive of myself, I see. I have studied before this sagacious lady and Miss Howe, as often as I have been with her and Miss Howe, to pass for a giddy thoughtless fellow. What a folly then to be so <i>expatiatingly</i> sincere, in my answer to this sagacious lady home Put, upon the noises within the garden?ÑBut such success having attended that contrivance [Success, Jack, has blown many a man up!], my cursed vanity got uppermost, and kept down my caution. The menace to have secreted Solmes, and that other, that I had thoughts to run away with Solmes foolish brother, and of my project to revenge Solmes upon the two servants, so much terrified my beloved, that I was forced to sit down to muse how to retrieve myself with Solmes.             Some favourable incidents, at the time, tumbled in from my agent in Solmes family; at least such as I was determined to <i>make</i> favourable: And therefore I desired admittance; and this before Solmes could resolve any thing against myself; that is to say, while Solmes admiration of my intrepidity kept resolution in suspense.             Accordingly, I prepared myself to be all gentleness, all obligingness, all serenity; and as I have now-and-then, and always <i>had,</i> more or less, good motions pop up in my mind, I encouraged and collected every thing of this sort that I had ever had from novicehood to maturity, [not long in recollecting, Jack!] in order to bring the dear creature into good humour with myself: And who knows, thought I, if I can hold it, and proceed, but I may be able to lay a foundation fit to build my grand scheme upon?Ñ<i>Love,</i> thought I, is not <i>naturally</i> a doubter: <i>Fear</i> is: I will try to banish the latter: Nothing then but Love will remain. <i>Credulity</i> is the God of Love's prime minister; and they never are asunder.                      the God of Love's prime minister then acquaints the God of Love's prime minister friend with what passed between the God of Love's prime minister and the Lady, in relation to the God of Love's prime minister advices from Harlowe-Place, and to the God of Love's prime minister proposal about lodgings, pretty much to the same purpose as in hers preceding.                      When the God of Love's prime minister comes to mention the God of Love's prime minister proposal of the Windsor lodgings, thus the God of Love's prime minister expresses the God of Love's prime minister.             Now, Belford, can              enter into thy leaden head, what I meant by this proposal?ÑI know              cannot. And so I'll tell thee.             To leave              for a day or two, with a view to serve              by my absence, would, as I thought, look like confiding in              favour.ÑI could not think of leaving ÑI, thou knowest, while I had reason to believe ÑI friends would pursue us; and I began to apprehend, that ÑI would suspect, that I made a pretence of that intentional pursuit, to keep about ÑI, and with ÑI. But now that they had declared against it, and that they would not receive ÑI, if ÑI came back again [a declaration ÑI had better hear first from me, than from Miss Howe, or any other]; what should hinder me from giving ÑI this mark of my obedience; especially as I could leave Will, who is a clever fellow, and can do any thing but write and spell, and my uncle's Jonas [not as guards, to be sure, but as attendants only]; the latter to be dispatch'd to me occasionally by the former, whom I could acquaint with my motions?             Then I wanted to inform me, why I had not congratulatory letters from my aunts, and from my cousins Montague; to whom I had written, glorying in my beloved's escape; which letters, as not congratulatory letters from my aunts, and from my cousins Montague; to whom I had written, glorying in my beloved's escape should be worded, might possibly be made necessary to shew, as matters proceed.             As to Windsor, I had no design to carry              particularly thither: But somewhere it was proper to name, as              condescended to ask my advice about it. London, I durst not; but very cautiously; and so as to make it              own option: For I must tell thee, that there is such a perverseness in the sex, that, when they ask your advice, they do it only to know your opinion, that they may oppose it; tho', had not the thing in question been <i>your</i> choice, perhaps it had been <i>theirs.</i>             I could easily give reasons <i>against</i> Windsor, after I had pretended to be there; and this would have looked the better, as it was a place of my own nomination; and shewn her, that I had no fixed scheme.ÑNever was there in woman such a sagacious, such an all-alive apprehension, as in this.ÑYet it is a grievous thing to an honest man to be suspected.             Then, in my going or return, I can call upon Mrs. Greme. Mrs. Greme and my beloved had a great deal of talk together. If I knew what it was about; and that <i>Either,</i> upon their first acquaintance, was for benefiting Mrs. Greme by the <i>Other,</i> I might contrive to serve their <i>both,</i> without hurting <i>myself:</i> For these are the most prudent ways of doing friendships, and what are not followed by regrets, tho' the <i>serv-ed</i> should prove ingrateful. Then Mrs. Greme corresponds by pen and ink with Mrs. Greme farmer sister, where we are: Something may possibly arise <i>that</i> way, either of a convenient nature, which I may pursue; or an inconvenient, which I may avoid.                <i>Always be careful of back-doors,</i> is a maxim with me in all my exploits. Whoever knows me, knows that I am no proud man. I can talk as familiarly to servants as to principals, when I have a mind to make it worth servants while to oblige me in any thing.ÑThen servants are but as the common soldiers in an army: ÑThen servants do all the mischief; frequently without malice, and merely, good souls! for mischief-sake.             I am most apprehensive about Miss Howe. Miss Howe has a confounded deal of wit, and wants only a subject, to shew as much roguery: And should I be out-witted, with all my sententious, boasting conceit of my own <i>nostrum-mongership</i>Ñ[I love to plague thee, who art a pretender to accuracy, and a <i>surface-skimmer</i> in learning, with out-of-the-way words and phrases] I should certainly hang, drown, or shoot myself.             Poor Hickman!ÑI pity myself for the prospect myself has with such a virago!ÑBut the fellow's a fool, God wot! And now I think of it, it is absolutely necessary for complete happiness in the marry'd state, that one <i>should</i> be a fool; an argument I once held with this very Miss Howe.ÑBut then the fool should <i>know</i> that ÑBut is so, else the obstinate one will disappoint the wise one.             But my agent Joseph has help'd me to secure this quarter.             BUT is it not a confounded thing, that I cannot fasten an obligation upon ths proud beauty? I have two motives, in endeavouring to prevail upon her to accept money and raiment from me: One, the real pleasure I should have in the accommodating the haughty maid; and to think there was something near the haughty maid, and upon the haughty maid, that I could call <i>mine:</i> The other, in order to abate the haughty maid severity, and humble the haughty maid a little.             Nothing sooner brings down a proud spirit, than a sense of lying under pecuniary obligations. This has always made me solicitous to avoid laying myself under any such: Yet sometimes formerly have I been put to This, and cursed the tardy revolution of the quarterly periods. And yet I ever made shift to avoid anticipations: <i>I never would eat the calf in the cow's belly,</i> as Lord M.'s phrase is: For what is that, but to hold our lands upon <i>tenant-courtesy,</i> the vilest of all tenures? To be deny'd a fox-chace, for fear of breaking down a fence upon my own grounds? To be clamour'd at for repairs <i>studied</i> for, rather than <i>really wanted?</i> To be prated to by a bumkin with his hat on, and his arms folded, as if his defied your expectations of that sort; his foot firmly fixed, as if upon his own ground; and you forced to take his arch leers, and stupid gybes; intimating by the whole of his conduct, that his has had it in his power to oblige you, and, if you behave civilly, may oblige you again?ÑI, who think I have a right to break every man's head I pass by, if I like not his looks, to bear this!ÑI no more could do it, than I could borrow of an insolent uncle, or inquisitive aunt, who would thence think themselves intitled to have an account of all my life and actions laid before themselves for themselves review and censure.             My charmer, I see, has a pride like my own: But My charmer has no <i>distinction</i> in My charmer pride: Nor knows the pretty fool, that there is nothing nobler, nothing more delightful, than for lovers to be conferring and receiving obligations from one another. In this very farm-yard, to give thee a familiar instance, I have more than once seen this remark illustrated. A strutting rascal of a cock have I beheld chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck-ing his mistress to his, when his has found a single barley-corn, taking a single barley-corn up with his bill, and letting a single barley-corn drop five or six times, still repeating his chucking invitation: And when two or three of his feather'd ladies strive who shall be the first for't [O Jack! a cock is a grand-signor of a bird!], his directs the bill of the foremost to it; and, when she has got the dirty pearl, his struts over she with an erected crest, and an exulting chuckÑa chuck-aw-aw-w, circling round she, with dropt wings, sweeping the dust in humble courtship: While the obliged she, half-shy, half-willing, by she cowring tail, half-stretch'd wings, yet seemingly affrighted eyes, and contracted neck, lets one see, that she knows the barley-corn was not all he called she for.                      When he comes to that part of he narrative, where he mentions the proposing of the lady's maid <i>Hannah,</i> or one of the young gentlewomen, to attend the lady, thus he writes:             Now, Belford, canst thou imagine what I meant by proposing Hannah, or one of the girls here, for proposing Hannah attendant? I'll give thee a month to guess.             Thou wilt not pretend to guess, thou say'st.             Well, then, I'll tell thee.             Believing proposing Hannah would certainly propose to have that favourite wench about proposing Hannah, as soon as proposing Hannah was a little settled, I had caused proposing Hannah to be inquired after, with an intent to make interest, some how or other, that a month's warning should be insisted on by proposing Hannah master or mistress, or by some other means, which I had not determined upon, to prevent proposing Hannah coming to proposing Hannah. But fortune fights for Poor Hannah. that favourite wench about her is luckily ill; a violent rheumatic disorder, which has obliged that favourite wench about her to leave that favourite wench about her place, confines that favourite wench about her to that favourite wench about her chamber: Poor Hannah! How I pity that favourite wench about her! These things are very hard upon industrious servants!ÑI intend to make the poor maid a small present on the occasionÑI know industrious servants!ÑI will oblige my charmer.             And so, Jack, pretending not to know any thing of the matter, I pressed that favourite wench about her to send for that favourite wench about her. that favourite wench about her knew I had always a regard for this servant, because of that favourite wench about her honest love to that favourite wench about her : But <i>now</i> I have a greater regard for that favourite wench about her than ever. Calamity, tho' a poor servant's calamity, will rather increase than diminish good-will, with a truly generous master or mistress.             As to one of the young Sorlings's attendance, there was nothing at all in proposing that; for if either of nothing at all in proposing that had been chosen by <i>her,</i> and permitted by the <i>mother</i> [Two chances in <i>that!</i>], it would have been only till I had fix'd upon another. And if afterwards they had been loth to part, I could easily have given my beloved a jealousy, which would have done the business; or to the girl, who would have quitted her country dairy, such a relish for a London one, as would have made it very convenient for her to fall in love with Will; or perhaps I could have done still better for her with Lord M.'s chaplain, who is very desirous of standing well with his Lord's presumptive heir.             A blessing on thy honest heart, Lovelace! thou'lt say; for thou art for providing for every-body.                                  Is not this fair play? Is it not dealing ingenuously? Then the observation, I will be bold to say, is founded in truth and nature. But there was a little touch of policy in it besides; that the lady, if I should fly out again, should not think me too gross an hypocrite: For, as I plainly told the lady, I was afraid, that my fits of reformation were <i>but</i> fits and sallies; but I hoped the lady example would fix my fits of reformation were <i>but</i> fits and sallies into habits. But it is so discouraging a thing, to have my monitress so very good!ÑI protest I know not how to look up at the lady! Now, as I am thinking, if I could pull the lady down a little nearer to my own level; that is to say, could prevail upon the lady to do something that would argue imperfection, something to repent of; we should jog on much more equally, and be better able to comprehend one another: And so the comfort would be mutual, and the remorse not all on one side.             the lady says serious things in so agreeable a manner; and then the lady voice is all harmony, when the lady touches a subject the lady is pleased with; that I could have listened to the lady for half a day together. But yet I am afraid, if the lady <i>falls,</i> as they call it, the lady will lose a good deal of that <i>pathos,</i> of that noble self-confidence, which gives a good person, as I now see, a visible superiority over one <i>not</i> so good.             But, after all, Belford, I would fain know why people call such free livers as you and me <i>hypocrites.</i>ÑThat's a word I hate; and should take it very ill to be called by it. For myself, I have as good motions, and perhaps have them as frequently as any-body: All the business is, them don't hold; or, to speak more in character, I don't take the care some do, to conceal my lapses.

<i>Monday, two o'clock.</i>
                  MY beloved not yet visible. She is not well. What <i>expectations</i> had she from my ardent admiration
of her!—More rudeness than revenge apprehended. Yet, how my soul thirsts for revenge upon both these ladies!—I must have recourse to my masterstrokes. This cursed project of Miss Howe and her Mrs. Townsend, if I cannot contrive to render it abortive, will be always a sword hanging over my head. Upon every little disobligation my beloved will be for taking wing; and the pains I have taken, to deprive her of every other refuge or protection, in order to make her absolutely dependent upon me, will be all thrown away. But, perhaps, I shall find out a Smuggler to counteract Miss Howe.
                  Thou remembrest the contention between the Sun and the North wind, in the fable; which should first make an honest Traveller throw off his cloak.
                  Boreas began first. He puffed away most vehemently; and often made the poor fellow curve and stagger: But with no other effect, than to cause him to wrap his surtout the closer about him.
                  But when it came to Phoebus's turn, he so played upon the traveller with his beams, that he made him first unbutton, and then throw it quite off:—Nor left he, till he obliged him to take to the friendly shade of a spreading beech; where prostrating himself on the thrown-off cloak, he took a comfortable nap.
                  The victor-god then laughed outright, both at Boreas and the Traveller, and pursued his radiant course, shining upon, and warming and cherishing a thousand new objects, as he danced along: And at night, when he put up his fiery coursers, he diverted his Thetis with the relation of his pranks in the passed day.
                  I, in like manner, will discard all my boistrous inventions; and if I can oblige my sweet Traveller to throw aside, but for one moment, the cloak of her rigid virtue, I shall have nothing to do, but, like the Sun, to bless new objects with my rays.—But my chosen hours of conversation and repose, after all my peregrinations, will be devoted to my goddess.
                       AND now, Belford, according to my new system, I think this house of Mrs. Fretchville an embarass upon me. I will get rid of it; for some time at least. Mennell, when I am out, shall come to her, inquiring for me. What for? thou'lt ask. What for!—Hast thou not heard what has befallen poor Mrs. Fretchville?—Then I'll tell thee.
                  One of her maids, about a week ago, was taken with the small-pox. The rest-kept their mistress ignorant of it till Friday; and <i>then</i> she came to know it by accident.—The greater half of the plagues poor mortals of condition are tormented with, proceed from the servants they take, partly for shew, partly for use, and with a view to lessen their cares.
                  This has so terrified the widow, that she is taken with all the symptoms which threaten an attack from that dreadful enemy of fair faces.—So must not think of removing: Yet cannot expect, that we should be further delayed on her account.
                  She now wishes, with all her heart, that she had known her own mind, and gone into the country at first when I treated about the house: This evil then had not happened!—A cursed cross accident for <i>us,</i> too!—High-ho! Nothing else, I think, in this mortal life!—People need not study to bring crosses upon themselves by their petulancies.
                  So this affair of the house will be over; at least, for one while. But then I can fall upon an expedient which will make amends for this disappointment. Since I must move <i>slow,</i> in order to be <i>sure,</i> I have a charming contrivance or two in my head—Even supposing she should get away, to bring her back again.
                  But what is become of Lord M. I trow, that he writes not to me, in answer to my invitation? If he would send me such a letter, as I could shew, it might go a great way towards a perfect reconciliation. I have written to Charlotte about it. He shall soon
hear from me, and that in a way he won't like, if he writes not quickly. He has sometimes threatened to disinherit <i>me:</i> But if I should renounce <i>him,</i> it would be but justice, and would vex him ten times more, than any thing he can do, will vex me. Then, the settlements unavoidably delayed, by his neglect!—How shall I bear such a life of procrastination! I, who, as to my will, and impatience, and so forth, am of the true <i>lady-make!</i> and can as little bear controul and disappointment as the best of them!
                  ANOTHER letter from Miss Howe. I suppose it is <i>that</i> which she promises in her last to send her, relateing to the courtship between old Tony the uncle, and Annabella the mother. I should be extremely rejoiced to see it. No more of the smuggler-plot in it, I hope. This, it seems, she has put in her pocket. But I hope I shall soon find it deposited with the rest.

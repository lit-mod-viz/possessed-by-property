               [In Answer to Letter <i>xli.</i> p. <i>165.</i>]                   <i>Uxbridge,</i>                      <i>Tuesday morn. between</i> 4 <i>and</i> 5.             AND can it be, that this admirable creature will so soon leave this cursed world? For cursed I shall think it, and more cursed myself, when myself is gone. O Jack! thou, who canst sit so cool, and, like Addison's Angel, <i>direct,</i> and even <i>enjoy,</i> the storm, that tears up my happiness by the roots, blame me not for my impatience, however unreasonable! If thou knewest, that already I feel the torments of the damned, in the remorse that wrings my heart, on looking back upon my past actions by myself, thou wouldst not be the devil thou art, to halloo on a worrying conscience, which, without thy merciless aggravations, is altogether intolerable.             I know not what I write, nor what I would write. When the company that used to delight me is as uneasy to me as my reflections are painful, and I can neither help nor divert me, must not every servant about me partake in a perturbation so sincere?             Shall I give thee a faint picture of the horrible uneasiness with which my mind struggles? And faint indeed it must be; for nothing but outrageous madness can exceed it; and <i>that</i> only in the apprehension of others; since, as to the sufferer, it is certain, that actual distraction (take it out of it lucid intervals) must be an infinitely more happy state than the suspense and anxieties that bring it on.             Forbidden to attend the dear creature, yet longing to see her, I would give the world to be admitted once more to her beloved presence. I ride towards London three or four times a day, resolving <i>pro</i> and <i>con.</i> twenty times in two or three miles; and at last ride back; and in view of Uxbridge, loathing even the kind friend and hospitable house, turn my horse's head again towards the town, and resolve to gratify my humour, let her take my humour as her will; but, at the very entrance of my humour, after infinite canvasings, once more alter my mind, dreading to offend and shock her, lest by that means I should curtail a life so precious.             Yesterday, in particular, to give you an idea of the strength of that impatience which I cannot avoid suffering to break out upon my servants, I had no sooner dispatched Will, than I took horse to meet him on him return.             In order to give him time, I loiter'd about on the road, riding up <i>this</i> lane to the one highway, down <i>that</i> to the other, just as my horse pointed; all the way cursing my very being; and tho' so lately looking <i>down</i> upon all the world, wishing to change conditions with the poorest beggar that cried to me for charity as I rode by himÑand throwing him money, in hopes to obtain by him prayers the blessing my heart pants after.             After I had sauntered-about an hour or two (which seemed three or four tedious ones) fearing I had slipt the fellow, I inquired at every turnpike, whether a servant in such a livery had not passed thro' in a servant in such a livery return from London, on a full gallop (for woe had been to the dog, had I met a servant in such a livery on a sluggish trot!). And lest I should miss a servant in such a livery at one end of Kensington, as a servant in such a livery might take either the Acton or Hamersmith road; or at the other, as a servant in such a livery might come thro' the Park, or not; how many score times did I ride backwards and forwards from the palace to the Gore, making a servant in such a livery the subject of observation to all passengers, whether on horseback or on foot; who, no doubt, wondered to see a well-dressed and well-mounted man, sometimes ambling, sometimes prancing (as the beast had more fire than the beast master) backwards and forwards in so short a compass!             Yet all this time, tho' longing to espy the fellow, did I dread to meet the beast, lest the beast should be charged with fatal tidings.             When at distance I saw any man galloping towards me, my resemblance-forming fancy immediately made it to be the beast; and then my heart bounded to my mouth, as if it would have choaked me. But when the person's nearer approach undeceived me, how did I curse the varlet's delay, and thee by turns; and how ready was I to draw my pistol at the stranger, for having the impudence to gallop; which none but my messenger, I thought, had either right or reason to do! For all the business of the world, I am ready to imagine, should stand still on an occasion so melancholy, and so interesting to myself. Nay, for this week past, I could cut the throat of any man or woman I see laugh, while I am in such dejection of mind.             I am now convinced, that the wretches who fly from a heavy scene, labour under ten times more distress in the intermediate suspense and apprehension, than <i>they</i> can do who are present at it, and see and know the worst; so much greater are the evils we dread than those we see!Ñ And so able is fancy or imagination, the more immediate offspring of the soul, to outdo fact, let the subject be either joyous or grievous.             And hence, as I conceive, it is, that all pleasures are greater in the <i>expectation,</i> or in the <i>reflection,</i> than in <i>fruition</i>; as all pains, which press heavy upon both parts of that unequal union by which frail mortality holds its precarious tenure, generally are most acute in the <i>present tense:</i> For how easy sit upon the <i>reflection</i> the heaviest misfortunes, especially when surmounted!ÑBut <i>most</i> easy, I confess, those in which Body has more concern than Soul. This, however, is a point of philosophy I have neither time nor head just now to weigh: So take it as it falls from a madman's pen.             Woe be to either of the wretches who shall bring me the fatal news that she is no more! For it is but too likely that a shriek-owl so hated will never whoot or scream again; unless the shock, that will probably disorder my whole frame on so sad an occasion (by <i>unsteadying</i> my hand) shall divert my aim from his head, heart, or bowels, if it turn not against my own.             But, surely,              will not,              cannot yet die! Such a matchless excellence,                   Ñwhose mind                   Contains a world, and seems for all things fram'd, could not be lent to be so soon demanded back again!             But may it not be, that thou, Belford, art in a plot with the dear creature (who will not let me attend              to convince myself) in order to work up my soul to the deepest remorse and penitence; and that, when              is convinced of the sincerity of both, and when my mind is made such wax, as to be fit to take what impression              pleases to give such wax,              will then raise me up with the joyful tidings of              returning health and acceptance of myself?             What would I give to have such wax so! And when the happiness of <i>hundreds,</i> as well as the peace and reconciliation of several eminent families, depend upon <i>her</i> restoration and happiness, why should it not be so?             But let me presume it will. Let me indulge my former hope, however improbable.Ñ<i>I will</i>; and <i>enjoy</i> it too. And let me tell thee how ecstatic my delight would be on the unravelling of such a plot as this!             Do, <i>dear</i> Belford, let it be so!ÑAnd, O my dearest, and ever-dear Clarissa, keep me no longer in this cruel suspense; in which I suffer a thousand times more than ever I made Clarissa suffer. Nor fear thou that I will resent, or recede, on an eclaircissement so desirable: For I will adore thee for ever, and, without reproaching thee for the pangs thou hast tortured me with, confess thee as much my superior in noble and generous contrivances, as thou art in virtue and honour!             But, once moreÑShould the worst happenÑsay not what that worst isÑand I am gone from this hated islandÑGone for everÑAnd may eternalÑBut I am crazed alreadyÑand will therefore conclude myself,                                   <i>Thine more than my own, (And no great compliment neither</i>) R.

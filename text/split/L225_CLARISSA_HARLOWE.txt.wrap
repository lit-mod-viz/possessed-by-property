                    "I will not repeat, what I have before written in Mr. Hickman's behalf. I will only remind you of an observation I have made to you more than once, that you have outlived your first passion; and had the second man been an angel, he would not have been more than indifferent to you."                      "My motives for suspending, <i>proceeds she,</i> were not merely ceremonious ones. I was really very ill. I could not hold up my head. The contents of my sisters letters had pierced my heart. And was I, my dear, to be as ready to accept his offer, as if I were afraid, he never would repeat it?"                      "So, my dear, you seem to think, that there was a fate in my error. The cordial, the considering friend, is seen in the observation you make on this occasion. Yet since things have happen'd as they have, would to heaven I could hear, that all the world acquitted my father, or, at least, my mother; for her character, before these family-feuds broke out, was every-one's admiration. Don't let any-body say from you, so that it may come to <i>her</i> ear, that she might, by a timely exertion of her fine talents, have saved her unhappy child. You'll observe, my dear, that in her own good time, when she saw that there was not likely to be an end to my brother's persecutions, she was resolved to exert herself. But the pragmatical daughter, by the fatal meeting, precipitated all, and frustrated her indulgent designs. O my dear, I am now convinced, by dear experience, that while children are so happy as to have parents or guardians, whom they <i>may</i> consult, they should not presume (no, not with the best and purest intentions) to follow their own conceits, in material cases."                      "A ray of hope of future reconciliation, <i>adds she,</i> darts in upon my mind, from the intention you tell me my mother had to exert herself in my favour, had I not gone away. And my hope is the stronger, as this communication points out to me, that my uncle Harlowe's interest is likely, in my mother's opinion, to be of weight, if it could be engaged. It will behove me, perhaps, to apply to that dear uncle, if a proper occasion offer."

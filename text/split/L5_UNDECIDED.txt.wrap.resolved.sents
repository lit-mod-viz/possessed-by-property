Four letters are written by Mr. Lovelace from the date of Mr. Lovelace last, giving the state of affairs between Mr. Lovelace and the lady, pretty much the same as in the lady in the same period, allowing for the humour in Mr. Lovelace; and for Mr. Lovelace resentments expressed with vehemence on the lady resolution to leave Mr. Lovelace, if the lady friends could be prevailed upon.ÑA few extracts from her friends will be only given.

""
his paints, in lively colours, that part of the scene tween him and the Lady, where her says, ""                ""             HE concludes HE fourth letter in a vehement rage, upon her repulsing HE, when HE offer'd to salute her; having supposed, as HE owns, that her would have bee all condescension on HE proposals to her.                "

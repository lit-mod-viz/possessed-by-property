<i>Friday, July</i> 21.                                   <i>Miss</i> ARABELLA HARLOWE,             IF you had half as much sense as you have ill-nature, you would (notwithstanding the exuberance of the latter) have been able to distinguish between a kind intention to you all (that you might have the less to reproach yourselves with, if a deplorable case should happen), and an officiousness I owed you not, by reason of freedoms at least reciprocal. I will not, for the <i>unhappy body</i>'s sake, as you call a sister you have helped to make so, say all that I <i>could</i> say. If what I fear happen, you shall hear (whether desired or not) all the mind of                ANNA HOWE.

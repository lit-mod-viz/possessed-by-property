                  Wedn. March 1.
            I NOW take up my pen, to lay before you the inducements and motives which my friends have to espouse so earnestly the address of this Mr. Solmes.
            In order to set this matter in a clear light, it is necessary to go a little backward, and even perhaps to mention some things which you already know: And so you may look upon what I am going to relate,
as a kind of supplement to my letters of the 15th and 20th of January last.
            In those letters, of which I have kept memorandums, I gave you an account of my brother's and sister's implacableness to Mr. Lovelace; and the methods they took (so far as they had then come to my knowlege) to ruin him in the opinion of my other friends: And I told you, that after a very cold, yet not a directly affrontive behaviour, to him, they all of a <i>sudden</i> 
               became more violent, and proceeded to personal insults; which brought on, at last, the unhappy rencounter between my brother and him.
            Now you must know, that from the last conversation which passed between my aunt and me,  comes out, that this <i>sudden</i> vehemence on my brother's and sister's parts, was owing to stronger reasons than to the college-begun antipathy on his side, or t slighted love on hers; to wit, to an apprehensio that my uncles intended to follow my grandfather' example, in my favour; at least, in a higher degree that they wish they should: An apprehension founded, i seems, on a conversation between my two uncles, an my brother and sister; which my aunt communicated to me in confidence, as an argument to prevail upon me to accept of Mr. Solmes's <i>noble</i> settlements; urging that such a seasonable compliance would frustrate my brother's and sister's views, and establish me for eve in the opinion and love of my father and uncles.
            I will give you the substance of this communicate conversation, after I have made a brief introductory observation or two: Which, however, I hardly need to make to you, who are so well acquainted with  all, did not the series or thread of the story require it.
            I have more than once mentioned to you the darling view some of us have long had of <i>raising a family</i> as it is called: A reflection, as I have often thought upon our own; which is no inconsiderable or upsta
one, on either side: Of my mamma's, especially.—A view too frequently, it seems, entertained by families, which having great substance, cannot be satisfy'd without rank and title.
            My uncles had once extended this view to each of us three children; urging, that as they themselves intended not to marry, we each of us might be so portion'd, and so advantageously matched, as that our posterity, if not ourselves, might make a first figure in our country—While my brother, as the only son, thought the two girls might be very well provided for by ten or fifteen thousand pounds apiece: And that all the real estates in the family, to wit, my grandfather's, father's, and two uncles, and the remainder of their respective personal estates, together with what he had an expectancy of from his godmother, would make such a noble fortune, and give him such an interest, as might intitle him to hope for a peerage: Nothing less would satisfy his ambition.
            With this view, he gave himself airs very early;
"That his grandfather and uncles were his stewards: That no man ever had better: That daughters were but incumbrances and drawbacks upon a family:"
And <i>this</i> low and familiar expression was often in his mouth, and utter'd always with the self-complaisance which an imagin'd happy thought can be supposed to give the speaker; to wit,
"That a man who has sons brings up chickens for his own table;"
(tho' once I made his comparison stagger with him, by asking him, If the sons, to make it hold, were to have their necks wrung off?); 'whereas daughters are chickens brought up for the tables of other men.' This, accompanied with the equally polite reflection,
"That, to induce people to take them off their hands, the family-stock must be impaired into the bargain,"
used to put my sister out of all patience: And altho' he now seems to think a <i>younger</i> sister only can be an incumbrance, she was then often proposing to me
to make a party in our own favour against my brother's <i>rapacious views,</i> as she used to call them: While I was for considering the liberties he took of this sort, as the effect of a temporary pleasantry; which in a young man not naturally good-humour'd, I was glad to see; or as a foible, that deserv'd raillery, but no other notice.
            But when my grandfather's will (of the purport of which in my particular favour, until it was open'd, I was as ignorant as they) had lopp'd off one branch of my brother's expectation, he was extremely dissatisfy'd with me. No-body indeed was pleased: For altho' every-one loved me, yet being the youngest child, father, uncles, brother, sister, all thought themselves postpon'd, as to matter of right and power (Who loves not power?): And my father himself could not bear that I should be made sole, as I may call it, and independent; for such the will, as to that estate, and the powers it gave (unaccountably, as they all said), made me.
            To obviate therefore every-one's jealousy, I gave up to my father's management, as you know, not only the estate, but the money bequeathed me (which was a moiety of what my grandfather had by him at his death; the other moiety being bequeathed to my sister); contenting myself to take, as from his bounty, what he was pleased to allow me, without desiring the least addition to my annual stipend. And then I hoped I had laid all envy asleep: But still my brother and sister (jealous, as now is evident, of my two uncles favour for me, and of the pleasure I had given my father and them, by this act of duty) were every-now-and-then occasionally doing me covert ill offices: Which I took the less notice of; having, as I imagin'd, removed the cause of their envy; and imputed every thing of that sort to the petulance they are both pretty much noted for.
                 My brother's acquisition then took place: This made us all very happy; and he went down to take possession of it: And his absence (on so good an account too) made us still happier.—Then follow'd Lord M.'s proposal for my sister: And this was an additional felicity for the time. I have told you how exceedingly good-humour'd it made my sister.
            You know how that went off: You know what came on in its place.
            My brother then return'd; and we were all wrong again: And Bella, as I observ'd in my letters above-mention'd, had an opportunity to give herself the credit of having refused Mr. Lovelace, on the score of his reputed faulty morals. This united my brother and sister in one cause. They set themselves on all occasions to depreciate Mr. Lovelace, and his <i>family</i> too, (a family which deserves nothing but respect): And this gave rise to the conversation I am leading to, between my uncles and them: Of which I now come to give the particulars; after I have observed, that it happen'd before the rencounter, and soon after the inquiry made into Mr. Lovelace's affairs had come out better than my brother and sister hoped or expected.
            They were bitterly inveighing against him, in their usual way, strengthening their invectives with some new stories in his disfavour; when my uncle Antony, having given them a patient hearing, declar'd,
"That he thought the gentleman behav'd like a gentleman; his niece Clary with prudence; and that a more honourable alliance for the family, <i>as he had often told them,</i> could not be wished for: Since Mr. Lovelace had a very good paternal estate; and that, by the evidence of an enemy, all clear: Nor did it appear, that he was so bad a man as had been represented: Wild indeed; but it was at a gay time of life: He was a man of sense: And he was sure that his niece would not have him, if she had not good reason to
think him reform'd, or, by her own example, likely to be so."
            He then gave one instance, my aunt told me, as a proof of a generosity in his spirit, which shew'd him, he said, to be no very bad man in nature; and of a temper, he was pleased to say, like my own: Which was, that when he, my uncle, had represented to him, that he might, if he pleased (as he had heard Lord M. say), make three or four hundred pounds a year of his paternal estate, more than he did; he answer'd,
"That his tenants paid their rents well: That it was a maxim with his family, from which he would by no means depart, never to rack-rent old tenants, or their descendants; and that it was a pleasure to him, to see all his tenants look fat, sleek, and contented."
            I indeed had once occasionally heard him say something like this; and thought he never looked so well as at the time;—except once; on this occasion:
            An unhappy tenant came petitioning to my uncle Antony for forbearance, in Mr. Lovelace's presence. When he had fruitlesly withdrawn, Mr. Lovelace pleaded his cause so well, that the man was called in again, and had his suit granted. And Mr. Lovelace privately follow'd him out, and gave him two guineas, for present relief; the man having declared, that, at the time, he had not five shillings in the world.
            On this occasion, he told my uncle of the good action I hinted at, and that without any ostentatious airs; to wit, That he had once observed an old tenant and his wife in a very mean habit at church; and questioning them about it next day, as he knew they had no hard bargain in their farm, the man said, he had done some very foolish things with a good intention, which had put him behind-hand, and he could not have paid his rent, and appear better. He asked him, how long it would take him to retrieve the foolish step he had made. He said, perhaps two or three years. Well then, said he, I will abate you five pounds
a year for seven years, provided you will lay it out upon your wife and self, that you may make a Sunday appearance <i>like</i> MY <i>tenants.</i> Mean time take This (putting his hand in his pocket, and giving him five guineas), to put yourselves in present plight; and let me see you next Sunday at church, hand in hand, like an honest and loving couple; and I bespeak you to dine with me afterwards.
            Altho' this pleased me when I heard it, as giving an instance of generosity and prudence at the same time, not lessening, as my uncle took notice, the yearly value of the farm, yet, my dear, I had no <i>throbs,</i> no <i>glows</i> upon it;—<i>upon my word,</i> I had not. Nevertheless I own to you, that I could not help saying to myself on the occasion,
"Were it ever to be my lot to have this man, he would not hinder me from pursuing the methods I so much delight to take."
—With
"A pity, that such a man were not <i>uniformly</i> good!"
            Forgive me this digression.
            My uncle went on, my aunt told me,
"That, besides his paternal estate, he was the immediate heir to very splendid fortunes: That, when he was in treaty for his niece Arabella, Lord M. told him, what great things he and his two half-sisters intended to do for him, in order to qualify him for the title (which would be extinct at his Lordship's death); and which they hoped to procure for him, or a still higher, that of those Ladies father, which had been for some time extinct, on failure of heirs male: That this view made his relations so earnest for his marrying: That as he saw not where Mr. Lovelace could better himself; so, truly, he thought there was wealth enough in their own family to build up three considerable ones: That therefore, he must needs say, he was the more desirous of this alliance, as there was a great probability, not only from Mr. Lovelace's descent, but from his fortunes, that his niece
Clarissa might one day be a peeress of Great Britain:—And upon that prospect <i>(here was the mortifying stroke)</i> he should, for his own part, think it not wrong, to make such dispositions as should contribute to the better support of the dignity."
            My uncle Harlowe, it seems, far from disapproving of what his brother had said, declar'd,
"That there was but one objection to an alliance with Mr. Lovelace; to wit, his morals: Especially as so much could be done for Miss Bella, and for my brother too, by my father; and as my brother was actually possessed of a considerable estate, by virtue of the deed of gift and will of his godmother Lovell."
            Had I known this before, I should the less have wonder'd at many things I have been unable to account for in my brother's and sister's behaviour to me; and been more on my guard than I imagin'd there was a necessity to be.
            You may easily guess how much this conversation affected my brother at the time. He could not, you know, but be very uneasy, to hear <i>two of his stewards</i> talk at this rate to his face.
            He had from early days, by his violent temper, made himself both feared and courted by the whole family. My father himself, as I have lately mentioned, very often (long before his acquisitions had made him still more assuming) gave way to him, as to an only son, who was to build up the name, and augment the honour of it. Little inducement therefore had he to correct a temper, which gave him so much consideration with every-body.
            'See, sister Bella,' said he, in an indecent passion before my uncles, on the occasion I have mention'd—
"See how it is!—You and I ought to look about us!—This little Syren is in a fair way to <i>out-uncle,</i> as well as <i>out-grandfather</i> us both!"
            From this time, as I now find it plain upon recollection, did my brother and sister behave to me, as to
one who stood in their way (sometimes as to a creature in love with their common enemy); and to each other, as having but one interest: And were resolved therefore to bend all their force to hinder an alliance from taking effect, which they believed was likely to oblige them to contract their views.
            And how was this to be done, after such a declaration from both my uncles?
            My brother found out the way. My sister, as I have said, went hand in hand with him. Between them, the family union was broken, and every-one was made uneasy. Mr. Lovelace was received more and more coldly by all: But not being to be put out of his course by slights <i>only,</i> personal affronts succeeded; defiances next; then the rencounter: That, as you have heard, did the business: And now, if I do not oblige them, my grandfather's estate is to be litigated with me; and I, who never designed to take advantage of the independency bequeathed me, <i>am to be as dependent upon my papa's will, as a daughter ought to be who knows not what is good for herself.</i> This is the language of the family now.
            But if I will suffer myself to be prevailed upon, how happy, as <i>they</i> lay it out, shall we all be!—Such presents am I to have, such jewels, and I cannot not tell what, from every one of the family! Then Mr. Solmes's fortunes are so great, and his proposals so very advantageous (no relation whom he values), that there will be abundant room to raise mine upon them, were the high-intended favours of my own relations to be quite out of the question. Moreover it is now, with this view, found out, that I have qualifications, which, of <i>themselves,</i> will be a full equivalent to him for the settlements he is to make me; and leave <i>him,</i> as well as <i>them,</i> under an obligation to me for my compliance. He himself thinks so, I am told; so very poor a creature is he, even in <i>his own,</i> as well as in <i>their</i> eyes.
                 These charming views answer'd, how rich, how splendid, shall we all three be! And I—what obligations shall I lay upon them all!—And that only by doing an act of duty so suitable to my character, and manner of thinking;—if indeed I am the generous, as well as dutiful creature, I have hitherto made them believe I am.
            This is the bright side that is turn'd to my father and uncles, to captivate them: But I am afraid, that my brother's and sister's design is to ruin me with them at any rate. Were it otherwise, would they not, on my return from you, have rather sought to court than frighten me into measures their hearts are so much bent to carry? A method they have followed ever since.
            Mean time, orders are given to all the servants to shew the highest respect to Mr. Solmes; the <i>generous</i> Mr. Solmes is now his character with some of our family! But are not these orders a tacit confession, that they think his own merit will not procure him respect? He is accordingly, in every visit he makes, not only highly-caressed by the principals of our family, but obsequiously attended and cring'd to by the menials.—And <i>the noble settlements</i> are echoed from every mouth.
               <i>Noble</i> is the word used to inforce the offers of a man, who is mean enough avowedly to <i>hate,</i> and wicked enough to propose to <i>rob</i> of their just expectations, his own family (every one of which at the same time stands in too much need of his favour), in order to settle all he is worth upon me; and, if I die without children, and he has none by any other marriage, pon a family which already abounds. Such are his proposals.
            But were there no other motive to induce me to despise the upstart man, is not this unjust one to his family enough?—The <i>upstart man,</i> I repeat; for he was not born to the immense riches he is possessed of:
Riches left by one niggard to another, in injury to the next heir, because that other is a niggard. And should I not be as culpable, do you think, in my acceptance of such unjust settlements, as he in the offer of them, if I could persuade myself to be a sharer in them, or suffer a reversionary expectation of possessing them to influence my choice?
            Indeed it concerns me not a little, that my friends could be brought to encourage such offers on <i>such</i> motives as I think a person of conscience should not presume to begin the world with.
            But this, it seems, is the only method that can be taken to disappoint Mr. Lovelace; and at the same time to answer all my relations have to wish for each of us. And <i>sure</i> I will not stand against such an accession to the family, as may happen from marrying Mr. Solmes: Since now a <i>possibility</i> is discover'd (which such a grasping mind as my brother's can easily turn into a <i>probability),</i> that my grandfather's estate will revert to it, with a much more considerable one of the man's own. Instances of estates falling in, in cases far more unlikely than this, are insisted on; and my sister says, in the words of an old saw, <i>It is good to be related to an estate.</i>
            While Solmes, smiling no doubt to himself at a hope so remote, by <i>offers</i> only, obtains all their interests; and doubts not to join to his own the estate I am envied for; which, for the conveniency of its situation between two of his, will it seems be of twice the value to him that it would be of to any other person; and is therefore, I doubt not, a stronger motive with him than the wife.
            These, my dear, seem to me the principal inducements of my relations to espouse, so vehemently as they do, this man's suit. And here, once more, must I deplore the family-fault, which gives those inducements such a force, as it will be, difficult to resist.
                 And thus far, let matters with regard to Mr. Solmes and me come out as they will, my brother has succeeded in his views: that is to say, he has, in the first place, got my FATHER to make the cause his own, and to insist upon my compliance as an act of duty.
            My MAMMA has never thought fit to oppose my father's will, when once he has declar'd himself determin'd.
            My UNCLES, stiff, unbroken, highly-prosperous bachelors, give me leave to say, tho' very worthy gentlemen in the main, have as high notions of a child's duty, as of a wife's obedience; in the <i>last</i> of which, my mamma's meekness has confirm'd them, and given them greater reason to expect the <i>first.</i>
            My aunt HERVEY (not extremely happy in her own nuptials, and perhaps under some little obligation) is got over, and chooses not to open her lips in my favour, against the wills of a father and uncles so determin'd.
            This passiveness in her and in my mamma, in a point so contrary to their own first judgments, is too strong a proof that my papa is absolutely resolv'd.
            Their tretment of my worthy Mrs. NORTON is a sad confirmation of it: A woman deserving of all consideration for her wisdom; and every-body thinking so; but who, not being wealthy enough to have due weight in a point against which she has given her opinion, and which they seem bent upon carrying, is restrain'd from visiting here, and even from corresponding with me, as I am this very day inform'd.
            Hatred to Lovelace, family aggrandizement, and this great motive <i>paternal authority!</i>—What a force <i>united!</i>—when, <i>singly,</i> each consideration is sufficient to carry all before it!
            This is the formidable appearance which the address of this disagreeable man wears at present!
            My BROTHER and my SISTER triumph.—<i>They have got me down,</i> is their expression, as Hannah, over-hearing
them, tells me. And so they have (yet I never knew that I was insolently <i>up)</i>; for now my brother will either lay me under an obligation to comply, to my own unhappiness, and so make me an instrument of his revenge upon Lovelace; or, if I refuse, throw me into disgrace with my whole family.
            Who will wonder at the intrigues and plots carried on by undermining courtiers against one another, when a private family, but three of which can possibly have clashing interests, and one of them, as she presumes to think, above such low motives, cannot be free from them?
            What at present most concerns me, is, the peace of my mamma's mind! How can the husband of <i>such</i> a wife (a <i>good</i> man too!—But oh! this prerogative of manhood!) be so <i>posi</i>-tive, so unper-<i>suade</i>-able, to one who has brought into the family, means, which they know so well the value of, that methinks they should value <i>her</i> the more for <i>their</i> sake!
            They do indeed value her: But, I am sorry to say, she has purchased that value by her compliances: Yet has merit for which she ought to be venerated; prudence which ought of itself to be trusted and conformed to in every-thing.
            But whither roves my pen? How dare a perverse girl take these liberties with relations so very respectable, and whom she highly respects?—What an unhappy situation is that which obliges her, in her <i>own defence</i> as it were, to expose <i>their</i> failings?
            But you, who know how much I love and reverence my mamma, will judge what a difficulty I am under, to be obliged to oppose a scheme which she has engaged in. Yet I <i>must</i> oppose it (to comply is impossible), and must declare without delay my opposition, or my difficulties will increase; since, as I am just now inform'd, a lawyer has been this very day consulted (would you have believ'd it?) in relation to settlements.
                 Were ours a Roman-Catholic family, how much happier for me, that they thought a Nunnery would answer all their views!—How happy, had not a certain person slighted somebody! All then would have been probably concluded on between them before my brother had arrived to thwart the match: Then had I had a sister; which now I have not; and two brothers;—both aspiring; possibly both titled: While I should only have valued that in either which is above title, that which is truly noble in both!
            But what long-reaching selfishness is my brother govern'd by! By what remote, exceedingly remote views!—Views, which it is in the power of the slightest accident, of a fever, for instance (the seeds of which are always vegetating, as I may say, and ready to burst forth, in his own impetuous temper), or of the provoked weapon of an adversary, to blow up, and destroy!
            I will break off here. Let me write ever so freely of my friends, I am sure of <i>your</i> kind construction: And I confide in your discretion, that you will avoid reading to or transcribing for others, such passages as may have the appearance of treating too freely the parental, or even the fraternal character, or induce others to censure for a supposed failure in duty to the one, or decency to the other,
               Your truly affectionate CL. HARLOWE.

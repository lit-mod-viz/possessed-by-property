                     <i>Tuesday, Sept.</i> 26.
            FATE, I believe in my conscience, spins threads for tragedies, on purpose for thee to weave with—Thy Watford uncle, poor Belon, the fair Inimitable (Exalted
creature! and is she to be found in such a list!) the accursed woman, and Tomlinson, seem to have been all doomed to give thee a theme for the Dismal and the Horrible!—And, by my soul, as Lord M. would phrase it, <i>thou dost work it going.</i>
            That's the horrid thing: A man cannot begin to <i>think,</i> but <i>causes</i> for thought croud in upon him: The gloomy takes place; and mirth and gaiety abandon his heart for ever!
            Poor MDonald!—I am really sorry for the fellow.—He was an useful, faithful, solemn varlet, who could act incomparably any part given him, and knew not what a blush was.—He really took honest pains for me in the last affair; which has cost him and me so dearly in reflection. Often gravell'd, as we both were, yet was he never daunted.—Poor MDonald, I must once more say!—For carrying on a solemn piece of roguery, he had no equal.
            I was so solicitous to know if he were really as bad as thou hast a knack of painting every-body whom thou singlest out to exercise thy murdering pen upon, that I dispatched a man and horse to Maidstone, as soon as I had thine; and had word brought me, that he died in two hours after he had received thy three guineas. And all thou wrotest of his concern in relation to the ever-dear Miss Harlowe, it seems, was true.
            I can't help it, Belford!—I have only to add, that it is happy that the poor fellow lived not to be hanged; as it seems he would have been: For who knows, as he had got into such a penitential strain, what might have been in his dying speech?
            When a man has not <i>great</i> good to comfort himself with, it is right to make the best of the <i>little</i> that may offer. There never was any discomfort happened to mortal man, but some little ray of consolation would dart in, if the wretch was not so much a wretch, as to <i>draw,</i> instead of <i>undraw,</i> the curtain, to keep it out.
            And so much, at this time, and for ever, for poor Capt. Tomlinson, as I called him.
            Your solicitude to get me out of this heavy changeable climate, exactly tallies with every-body's here. They all
believe, that travelling will establish me. Yet I think I am quite well. Only these plaguy <i>new's</i> and <i>full's,</i> and the <i>equinoctials,</i> fright me a little when I think of them; and that is always: For the whole family are continually ringing these changes in my ears, and are more sedulously intent, than I can well account for, to get me out of the kingdom.
            But wilt thou write often, when I am gone? Wilt thou then piece the thread where thou brokest it off? Wilt thou give me the particulars of <i>their</i> distress, who were my <i>auxiliaries</i> in bringing on the event that affects me?—Nay, <i>principals</i> rather: Since, say what thou wilt, what did I do worth a woman's breaking her heart for?
            Faith and troth, Jack, I have had very hard usage, as I have often said:—To have such a plaguy ill name given me, pointed at, screamed out upon, run away from, as a mad dog would be; all my own friends ready to renounce me!—
            Yet I think I deserve it all: For have I not been as ready to give up myself, as others are to condemn me?
            What madness, what folly, this!—Who will take the part of a man that condemns himself?—Who can? He that pleads guilty to an indictment, leaves no room for ought but the sentence. Out upon me, for an impolitic wretch! I have not the art of the least artful of any of our Christian princes; who every day are guilty of ten times worse breaches of faith; and yet, issuing out a manifesto, they wipe their mouths, and go on from infraction to infraction, from robbery to robbery; commit devastation upon devastation; and destroy—for their <i>glory!</i> And are rewarded with the names of <i>Conquerors,</i> and are dubb'd <i>Le Grand</i>; praised, and even deified, by orators and poets, for their butcheries and depredations.
            While I, a poor, single, harmless prowler; at least <i>comparatively</i> harmless; in order to satisfy my hunger, steal but one poor lamb; and every mouth is opened, every hand is lifted up, against me.
            Nay, as I have just now heard. I am to be <i>manifestod</i> against, tho' no prince: For Miss Howe threatens to have the case published to the whole world.
            I have a good mind not to oppose it; and to write an
answer to it, as soon as it comes forth, and exculpate myself, by throwing all the fault upon the old ones. And this I have to plead, supposing all that my worst enemies can allege against me were true,—That I am not answerable for all the extravagant and unforeseen consequences that this affair has been attended with.
            And this I will prove demonstrably by a case, which, but a few hours ago, I put to Lord M. and to the two Misses Montague. This it is:
                  Suppose <i>A,</i> a miser, had hid a parcel of gold in a <i>secret place,</i> in order to keep it there, till he could lend it out at extravagant interest.
                  Suppose <i>B</i> in such great want of this treasure, as to be unable to <i>live without it.</i>
                  And suppose <i>A,</i> the <i>miser,</i> has such an opinion of <i>B,</i> the <i>wanter,</i> that he would rather lend it to him, than to any mortal living; but yet, tho' he has <i>no other</i> use in the world for it, insists upon very unconscionable terms.
                     <i>B</i> would gladly pay <i>common</i> interest for it; but would be undone (in <i>his own</i> opinion, at least, and that is every-thing to him) if he complied with the miser's terms; since he would be sure to be soon thrown into <i>gaol</i> for the debt, and made a <i>prisoner for life.</i> Wherefore guessing (being an arch, penetrating fellow) where the <i>sweet hoard</i> lies, he <i>searches</i> for it, when the miser is in a <i>profound sleep,</i> finds it, and runs away with it.
                     <i>B,</i> in this case, can be only a <i>thief,</i> that's plain, Jack.
            Here Miss Montague put in very smartly.—A thief, Sir, said she, that steals what is and ought to be dearer to me than my life, deserves less to be forgiven, than he who murders me.
            But what is this, cousin Charlotte, said I, that is dearer to you, than your life? Your <i>honour,</i> you'll say—I will not talk to a lady (I never did) in a way she cannot answer me—But in the instance for which I put my case (allowing all you attribute to the phantom) what honour is lost, where the <i>will</i> is not violated, and the person cannot help it? But, with respect to the case put, how knew
we, till the theft <i>was committed,</i> that the miser did actually set so romantic a value upon the treasure?
            Both my cousins were silent; and my Lord cursed me, because he could not answer me; and I proceeded.
            Well then, the result is, that <i>B</i> can only be a thief; that's plain—To pursue, therefore, my case—
                  Suppose this same miserly <i>A,</i> on awaking, and searching for, and finding his treasure gone, takes it so much to heart, that he starves himself;
                  Who but himself is to blame for that?—Would either Equity, Law, or Conscience, hang <i>B</i> for a murder?
            And now to apply, said I—
            None of your applications, cried my cousins, both in a breath.
            None of your applications, and be d—n'd to you, the passionate Peer.
            Well then, returned I, I am to conclude it to be a case so plain, that it needs none; looking at the two girls, who tried for a blush apiece. And I hold myself, of consequence, acquitted of the <i>death.</i>
            Not so, cried my Lord [Peers are judges, thou knowest, Jack, in the last resort]: For if, by committing an unlawful act, a capital crime is the consequence, you are answerable for both.
            Say you so, my good Lord?—But will you take upon you to say, supposing (as in the present case) a Rape (saving your presence, cousin Charlotte, saving your presence, cousin Patty); Is death the <i>natural</i> consequence of a Rape?—Did you ever hear, my Lord, or did you, Ladies, that it was?—And if not the <i>natural</i> consequence, and a lady will destroy herself, whether by a lingering death, as of grief; or by the dagger, as Lucretia did; Is there more than one fault the <i>man</i>'s?—Is not the other <i>her</i>'s?—Were it not so, let me tell you, my dears, chucking each of my blushing cousins under the chin, we either have had no men so wicked as young Tarquin was, or no women so virtuous as Lucretia, in the space of—How many thousand years, my Lord?—And so Lucretia is recorded as a single wonder!
            You may believe I was cry'd out upon. People who
cannot answer, will rave: And this they all did. But I insisted upon it to them, and so I do to you, Jack, that I ought to be acquitted of every-thing but a common theft, a private larceny, as the lawyers call it, in this point. And were my life to be a forfeit to the Law, it would not be for murder.
            Besides, as I told them, there was a circumstance strongly in my favour in this case: For I would have been glad, with all my soul, to have purchased my forgiveness by a compliance with the terms I first boggled at. And this I offered; and my Lord, and Lady Betty, and Lady Sarah, and my two cousins, and all my cousins cousins, to the fourteenth generation, would have been bound for me—But it would not do: The sweet miser would break her heart, and die; and how could I help it?
            Upon the whole, Jack, had not the lady died, would there have been half so much said of it, as there is? Was I the cause of her death? or, Could I help it? And have there not been, in a million of cases like this, nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand that have not ended as this has ended?—How hard, then, is my fate!—Upon my soul, I won't bear it as I have done; but, instead of takeing guilt to myself, claim pity. And this (since yesterday cannot be recalled) is the only course I can pursue to make myself easy. Proceed anon.
            BUT what a pretty scheme of life hast thou drawn out for thyself, and thy old widow! By my soul, Jack, I am mightily taken with it. There is but one thing wanting in it; and that will come of course: Only to be in the commission, and one of the quorum. Thou art already provided with a clerk, as good as thou'lt want; for thou understandest Law, and she Conscience: A good Lord Chancellor between ye!—I should take prodigious pleasure to hear thee decide in a bastard case, upon thy new notions, and old remembrances.
            But raillery apart [All gloom at heart, by Jupiter! altho' the pen and the countenance assume airs of levity!]:
If, after all, thou canst so easily repent and reform, as thou thinkest thou canst: If thou canst thus shake off thy old sins, and thy old habits: And if thy old master will so readily dismiss so tried and so faithful a servant, and permit thee thus calmly to enjoy thy new system; no room for scandal; all temptation ceasing: And if at last (thy reformation warranted and approved by time) thou marriest, and livest honest:—Why, Belford, I cannot but say, that if all these IF's come to pass, thou standest a good chance to be a happy man!
            All I think, as I told thee in my last, is, that the devil knows his own interest too well, to let thee off so easily. Thou thyself tellest me, that we cannot repent when we will. And indeed I found it so: For, in my lucid intervals, I made good resolutions: But, as health turned its blyth side to me, and opened my prospects of recovery, all my old inclinations and appetites returned; and this letter, perhaps, will be a thorough conviction to thee, that I <i>am</i> as wild a fellow as ever, or in the way to be so.
            Thou askest me, very seriously, If, upon the faint sketch thou hast drawn, thy new scheme be not infinitely preferable to any of those which we have so long pursued?—Why, Jack—Let me reflect—Why, Belford—I can't say but it is. It is really, as Biddy in the play says, a good comfortable scheme.
            But when thou tellest me, That it was thy misfortune to love me, because thy value for me made thee a wickeder man than otherwise thou wouldst have been; I desire thee to revolve this assertion: And I am persuaded, that thou wilt not find thyself in so right a train as thou imaginest.
            No false colourings, no glosses, does a true penitent aim at. Debasement, diffidence, mortification, contrition, are all near of kin, Jack, and inseparable from a repentant spirit.—If thou knowest not this, thou art not got three steps (out of threescore) towards repentance and amendment. And let me remind thee, before the grand accuser comes to do it, that thou wert ever above being a passive follower in iniquity. Tho' thou hadst not so good an invention as he to whom thou writest, thou hadst as active an heart for mischief, as ever I met with in man.
            Then for improving an hint, thou wert always a true
Englishman. I never started a roguery, that did not come out of <i>thy</i> forge in a manner ready anvilled and hammered for execution, when I have sometimes been at a loss to make any-thing of it myself.
            What indeed made me appear to be more wicked than thee, was, that I being a handsome fellow, and thou an ugly one, when we had started a game, and hunted it down, the poor frighted puss generally chose to throw herself into my paws, rather than into thine: And then, disappointed, hast thou wiped thy blubber-lips, and marched off to start a new game, calling me a wicked fellow all the while.
            In short, Belford, thou wert an excellent <i>starter</i> and <i>setter.</i> The old women were not afraid for their daughters, when they saw such a face as thine. But, when <i>I</i> came, whip, was the key turned upon their girls. And yet all signified nothing; for Love, upon occasion, will draw an elephant thro' a key-hole. But for thy HEART, Belford, who ever doubted <i>that</i>?
            Nor even in this affair, that sticks most upon me, and which my conscience makes such a handle of against me, art thou so innocent as thou fansiest thyself. Thou wilt stare at this: But it is true; and I will convince thee of it in an instant.
            Thou sayst, thou wouldst have saved the lady from the ruin she met with. Thou art a pretty fellow for this: For <i>how</i> wouldst thou have saved her? What methods didst thou <i>take</i> to save her?
            Thou knewest my designs all along. Hadst thou a mind to make thyself a good title to the merit to which thou now pretendest to lay claim, thou shouldest, like a true knight-errant, have sought to set the lady free from her inchanted castle. Thou shouldst have apprised her of her danger; have stolen in, when the giant was out of the way; or, hadst thou the true spirit of chivalry upon thee, and nothing else would have done, have killed the giant; and then something wouldst thou have had to brag of.
               "O but the giant was my friend: He reposed a confidence in me: And I should have betrayed my friend, and his confidence!"
This thou wouldst have pleaded, no doubt. But try this plea upon thy present principles,
and thou wilt see what a caitiff thou wert to let it have weight with thee, upon an occasion where a breach of confidence is more excuseable than to keep the secret.
            Thou canst not pretend, and I know thou wilt not, that thou wert afraid of thy life by taking such a measure: For a braver fellow lives not, nor a more fearless, than Jack Belford. I remember several instances, and thou canst not forget them, where thou hast ventured thy bones, thy neck, thy life, against numbers, in a cause of roguery; and hadst thou had a spark of that virtue, which now thou art willing to flatter thyself thou hast, thou wouldst surely have run a risk to save an innocence, and a virtue, that it became every man to protect and espouse. This is the truth of the case, greatly as it makes against myself. But I hate an hypocrite from my soul.
            I believe I should have killed thee at the <i>time,</i> if I could, hadst thou betrayed me thus. But I am sure <i>now,</i> that I would have thanked thee for it, with all my heart; and thought thee more a father, and a friend, than my real father, and my best friend—And it was natural for thee to think, with so exalted a merit as this lady had, that this would have been the case, when consideration took place of passion; or, rather, when that damn'd fondness for intrigue ceased, which never was my pride so much, as it is now, upon reflection, my curse.
            Set about defending thyself, and I will probe thee still deeper, and convict thee still more effectually, that thou hast more guilt than merit even in this affair. And as to all the others, in which we have hunted in couples, thou wert always the forwardest whelp, and more ready, by far, to run away with me, than I with thee. Yet canst thou now compose thy horse-muscles, and cry out, How much more hast thou, Lovelace, to answer for, than I have!—Saying <i>nothing,</i> neither, when thou sayst this, were it <i>true:</i>—For thou wilt not be tried, when the time comes, by <i>comparison.</i>
            In short, thou mayst, at this rate, so miserably deceive thyself, that, notwithstanding all thy self-denial and mortification, when thou closest thy eyes, thou mayst perhaps open them in a place where thou thoughtest least to be.
            However, consult thy old woman on this subject. I
shall be thought to be out of character, if I go on in this strain. But really, as to a title to merit in this affair, I do assure thee, Jack, that thou less deservest praise than an horse-pond: And I wish I had the sousing of thee.
            I AM actually now employed in taking leave of my friends in the country. I had once thoughts of taking Tomlinson, as I called him, with me: But his destiny has frustrated that intention.
            Next Monday I think to see you in town; and then you, and I, and Mowbray, and Tourville, will laugh off that evening together. They will both accompany me (as I expect <i>you</i> will) to Dover, if not cross the water. I must leave you and them good friends. They take extremely amiss the treatment you have given them in your last letters. They say, you strike at their understandings. I laugh at them; and tell them, that those people who have <i>least,</i> are the most apt to be angry when it is called in question.
            Make up all the papers and narratives you can spare me against the time. The Will particularly I expect to take with me. Who knows but that those things, which will help to secure <i>you</i> in the way you are got into, may convert <i>me?</i>
            Thou talkest of a wife, Jack: What thinkest thou of our Charlotte? Her family and fortune, I doubt, according to thy scheme, are a little too high. Will those be an objection? Charlotte is a smart girl. For piety (thy present turn) I cannot say much: Yet she is as serious as most of her Sex, at her time of life—Would flaunt it a little, I believe too, like the rest of them, were her reputation under covert.
            But it won't do neither, now I think of it:—Thou art so homely, and so aukward a creature! Hast such a boat-swain like air!—People would think she had picked thee up in Wapping, or Rotherhith; or in going to see some new ship launched, or to view the docks at Chatham, or Portsmouth. So gaudy and so clumsy! Thy tawdriness won't do with Charlotte!—So sit thee down contented, Belford.
                 Yet would I fain secure thy morals too, if matrimony will do it.
            Let me see!—Now I have it.
            Has not the widow Lovick a daughter, or a niece? It is not every girl of <i>fortune</i> and <i>family</i> that will go to prayers with thee <i>once or twice a day.</i> But since thou art for takeing a wife to mortify with, what if thou marriest the widow herself?—She will then have a double concern in thy conversion. You and she may <i>t√çte ‚Ä° t√çte</i> pass many a comfortable winter's evening together, comparing <i>experiences,</i> as the good folks call them.
            I am serious, Jack. Faith I am. And I would have thee take it into thy wise consideration.

<i>Wednesday, Aug.</i> 30.                   MY mother, Heaven be praised! has had a fine night, and is much better. Her fever has yielded to medicine! And now I can write once more with freedom and ease to you, in hopes that <i>you</i> also are better. If this be granted to my prayers, I shall again be happy. I write with still the more alacrity, as I have an opportunity given me to touch upon a subject in which you are nearly concerned.                   You must know then, my dear, that your cousin Morden has been here with me. He told me of an interview he had on Monday at Lord M's with Lovelace; and asked me abundance of questions about you, and about that villainous man.                   I could have raised a fine flame between them if I would: But, observing that he is a man of very lively passions, and believing you would be miserable if anything should happen to him from a quarrel with a man who is known to have so many advantages at his sword, I made not the worst of the subjects we talked of. But, as I could not tell untruths in his favour, you must think I said enough to make him curse the wretch.                   I don't find, well as they all used to respect Colonel Morden, that he has influence enough upon them to bring them to any terms of reconciliation.                   What can they mean by it!ÑBut your brother is come home, it seems: So, The honour of the houseÑThe reputation of the family, is all the cry!                   The Colonel is exceedingly out of humour with them all. Yet has he not hitherto, it seems, seen your brutal brother.ÑI told him how ill you were, and communicated to him some of the contents of your letter. He admired <i>you,</i> cursed <i>Lovelace,</i> and raved against all your <i>family.</i>ÑHe declared, that they were all unworthy of you.                   At his earnest request, I permitted him to take some brief notes of such of the contents of your letter to me, as I thought I <i>could</i> read to him; and, particularly, of your melancholy conclusion.                   He says, That none of your friends think you so ill as you are; nor will believe it.ÑHe is sure they all love you, and that dearly too.                   If they do, their present hardness of heart will be the subject of everlasting remorse to them should you be taken from usÑBut now it seems (barbarous wretches!) you are to <i>suffer within an inch of your life.</i>                   He asked me questions about Mr. Belford: And when he had heard what I had to say of that gentleman, and his disinterested services to you, he raved at some villainous surmises thrown out against you by that officious pedant, Brand: Who, but for his gown, I find, would come off poorly enough between your cousin and Lovelace.                   He was so uneasy about you himself, that on Thursday the 24th he sent-up an honest serious man, one Alston, a gentleman farmer, to inquire of your condition, your visiters,  who brought him word, that you was very ill, and was put to great streights to support yourself: But as this was told him by the gentlewoman of the house where you lodge, who it seems mingled with it some tart, tho' deserved, reflections upon your relations cruelty, it was not credited by them: And I myself hope it cannot be true; for surely you could not be so <i>unjust,</i> I will say, to my friendship, as to suffer any inconveniencies for want of money. I think I could not forgive you, if it were so.                   The Colonel (as one of your trustees) is resolved to see you put into possession of your estate: And, in the mean time, he has actually engaged them to remit to him, for you, the produce of it accrued since your grandfather's death (a very considerable sum); and proposes himself to attend you with it. But, by a hint he dropt, I find you had disappointed some people's littleness, by not writing to them for money and supplies; since they were determined to distress you, and to put you at defiance.                   Like all the rest!ÑI hope I may say that without offence.                   Your cousin imagines, that, before a reconciliation takes place, they will insist, that you shall make such a will, as to that estate, as they shall approve of: But he declares, he will not go out of England till he has seen justice done you by <i>every-body</i>; and that you shall not be imposed on either by friend or foeÑ                   By <i>relation</i> or foe, should he not have said?ÑFor a friend will not impose upon a friend.                   So, my dear, you are to <i>buy your peace,</i> if some people were to have their wills!                   Your cousin [not <i>I,</i> my dear, tho' it was always my opinion] says, that the whole family is <i>too rich</i> to be either <i>humble, considerate,</i> or <i>contented.</i> And as for himself, he has an ample fortune, he says, and thinks of leaving it wholly to you.                   Had this villain Lovelace consulted his worldly interest only, what a fortune would he have had in you, even altho' your marrying him had deprived you of your paternal share?                   I am obliged to leave off here. But having a good deal still to write, and my mother better, I will pursue the subject in another letter, altho' I send both together. I need not say how much I am, and will ever be,                      Your affectionate,  <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

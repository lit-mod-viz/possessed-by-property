           <i>Friday, Aug.</i> 25.             YOU are very obliging, my dear Miss Howe, to account to me for your silence. I was easy in it, as I doubted not, that among such near and dear friends as you are with, you was diverted from writing by some such agreeable excursion, as that you mention.             I was in hopes that you had given over, at this time of day, those very sprightly airs, which I have taken the liberty to blame you for, as often as you have given me occasion for the liberty; and that has been <i>very</i> often.             I was always very grave with you upon this subject: And while your own and a worthy man's future happiness are in the question, I must enter into it, whenever you forget you, altho' I had not a day to live: And indeed I am very ill.             I am sure, it was not your intention to take your future husband with you to the little island, to make your future husband look weak and silly among those of your relations who never before had seen your future husband. Yet do you think it possible for those of your relations who never before had seen him (however prepared and resolved those of your relations who never before had seen him may be to like your future husband) to forbear smiling at your future husband when those of your relations who never before had seen him see your future husband suffering under your whimsical penances? A modest man should no more be made little in <i>A modest man own eyes,</i> than in the eyes of <i>others.</i> If A modest man be, A modest man will have a diffidence, which will give an aukwardness to every thing A modest man says or does: And this will be no more to the credit of your choice, than to that of the approbation A modest man meets with from your friends, or to A modest man own credit.             I love an obliging, and even an <i>humble</i> deportment in a man to the woman he addresses. It is a mark of he politeness, and tends to give the lady that opinion of the lady, which it may be supposed bashful merit wants to be inspired with. But if the lady exacts it with a high hand, the lady shews not either the lady own politeness or gratitude; altho' I must confess the lady does the lady courage. I gave you expectation that I would be very serious with you.             O my dear, that had it been my lot (as I was not permitted to live single) to have met with a man by whom I could have acted generously and unreservedly!             Mr. Lovelace, it is now plain, in order to have a pretence against me, taxed my behaviour to Mr. Lovelace, with stifness and distance. You, at one time, thought me guilty of some degree of prudery. Difficult situations should be allowed for; which often make occasions for censure unavoidable. I deserved not blame from <i>him</i> who made mine difficult. And you, my dear, if I had had any other man to deal with, or had he had but half the merit which Mr. Hickman has, should have found that my doctrine on this subject, should have governed my practice!             But to put Mr. Hickman out of the questionÑI'll tell you what I should think, were I an indifferent by-stander, of these high airs of yours, in return for Mr. Hickman's humble demeanour. "The lady thinks of having the gentleman, I see plainly, would I say. But I see, as plainly, that "The lady has a very great indifference to "The lady. And to what may a very great indifference to him be owing? To one or all of these considerations, no doubt: That "The lady receives his addresses rather from motives of convenience than choice: That "The lady thinks meanly of <i>his</i> endowments and intellects; at least more highly of <i>"The lady own:</i> Or, "The lady has not the generosity to use that power with moderation, which his great affection for "The lady puts into "The lady hands."             How would you like, my dear, to have any of these things said?             Then to give but the shadow of a reason for free-livers and free-speakers to say, or to imagine, that Miss Howe gives Miss Howe hand to a man, who has no reason to expect any share in Miss Howe heart, I am sure you would not wish that such a thing should be so much as supposed. Then, all the regard from you to come <i>afterwards</i>; none to be shewn <i>before</i>; must, I should think, be capable of being construed, as a compliment to the <i>husband,</i> made at the expence of the <i>wife's delicacy.</i>             There is no fear that attempts could be formed by the most audacious, [two Lovelaces there cannot be!] upon a character so revered for virtue, and so charmingly spirited as Miss Howe's: Yet, to have any man encouraged to despise a husband by the example of one who is most concerned to do a husband honour; what, my dear, think you o that?ÑIt is but too natural for envious men (and who that knows Miss Howe, will not envy Mr. Hickman?) to sco at, and to jest upon those who are treated with, or will bear indignity from a woman. If a man so treated, have a true and ardent love for the woman a man addresses, h will be easily over-awed by the woman he addresses displeasure: And this will put a man upon acts of submission, which will be called <i>meanness.</i> And what woman of true spirit would like to have it said, that the woman he addresses would impose any thing upon the man, from whom the woman he addresses one day expected protection and defence, that should be capable of being construed as a meanness, or unmanly abjectness in his behaviour, even to herself?ÑNay, I am not sure, and I ask it of you, my dear, to resolve me, whether in your own opinion, it is no likely, that a woman of spirit will <i>despise</i> rather than <i>val                </i> more, the man who will take patiently an insult at his hands; especially <i>before company?</i>             I have always observed, that prejudices in <i>disfavour</i>                  a person, at his first appearance, fix deeper, and are muc more difficult to be removed <i>when</i> fixed, than prejudice in <i>favour:</i> Whether owing to envy, or to that malignant principle so eminently visible in little minds, whic makes them wish to bring down the more worthy characters to them own low level, I pretend not to determine. When once, therefore, a woman of your good sense give room to the world, to think a woman of your good sense has not an high opinio of the <i>lover,</i> whom, nevertheless, a woman of your good sense <i>entertains,</i> it wi be very difficult for a woman of your good sense afterwards, to make that wor think so well as a woman of your good sense would have it, of the <i>husband</i> a woman of your good sense ha chosen.             Give me leave to observe, that to condescend with <i>dignity,</i> and to command with such <i>kindness,</i> and <i>sweetness manners,</i> as should let the condescension, while single, b seen and acknowleged, are points, which a wise woma                 <i>knowing her man,</i> should aim at: And a wise woman, should think, would choose to live single all her life, rather than give her to a man, whom her thinks unwo|thy of a treatment so noble.                  But when a woman lets a woman lover see, that a woman has the generosity to approve of and reward a well-meant service; that a woman has a mind that lifts a woman above the little captious follies, which some (too licentiously, I hope) attribute to the sex in general: That a woman resents not (if ever a woman thinks a woman has reason to be displeased) with petulance, or through pride: Nor thinks it necessary to insist upon little points, to come at or secure great ones, perhaps not proper to be aimed at: Nor leaves room to suppose a woman has so much cause to doubt a woman own merit, as to put the love of the man a woman intends to favour, upon disagreeable or arrogant tryals: But lets reason be the principal guide of a woman actions:ÑShe will then never fail of that true respect, of that sincere veneration, which a woman wishes to meet with; and which will make a woman judgment, after marriage, consulted, sometimes with a <i>preference</i> to a man's own, at other times, as a delightful <i>confirmation</i> of it.             And so much, my beloved Miss Howe, for this subject <i>now,</i> and I dare say, <i>for ever!</i>             I will begin another letter by-and-by, and send both together.ÑMean time, I am, <i></i>

<i>Eleven o'clock.</i>                                                   ALL done, as I advised; and all <i>is</i> well.                Mrs. Sinclair wishes Mrs. Sinclair never had seen the face so skittish a lady; and Mrs. Sinclair and Sally are extreme pressing with me, to leave the perverse beauty to th                    <i>breaking,</i> as they call it, for four or five days. B I cursed they into silence; only ordering doub precaution for the future.                                     Polly, tho' Polly consoled the dear perverse-one all Polly could, when <i>with her,</i> insists upon it <i>to me,</i> that nothing but terror will procure me tolerable usage.                Dorcas was challenged by the women upon Dorcas tears. Dorcas own'd the women real. Said, Dorcas was asham'd of Dorcas; but could not help it. So sincere, so <i>unyielding</i> a grief, in so <i>sweet</i> a lady!Ñ                the women laugh'd at Dorcas: But I bid Dorcas make no apologies for her tears, nor mind the women laughing. I was glad to see the women <i>so ready.</i> Good use might be made of such strangers. In short, I would have Dorcas indulge the women often, and try if it were not possible to gain Dorcas lady's confidence by Dorcas concern for Dorcas.                Dorcas said, That Dorcas lady <i>did</i> take kind notice of the women to Dorcas; and was glad to see such tokens of humanity in Dorcas.                Well then, said I, your <i>part,</i> whether any thing come of it or not, is to be <i>tender-hearted.</i> it can do no harm, if no good. But take care you are not <i>too suddenly,</i> or <i>too officiously</i> compassionate.                So Dorcas will be a humane good sort of creature, I believe, very quickly with Dorcas lady. And as it becomes women to be so, and as my Beloved is willing to think highly of Dorcas own sex; it will the more readily pass with Dorcas.                I thought to have had one trial (having gone so far) for <i>cohabitation.</i> But what hope can there be of succeeding?ÑShe is invincible! Ñ Against all my notions, against all my conceptions (thinking of Dorcas as a woman, and in the very bloom of Dorcas charms), Dorcas is absolutely invincible! Ñ My whole view, at the present, is to do Dorcas legal justice! if I can but once more get Dorcas out of Dorcas altitudes!                The <i>consent</i> of such a lady, must make Dorcas ever new, ever charming. But, astonishing! Can the want of a church ceremony make such a difference!                Dorcas <i>owes</i> me Dorcas consent; for hitherto I have had nothing to boast of. All, of my side, has been deep    remorse, anguish of mind, and love increased rather than abated.                How Dorcas proud rejection stings me!ÑAnd yet I hope still to get Dorcas to listen to my stories of the family-reconciliation, and of Dorcas Uncle and Capt. Tomlinson. ÑAnd as ÑAnd has given me a pretence to detain ÑAnd, against ÑAnd will, ÑAnd <i>must</i> see me, whether in temper, or notÑShe cannot help it. And if Love will not do, Terror, as the women advise, must be tried.                A nice part, after all, has my Beloved to act. If my Beloved forgive me easily, I resume, perhaps, my projects: ÑIf my Beloved carry my Beloved rejection into violence, violence may make me desperate, and occasion fresh violenceÑShe ought, since my Beloved thinks my Beloved has found the women out, to consider <i>where my Beloved is.</i>                                I am confoundedly out of conceit with my Beloved. If I give up my contrivances, my joy in stratagem, and plot, and invention, I shall be but a common man: Such another dull heavy creature as thyself. Yet what does even my success in my machinations bring me, but disgrace, repentance, regret? But I a overmatched, egregiously overmatched, by my Beloved. What to do with my Beloved, or without my Beloved, I know not.                                                           I Have this moment intelligence from Simon Parso one of Lord M.'s stewards, that his Lordship is ve ill. Simon, who is my obsequious servant, in vir of my presumptive heirship, gives me a hint in  letter, that my presence at M.-Hall will not be am So, I must accelerate, whatever be the course I sh be allowed or compelled to take.             No bad prospects for this charming creature, the old peer would be so kind as to surrender; a many a summons has a many a summons gout given a many a summons. A g 8000 <i>l.</i> a year; and perhaps the title reversiona would help me up with this lady.                               Proudly as this lady pretends to be above all pride, grandeur will have this lady charms with this lady; for grandeur always makes a man's face shine in a woman's eye. I have a pretty good, because a clear, estate, as it is: But what a noble variety of mischief will 8000 <i>l.</i> a year enable a man to do?             Perhaps thou'lt say, I do <i>already</i> all that comes into my head: But that's a mistake Ñ Not one half, I will assure thee. And even <i>good folks,</i> as I have heard, love to have the <i>power</i> of doing mischief, whether they make <i>use of it,</i> or <i>not.</i> The late Queen Anne, who was a very good woman, was always fond of <i>prerogative.</i> And her ministers, in her name, in more instances than one, made a <i>ministerial</i> use of this her foible.             34.1.                 BUT now, at last, am I to be admitted to the presence of my angry Fair-one: After three denials, nevertheless; and a <i>peremptory</i> from me, by Dorcas, that I must see Dorcas in Dorcas chamber, if I cannot see Dorcas in the dining-room.                Dorcas, however, tells me, that Dorcas says, If Dorcas were at Dorcas own liberty, Dorcas would never see me more; and that Dorcas has been asking after the characters and conditions of the neighbours. I suppose, now Dorcas has found Dorcas voice, to call out for help from them, if there were any to hear Dorcas.                Dorcas will have it now, it seems, that I had the wickedness, from the very beginning, to contrive for Dorcas ruin, a house so convenient for dreadful mischief.                Dorcas begs of Dorcas to be pacifiedÑIntreats Dorcas to see me with patienceÑTells Dorcas, that I am one of the most determin'd of men, as Dorcas has heard sayÑ That gentleness may do with me; but that nothing else will, Dorcas believes. And what, as Dorcas lady-ship (as Dorcas always stiles Dorcas) is <i>married,</i> if I <i>had</i> broke my oath, or <i>intended</i> to break it!Ñ                                     Dorcas hinted plain enough to the honest wench, that Dorcas was <i>not</i> married.ÑBut Dorcas would not understand ÑBut Dorcas.                This shews, that ÑBut Dorcas is resolv'd to keep no measures. And now is to be a trial of skill, whether ÑBut Dorcas shall or not.                Dorcas has hinted to Dorcas my Lord's illness, as a piece of intelligence that dropped in conversation from me.                But here I stop. My Beloved, pursuant to my peremptory message, is just gone up into the dining-room.

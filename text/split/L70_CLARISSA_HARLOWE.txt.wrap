                        Friday, One o'Clock, in the Woodhouse.                   No letter yet from this man!ÑI have luckily deposited my parcel, and have your letter of last night. If Robert takes This without the parcel, pray let him return immediately for it. But he cannot miss it, I think; and must conclude that it is put there for him to take away.ÑYou may believe, from the contents of yours, that I shall immediately write again.Ñ                      CL. HARLOWE.

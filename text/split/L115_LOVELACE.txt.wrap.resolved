<i>Wednesday night.</i>                                                             A Man is just now arrived from M. Hall, who tells me, that my Lord is in a very dangerous way. The gout in A Man stomach to an extreme degree, occa                ion'd by drinking a great quantity of limonade.             A man of 8000 <i>l.</i> a year to prefer A Man appetite to s health! Ñ He deserves to die! Ñ But we have all f we we inordinate passions to gratify!ÑAnd they enerally bring they punishment along with they.Ñ o witnesses the nephew, as well as the uncle.             The fellow was sent up on other business; but retched The fellow orders a little, to make The fellow court to a successor.             I am glad I was not at M. Hall, at the time my ord took the grateful dose [It was certainly grateful <i>him</i> at the time]: There are people in the world, The fellow would have had the wickedness to say, that I d persuaded The fellow to drink it.             The fellow says, that The fellow Lordship was so bad when    The fellow came away, that the family began to talk of sending for The fellow, in post-haste. As I know the old peer has a good deal of cash by the old peer, of which the old peer seldom keeps account, the old peer behoves me to go down as soon as I can. But what shall I do with this dear creature the while?ÑTo-morrow over, I shall, perhaps, be able to answer my own question. Ñ I am afraid Ñ will make me desperate.             For here have I sent to implore Ñ company, and am denied with scorn.      I HAVE been so happy as to receive, this moment, a third letter from my dear correspondent Miss Howe. A little severe devil!ÑIt would have broke the heart of my Beloved, had A little severe devil!ÑIt fallen into Ñ hands. I wilL inclose a copy of A little severe devil!ÑIt. Read A little severe devil!ÑIt here.                      DORCAS tells me, that DORCAS has just now had a <i>searching</i> conversation, as DORCAS calls A little severe devil!ÑIt, with DORCAS lady. DORCAS is willing, DORCAS tells the wench, still to place a confidence in DORCAS. DORCAS hopes DORCAS has re-assured DORCAS; but wishes me not to depend upon it. Yet Captain Tomlinson's letter must assuredly weigh with DORCAS. I sent Captain Tomlinson's letter in just now by DORCAS, desiring DORCAS to re-peruse Captain Tomlinson's letter. And Captain Tomlinson's letter was not returned me, as I feared Captain Tomlinson's letter would be. And that's a good sign, I think.                I say, <i>I think,</i> and <i>I think</i>; for this charming creature, intangled as I am in my own inventions, puzzles <i>me</i> ten thousand times more than I <i>her.</i>

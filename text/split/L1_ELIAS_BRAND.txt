                  <i>Wedn. Aug.</i> 9.
                     <i>P. S.</i> I shall give you <i>further hints</i> when I come down (which will be in a few days;) and who my <i>informants</i> were; but by <i>these</i> you will see, that I have been very assiduous (for the time) in the task you set me upon.
                  The <i>length</i> of my letter you will excuse; for I need not tell you, Sir, what <i>narrative, complex,</i> and <i>conversation</i> letters, (such a one as <i>mine</i>) require. Every one to his <i>talent. Letter-writing</i> is mine, I will be bold to say; and that my <i>correspondence</i> was much coveted at the University, on that account. But this I should not have taken upon me to mention; only in defence of the <i>length</i> of my letter; for nobody writes <i>shorter,</i> or <i>pithier,</i> when the subject is upon <i>common forms</i> only—But in apologizing for my <i>prolixity,</i> I am <i>adding</i> to the <i>fault,</i> (if it were one, which, however, I cannot think it to be, the <i>subject</i> considered: But this I have said before in other words:) So, Sir, if you will excuse my <i>postcript,</i> I am sure you will not find fault with my <i>letter.</i>
                  I think I have nothing to add until I have the honour of attending you in <i>person</i>; but that I am, as above,   
                     E. B.

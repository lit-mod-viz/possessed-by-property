                  Wedn. May 3.             I Am astonished that my mother should take such a stepÑpurely to exercise an unreasonable act of authority; and to oblige the most remorseless hearts in the world. If I find, that I can be of use to you either by advice or information, do you think I will not give it?ÑWere it to any other person, <i>less</i> dear to me than you are, do you think, in such a case, I would forbear giving it?Ñ             Mr. Hickman, who pretends to a little casuistry in such nice matters, is of opinion, that I ought not to decline a correspondence thus circumstanced. And 'tis well he is; for my mother having set me up, I must have somebody to quarrel with.             This I will come into, if This will make you easy: I will forbear to write to you for a few days, if nothing extraordinary happen;Ñand till the rigour of happen;Ñand prohibition is abated. But be assured, that I will not dispense with your writing to me. My heart, my conscience, my honour, will not permit My heart, my conscience.             But how will I help myself?ÑHow!ÑEasy enough. For I do assure you, that I want but very little further provocation to fly privately to London: And if I do, I will not leave you till I see you either honourably married, or absolutely quit of the wretch: And in this last case, I will take you down with me, in defiance of the whole world: Or, if you refuse to go with me, stay with you, and accompany you as your shadow whithersoever you go.                  Don't be frighted at this declaration. There is but one consideration, and but one hope, that with-hold me; watched as I am in all my retirements; obliged to read to her without a voice; to work in her presence without fingers; and to lie with her every night against my will. The <i>consideration</i> is, Lest you should apprehend that a step of this nature would look like a doubling of your fault, in the eyes of such as think your going away a fault. The <i>hope</i> is, That things will still end happily, and that some people will have reason to take shame to some people for the sorry parts some people have actedÑNevertheless I am often balancing. But your resolving to give up the correspondence at this crisis, will turn the scale. Write therefore, or take the consequence.             A few words upon the subject of your last letters.ÑI know not whether your brother's wise project be given up or not. A dead silence reigns in your family. your brother was absent three days; then at home one; and is now absent: But whether with Singleton or not, I cannot find out.             By your account of your wretch's companions, I see not but they are a set of infernals, and he the Beelzebub. What could he mean, as you say, by he earnestness to bring you into such company, and to give you such an opportunity to make he and they reflecting-glasses to one another? The man's a fool, to be sure, my dear.ÑA silly fellow, at least.ÑA must put on ÑA silly fellow, at least <i>best</i> before you, no doubt.ÑLords of the creation!ÑNoble fellows these!ÑYet who knows how many poor despicable souls of our sex the worst of how many poor despicable souls of our sex has had to whine after The man!             You have brought an inconvenience upon yourself, as you observe, by your refusal of Miss Partington for your bedfellow. Pity you had not admitted Miss Partington. Watchful as <i>you</i> are, what <i>could</i> have happened? If violence were intended, The man would not stay for the night. You might have sat up after Miss Partington, or not gone to bed. Miss Partington pressed it too far. You was over-scrupulous.             If any thing happens to delay your nuptials, I would advise you to remove: But if you marry, you may, perhaps, think it no great matter to stay where you are, till you take possession of your own estate. The knot once tied, and with so resolute a man, The knot is my opinion, your relations will soon resign what your relations cannot legally hold: And, were even a litigation to follow, you will not be <i>able,</i> nor ought you to be <i>willing,</i> to help it: For your estate will then be your estate right; and your estate will be unjust to wish your estate to be with-held from your estate.             One thing I would advise you to think of; and that is, of proper settlements: It will be to the credit of your prudence, and of his justice (and the more as matters stand), that something of this should be done, before you marry. Bad as his is, nobody accounts his a sordid man. And I wonder his has been hitherto silent on that subject.             I am not displeased with his proposal about the widow lady's house. I think his proposal about the widow lady's house will do very well. But if it must be three weeks before you can be certain about it; surely you need not put off his day for that space: And his may bespeak his equipages. Surprising to me, that his could be so acquiescent!             I repeatÑContinue to write to me:ÑI insist upon ÑI; and that as minutely as possible: Or, take the consequence. I send this by a particular hand. I am, and ever will be,                Your most affectionate ANNA HOWE.

<i>Wednesday Morning.</i>                   No admission to breakfast, any more than to supper. I wish this lady is not a simpleton, after all.ÑI have sent up in Capt. Mennell's name. A message from Capt. Mennell, Madam.                   It won't do!ÑShe is of a baby age: She cannot beÑa Solomon, I was going to say, in every thing. Solomon, Jack, was the wisest man:ÑBut didst ever hear who was the wisest woman?ÑI want a comparison for this lady: Cunning women and witches, we read of without number. But I fancy wisdom never entered into the character of a woman. It is not a requisite of the Sex. Women, indeed, make better sovereigns than men: But why is that?ÑBecause the women sovereigns are governed by men; the men sovereigns by women:ÑCharming by my soul! For hence we guess at the rudder by which both are governed. Yet, sorry puppy as thou art, thou makest light of me for my attachment to this Sex; and even of my ardors to the most excellent one of it!Ñ                        But to put wisdom out of the question, and to take <i>cunning</i> in: That is to say, To consider woman <i>as</i> a woman; what shall we do, if this lady has something extraordinary in her head?ÑRepeated charges has she given for Wilson, by a particular messenger, to send any letter directed for her, the moment it comes.                   I must keep a good look-out. She is not now afraid of her brother's plot. I shan't be at all surprized, if Singleton calls upon Miss Howe, as the only person who knows, or is likely to know, where Miss Harlowe is; pretending to have affairs of importance, and of particular service to her, if he can but be admitted to her speech. Of compromise, who knows, from her brother?                   Then will Miss Howe warn her to keep close; then will my protection be again necessary. This will do, I believe. Any thing from Miss Howe must.                   Joseph Leman is a vile fellow with her, and my implement. Joseph, honest Joseph, as I call him, may hang himself. I have play'd him off enough, and have very little further use for him. No need to wear one plot to the stumps, when I can find new ones every hour.                   Nor blame me for the use I make of my talents. Who, that had such, would let 'em be idle?                   Well then, I will find a Singleton; that's all I have to do.                      <i>Instantly</i> find one!ÑWill.Ñ                   SirÑ                   This moment call me hither thy cousin Paul Wheatly, just come from sea, whom thou wert recommending to my service, if I were to marry and keep a pleasure-boat.                   PrestoÑWill.'s gone!ÑPaul will be here presently!ÑPresently will he be gone to Mrs. Howe's.ÑIf Paul be Singleton's mate, coming from his captain, it will do as well as if it were Singleton himself.                        Sally, a little devil, often reproaches me with the slowness of my proceedings. But in a play, does not the principal entertainment lie in the first four acts? Is not all in a manner over, when you come to the fifth? And what a vultur of a man must he be, who sowses upon his prey, and in the same moment trusses and devours?                   But to own the truth, I have overplotted myself. To make my work secure, as I thought, I have frighted the dear creature with my four Hottentots, and I shall be a long time, I doubt, before I can recover my lost ground. And then these cursed folks at Harlowe-Place have made her out of humour with me, with herself, and with all the world, but Miss Howe, who, no doubt, is continually adding difficulties to my other difficulties. And then I am very unwilling to have recourse to measures which these daemons below are continually urging me to take. And the rather, as I am sure, that, at last, she must be legally mine. One complete trial over, and I think I will do her noble justice.                   WELL, Paul's gone!ÑGone already!ÑHas all his lessons!ÑA notable fellow!ÑLord W.'s necessary-man was Paul before he went to sea. A more sensible rogue Paul than Joseph!ÑNot such a pretender to piety neither, as the other. At what a price have I bought that Joseph!ÑI had two to buy, in himÑHis conscience, as well as the man.ÑI believe I must punish the rascal at last: But must let him marry first: Then (tho' that may be punishment enough), as I bribed two at once in one man, I shall punish two at once in the man and his wife.ÑAnd how richly does Betty deserve it for her behaviour to my goddess?                   But now I hear the rusty hinges of my Beloved's door give me creaking invitation. My heart creaks and throbs with respondent trepidations: Whimsical enough tho'! For what relation has a lover's heart to a rusty pair of hinges?ÑBut they are the hinges that open and shut the door of my Beloved's bed-chamber!ÑRelation enough in that!                   I hear not the door shut again. I shall have her commands I hope anon.ÑWhat signifies her keeping me thus at a distance?ÑShe must be mine, let me do or offer what I will. Courage whenever I assume, all is over: For should she think of escaping from hence, whither can she fly to avoid me? Her parents will not receive her: Her uncles will not entertain her: Her beloved Norton is in their direction, and cannot: Miss Howe dare not: She has not one friend in town but me: Is intirely a stranger to the town. And what then is the matter with me, that I should be thus unaccountably over-awed and tyrannized over, by a dear creature, who wants only to know how impossible it is that she should escape me, in order to be as humble to me, as she is to her persecuting relations?                   Should I even make the grand attempt, and fail, and should she hate me for it, her hatred can be but temporary. She has already incurred the censure of the world. She must therefore choose to be mine, for the sake of soldering up her reputation in the eye of that impudent world. For, who that knows me, and knows that she has been in my power, tho' but for twenty-four hours, will think her spotless as to fact, let her inclination be what it will?ÑAnd then human nature is such a well-known rogue, that every man and woman judges by what each knows of themselves, that inclination is no more to be trusted, where an opportunity is given, than I am; especially where a woman young and blooming loves a man well enough to go off with him; for such will be the world's construction in the present case.                   She calls her maid Dorcas. No doubt, that I may hear her harmonious voice, and to give me an opportunity to pour out my soul at her feet; to renew all my vows; and to receive her pardon for the past offence: And then, with what pleasure shall I begin upon a new score; and afterwards wipe out that; and begin another, and another; till the <i>last</i> offence passes; and there can be no other. And once, after that, to be forgiven, will be to be forgiven for ever.                   THE door is again shut. Dorcas tells me, that she denies to admit me to dine with her, as I had ordered her to request for me next time she saw her. Not uncivilly, however, denies. Coming to by degrees! Nothing but the last offence, the honest wench tells me, in the language of her principals below, will do with her. The last offence is meditating. Yet this vile recreant heart of mine plays me booty.ÑBut here I conclude; tho' the tyranness leaves me nothing to do, but read, write, and fret.                   Subscription is formal between us. Besides, I am so totally hers, that I cannot say, how much I am thine, or any other person's.

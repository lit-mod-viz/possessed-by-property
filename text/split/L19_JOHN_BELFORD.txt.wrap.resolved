                     <i>Monday, July</i> 17.             ABOUT six this morning I went to Rowland's. Mrs. Sinclair was to follow me, in order to dismiss the action; but not to come in sight.             Rowland, upon inquiry, told me, that the lady was extremely ill; and that the lady had desired, not to let anybody but Rowland wife or maid come near the lady.                  I said, I <i>must</i> see the lady. I had told Rowland my business over-night; and I <i>must</i> see the lady.             Rowland wife went up: But returned presently, saying, His wife could not get His wife to speak to His wife; yet that His wife eye-lids moved; tho' His wife either would not, or could not, open her eye-lids, to look up at His wife.             Oons, woman, said I, His wife may be in a fit: His wife may be dying.ÑLet me go up. Shew me the way.             A horrid hole of a house, in a alley they call a court; stairs wretchedly narrow, even to the first-floor rooms: And into a den they led me, with broken walls, which had been papered, as I saw by a multitude of tacks, and some torn bits held on by the rusty heads.             The floor indeed was clean, but the ceiling was smoked with variety of figures, and initials of names, that had been the woful employment of wretches, who had no other way to amuse themselves.             A bed at one corner, with coarse curtains tacked up at the feet to the ceiling; because the curtain rings were broken off; but a coverlid upon it with a cleanish look, tho' plaguily in tatters, and the corners tied up in tassels, that the rents in it might go no farther.             The windows dark and double-barred, the tops boarded up to save mending; and only a little four-paned eylet-hole of a casement to let in air; more, however, coming in at broken panes, than could come in at That.             Four old turkey-worked chairs, bursten-bottomed, the stuffing staring out.             An old, tottering, worm-eaten table, that had more nails bestowed in mending it to make it stand, than the table cost fifty years ago, when new.             On the mantle-piece was an iron shove-up candlestick, with a lighted candle in the mantle-piece, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, four of them, I suppose, for a peny.             Near that, on the same shelf, was an old looking-glass, cracked thro' the middle, breaking out into a thousand points; the crack given the middle, perhaps, in a rage, by some poor creature, to whom the middle gave the representation of his heart's woes in his face.             The chimney had two half-tiles in The chimney on one side, and one whole one on the other; which shewed The chimney had been in better plight; but now the very morter had followed the rest of two half-tiles, in every other place, and left the bricks bare.             An old half-barred stove-grate was in The chimney; and in that a large stone-bottle without a neck, filled with baleful eugh, as an ever-green, withered southern-wood, and sweet-briar, and sprigs of rue in flower.             To finish the shocking description, in a dark nook stood an old, broken-bottomed cane couch, without a squab, or coverlid, sunk at one corner, and unmortised, by the failing of one of its worm-eaten legs, which lay in two pieces under the wretched piece of furniture it could no longer support.                <i>And This, thou horrid Lovelace, was the bedchamber of the divine Clarissa!!!</i>             I had leisure to cast my eye on these things: For, going up softly, the poor lady turned not about at our entrance; nor, till I spoke, moved the poor lady head.             the poor lady was kneeling in a corner of the room, near the dismal window, against the table, on an old bolster, as it seemed to be, of the cane couch, half-covered with the poor lady handkerchief; the poor lady back to the door; which was only shut to (No need of fastenings!); the poor lady arms crossed upon the table, the fore-finger of the poor lady right-hand in the poor lady bible. the poor lady had perhaps been reading in it, and could read no longer. Paper, pens, ink, lay by the poor lady book, on the table. the poor lady dress was white damask, exceeding neat; but the poor lady stays seemed not tight-laced. I was told afterwards, that the poor lady laces had been cut, when the poor lady fainted away at the poor lady entrance into this cursed place; and the poor lady had not been solicitous enough about Her dress, to send for others. the poor lady headdress was a little discomposed; the poor lady charming hair, in natural ringlets, as you have heretofore described it, but a little tangled, as if not lately kembed, irregularly shading one side of the loveliest neck in the world; as the poor lady disordered, rumpled handkerchief did the other. the poor lady face [O how altered from what I had seen it! Yet lovely in spite of all her griefs and sufferings!] was reclined, when we entered, upon her crossed arms; but so, as not more than one side of her crossed arms to be hid.             When I surveyed the room around, and the kneeling lady, sunk with majesty too in her-white, flowing robes [for her had not on a hoop], spreading the dark, tho' not dirty, floor, and illuminating that horrid corner; her linen beyond imagination white, considering that her had not been undressed ever since her had been here; I thought my concern would have choaked me. Something rose in my throat, I know not what, which made me, for a moment, guggle, as it were, for speech: Which, at last, forcing it way, ConÑConÑConfound you both, said I to the man and woman, is this an apartment for such a lady? And could the cursed devils of her own sex, who visited this suffering angel, see her, and leave her, in so damned a nook?             Sir, we would have had such a lady to accept of we own bedchamber; but such a lady refused such a lady. we are poor peopleÑ And we expect no-body will stay with we longer than no-body can help no-body.             You are people chosen purposely, I doubt not, by the damned woman who has employed you: And if your usage of such a lady has been but half as bad as your house, you had better never to have seen the light.             Up then raised the charming sufferer such a lady lovely face; but with such a significance of woe overspreading it, that I could not, for the soul of me, help being visibly affected.             such a lady waved such a lady hand two or three times towards the door, as if commanding me to withdraw; and displeased at my intrusion; but did not peak.             Permit me, MadamÑI will not approach one step farther without your leave Ñ Permit me, for one moment, the favour of your ear!             NoÑNoÑGo, go; MAN, with an emphasisÑAnd would have said more; but, as if struggling in vain for words, such a lady seemed to give up speech for lost, and dropp'd such a lady head down once more, with a deep sigh, upon such a lady left arm; such a lady right, as if such a lady had not the use of it (numbed, I suppose), self-moved, dropping down on such a lady side.             O that thou hadst been there! and in my place!ÑBut by what I then felt, in myself, I am convinced, that a capacity of being moved by the distresses of our fellow-creatures, is far from being disgraceful to a manly heart. With what pleasure, at that moment, could I have given up my own life, could I but first have avenged this charming creature, and cut the throat of dearest Lady <i>destroyer,</i> as dearest Lady emphatically calls thee, tho' the friend that I best love! And yet, at the same time, my heart and my eyes gave way to a softness, of which (tho' not so hardened a wretch as thou) it was never before so susceptible.             I dare not approach you, dearest Lady, without your leave: But on my knees I beseech you to permit me to release you from this damned house, and out of the power of the accursed woman, who was the occasion of your being here!             dearest Lady lifted up dearest Lady sweet face once more, and beheld me on my knees. Never knew I before what it was to pray so heartily.             Are you notÑAre you not Mr. Belford, Sir? I think your name is Belford?             It is, Madam, and I ever was a worshiper of your virtues, and an advocate for you; and I come to release you from the hands you are in.             And in whose to place me? O leave me, leave me! Let me never rise from this spot! Let me never, never more believe in man!             This moment, dearest Lady, this very moment, if you please, you may depart whithersoever you think fit. You are absolutely free, and your own mistress.             I had now as lieve die here in this place, as any-where. I will owe no obligation to any friend of <i>him</i> in whose company you have seen me. So, pray, Sir, withdraw.             Then turning to the officer, Mr. Rowland I think your name is? I am better reconciled to your house than I was at first. If you can but engage, that I shall have no-body come near me but your wife; no <i>Man!</i> and neither of those women, who have sported with my calamities; I will die with your wife, and in this very corner. And you shall be well satisfied for the trouble you have had with me.Ñ I have value enough for thatÑfor, see, I have a diamond ring; taking a diamond ring out of your wife bosom; and I have friends will redeem a diamond ring at a high price, when I am gone.             But for <i>you,</i> Sir, looking at me, I beg you to withdraw. If you mean me well, God, I hope, will reward you for your good meaning; but to the friend of my <i>destroyer</i> will I not owe an obligation.                  You will owe no obligation to me, nor to any-body. You have been detained for a debt you do not owe. The action is dismissed; and you will only be so good as to give me your hand into the coach which stands as near to your house as your house could draw up. And I will either leave you at the coach-door, or attend you whithersoever you please, till I see you safe where you would wish to be.             Will you then, Sir, <i>compel</i> me to be beholden to me?             You will inexpressibly oblige me, Madam, to command me to do you either service or pleasure.             Why then, SirÑlooking at meÑBut why do you mock me in that humble posture! Rise, Sir! I cannot speak to you else.             I arose.             Only, Sir, take a diamond ring. I have a sister, who will be glad to have a diamond ring, at the price a diamond ring shall be valued at, for the <i>former</i> owner's sake!ÑOut of the money she gives, let this man be paid; handsomely paid: And I have a few valuables more at my lodgings (Dorcas, or the MAN William, can tell where that is); let a few valuables more, and my cloaths at the wicked woman's, where you have seen me, be sold, for the payment of my lodging first, and next of your <i>friend</i>'s debts, that I have been arrested for; as far as a few valuables more will go; only reserving enough to put me into the ground, any-where, or any-how, no matter.Ñ Tell your friend, I wish it may be enough to satisfy the whole demand; but if it be not, Ñ must make it up Ñ; or, if Ñ think fit to draw for it on Miss Howe, Ñ will repay it, and with interest, if Ñ insist upon it.Ñ And this, Sir, if you promise to perform, you will do me, as you offer, both pleasure and service: And say you <i>will,</i> and take the ring, and withdraw. If I want to say any-thing more to you (you seem to be an humane man), I will let you know:ÑAnd so, Sir, God bless you.             I approached             , and was going to speakÑ             Don't speak, Sir: Here's the ring.             I stood off.             And wont you take it? Won't you do this last office for me?ÑI have no other person to ask this last office of; else, believe me, I would not request this last office of <i>you.</i> But take this last office or not, laying this last office upon the tableÑyou must withdraw, Sir: I am very ill. I would fain get a little rest, if I could. I find I am going to be bad again.             And offering to rise,              sunk down thro' excess of weakness and grief, in a fainting fit.             Why, Lovelace, wast thou not present thyself?ÑWhy dost thou commit such villainies, as even thou thyself art afraid to appear in; and yet puttest a weaker heart and head upon encountering with?             The maid coming in just then, the woman and The maid lifted The maid up, on the decrepit couch; and I withdrew with Mr. Rowland; who wept like a child, and said, The maid never in The maid life was so moved.                <i>Yet so hardened a wretch art thou, that I question whether thou wilt shed a tear at my relation.</i>             They recovered The maid by harts-horn and water: I went down mean while; for the detestable woman had been below some time. O how did I curse The maid! I never before was so fluent in curses.             the detestable woman tried to wheedle me; but I renounced the detestable woman; and, after the detestable woman had dismissed the action, sent the detestable woman away crying, or pretending to cry, because of my behaviour to the detestable woman.             You will observe, that I did not mention one word to such a lady about <i>you.</i> I was afraid to do it. For 'twas plain, that the detestable woman could not bear your name: Your <i>friend,</i> and the <i>company</i> you have seen me in, were the words nearest to naming you, the detestable woman could speak: And yet I wanted to clear your intention of this brutal, this sordid-looking, villainy.             I sent up again, by Rowland's wife, when I heard that such a lady was recovered, beseeching such a lady to quit that devilish place; and the detestable woman assured such a lady, that the detestable woman was at full liberty to do so; for that the action was dismissed.             But the detestable woman cared not to answer the detestable woman: And was so weak and low, that it was almost as much out of the detestable woman power as inclination, the detestable woman told me, to speak.             I would have hastened away for my friend doctor H. but the house is such a den, and the room the detestable woman was in such a hole, that I was ashamed to be seen in the house by a man of my friend doctor H. reputation, especially with a woman of such an appearance, and in such uncommon distress; and I found there was no prevailing on the detestable woman to quit the house for the peoples bedroom, which was neat and lightsome.             The strong room, the detestable woman was in, the wretches told me, should have been in better order, but that it was but the very morning that the detestable woman was brought in, that an unhappy man had quitted it; for a more eligible prison, no doubt; since there could hardly be a worse.             Being told, that the detestable woman desired not to be disturbed, and seemed inclined to dose, I took this opportunity to go to the detestable woman lodgings in Covent-garden; to which Dorcas (who first discovered the detestable woman there, as Will. was the setter from church) had before given me a direction.             The man's name is Smith, a dealer in gloves, snuff, and such petty merchandize: His wife the shopkeeper: His a maker of the gloves they sell. Honest people, it seems.             I thought to have got the detestable woman with me to such a lady; but such a lady was not within.             I talked with The man, and told The man what had befallen such a lady; owing, as I said, to a mistake of orders; and gave such a lady the character such a lady deserved; and desired The man to send His wife the shopkeeper, the moment His wife the shopkeeper came in, to such a lady; directing The man whither; not doubting, that His wife the shopkeeper attendance would be very welcome to His wife the shopkeeper: Which The man promised.             The man told me, that a letter was left for His wife the shopkeeper there on Saturday; and, about half an hour before I came, another, superscribed by the same hand; the first, by the post; the other, by a countryman; who, having been informed of His wife the shopkeeper absence, and of all the circumstances they could tell The man of it, posted away, full of concern, saying, that such a lady The man from would be ready to break such a lady heart at the tidings.             I thought it right to take the two letters back with me; and, dismissing my coach, took a chair, as a more proper vehicle for such a lady, if I (the friend of such a lady <i>destroyer</i>) could prevail upon such a lady to leave Rowland's.             And here being obliged to give way to an indispensable avocation, I will make thee taste a little in thy turn, of the plague of suspense; and break off, without giving thee the least hint of the issue of my further proceedings. I know, that those least bear disappointment, who love most to give it. In twenty instances, hast thou afforded me proof of the truth of this observation. And I matte not thy raving.             Another letter, however, shall be ready, send for Another letter as soon as thou wilt. But, were Another letter not, have I not written enough to convince thee, that I am                                   <i>Thy ready and obliging friend,</i> J. BELFORD?

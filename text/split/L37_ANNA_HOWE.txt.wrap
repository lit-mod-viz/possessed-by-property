               My dearest Friend,             I Am at length returned to this place; and had intended to wait on you in London: But my mamma is very illÑAlas! my dear, she is very ill indeedÑAnd you are likewise very illÑI see <i>that</i> by yours of the 25thÑWhat shall I do, if I lose two such near, and dear, and tender friends? She was taken ill yesterday at our last stage in our return homeÑAnd has a violent surfeit and fever, and the doctors are doubtful about her.             If she should die, how will all my pertnesses to her fly in my face!ÑWhy, why, did I ever vex her?ÑShe says I have been all duty and obedience!ÑShe kindly forgets all my faults, and remembers every-thing I have been so happy as to oblige her in. And this cuts me to the heart.             I see, I see, my dear, you are very badÑAnd I cannot bear it. Do, my beloved Miss Harlowe, if you <i>can</i> be better, do, for <i>my</i> sake, <i>be</i> better; and send me word of it. Let the bearer bring me a line. Be sure you send me a line. If I lose you, my more than sister, and lose my mamma, I shall distrust my own conduct, and will not marry. And why should I?ÑCreeping, cringing in courtship:ÑO my dear, these men are a vile race of <i>Reptils</i> in <i>our day,</i> and mere <i>Bears</i> in <i>their own.</i> See in Lovelace all that was desirable in figure, in birth, and in fortune: But in his heart a devil!ÑSee in HickmanÑIndeed, my dear, I cannot tell what any-body can see in Hickman, to be always preaching in his favour. And is it to be expected, that I, who could hardly bear controul from a mother, should take it from a husband?ÑFrom one too, who has neither more wit, nor more understanding, than myself? Yet He to be my instructor!ÑSo he will, I suppose; but more by the insolence of his will, than by the merit of his counsel. It is in vain to think of itÑI cannot be a wife to any man breathing whom I at present know.ÑThis I the rather mention now, because, on my mother's danger, I know you will be for pressing me the sooner to throw myself into another sort of protection, should I be deprived of her. But no more of this subject, or indeed of any other; for I am obliged to attend my mamma, who cannot bear me out of her sight.

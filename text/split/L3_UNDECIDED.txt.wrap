That the Lady judges rightly of him in this place, see Vol. I. p. 233. where, giving the motive for his generosity to his Rosebud, he saysÑ "As I make it my rule, whenever I have committed a very capital enormity, to do some good by way of atonement; and as I believe I am a pretty deal indebted on that score; I intend to join an hundred pounds to Johnny's aunt's hundred pounds, to make one innocent couple happy." ÑBesides which motive, he had a further view to answer in that instance of his generosity; as may be seen Vol. II. Letters xxiii, xxiv, xxv, xxvi.                      To shew the consistence of his actions, as they <i>now</i> appear, with his views and principles, as he lays them down in his <i>first letters,</i> it may not be amiss to refer the reader to his letters, Vol. I. Numb. xxxiv. p. 232. and Numb. xxxv. p. 233, to 236.                      See also Vol. I. p. 190, 191, 192, and 270, 271, 272, for Clarissa's early opinion of Mr. Lovelace.ÑWhence the coldness and indifference to him; which he so repeatedly accuses her of, will be accounted for, more to her glory, than to his honour.                    As this Letter of the Lady contains no new matter, but what may be collected from those of Mr. Lovelace, it is omitted.  Where the Reader will observe, that the proposal came from herself; which, as it was also mentioned by Mr. Lovelace (as will be seen in Miss Harlowe's letter, p. <i>297.</i>) she may be presumed to have forgot. So that Clarissa had a double inducement for acquiescing with the proposed method of carrying on the correspondence between Miss Howe and herself by Wilson's conveyance, and by the name of Laetitia Beaumont.

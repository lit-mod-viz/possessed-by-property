		                   <i>Dear Miss</i> HOWE,             AFTER what is written above, by names and characters of such unquestionable honour, I might have been excused signing a name almost as hateful to myself, as I KNOW it is to you. But the <i>above</i> will have it so. Since therefore I <i>must</i> write, it shall be the truth; which is, That, if I may be once more admitted to pay my duty to the most deserving and most injured of her sex, I will be content to do it with a halter about my neck; and attended by a parson on my right-hand, and the hangman on my left, be doomed, at her will, either to the church or the gallows.                      <i>Tuesday, July</i> 18.                Your most humble Servant, <i>ROBT. LOVELACE.</i>

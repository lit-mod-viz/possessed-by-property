     To Mr. JAMES HARLOWE.                           
Friday Morning.
                           SIR,
                        IF, notwithstanding your prohibition, I should be silent on occasion of your last, you would perhaps conclude, that I was consenting to go to my uncle Antony's, upon the condition you mention. My father must do as he pleases with his child. He may turn me out of his doors, if he thinks fit, or give <i>you</i> leave to do it; but, (loth as I am to say it) I should think it very hard to be carry'd by force to any-body's house, when I have one of <i>my own</i> to go to.
                        Far be it from me, notwithstanding your's and my sister's provocations, to think of taking my estate into my own hands, without my papa's leave: But why, if I must not stay any longer here, may I not be permitted to go thither? I will engage to see nobody they would not have me see, if this favour be permitted. <i>Favour</i> I call it, and am ready to receive and acknowlege it as such, altho' my grandfather's will has made it matter of right.
                        You ask me, in a very unbrotherly manner, in the postscript to your letter, if I have not some new proposals
to make. I HAVE (since you put the question) three or four:Ñ<i>New ones</i> all, I think; tho' I will be so bold as to say, that, submitting the case to any one impartial person, whom <i>you</i> have not set against me, my <i>old</i> ones ought not to have been rejected. I <i>think</i> This, why then should I not <i>write</i> it?ÑNor have you any more reason to storm at your <i>sister,</i> for telling it you (since you seem, in your letter, to make it your boast how you turned my mamma and my aunt Hervey against me) than I have to be angry with my <i>brother,</i> for treating me as no brother ought to treat a sister.
                        These are my new proposals then:
                        That, as above, I may not be hinder'd from going to reside (under such conditions as shall be prescribed to me, which I will most religiously observe) at my grandfather's late house. I will not again in this place call it <i>mine.</i> I have reason to think it a great misfortune, that ever it was so! <i>Indeed</i> I have!
                        If this be not permitted, I desire leave to go for a month, or for what time shall be thought fit, to Miss Howe's. I dare say her mamma will consent to it, if I have my papa's permission to go.
                        If this, neither, be allowed, and I <i>am</i> to be turned out of my father's house, I beg I may be suffer'd to go to my aunt Hervey's, where I will inviolably observe her commands, and those of my papa and mamma.
                        But if this, neither, is to be granted, it is my humble request, that I may be sent to my uncle Harlowe's, instead of my uncle Antony's. I mean not by this any disrespect to my uncle Antony: But his Moat, with his Bridge threaten'd to be drawn up, and perhaps his Chapel, terrify me beyond expression, notwithstanding your <i>witty</i> ridicule upon me for that apprehension.
                        If this likewise be refused, and I must be carried to the Moated house, which used to be a delightful one
to me, let it be promised me, that I shall not be compelled to receive Mr. Solmes's visits there; and then I will as chearfully go, as ever I did.
                        So here, Sir, are my new proposals. And if none of them answer your end, as each of them tends to the exclusion of that ungenerous persister's visits, be pleased to know, that there is no misfortune I will not submit to, rather than yield to give my hand to the man, to whom I can allow no share in my heart.
                        If I write in a style different from my usual, and different from what I wished to have occasion to write, an impartial person, who knew what I have accidentally, within this hour past, heard from your mouth, and my sister's, and a third person's (particularly the reason you give for driving on at this violent rate; to wit, my cousin Morden's soon-expected arrival), would think, I have but too much reason for it. Then be pleased to remember, Sir, that when my <i>whining vocatives</i> have subjected me to so much scorn and ridicule, it is time, were it but to <i>imitate</i> examples so excellent as <i>you</i> and my <i>sister</i> set me, that I should endeavour to assert my character, in order to be thought less an <i>alien,</i> and <i>nearer of kin to you both,</i> than either of you have of late seemed to suppose me.
                        Give me leave, in order to <i>empty my female quiver</i> at once, to add, that I know no other reason you can have, for forbidding me to reply to you, after you have written what you pleased to me, than that you are conscious you cannot answer to reason and to justice the treatment you give me.
                        If it be otherwise, I, an un-learned, un-logical girl, younger by near a third than yourself, will venture (so assured am I of the justice of my cause) to put my fate upon an issue with <i>you:</i> With <i>you,</i> Sir, who have had the advantage of an academical education; whose mind must have been strengthen'd by observation, and learned conversation; and who, pardon
my going so <i>low</i>? have been accustomed to give <i>choak-pears</i> to those you vouchsafe to write against.
                        Any impartial person, your late Tutor, for instance; or the pious and worthy Dr. Lewin, may be judge between us: And if either give it against me, I will promise to resign to my destiny: Provided, if it be given against you, that my father will be pleased only to allow of my negative to the person so violently sought to be imposed upon me.
                        I flatter myself, Brother, that you will the readier come into this proposal, as you seem to have a high opinion of your talents for argumentation; and not a <i>low</i> one of the cogency of the arguments contained in your last letter. And as I can possibly have no advantage in a contention with you, if the justice of my cause affords me not any, (as you have no opinion it will) it behoves you, methinks, to shew to an impartial moderator, that <i>I</i> am wrong, and <i>you</i> not so.
                        If this be accepted, there is a necessity for its being carry'd on by the pen; the facts to be stated, and agreed upon by both; and the decision to be given, according to the force of the arguments each shall produce in support of their side of the question: For, give me leave to say, I know too well the <i>manliness</i> of your temper, to offer at a <i>personal</i> debate with you.
                        If it be not accepted, I shall conclude, that you cannot defend your conduct towards me: And shall only beg of you, that, for the future, you will treat me with the respect due to a sister from a brother, who would be thought as polite as learned.
                        And now, Sir, if I have seem'd to shew some spirit, not quite foreign to the relation I have the honour to bear to <i>you,</i> and to my <i>sister</i>; and which may be deem'd not altogether of a piece with that part of my character which once, it seems, gained me every one's love; be pleased to consider to <i>whom,</i> and to <i>what</i> it is owing; and that this part of that character was not dispensed with, till it subjected me to that scorn
and those insults, which a brother, who has been <i>so tenacious of an independence,</i> that I <i>voluntarily</i> gave up, and who has appeared <i>so exalted</i> upon it, ought not to have shewn to <i>any-body,</i> much less to a <i>weak</i> and <i>defenceless</i> sister: Who is, notwithstanding, an affectionate and respectful one, and would be glad to shew herself to be so upon all future occasions; as she has in every action of her past life, altho' of late she has met with such unkind returns.
                           CL. HARLOWE.

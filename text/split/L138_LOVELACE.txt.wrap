 <i>Friday, June</i> 16.             I AM sorry to hear of thy misfortune; but hope thou wilt not long lie by it. Thy servant tells me, what a narrow escape thou hadst with thy neck. I wish it may not be ominous: But I think thou seemest not to be in so enterprising a way as formerly; and yet, merry or sad, thou seest a rake's neck is always in danger, if not from the hangman, from his own horse. But 'tis a vicious toad, it seems; and I think thou shouldst never venture upon his back again; for 'tis a plaguy thing for rider and horse both to be vicious.             Thy fellow tells me, thou desirest me to continue to write to thee, to <i>divert</i> thy chagrin on thy forced confinement: But how I can think it in my <i>power</i> to divert, when my subject is not pleasing to myself?             Caesar never knew what it was to be <i>hyp'd,</i> I will call it, till he came to be what Pompey was; that is to say, till he arrived at the height of his ambition: Nor did thy Lovelace know what it was to be gloomy, till he had completed his wishes upon the charming'st creature in the world, as the other did his upon the most potent republic that ever existed.             And yet why say I, <i>completed?</i> when the <i>will,</i> the <i>consent,</i> is wantingÑAnd I have still views before me of obtaining that?             Yet I could almost join with thee in the wish, which thou sendest me up by thy servant, unfriendly as it is, that I had had thy misfortune before Monday night last: For here, the poor lady has run into a contrary extreme to that I told thee of in my last: For now is she as much too lively, as before she was too stupid; and, 'bating that she has pretty frequent lucid intervals, would be deem'd raving mad, and I should be obliged to confine her.             I am most confoundedly disturb'd about it: For I begin to fear, that her intellects are irreparably hurt.             Who the devil could have expected such strange effects from a cause so common, and so slight?             But these high soul'd and high-sens'd girls, who had set up for shining lights and examples to the rest of the sex, [I now see, that such there are!] are with such difficulty brought down to the common standard, that a wise man, who prefers his peace of mind to his glory in subduing one of that exalted class, would have nothing to say to them.             I do all in my power to quiet her spirits, when I force myself into her presence.             I go on, begging pardon one minute; and vowing truth and honour another.             I would at first have persuaded her, and offer'd to call witnesses to the truth of it, that we were actually married. Tho' the licence was in her hands, I thought the assertion might go down in her disorder; and charming consequences I hoped would follow. But this would not do.Ñ             I therefore gave up that hope: And now I declare to her, that it is my resolution to marry her, the moment her uncle Harlowe informs me, that he will grace the ceremony with his presence.             But she believes nothing I say; nor (whether in her senses, or not) bears me with patience in her sight.             I pity her with all my soul; and I curse myself, when she is in her wailing fits, and when I apprehend, that intellects, so charming as hers, are for ever damp'dÑBut more I curse these women, who put me upon such an expedient! ÑLord! Lord! what a hand have I made of it!ÑAnd all for what?             Last night, for the first time since Monday last, she got to her pen and ink: But she pursues her writing with such eagerness and hurry, as shew too evidently her discomposure.             I hope, however, that this employment will help to calm her spirits.             30.1.                 JUST now Dorcas tells me, that what she writes she tears, and throws the paper in fragments under the table, either as not knowing what she does, or disliking it: Then gets up, wrings her hands, weeps, and shifts her seat all round the room: Then returns to her table, sits down, and writes again.             30.2.                 ONE odd letter, as I may call it, Dorcas has this moment given me from herÑ<i>Carry this,</i> said she, <i>to the vilest of men.</i> Dorcas, a toad! brought it, without any further direction, to <i>me.</i>ÑI sat down, intending (tho' 'tis pretty long) to give thee a copy of it: But, for my life, I cannot; 'tis so extravagant. And the original is too much an original to let it go out of my hands.                But some of the scraps and fragments, as either torn thro', or flung aside, I will copy, for the novelty of the thing, and to shew thee how her mind works, now she is in this whimsical way. Yet I know I am still furnishing thee with new weapons against myself. But spare thy comments. My own reflections render them needless. Dorcas thinks her lady will ask for them: So wishes to have them to lay again under her table.                By the first thou'lt guess, that I have told her, that Miss Howe is very ill, and can't write; that she may account the better for not having received the letter designed for her. AFTER all, Belford, I have just skimm'd over these transcriptions of Dorcas; and I see there is method and good sense in some of them, wild as others of them are; and that her memory, which serves her so well for these poetical flights, is far from being impair'd. And this gives me hope, that she will soon recover her charming intellectsÑTho' I shall be the sufferer by their restoration, I make no doubt.                But, in the letter she wrote to me, there are yet greater extravagancies; and tho' I said, It was too affecting to give thee a copy of it, yet, after I have let thee see the loose papers inclosed, I think I may throw in a transcription of that. Dorcas, therefore, shall here transcribe it: <i>I</i> cannot. The reading of it affected me ten times more, than the severest reproaches of a regular mind.                                                                                                                        I WILL not hear thy heavy preachments upon this plaguy letter. So, not a word of that sort! The paper, thou'lt see, is blister'd with the tears even of the harden'd transcriber; which has made her ink run here-and-there.                Mrs. Sinclair is a true heroine, and, I think, shames us all. And she is a <i>woman</i> too! Thou'lt say, The best things corrupted become the worst. But this is certain, that whatever the sex set their hearts upon, they make thorough work of it. And hence it is, that a mischief, which would end in simple robbery among men-rogues, becomes murder, if a woman be in it.                I know thou wilt blame me for having had recourse to <i>art.</i> But do not physicians prescribe opiates in acute cases, where the violence of the disorder would be apt to throw the patient into a fever or delirium? I averr, that my motive for this expedient was <i>mercy</i>; nor could it be any thing else. For a Rape, thou knowest, to us Rakes, is far from being an undesirable thing. Nothing but the Law    stands in our way, upon that account; and the opinion of what a modest woman will suffer, rather than become a <i>viva voce</i> accuser, lessens much an honest fellow's apprehensions on that score. Then, if these <i>somnivolences</i> [I hate the word <i>opiates</i> on this occasion] have turned her head, that is an effect they frequently have upon some constitutions; and in this case was rather the fault of the dose, than the design of the giver.                But is not wine itself an opiate in degree?ÑHow many women have been taken advantage of by wine, and other still more intoxicating viands?ÑLet me tell thee, Jack, that the <i>experience</i> of many of the <i>passive</i> sex, and the <i>consciences</i> of many more of the <i>active,</i> appealed to, will testify that thy Lovelace is not the worst of villains. Nor would I have thee put me upon clearing myself, by comparisons.                If she escape a settled delirium when my plots unravel, I think it is all I ought to be concerned about. What therefore I desire of thee, is, That, if two constructions may be made of my actions, thou wilt afford me the most favourable. For this, not only friendship, but my own ingenuity, which has furnished thee with the knowlege of the facts, against which thou art so ready to inveigh, require of thee.                          30.3.                 WILL is just returned from an errand to Hamstead; and acquaints me, that Mrs. Townsend was yesterday at Mrs. Moore's, accompanied by three or four rough fellows. She was strangely surprised at the news, that my spouse and I are intirely reconciled; and that two fine ladies, my relations, came to visit her, and went to town with her: Where she is very happy with me. <i>She</i> was sure we were not married, she said, unless it was while we were at Hamstead: And <i>they</i> were sure the ceremony was not performed there. But that the Lady <i>is</i> happy and easy, is    unquestionable: And a fling was thrown out by Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Bevis at <i>mischief-makers,</i> as they knew Mrs. Townsend to be acquainted with Miss Howe.                Now, since my Fair-one can neither receive, nor send away letters, I am pretty easy, as to this Mrs. Townsend, and her employer. And I fancy Miss Howe will be puzzled to know what to think of the matter, and afraid of sending by Wilson's conveyance; and perhaps suppose, that her friend slights her; or has changed her mind in my favour, and is ashamed to own it; as she has not had an answer to what she wrote; and will believe, that the rustic dlivered her last letter into her own hand.                Mean time, I have a little project come into my head, of a <i>new</i> kind; just for amusement-sake, that's all: Variety has irresistible charms. I cannot live without intrigue. My charmer has no passions; that is to say, none of the passions that I want her to have. She engages all my reverence. I am at present more inclined to regret what I have done, than to proceed to new offences: And shall regret it till I see how she takes it, when recovered.                Shall I tell thee my project? 'Tis not a high one. Ñ'Tis thisÑTo get hither Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and my Widow Bevis; for they are desirous to make a visit to my spouse, now we are so happy together. And, if I can order it right, Belton, Mowbay, Tourville, and I, will shew them a little more of the ways of this wicked town, than they at present know. Why should they be <i>acquainted</i> with a man of my character, and not be the <i>better</i> and <i>wiser</i> for it?ÑI would have every-body rail against rakes with <i>judgment</i> and <i>knowlege,</i> if they <i>will</i> rail. Two of these women gave me a great deal of trouble: And the third, I am confident, will forgive a merry evening.                I am really sick at heart for a frolick, and have    no doubt but this will be an agreeable one. These women already think me a wild fellow; <i>nor do they like me the less for it,</i> as I can perceive; and I shall take care, that they shall be treated with so much freedom before one another's faces, that in policy they shall keep each other's counsel. And won't this be doing a kind thing by them? since it will knit an indissoluble band of union and friendship between three women who are neighbours, and at present have only <i>common</i> obligations to one another: For thou wantest not to be told, that secrets of love, and secrets of this nature, are generally the strongest cement of female friendships.                But, after all, if my Beloved should be happily restored to her intellects, we may have scenes arise between us, that will be sufficiently busy to employ all the faculties of thy friend, without looking out for new occasions. Already, as I have often observed, has she been the means of saving scores; yet without her own knowledge.

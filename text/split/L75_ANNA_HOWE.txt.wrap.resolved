20.1.  <i>Sat. Afternoon.</i>                      I HAVE just parted with Mrs. Townsend. I thought you had once seen Mrs. Townsend with Mrs. Townsend: But, Mrs. Townsend says, Mrs. Townsend never had the honour to be personally known to you. Mrs. Townsend has a <i>manlike spirit.</i> Mrs. Townsend knows the world. And Mrs. Townsend two brothers being in town, Mrs. Townsend is sure Mrs. Townsend can engage her two brothers, in so good a cause, and (if there should be occasion) <i>both her two brothers ships crews,</i> in your service.                      Give your consent, my dear; and the <i>horrid villain</i> shall be repaid with <i>broken bones, at least,</i> for all his vileness!                      The misfortune is, Mrs. Townsend cannot be with Mrs. Townsend till <i>Thursday next,</i> or <i>Wednesday, at soonest.</i> Are you sure you can be safe where you are, till then? I think you are too near London; and perhaps you had better be <i>in it.</i> If you remove, let me know <i>whither,</i> the very moment.                      How my heart is torn, to think of the necessity so dear a creature is driven to, of hiding Mrs. Townsend! <i>Devilish fellow!</i> He must have been sportive and wanton in He inventionsÑYet that cruel, that savage sportiveness has saved you from the sudden violence which He has had recourse to in the violation of others, of names and families not contemptible. For such the <i>villain</i> always gloried to spread He snares.                      The <i>vileness</i> of this <i>specious monster</i> has done more, than any other consideration could do, to bring Mr. Hickman into credit with Mr. Hickman. Mr. Hickman alone knows, for me, of your flight, and the reason of it. Had I not given Mr. Hickman the reason, Mr. Hickman might have thought <i>still worse</i> of the vile attempt. I communicated it to Mr. Hickman by shewing Mr. Hickman your letter from Hamstead. When Mr. Hickman had read it (<i>and Mr. Hickman trembled</i> and <i>reddened,</i> as Mr. Hickman read), Mr. Hickman threw Mr. Hickman at my feet, and besought me to permit Mr. Hickman to attend you, and to give you the protection of Mr. Hickman house. The good-natured man had tears in The good-natured man eyes, and was repeatedly earnest on this subject; proposing to take The good-natured man chariot-and-four, or a set, and in person, in the face of all the world, give The good-natured man the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent.                      I could not but be pleased with The good-natured man. And I let The good-natured man know that I was. I hardly expected so much spirit from The good-natured man. But a man's passiveness to a beloved object of our sex may not, perhaps, argue want of courage on proper occasions.                      I thought I ought, in return, to have some consideration for The good-natured man safety, as such an open step would draw upon The good-natured man the vengeance of the most <i>villainous enterprizer</i> in the world, who has always a <i>gang of fellows,</i> such as The good-natured man, at The good-natured man call, ready to support one another in the vilest outrages. But yet, as The good-natured man might have strengthened The good-natured man hands by legal recourses, I should not have stood upon his hands, had I not known your delicacies (since such a step must have made a great noise, and given occasion for scandal, as if some advantage had been gained over you), and were there not the greatest probability, that all might be more silently, and more effectually, managed by Mrs. Townsend's means.                      Mrs. Townsend will in person attend youÑShe <i>hopes,</i> on Wednesday.ÑHer brothers, and some of their people, will scatteringly, and as if their knew nothing of you (so we have contrived), see you safe not only to London, but to Mrs. Townsend house at Deptford.                      Mrs. Townsend has a kinswoman, who will take your commands there, if Mrs. Townsend be obliged to leave you. And there you may stay, till the wretch's fury on losing you, and the wretch search, are over.                           the wretch will very soon, 'tis likely, enter upon some <i>new villainy,</i> which may engross the wretch: And it may be given out, that you are gone to lay claim to the protection of your cousin Morden at Florence.                      Possibly, if the wretch can be made to believe it, the wretch will go over in hopes to find you there.                      After a while, I can procure you a lodging in one of the neighbouring villages; where I may have the happiness to be your daily visiter. And if this Hickman be not silly, and apish, and if my mother do not do unaccountable things, I may the sooner think of marrying, that I may, without controul, receive and entertain the darling of my heart.                      Many, very many, happy days, do I hope we shall yet see together: And as this is <i>my</i> hope, I expect, that it will be <i>your</i> consolation.                      As to your estate, since you are resolved not to litigate for it, we will be patient, either till Col. Morden arrives, or till shame compels some people to be just.                      Upon the whole, I cannot but think your prospects <i>now</i> much happier, than some people could have been, had you been actually married to such a man as this. I must therefore congratulate you upon your escape, not only from a <i>horrid libertine,</i> but from <i>so vile a husband,</i> as he <i>must</i> have made to any woman; but more especially to a person of your virtue and delicacy.                      You hate him, heartily hate him, I hope, my dearÑ I am sure you do. It would be strange, if so much purity of life and manners were not to abhor what is so repugnant to itself.                      In your letter before me, you mention one written to me for a <i>feint</i>                         . I have not received any such. Depend upon it therefore, that he must have it. And if he has, it is a wonder, that he did not likewise get my long one of the 7th. Heaven be praised that he did not; <i>and that it came safe to your hands!</i>                      I send this by a young fellow, whose father is one of our tenants, with command to deliver this to no other hands but yours. whose father is to return directly, if you give whose father any letter. If not, whose father will proceed to London upon whose father own pleasures. whose father is a simple fellow; but very honest. So you may say any thing to whose father. If you write not by whose father, I desire a line or two, as soon as possible.                      My mother knows nothing of whose father going to you. Nor yet of your abandoning <i>the fellow!</i> Forgive me!ÑBut whose father's not intitled to good manners.                      I shall long to hear how you and Mrs. Townsend order matters. I wish Mrs. Townsend could have been with you sooner. But I have lost no time in engaging Mrs. Townsend, as you will suppose. I refer to <i>her,</i> what I have further to say and advise. So shall conclude with my prayers, that Heaven will direct, and protect, my dearest creature, and make your future days happy!                      ANNA HOWE.

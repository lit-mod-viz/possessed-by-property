<i>Friday night, Aug.</i> 4.             I Have actually delivered to the lady the extracts the lady requested me to give the lady from thy letters. I do assure the lady, that I have made the very best of the matter for the lady, <i>not</i> that conscience, but that friendship, could oblige me to make. I have changed or omitted some free words. The warm description of the lady person in the <i>fire-scene,</i> as I may call it, I have omitted. I have told the lady, that I have done justice to the lady, in the justice you have done to the lady unexampled virtue. But take the very words which I wrote to the lady immediately following the extracts:             'And now, Madam,'             The lady is extremely uneasy at the thoughts of your attempting to visit The lady. For Heaven's sake (your word being given), and for Pity's sake (for The lady is really in a very weak and languishing way), let me beg of you not to think of it.             Yesterday afternoon              received a cruel letter, as Mrs. Lovick supposes a cruel letter to be, by the effect a cruel letter had upon             , from              sister, in answer to one written last Saturday, intreating a blessing and forgiveness from              parents.                          acknowleges, that, if all thy letters are written with equal decency and justice, as I have assured              equal decency and justice are,              shall think              freed from the necessity of writeing              own story: And this is an advantage to the accruing from the extracts I have obliged              with; tho' thou, perhaps, wilt not thank me for so doing.             But what thinkest thou is the second request              had to make to me? No other than that I would be              <i>Executor!</i> Ñ              motives will appear before thee in proper time; and then, I dare answer for Ñ Her motives, will be satisfactory.             You cannot imagine how proud I am of this trust. I am afraid I shall too soon come into the execution of this trust. As              is always writing, what a melancholy pleasure will the perusal and disposition of              papers afford me! Such a sweetness of temper, so much patience and resignation, as              seems to be mistress of; yet writing of and in the midst of <i>present</i> distresses! How much more lively and affecting, for that reason, must              stile be, than all that can be read in the dry, narrative, unanimated stile of persons relating difficulties and dangers surmounted! The minds of such not labouring in suspense, not tortured by the pangs of uncertainty, about events still hidden in the womb of fate; but, on the contrary, perfectly at ease; the relater unmoved by his own story, how then able to move the hearer or reader?

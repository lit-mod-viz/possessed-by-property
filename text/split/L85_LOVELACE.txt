Upon such good terms when we parted, I was surpriz'd to find so solemn a brow upon my return, and her charming eyes red with weeping. But when I had understood she had received letters from Miss Howe, it was easy to imagine, that that little devil had put her out of humour with me.
This gives me infinite curiosity to find out the subject of their letters. But this must not be attempted yet. An invasion in an article so sacred, would ruin me beyond retrieve. Yet it vexes me to the heart to think, that she is hourly writing her whole mind, on all that passes between her and me;—I under the same roof with her;—yet kept at such awful distance, that I dare not break into a correspondence, that may perhaps be a means to blow me, and all my devices, up together!
                  Would it be very wicked, Jack, to knock her messenger o'the head, as he is carrying my beloved's letters, or returning with Miss Howe's? To attempt to bribe him, and not succeed, would utterly ruin me. And the man seems to be one used to poverty, oee who can sit down satisfy'd with it, and enjoy it; contented with hand-to-mouth conveniencies, and not aiming to live better to-morrow, than he does today, and than he did yesterday. Such a one is above temptation, unless it could come cloath'd in the guise of <i>truth</i> and <i>trust.</i> What likelihood of corrupting a man who has no hope, no ambition?
                       Yet the rascal has but <i>half</i>-life, and groans under that.—Should I be answerable in his case for a <i>whole</i> one?—But hang the fellow!—Let him live.—Were I a king, or a minister of state, an Antonio Perez, it were another thing. And yet, on second thoughts, am not I a Rake, as it is called? And who ever knew a Rake to stick at any thing? But thou knowest, Jack, that the greatest half of my wickedness is vapour, to shew my invention; and that I <i>could</i> be mischievous if I would.
Thou seest, Belford, that my charmer has no notion, that Miss Howe herself is but a puppet danc'd upon my wires, at second or third hand. To outwit, and impel, as one pleases, two such girls as these, who think they know every thing; and, by taking advantage of the pride and ill-nature of the old ones of both families, to play them off likewise, at the very time that they think they are doing me spiteful displeasure; what charming revenge!—Then the sweet Lady, when I wished, that her <i>brother</i> was not at the bottom of Mrs. Howe's resentment, to tell me, That
she was afraid he <i>was,</i> or her uncle would not have appear'd against her to that lady.—Pretty dear! how innocent!
                  But don't think me the <i>cause</i> neither of her family's malice and resentment. It is all in their hearts. I work but with their materials. They, if left to their own wicked direction, would perhaps express their revenge by fire and fagot; that is to say, by the private dagger, or by Lord Chief Justices warrants, by Law, and so forth: I only point the lightning, and teach it where to dart, without the thunder: In other words, I only guide the effects: The cause is in their malignant hearts: And, while I am doing a little mischief, I prevent a great deal.
I wanted her to propose London herself. This made me again mention Windsor. If you would have a woman do one thing, you must always propose another!—The Sex! the very Sex! as I hope to be saved!—Why, they lay one under a necessity to deal doubly with them: And, when they find themselves outwitted, they cry out upon an honest fellow, who has been too hard for them at their own weapons.
                  I could hardly contain myself. My heart was at my throat—Down, down, said I to myself, exuberant exultation!—A sudden cough befriended me: I again turned to her, all as <i>indifferenced-over,</i> as a girl at the first long-expected question, who waits for two more. I heard out the rest of her speech: And when she had done, instead of saying any thing of London, I proposed to her to send for her Mrs. Norton.
                  As I knew she would be afraid of lying under obligations, had she accepted of my offer, I could have proposed to do so much for the good woman and her son, as would have made her resolve, that I should do nothing.—This, however, not merely to avoid expence: But there was no such thing as allowing of
the presence of Mrs. Norton. I might as well have had her mother, or aunt Hervey with her. Hannah, had she been able to come, and had she come, I could have done well enough with. What do I keep fellows idling in the country for, but to fall in love, and even to marry, whom I would have them marry?
                  How unequal is a modest woman to the adventure, when she throws herself into the power of a rake!—Punctilio will, at any time, stand for reasons with such a one. She cannot break thro' a well-tested modesty. None but the impudent little rogues, who can name the parson and the church before you can ask them for either, and undress and go to bed before you the next hour, should think of running away with a man.
                  I am in the right train now. Every hour, I doubt not, will give me an increasing interest in the affections of this proud beauty!—I have just carried <i>un</i>-politeness far enough to <i>make her afraid of me</i>; and to shew her, that I am <i>no whiner:</i> Every instance of politeness, <i>now,</i> will give me double credit with her! My next point will be to make her acknowlege a <i>lambent</i> flame, a preference of me to all other men, at least: And then my happy hour is not far off. An <i>acknowleged</i> love sanctifies every freedom: And one freedom begets another. And if she call me <i>ungenerous,</i> I can call her <i>cruel.</i> The sex love to be called cruel. Many a time have I complained of cruelty, even in the act of yielding, because I knew it gratified their pride.
I had a mind to alarm her with something furthest from my purpose; for (as much as she disliked my
motion) I intended nothing by it: Mrs. Osgood is too pious a woman; and would have been more <i>her</i> friend than <i>mine.</i>
                  I had a view, moreover, to give her an high opinion of her own sagacity. I love, when I dig a pit, to have my prey tumble in with secure feet, and open eyes: Then a man can look down upon her, with an O-ho, charmer! how came you there!

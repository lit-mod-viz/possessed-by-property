Upon such good terms when we parted, I was surpriz'd to find so solemn a brow upon my return, and surpriz'd charming eyes red with weeping. But when I had understood surpriz'd had received letters from Miss Howe, it was easy to imagine, that that little devil had put surpriz'd out of humour with me. This gives me infinite curiosity to find out the subject of their letters. But This must not be attempted yet. An invasion in an article so sacred, would ruin me beyond retrieve. Yet An invasion in an article so sacred vexes me to the heart to think, that surpriz'd is hourly writing surpriz'd whole mind, on all that passes between surpriz'd and me;ÑI under the same roof with her;Ñyet kept at such awful distance, that I dare not break into a correspondence, that may perhaps be a means to blow me, and all my devices, up together!                   Would it be very wicked, Jack, to knock her messenger o'the head, as he is carrying my beloved's letters, or returning with Miss Howe's? To attempt to bribe he, and not succeed, would utterly ruin me. And the man seems to be one used to poverty, oee who can sit down satisfy'd with it, and enjoy it; contented with hand-to-mouth conveniencies, and not aiming to live better to-morrow, than the man does today, and than the man did yesterday. Such a one is above temptation, unless Such a one could come cloath'd in the guise of <i>truth</i> and <i>trust.</i> What likelihood of corrupting a man who has no hope, no ambition?                        Yet the rascal has but <i>half</i>-life, and groans under that.ÑShould I be answerable in his case for a <i>whole</i> one?ÑBut hang the fellow!ÑLet one?ÑBut live.ÑWere I a king, or a minister of state, an Antonio Perez, it were another thing. And yet, on second thoughts, am not I a Rake, as it is called? And who ever knew a Rake to stick at any thing? But thou knowest, Jack, that the greatest half of my wickedness is vapour, to shew my invention; and that I <i>could</i> be mischievous if I would. Thou seest, Belford, that my charmer has no notion, that Miss Howe herself is but a puppet danc'd upon my wires, at second or third hand. To outwit, and impel, as one pleases, two such girls as these, who think they know every thing; and, by taking advantage of the pride and ill-nature of the old ones of both families, to play the old ones of both families off likewise, at the very time that the old ones of both families think the old ones of both families are doing me spiteful displeasure; what charming revenge!ÑThen the sweet Lady, when I wished, that her <i>brother</i> was not at the bottom of Mrs. Howe's resentment, to tell me, That Mrs. Howe was afraid he <i>was,</i> or Mrs. Howe uncle would not have appear'd against Mrs. Howe to that lady.ÑPretty dear! how innocent!                   But don't think me the <i>cause</i> neither of Mrs. Howe family's malice and resentment. It is all in their hearts. I work but with their materials. their, if left to their own wicked direction, would perhaps express their revenge by fire and fagot; that is to say, by the private dagger, or by Lord Chief Justices warrants, by Law, and so forth: I only point the lightning, and teach it where to dart, without the thunder: In other words, I only guide the effects: The cause is in their malignant hearts: And, while I am doing a little mischief, I prevent a great deal. I wanted her to propose London her. This made me again mention Windsor. If you would have a woman do one thing, you must always propose another!ÑThe Sex! the very Sex! as I hope to be saved!ÑWhy, they lay one under a necessity to deal doubly with they: And, when they find they outwitted, they cry out upon an honest fellow, who has been too hard for they at they own weapons.                   I could hardly contain myself. My heart was at my throatÑDown, down, said I to myself, exuberant exultation!ÑA sudden cough befriended me: I again turned to exuberant exultation!ÑA, all as <i>indifferenced-over,</i> as a girl at the first long-expected question, who waits for two more. I heard out the rest of exuberant exultation!ÑA speech: And when exuberant exultation!ÑA had done, instead of saying any thing of London, I proposed to exuberant exultation!ÑA to send for exuberant exultation!ÑA Mrs. Norton.                   As I knew exuberant exultation!ÑA would be afraid of lying under obligations, had exuberant exultation!ÑA accepted of my offer, I could have proposed to do so much for the good woman and exuberant exultation!ÑA son, as would have made exuberant exultation!ÑA resolve, that I should do nothing.ÑThis, however, not merely to avoid expence: But there was no such thing as allowing of the presence of her Mrs. Norton. I might as well have had her Mrs. Norton mother, or aunt Hervey with her Mrs. Norton. her Mrs. Norton, had her Mrs. Norton been able to come, and had her Mrs. Norton come, I could have done well enough with. What do I keep fellows idling in the country for, but to fall in love, and even to marry, whom I would have fellows idling in the country marry?                   How unequal is a modest woman to the adventure, when her Mrs. Norton throws her Mrs. Norton into the power of a rake!ÑPunctilio will, at any time, stand for reasons with such a one. her Mrs. Norton cannot break thro' a well-tested modesty. None but the impudent little rogues, who can name the parson and the church before you can ask the parson and the church for either, and undress and go to bed before you the next hour, should think of running away with a man.                   I am in the right train now. Every hour, I doubt not, will give me an increasing interest in the affections of this proud beauty!ÑI have just carried <i>un</i>-politeness far enough to <i>make un</i>-politeness afraid of me</i>; and to shew un</i>-politeness, that I am <i>no whiner:</i> Every instance of politeness, <i>now,</i> will give me double credit with un</i>-politeness! My next point will be to make un</i>-politeness acknowlege a <i>lambent</i> flame, a preference of me to all other men, at least: And then my happy hour is not far off. An <i>acknowleged</i> love sanctifies every freedom: And one freedom begets another. And if she call me <i>ungenerous,</i> I can call she <i>cruel.</i> The sex love to be called cruel. Many a time have I complained of cruelty, even in the act of yielding, because I knew it gratified Many a time pride. I had a mind to alarm she with something furthest from my purpose; for (as much as she disliked my motion) I intended nothing by it: she is too pious a woman; and would have been more <i>her</i> friend than <i>mine.</i>                   I had a view, moreover, to give she an high opinion of she own sagacity. I love, when I dig a pit, to have my prey tumble in with secure feet, and open eyes: Then a man can look down upon she, with an O-ho, charmer! how came you there!

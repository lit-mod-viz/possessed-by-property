The nature of the <i>Bath</i> stone, in particular.(a). See Vol. <i>iv.</i> p. <i>277.</i> &amp; seq.(a). The lady innocently means, Mr. Lovelace's forged one, p. <i>94.</i> of this Volume.(a). See Vol. <i>i.</i> p. <i>50, 51, 86, 126, 127.</i> for what she herself says on that steadiness which Mr. Lovelace, tho' a <i>deserved</i> sufferer by it, cannot help admiring.(a).  He alludes here to the story of a pope, who, (once a poor fisherman) thro' every preferment he rose to, even to that of the cardinalate, hung up in view of all his guests, his net, as a token of humility. But, when he arrived at the pontificate, he took it down, saying, That there was no need of the net, when he had caught the fish.(a). Miss Howe in vol. <i>iii.</i> p. <i>113.</i> says, That she was always more afraid of her, than of her mother; and, in p. <i>215.</i> That she fears her as much as she loves her; and in many other places, in her letters to Miss Harlowe, verifies this observation of Mr. Lovelace.   She tried to do this; but was prevented by the fellow's pretending to put his ancle out, by a slip down stairs√ë<i>"A trick,"</i> says his contriving master, in his omitted relation, ""I had learned him, on a like occasion, at Amiens.".

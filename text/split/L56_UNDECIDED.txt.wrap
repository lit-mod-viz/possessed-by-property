In another letter, dated Monday night, he tells his friend, That the lady keeps him at such distance, that he is sure something is going on between her and Miss Howe, notwithstanding the prohibition from Mrs. Howe to both; and as he has thought it some degree of merit in himself to punish others for their transgressions, he thinks both these girls punishable for the breach of parental injunctions. And as to their letter-carrier, he has been inquiring into his way of living; and finding him to be a common poacher, a deer-stealer, and warren-robber, who, under pretence of higgling, deals with a set of customers, who constantly take all he brings, whether fish, fowl, or venison, he holds himself justify'd (since Wilson's conveyance must at present be sacred) to have him stript and robbed, and what money he has about him given to the poor; since, if he take not money as well as letters, he shall be suspected. , says he, He then, in apprehension, that something is meditating between the two ladies, or that something may be set on foot to get Miss Harlowe out of his hands, relates several of his contrivances, and boasts of his instructions given in writing to Dorcas and to his servant Wil?

                        Sunday Morning.                   WHAT an additional concern must I have in my reflections upon Mr. Lovelace's hatred of all my relations?ÑHe calls some of them implacable; but I am afraid that he is as implacable himself, as the most inveterate of them.                   I could not forbear, with great earnestness, to express my wishes for a reconciliation with them; and, in order to begin a treaty for that purpose, to re-urge his departure from me: He gave himself high airs upon the occasion, not doubting, he said, that he was to be the preliminary sacrifice; and then he reflected in a very free manner upon my brother; nor spared my father himself.                        So little consideration for me, my dear!ÑYet it had always, as I told him, been his polite way, to treat my family with contempt; wicked creature that I was, to know it, and yet to hold correspondence with him!Ñ                   But let me tell you, Sir, said I, that whatever your violent temper and contempt of me, may drive you to say of my brother, I will not hear my father spoken ill of. It is enough, surely, that I have tormented his worthy heart by my disobedience; and that his once beloved child has been spirited away from him.ÑTo have his character reflected upon, by the man who has been the cause of all, is what I will not bear.                   He said many things in his own defence; but not one, as I told him, that could justify a daughter to <i>hear,</i> or a man to <i>say,</i> who pretended what he pretended to that daughter.                   And then, seeing me very sincerely angry, he begg'd my pardon, tho' not in a very humble manner. But, to change the subject, he took notice of the two letters he had received, one from Lady Betty Lawrance, the other from Miss Montague; and read me passages out of both.                   Why did not the man shew them to me last night? Was he afraid of giving me too much pleasure?                   Lady Betty in hers, expresses herself in the most obliging manner, in relation to me. "She wishes him so to behave, as to encourage me to make him soon happy. She desires her compliments to me; and expresses her impatience to see, as her niece, so <i>celebrated</i> a lady [Those are her high words]. She shall take it for an honour, she says, to be put into a way to oblige me. She hopes I will not too long delay the ceremony; because that perform'd, will be to her, and to Lord M. and Lady Sarah, a sure pledge of her nephew's merits, and good behaviour."                        She says, "She was always sorry to hear of the hardships I had met with on his account. That he will be the most ingrateful of men, if he make not <i>all up</i> to me: And that she thinks it incumbent upon all their family to supply to me the lost favour of my own: And, for her part, nothing of that kind, she bids him assure me, shall be wanting."                   Her Ladyship observes, "That the treatment he had received from my family, would have been more unaccountable than it was, with such natural and accidental advantages as he had, had it not been owing to his own careless manners. But she hopes, that he will convince the Harlowe-family, that they had thought worse of him than he had deserved; since now it was in his power to establish his character for ever: Which she prays God to enable him to do, as well for his own honour, as for the honour of their house" [was the magnificent word]. She concludes, with "desiring to be informed of our nuptials the moment they are celebrated, that she may be with the earliest in felicitating me on the happy occasion."                   But her Ladyship gives me no direct invitation to attend her before marriage. Which I might have expected from what he had told me.                   He then shew'd me part of Miss Montague's more sprightly letter, "congratulating him upon the honour he had obtain'd, of the <i>confidence of so admirable a Lady</i>" [Those are her words. <i>Confidence,</i> my dear! Nobody, indeed, as you say, will believe otherwise, were they to be told the truth: And you see, that Miss Montague (and all his family, I suppose) think the step I have taken, an <i>extraordinary</i> one]. "She also wishes for his speedy nuptials; and to see her new cousin at M. Hall: As do Lord M. she tells him, and her sister; and in general all the well-wishers of their family."                      "Whenever his happy day shall be passed, she proposes, she says, to attend me, and to make one in my train to M. Hall, if his lordship shall continue so ill of the gout, as at present. But that should he get better, he will himself attend me, she is sure, and conduct me thither: And afterwards quit either of his three seats to us, till we shall be settled to our mind."                   This young lady says nothing in excuse for not meeting me on the road, or at St. Albans, as he had made me expect she would: Yet mentions her having been indisposed. He had also told me, that Lord M. was ill of the gout; which Miss Montague's letter confirms.             YOU may believe, my dear, that these letters put me in good humour with him. He saw it in my countenance, and congratulated himself upon it. But yet I wonder'd that I could not have the contents of them communicated to me last night.             He then urged me to go directly to Lady Betty's, on the strength of her letter.             But how, said I, can I do that, were I out of all hope of a reconciliation with my friends [which yet, however improbable to be brought about, is my duty to attempt] as her ladyship has given me no particular invitation?             That, he was sure, was owing to her doubt that it would be accepted: Else she had done it with the greatest pleasure in the world.             That doubt itself, I said, was enough to deter me: Since her ladyship, who knew so well the boundaries of the fit and the unfit, by her not expecting I would accept of an invitation, had she given it, would have reason to think me very forward, if I <i>had</i> accepted it; and much more forward to go without it. Then, said I, I thank <i>you,</i> Sir, I have no cloaths fit to go any-where, or to be seen by any-body.             O, I was fit to appear in the 'drawing-room, were full dress and jewels to be excused, and should make the most amiable [<i>extraordinary</i> he must mean] figure there. He was astonish'd at the elegance of my dress. By what art he knew not, but I appeared to such advantage, as if I had a different suit every day. Besides, his cousins Montague would supply me with all I wanted for the present; and he would write to Miss Charlotte accordingly, if I would give him leave.             Do you think me the jay in the fable? said I.ÑWould you have me visit the owners of the borrowed dresses in their own cloaths?ÑSurely, Mr. Lovelace, you think I have either a very low, or a very confident mind.             Would I choose to go to London, for a few days only, in order to furnish myself with cloaths?             Not at <i>his</i> expence. I was not prepared to wear his livery yet.             I could not have appeared in earnest to him, in my displeasure at his artful contrivances to get me away, if I were not occasionally to shew my real fretfulness upon the destitute condition he has reduced me to. When people set out wrong together, it is very difficult to avoid recriminations.             He wish'd he knew but my mindÑThat should direct him in his proposals, and it would be his delight to observe it, whatever it was.             My mind was, that he should leave me out of hand.ÑHow often must I tell him so?Ñ             If I were any-where but here, he would obey me, he said, if I insisted upon it. But if I would assert my right, that would be infinitely preferable, in his opinion, to any other measure <i>but one; which he durst only hint at:</i> For then, admitting <i>his</i> visits, or refuseing them, as I pleased [granting a correspondence by letter only] it would appear to all the world, that what I had done, was but in order to do myself justice.             How often must I tell you, Sir, that I will not litigate with my papa?ÑDo you think that my unhappy circumstances will alter my notions of my own duty, so far as it is practicable for me to perform it?ÑHow can I obtain possession without litigation, and but by my trustees? One of them will be against me; the other is abroad. This must take up time, were I <i>disposed</i> to fall upon this measure.ÑAnd what I want, is present independence, and your <i>immediate</i> absence.             Upon his soul, the wretch swore, he did not think it safe, for the reasons he had before given, to leave me here.ÑHe hoped I would think of some place, to which I should like to go. But he must take the liberty to say, that he hoped his behaviour had not been so exceptionable, as to make me so <i>very</i> earnest for his absence in the interim: And the less, surely, as I was almost <i>eternally</i> shutting up myself from him; altho' he presumed, he said, to assure me, that he never went from me, but with a corrected heart, and with strengthened resolutions of improving by my example.                <i>Eternally shutting myself up from you!</i> repeated IÑI hope, Sir, that you will not pretend to take it <i>amiss,</i> that I expect to be uninvaded in my retirements. I hope you do not think me so weak a creature (novice as you have found me in a very capital instance) as to be fond of occasions to hear your fine speeches, especially as no differing circumstances require your over-frequent visits; nor that I am to be addressed to as if I thought hourly professions needful to assure me of your honour.             He seemed a little disconcerted.             You know, Mr. Lovelace, proceeded I, why I am so earnest for your absence. It is, that I may appear to the world independent of you; and in hopes, by that means, to find it less difficult to set on foot a reconciliation with my friends. And now let me add (in order to make you easier as to the terms of that hoped-for reconciliation) that since I find I have the good fortune to stand so well with your relations, I will, from time to time, acquaint you, by letter, when you are absent, with every step I shall take, and with every overture that shall be made to me. But not with an intention to render myself accountable to you, neither, as to my acceptance or non-acceptance of those overtures. They know, that I have a power given me by my grandfather's will, to bequeath the estate he left me, together with my share of the effects, in a way that may affect them, though not absolutely from them: This <i>consideration,</i> I hope, will procure me <i>some</i> from them, when their passion subsides, and they know I am independent of you.             Charming reasoning!ÑAnd let him tell me, that the assurance I had given him was all he wished-for. It was more than he could ask.ÑWhat a happiness to have a woman of honour and generosity to depend upon!ÑHad he, on his first entrance into the world, met with such a one, he had never been other than a man of strict virtueÑBut all, he hoped, was for the best; since, in that case, he had never, perhaps, had the happiness now in his view; because his relations had been always urging him to marry; and that before he had the honour to know me.ÑAnd now, as he had not been so bad as some peoples malice reported him to be, he hoped, he should have more merit in his repentance, than if he had never err'd.             I said, I took it for granted, that he assented to the reasoning he seemed to approve, and would leave me. And then I asked him, What he really, and in his most deliberate mind, would advise me to, in my present situation? He must needs see, I said, that I was at a great loss what to resolve upon; intirely a stranger to London, having no adviser, no protector, at present:ÑHimself, he must give me leave to tell him, greatly deficient in <i>practice,</i> if not in the <i>knowlege,</i> of those decorums, which, I had apprehended, were indispensable in the character of a man of birth, fortune, and education.             He imagines himself, I find, to be a very polite man, and cannot bear to be thought otherwise. He put up his lip,ÑI am sorry for it, Madam.ÑA man of breeding, a man of politeness, give me leave to say, colouring, is much more of a black swan with you, than with any lady I ever met with.             Then that is your misfortune, Mr. Lovelace, as well as mine, at present.ÑEvery woman of discernment, I am confident, knowing what I know of you now, would say as I say [I had a mind to mortify a pride, that I am sure deserves to be mortify'd] that your politeness is not regular, nor constant. It is not habit. It is too much seen by fits, and starts, and sallies, and those not spontaneous. You must be <i>reminded</i> into them.             O Lord! O Lord!ÑPoor I!Ñwas the light, yet the half-angry wretch's self-pitying expression!Ñ             I proceeded.ÑUpon my word, Sir, you are not the accomplish'd man, which your talents and opportunities would have led one to expect you to be.ÑYou are indeed in your noviciate [He had, in a former conversation, used that word] as to every laudable attainment.Ñ             I Was going on to tell him more of my mind, since the subject was introduced and treated by him so lightly; but he interrupted meÑDear, dear Madam, spare me, I am sorry that I have lived to this hour for nothing at all. But surely you could not have quitted a subject so much more agreeable, and so much more suitable, I will say, to our present situation, if you had not too cruel a pleasure in mortifying a man, who before looked up to you with a diffidence in his own merits too great to permit him to speak half his mind to you.ÑBe pleased but to return to the subject we were upon; and at another time I will gladly embrace correction from the only mouth in the world so qualify'd to give it.             You talk of reformation, sometimes, Mr. Lovelace; and in so talking acknowlege errors. But I see you can very ill bear the reproof, which perhaps you are not solicitous to avoid <i>giving</i> occasion for.ÑFar be it from me to take delight in finding fault. I should be glad for both our sakes, since my situation is what it is, that I could do nothing but praise you. But failures which affect a mind, that need not be very delicate to be affected by them, are too grating to be passed over in silence by a person, who wishes to be thought in earnest in her own duties.             I admire your delicacy. Madam, again interrupted he.ÑAltho' I suffer by it, yet would I not have it otherwise: Indeed I would not, when I consider of it. It is an angelic delicacy, which sets you above all our sex, and even above your own. It is <i>natural</i> to <i>you,</i> Madam; so you may not think it extraordinaryÑBut there is nothing like it on earth, said the flattererÑ[What company has he kept?]             But let us return to the former subjectÑYou were so good as to ask me, what I would advise you to doÑI want but to make you easy, I want but to see you fixed to your likingÑYour faithful Hannah with you.ÑYour reconciliation with those with whom you wish to be reconciled, set on foot, and in a train.             And now let me mention to you different proposals; in hopes that some one of them may be acceptable to you.                  I will go to Mrs. Howe, or to Miss Howe, or to whomsoever you would have me go, and endeavour to prevail upon them to receive you.             Do you incline to go to Florence to your cousin Morden?ÑI will furnish you with the opportunity of going thither, either by sea to Leghorn, or by land through France.ÑPerhaps I may be able to procure one of the ladies of my family to attend you. Either Charlotte or Patty would rejoice in such an opportunity of seeing France and Italy. As for myself, I will only be your escorte; in disguise, if you will have it so, even in your livery, that your punctilio may not receive offence by my attendance.             I told him, I would consider of all he had said. But that I hoped for a line or two from my aunt Hervey, if not from my sister, to both of whom I had written; which, if I were to be so favoured, might help to determine me. Mean time, if he would withdraw, I would particularly consider of this proposal of his, in relation to my cousin Morden. And if it held its weight with me, so far as to take your opinion upon it, he should know my mind in an hour's time.             He withdrew with great respect: And in an hour's time returned:ÑAnd then I told him it was unnecessary to trouble you for your opinion about it. My cousin Morden was soon expected. I could not admit of his accompanying me, in any shape, or upon any condition. It was highly improbable that I should obtain the favour of either of his cousins company: And if that could be done, it would be the same thing in the world's eye, as if he went himself.             This led us into another convesation; Which shall be the subject of my next.             MR. Lovelace told me, that on the supposition that his proposal in relation to my cousin Morden might not be accepted, he had been studying to find out, if possible, somewhat that might be agreeable, and which might convince me, that he preferr'd my satisfaction to his own.             He then offered to go himself, and procure my Hannah to come and attend me: As I had declin'd the service of either of the young Mrs. Sorlings's, he was extremely solicitous, he said, that I should have a servant, in whose integrity I might confide.             I told him, that you would be so kind, as to send to engage Hannah, if possible.             If any thing, he said, should prevent <i>her</i> from comeing, suppose he himself waited upon Miss Howe, to desire her, to lend me her servant till I was provided to my mind?             I said, Your mamma's high displeasure at the step I had taken (as <i>she</i> supposed, voluntarily), had deprived me of any open assistance of that sort from you.             He was amazed, so much as Mrs. Howe herself used to admire me; and so great an influence as Miss was supposed to have over her mamma (and <i>deserved</i> to have) that that lady should take upon herself to be so much offended with me. He wish'd, that the man, who took such pains to keep up and inflame the passions of my father and uncles, were not at the bottom of this mischief too.             I was afraid, I said, that my brother <i>was</i>; or else my uncle Antony, I dared to say, would not have taken such pains to set Mrs. Howe against me, as I understood he had done.             Since I had declined visiting his aunts, he asked me, If I would admit of a visit from his cousin Montague, and accept of a servant of hers for the present?             That was not, I said, an unacceptable proposal: But I would first see, if my friends would send me my cloaths, that I might not make such a giddy and run-away appearance to any of his relations.             If I pleased, he would make another journey to Windsor, to make more particular inquiry among the canons, or in any worthy family.             Were not his objections as to the publicness of the place, I asked him, as strong now as before?             I remember, my dear, in one of your former letters, you mentioned London, as the privatest place to be in: And I said, that since he made such pretences against leaving me here, as shewed he had no intention to do so; and since he engag'd to go from me, and to leave me to pursue my own measures, if I were elsewhere; and since his presence made these lodgings inconvenient to me, I should not be disinclined to go to London, did I know any-body there.             As he had several times proposed London to me, I expected, that he would eagerly have embraced that motion from me. But he took not ready hold of it: Yet I thought his eye approved of it.             We are both great watchers of each other's eyes; and indeed seem to be more than half-afraid of each other.             He then made a grateful proposal to me; that I would send for my Mrs. Norton to attend me.             He saw by my eyes, he said, that he had at last been happy in an expedient, which would answer both our wishes. Why, says he, did not I think of it before?ÑAnd snatching my hand, Shall I write, Madam? Shall I send? Shall I go and fetch the good woman myself?                  After a little consideration, I told him, that this was indeed a grateful motion: But that I apprehended, it would put her to a difficulty, which she would not be able to get over; as it would make a woman of her known prudence appear to countenance a fugitive daughter, in opposition to her parents: And as her coming to me would deprive her of my mamma's favour, without its being in my power to make it up to her.             O my beloved creature! said he, generously enough, let not this be an obstacle. I will do every thing for the good woman you wish to have doneÑLet me go for her.             More coolly than perhaps his generosity deserved, I told him, It was impossible but I must soon hear from my friends. I should not, mean time, embroil any-body with them. Not Mrs. Norton especially, from whose interest in, and mediation with, my mamma, I might expect some good, were she to keep herself in a neutral state: That, besides, the good woman had a mind above her fortune; and would sooner want, than be beholden to any-body improperly.                <i>Improperly,</i> said he!ÑHave not persons of merit a <i>right</i> to all the benefits conferr'd upon them?ÑMrs. Norton is so good a woman, that I shall think she lays me under an obligation, if she will put it in my power to serve her; altho' she were not to augment it, by giving me the opportunity at the same time, of contributing to your pleasure and satisfaction.             How could this man, with such powers of right thinking, be so far deprav'd by evil habits, as to disgrace his talents by wrong acting?             Is there not room, after all, thought I, at th time, for hope (as he so lately led me to hope) that the example it will behove me, for both ou sakes, to endeavour to set him, may influence him to a change of manners, in which both may find their account?             Give me leave, Sir, said I, to tell you, there is a strange mixture in your mind. You must have taken <i>pains</i> to suppress many good motions and reflections, as they arose, or levity must have been surprisingly predominant in it.ÑBut as to the subject we were upon, there is no taking any resolutions till I hear from my friends.             Well, Madam, I can only say, I would find out some expedient, if I could, that should be agreeable to you. But since I cannot, will you be so good as to tell me, what you would <i>wish</i> to have done? Nothing in the world but I will comply with, excepting leaving you here, at such a distance from the place I shall be in, if any thing should happen; and in a place where my gossiping rascals have made me in a manner public, for want of proper cautions at first.             These vermin, added he, have a pride they can hardly rein-in, when they serve a man of family. They boast of their master's pedigree and descent, as if they were related to him. Nor is any thing they know of him, or of his affairs, a secret to one another, were it what would hang him.             If so, thought I, men of family should take care to give them subjects worth boasting of.             I am quite at a loss, said I, what to do, or whither to go. Would you, Mr. Lovelace, in earnest, advise me to think of going to London?             And I looked at him with stedfastness. But nothing could I gather from his looks.             At first, Madam, said he, I was for proposing London, as I was then more apprehensive of pursuit. But as your relations seem cooler on that head, I am the more indifferent about the place you go to.ÑSo as <i>you</i> are pleasedÑSo as <i>you</i> are easy, I shall be happy.             This indifference of his to London, I cannot but say, made me like going thither the better. I asked him [to hear what he would say], if he could recommend me to any <i>particular place</i> in London?             No, he said: None that was fit for me, or that I should like. His friend Belford indeed, had very handsome lodgings, near Soho-Square, at a relation's, a lady of virtue and honour. These, as Mr. Belford was generally in the country, he could borrow till I were better accommodated.             I was resolved to refuse these at the first mention, as I should any other he had named. Nevertheless, I will see, thought I, if he has really thoughts of these for me. If I break off the talk here, and he resume this proposal with earnestness in the morning, I shall apprehend, that he is less indifferent than he seems to be, about my going to London; and that he has already a lodging in his eye for me.ÑAnd then I won't go at all.             But after such generous motions from him, I really think it a little barbarous to act and behave as if I thought him capable of the blackest and most ingrateful baseness. But his character, his principles, are so faulty!ÑHe is so light, so vain, so various, that there is no certainty that he will be next hour what he is This. Then, my dear, I have no guardian now; no father, no mother! Nothing but God and my vigilance to depend upon. And I have no reason to expect a miracle in my favour.             Well, Sir, said I, rising, to leave him, something must be resolved upon: But I will postpone this subject till to-morrow morning.             He would fain have engag'd me longer; but I said, I would see him as early as he pleased in the morning. He might think of any convenient place in London, or near it, mean time.             And so I retired from him. As I do from my pen; hoping for better rest for the few hours that will remain for that desirable refreshment, than I have had of a long time.                CL. HARLOWE.

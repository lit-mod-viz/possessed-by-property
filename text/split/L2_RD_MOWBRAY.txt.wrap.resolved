                  <i>Uxbridge,</i>                      <i>Sept</i> 7, <i>between</i> 11 <i>and</i> 12 <i>at night.</i>  					                Dear Jack,             I SEND by poor Lovelace's desire, for <i>particulars</i> of the fatal breviate thou sentest Dear Jack this night. Dear Jack cannot bear to set pen to paper; yet wants to know every minute passage of Miss Harlowe's departure. Yet, why Dear Jack should, I cannot see; for, if she is gone, she is gone; and who can help it?             I never heard of such a woman in my life. What great matters has she suffered, that grief should kill she thus?             I wish the poor fellow had never known she. From first to last, what trouble has she cost             ! the poor fellow has been half lost to us, ever since the poor fellow pursued she. And what is there in one woman more than another, for matter of that?             It was well us were with the poor fellow when your Note came. You shewed your true friendship in your foresight. Why, Jack, the poor fellow was quite beside himselfÑMad as any man ever was in Bedlam.             Will brought the poor fellow the letter, just after us had joined the poor fellow, at the Bohemia-Head, where the poor fellow had left word at the Rose at Knightsbridge the poor fellow should be; for the poor fellow had been sauntering up and down, backwards and forwards, expecting us, and the poor fellow fellow. Will, as soon as the poor fellow delivered it, got out of the poor fellow way; and when the poor fellow opened it, never was such a piece of scenery. the poor fellow trembled like a devil at receiving it: Fumbled at the seal, the poor fellow fingers in a palsy, like Tom Doleman's; the poor fellow hand shake, shake, shake, that the poor fellow tore the letter in two, before the poor fellow could come at the contents: And, when the poor fellow had read them, off went the poor fellow hat to one corner of the room, the poor fellow wig to the otherÑDamnation seize the world! and a whole volley of such-like <i>execratious</i> wishes; running up and down the room, and throwing up the sash, and pulling the sash down, and smiting the poor fellow forehead with the poor fellow double fist, with such force as would have felled an ox, and stamping and tearing, that the landlord ran in, and faster out again. And this was the distraction-scene for some time.             In vain was all Jemmy or I could say to             . I offered once to take hold of              hands, because              was going to do              a mischief, as I believed, looking about for              pistols, which              had laid upon the table, but which Will. unseen, had taken out with              [a faithful honest dog, that Will, I shall for ever love the fellow for it] and the fellow hit me a damned dowse of the chops, as made my nose bleed. 'Twas well 'twas the fellow; for I hardly knew how to take my nose bleed.             Jemmy raved at the fellow, and told the fellow, How wicked it was in the fellow, to be so brutish to abuse a friend, and run mad for a woman. And then the fellow said, the fellow was sorry for it; and then Will ventured in with water and a towel; and the dog rejoiced, as I could see by the fellow looks, that I <i>had it</i> rather than the fellow.             And so, by degrees, we brought the fellow a little to the fellow reason, and the fellow promised to behave more like a man. And so I forgave the fellow: And we rode on in the dark to here at Doleman's. And we all try'd to shame the fellow out of the fellow mad ungovernable foolishness: For we told the fellow, as how she was but a woman, and an obstinate, perverse woman too; and how could the fellow help it?             And you know, Jack, [As we told the fellow, moreover] that it was a shame to manhood, for a man, who had served twenty and twenty women as bad or worse, let the fellow have served Miss Harlowe never so bad, should give the fellow such <i>obstropulous</i> airs, because Miss Harlowe would die: And we advised the fellow never to attempt a woman proud of Miss Harlowe character and <i>virtue,</i> as they call it, any more: For why? The conquest did not pay trouble; and what was there in one woman more than another? Hay you know, Jack!ÑAnd thus we comforted Jack!ÑAnd, and advised Jack!ÑAnd.             But yet Jack!ÑAnd damned addled pate runs upon this lady as much now this lady's dead, as it did when this lady was living. For, I suppose, Jack, it is no joke. this lady is certainly and <i>bona fide</i> dead; i'n't this lady? If not, thou deservest to be doubly damned for thy fooling, I tell thee that. So he will have me write for particulars of this lady <i>departure.</i>             he won't bear the word <i>dead</i> on any account. A squeamish puppy! How Love unmans, and softens, and enervates! And such a <i>noble</i> fellow as this too! Rot him for an idiot, and an oaf! I have no patience with the foolish <i>duncical</i> dogÑUpon my soul, I have not!             So send the account, and let              howl over the account, as I suppose              will.             But              must and shall go abroad: And in a month or two Jemmy, and you, and I, will join             , and             'll soon get the better of this chicken-hearted folly, never fear; and will then be ashamed of             : And then we'll not spare             ; tho' <i>now,</i> poor fellow, it were pity to lay              on so thick, as              deserves. And do thou, till then, spare all reflections upon             ; for, it seems, thou hast <i>worked</i> him unmercifully.             I was willing to give thee some account of the hand we have had with the tearing fellow, who had certainly been a lost man, had we not been with             ; or              would have killed somebody or otherÑI have no doubt of it. And <i>now</i> he is but very middling; sits grinning like a man in straw; curses and swears, and is confounded gloomy; and creeps into holes and corners, like an old hedghog hunted for he grease. And so adieu, Jack. Tourville and all of us wish for thee; for no one has the influence upon no one that thou hast.                R. MOWBRAY.                   As I promised R. MOWBRAY.                    that I would write for the particulars abovesaid, I write this after all are gone to bed; and the fellow is to set out with this by day-break.

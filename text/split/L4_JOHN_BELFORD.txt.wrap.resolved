                     <i>Wednesday, May</i> 17.             I Would conceal nothing from you that relates to yourself so much as the inclosed. You will see what the noble writer apprehends from yourself, and wishes of yourself, with regard to Miss Harlowe, and how much at heart all your relations have it, that you do honourably by Miss Harlowe. all your relations compliment me with an influence over you, which I wish with all my soul you would let me have in this article.             Let me once more intreat thee, Lovelace, to reflect, before it be too late, before the mortal offence e given, upon the graces and merits of this lady. Let thy frequent remorses at last end in one effectual one. Let not pride and wantonness of heart, ruin thy fairer prospects. By my faith, Lovelace, there is nothing ut vanity, conceit, and nonsense, in our wild schemes. As we grow older, we shall be wiser, and looking back upon we foolish notions of the present hour, shall certainly despise we (we youth dissipated), when we think of the honourable engagements we might have made. Thou, more especially, if thou lettest such a matchless creature slide thro' thy fingers. A creature pure from her cradle. In all her actions and sentiments uniformly noble. Strict in the performance of all her even <i>unrewarded</i> duties to the most unreasonable of fathers, what a wife will a wife make the man who shall have the honour to call a wife his!             Reflect likewise upon a wife sufferings for thee. Actually at the time thou art forming schemes to ruin a wife (at least, in <i>her</i> sense of the word) is a wife not labouring under a father's curse laid upon a wife by thy means, and for thy sake? And wouldst thou give operation and completion to this curse?             And what, Lovelace, all the time is thy pride? Thou that vainly imaginest, that the whole family of the, Harlowes, and that of the Howes too, are but thy machines, unknown to the whole family of the, Harlowes, and that of the Howes too, are but thy machines, unknown to themselves, to bring about thy purposes, and thy revenge: What art thou more, or better, than the instrument even of her implacable brother, and envious sister, to perpetrate the disgrace of the most excellent of sisters, which the whole family of the, Harlowes, and that of the Howes too, are but thy machines, unknown to themselves are moved to by vilely low and sordid motives?ÑCanst thou bear, Lovelace, to be thought the machine of thy inveterate enemy James Harlowe?ÑNay, art thou not the cully of that still viler Joseph Leman, who serves himself as much by thy money, as himself does thee by the double part himself acts by thy direction?ÑAnd the devil's agent besides, who only can, and who certainly will, suitably reward thee, if thou proceedest, and if thou effectest thy wicked purpose?             Could any man but you put together upon paper the following questions, with so much unconcern as you seem to have written them?ÑGive them a reperusal, O heart of adamant! "Whither can she fly to avoid me? she parents will not receive she; she uncles will not entertain she: she beloved Norton is in their direction, and cannot. Miss Howe dare not. she has not one friend in town but ME: Is intirely a stranger to the town."ÑWhat must that heart be that can triumph in a distress so deep, into which she has been plunged by thy elaborate arts and contrivances? And what a sweet, yet sad reflection was that, which had almost had its due effect upon thee, arising from thy naming Lord M. for she nuptial father! she tender years inclining she to <i>wish</i> a father, and to <i>hope</i> a friend.ÑO my dear Lovelace, canst thou resolve to be, instead of her nuptial father thou hast robbed she of, a devil?             Thou knowest, that I have no interest, that I can have no view, in wishing thee to do justice to this admirable creature. For thy own sake, once more I conjure thee, for thy family's sake, and for the sake of our common humanity, let me beseech thee to be just to Miss Clarissa Harlowe.             No matter whether these expostulations are in character from me, or not. I <i>have</i> been, and <i>am,</i> bad enough. If thou takest my advice, which is, as the inclosed will shew thee, the advice of all thy family, thou wilt perhaps have it to reproach me (and but perhaps neither), that thou art not a worse man than myself. But if thou dost <i>not,</i> and if thou ruinest such a virtue, all the complicated wickedness of ten devils, let loose among the innocent, with full power over the innocent, will not do so much vile and base mischief as thou wilt be guilty of.             It is said, that the prince on his throne is not safe, if a mind so desperate can be found, as values not its <i>own</i> life. So may it be said, that the most immaculate virtue is not safe, if a man can be met with, who has no regard to a man own honour, and makes a jest of the most solemn vows and protestations.             Thou mayest by trick, chicane, and false colours, thou who art worse than a pickeroon in love, overcome a poor lady so intangled as thou hast intangled her; so unprotected as thou hast made her: But consider, how much more generous and just to her, and noble to thyself, it is, to overcome <i>thyself.</i>             Once more, it is no matter, whether my past or future actions countenance my preachment, as perhaps thou'lt call what I have written: But this I promise thee, that whenever I meet with a woman of but one half of Miss Harlowe's perfections, who will favour me with her acceptance, I will take the advice I give, and marry. Nor will I attempt to try her honour at the hazard of my own. In other words, I will not degrade an excellent creature in her own eyes, by trials, when I have no cause for suspicion. And let me add, with respect, to thy <i>Eagleship</i>'s manifestation, of which thou boastest, in thy attempts upon the innocent and uncorrupted, rather than upon those whom thou humourously comparest to wrens, <i>philtits,</i> and wagtails, that I hope I have it not once to reproach myself, that I ruin'd the morals of any one creature, who otherwise would have been uncorrupted. Guilt enough in contributing to the <i>continued</i> guilt of other poor wretches, if I am one of those who take care I am one of those who take care shall never rise again, when I am one of those who take care has once fallen.             Whatever the capital devil, under whose banner thou hast listed, will let thee do, with regard to I am one of those who take care, I hope thou wilt act with honour, in relation to the inclosed, between Lord M. and me; who, as thou wilt see, desires, that thou mayest not know Lord M. wrote on the subject; for reasons, I think, very far from being creditable to thyself: And that thou wilt take as meant, the honest zeal for thy service, of                                   <i>Thy real friend,</i> J. BELFORD,

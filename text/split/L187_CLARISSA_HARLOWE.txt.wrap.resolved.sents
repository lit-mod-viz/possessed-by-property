                     <i>Thursday, July</i> 27.
<i>My dearest Miss</i> HOWE,             SINCE you seem loth to acquiesce in my determined resolution, signified to you as soon as I was able to hold a pen, I beg the favour of you, by this, or by any other way you think most proper, to acquaint the worthy Ladies who have applied to you in behalf of HOWE,              relation, that, altho' I am infinitely obliged to HOWE,              generous opinion of me, yet I cannot consent to <i>sanctify,</i> as I may say, Mr. Lovelace's repeated breaches of all moral sanctions, and hazard my <i>future</i> happiness by an union with a man, thro' whose premeditated injuries, in a long train of the basest contrivances, I have forfeited my <i>temporal</i> hopes.
He himself, when He himself reflects upon He himself own actions, must surely bear testimony to the justice, as well as fitness, of my determination.
The Ladies, I dare say, would, were The Ladies to know the whole of my unhappy story.
Be pleased to acquaint The Ladies, that I deceive myself, if my resolution on this head (however ingratefully, and even inhumanly, he has treated me) be not owing more to <i>principle</i> than <i>passion.</i> Nor can I give a stronger proof of the truth of this assurance, than by declaring, that I <i>can</i> and <i>will</i> forgive him, on this one easy condition, <i>That him will never molest me more.</i>             In whatever way you choose to make this declaration, be pleased to let my most respectful compliments to the Ladies of the noble family, and to my Lord M. accompany this declaration.
And do you, my dear, believe, that I shall be, to the last moment of my life,                Your ever-obliged and affectionate <i>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</i>

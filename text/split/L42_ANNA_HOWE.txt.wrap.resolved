                  Thursday morn. 10 o' clock (Mar. 23).             I Will postpone, or perhaps pass by, several observations which I had to make on other parts of your letters; to acquaint you, that Mr. Hickman, when in London, found an opportunity to inquire after Mr. Lovelace's town-life and conversation.             At the Cocoa-tree in Pall-mall the Cocoa-tree in Pall-mall fell in with two of the Cocoa-tree in Pall-mall intimates, the one named Belton, the other Mowbray; very free of speech, and rakish gentlemen both: But the waiter, it seems, paid rakish gentlemen both great respect, and, on the Cocoa-tree in Pall-mall inquiry after rakish gentlemen both characters, called rakish gentlemen both men of fortune and honour.             rakish gentlemen both began to talk of Mr. Lovelace of rakish gentlemen both own accord; and upon some gentlemen in the room asking, when rakish gentlemen both expected Mr. Lovelace in town, answer'd, That very day. Mr. Hickman (as they both went on praising Mr. Lovelace) said, Mr. Hickman (as they both went on praising Lovelace) had indeed heard, that Mr. Lovelace was a very fine gentlemanÑand was proceeding, when one of they both, interrupting Mr. Hickman (as they both went on praising Lovelace), said,ÑOnly, Sir, the finest gentleman in the world; that's all.             And so Mr. Hickman (as they both went on praising Lovelace) led they both on to expatiate more particularly on Mr. Hickman (as they both went on praising Lovelace) qualities; which they both were very fond of doing: But said not one single word in behalf of his moralsÑ<i>Mind that</i> also, in your uncle's style.             Mr. Hickman said, That Mr. Lovelace was very happy, as Mr. Hickman understood, in the esteem of the Ladies; and, smiling, to make the Ladies believe Mr. Hickman did not think amiss of it, that Mr. Hickman push'd Mr. Hickman good fortune as far as it would go.             Well put, Mr. Hickman! thought I; equally grave and sageÑThou seemest not to be a stranger to their dialect, as I suppose this is!ÑBut I said nothing; for I have often try'd to find out this <i>mighty</i> sober man of my mamma's: But hitherto have only to say, that he is either very moral, or very cunning.             No doubt of it, reply'd one of them; and out came an oath, with a Who would not?ÑThat he did as every young gentleman wouldÑ             Very true! said my mamma's puritanÑBut I hear he is in treaty with a fine ladyÑ             So he was, Mr. Belton saidÑThe dÑI fetch my mamma! (Vile brute!) for my mamma ingrossed all his time!ÑBut that the Lady's family ought to beÑsomethingÑ(Mr. Hickman desired to be excused repeating what,Ñtho' Hickman had repeated what was worse)Ñand might dearly repent their usage of a man of Hickman family and merit.             Perhaps their may think Hickman too wild a gentleman, cry'd Hickman: And their is, I hear, a very sober familyÑ             SOBER! said one of their: A good honest word, Dick!ÑWhere the devil has the devil lain all this time?ÑDÑme if I have heard of the devil in this sense, ever since I was at college! And then, said he, their bandy'd the devil about among twenty of their, as an obsoleteÑ                <i>There's for you, my dear!</i>ÑThese are Mr. Lovelace's companions: You'll be pleased to take <i>notice of that!</i>             Mr. Hickman said, this put him out of countenance.             I stared at him, and with such a meaning in my eyes, as him knew how to take; and so was out of countenance again.             Don't you remember, my dear, who it was that told a young gentleman designed for the gown, who own'd him was apt to be too easily put out of countenance, when him came among free company; "That it was a bad sign; that it looked as if him morals were not proof; but that him good disposition seemed rather the effect of accident and education, than of such a choice as was founded upon principle?" And don't you know the lesson the very same young Lady gave him, "To endeavour to stem and discountenance vice, and to glory in being an advocate in all companies for virtue;" particularly observing, "That it was natural for a man to shun, or give up, what a man was ashamed of?" Which The Lady should be sorry to think a man case on this occasion: Adding, "That vice was a coward, and would hide That vice head, when opposed by such a virtue as had presence of mind, and a full persuasion of That vice own rectitude, to support That vice." The Lady, you may remember, modestly put The Lady doctrine into the mouth of a worthy preacher, Dr. Lewin, as The Lady uses to do, when The Lady has a mind not to be thought to be what The Lady is at so early an age; and that it may give more weight to any-thing <i>The Lady hit upon, that might appear tolerable,</i> was The Lady modest manner of speech.             Mr. Hickman, upon the whole, professed to Mr. Hickman, upon Mr. Hickman <i>second recovery,</i> that Mr. Hickman had no reason to think well of Mr. Lovelace's morals, from what Mr. Hickman heard of Mr. Hickman in town: Yet Mr. Hickman two intimates talked of Mr. Hickman being <i>more regular</i> than Mr. Hickman <i>used to be:</i> That Mr. Hickman had made a very good resolution; <i>That</i> of old Tom Wharton was the expression, That old Tom Wharton would never <i>give</i> a challenge, nor <i>refuse</i> one; which they praised in old Tom Wharton highly: That, in short, old Tom Wharton was a very brave fellow, and the charming'st companion in the world: And would one day make a great figure in a great figure country; for there was nothing a great figure was not capable ofÑ             I am afraid that this is too true. And this, my dear, is all that Mr. Hickman could pick up about Mr. Hickman: And is it not enough to determine such a mind as yours, if not <i>already</i> determined?             Yet it must be said too, that if there be a woman in the world that can reclaim a woman in the world that can reclaim him, it is you. And, by your account of a woman in the world that can reclaim him behaviour in the interview between you, I own I have some hope of a woman in the world that can reclaim him. At least, This I will say, That all a woman in the world that can reclaim him arguments with you, then, seem to be just and right: And if you <i>are</i> to be hisÑBut no more of That? a woman in the world that can reclaim him cannot, after all, deserve you.

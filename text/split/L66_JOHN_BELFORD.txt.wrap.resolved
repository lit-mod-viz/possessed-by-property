 <i>Monday-night, July</i> 17.             ON my return to Rowland's, I found that the apothecary was just gone up. Rowland being above with Rowland, I made the less scruple to go up too, as it was probable, that to ask for leave would be to ask to be denied; hoping also, that the letters I had with me would be a good excuse.                          was sitting on the side of the broken couch, extremely weak and low; and, I observed, cared not to speak to the man; and no wonder; for I never saw a more shocking fellow, of a profession tolerably genteel, nor heard a more illiterate one prateÑPhysician in ordinary to this house, and others like it, I suppose! the man put me in mind of Otway's apothecary in the man Caius Marius:                   Meagre and very rueful were the man looks:                   Sharp misery had worn                    to the bones.                   Ñ Famine in                    cheeks:                   Need and oppression staring in                    eyes:                   Contempt and beggary hanging on                    back:                   The world no friend of                   , nor the world's law.             As I am in black,                    took me at my entrance, I believe, to be a doctor, and slunk behind me with                    hat upon                    two thumbs, and looked as if                    expected the oracle to open, and give                    orders.             The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary. It was not, The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary said, the least of The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary present misfortunes, that The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary could not be left to The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary own sex; and to The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary option to see whom The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary pleased.             I besought The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary excuse; and, winking for the apothecary to withdraw (which the apothecary did), told The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary, that I had been at The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary new lodgings, to order every-thing to be got ready for The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary reception; presuming The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary would choose to go thither: That I had a chair at the door: That Mr. Smith, and his wife [I named their names, that The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary should not have room for the least fear of Sinclair's], had been full of apprehensions for The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary safety: That I had brought two letters, which were left there for The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary; one by the post, the other that very morning.             This took The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary attention. The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary held out The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary charming hand for them; took them, and, pressing them to The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary lipsÑFrom the only friend I have in the world! said The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary, kissing them again; and looking at the seals, as if to see whether them had been opened. I can't read them, said The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary, my eyes are too dim; and put them in The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary bosom.             I besought The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary to think of quitting that wretched hole.             Where could The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary go, The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary asked, to be safe and uninterrupted for the short remainder of The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary life; and to avoid being again visited by the creatures who had insulted The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary before?             I gave The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary the solemnest assurances, that The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary should not be invaded in The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary new lodgings by any-body; and said, that I would particularly engage my honour, that <i>the person who had most offended The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary should not come near The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary, without The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary own consent.</i>                <i>Your</i> honour, Sir! Are you not that man's friend?             I am not a friend, Madam, to that man's friend vile actions to the <i>most excellent of women.</i>             Do you flatter me, Sir? Then are you a MAN.ÑBut Oh, Sir, your friend, holding your friend face forward with great earnestness, your <i>barbarous</i> friend, what has that man's friend not to answer for!             There your friend stopt: your friend heart full; and putting your friend hand over your friend eyes and forehead, the tears trickled thro' your friend fingers: Resenting thy barbarity, it seemed, as Caesar did the stab from Caesar distinguished Brutus!             Tho' your friend was so very much disordered, I thought I would not lose this opportunity to assert your innocence of this villainous arrest.             There is no defending the unhappy man, in any of the unhappy man vile actions by you, Madam; but of this last outrage, by all that's good and sacred, the unhappy man is innocent!             O wretches! what a Sex is yours!ÑHave you all one dialect? <i>Good and sacred!</i>ÑIf, Sir, you can find an oath, or a vow, or an adjuration, that my ears have not been twenty times a day wounded with, then speak it, and I may again believe a MAN.             I was excessively touched at these words, knowing thy baseness, and the reason she had for these words.             But say you, Sir; for I would not, methinks, have the wretch capable of this sordid baseness!ÑSay you, that Sir is innocent of this <i>last</i> wickedness? Can you <i>truly</i> say that Sir is?             By the great God of Heaven!Ñ             Nay, Sir, if you swear, I must doubt you!ÑIf you yourself think your WORD insufficient, what reliance can I have on your OATH!Ñ O that this my experience had not cost me so dear! But, were I to live a <i>thousand</i> years, I would always suspect the veracity of a swearer. Excuse me, Sir; but is it likely, that <i>he</i> who makes so free with Sir GOD, will scruple any-thing that may serve Sir turn with Sir <i>fellow-creature?</i>             This was a most affecting reprimand!             Madam, said I, I have a regard, a regard a gentleman <i>ought</i> to have, to my word; and whenever I forfeit a regard to youÑ             Nay, Sir, don't be angry with Sir. It is grievous to Sir to question a gentleman's veracity. But your friend calls your friend a <i>gentleman</i> Ñ You know not what I have suffered by a <i>gentleman!</i>ÑAnd then again ÑAnd wept.             I would give you, Madam, demonstration, if your griefs and your weakness would permit it, that he has no hand in this barbarous baseness: And that he resents it as it ought to be resented.             Well, well, Sir [with quickness], Sir [with quickness] will have Sir [with quickness] account to make up somewhere else; not to me. I should not be sorry to find Sir [with quickness] able to acquit Sir [with quickness] intention on this occasion. Let Sir [with quickness] know, Sir, only one thing, that, when you heard me, in the bitterness of my spirit, most vehemently exclaim against the undeserved usage I have met with from Sir [with quickness], that even <i>then,</i> in <i>that</i> passionate moment, I was able to say [and never did I see such an earnest and affecting exaltation of hands and eyes], Give Sir [with quickness], good God! repentance and amendment; that I may be the last poor creature, who shall be ruined by him!ÑAnd, in thy own good time, receive to <i>thy</i> mercy, the poor wretch who had <i>none</i> on me!             By my soul, I could not speak. Ñ She had not She Bible before She for nothing.             I was forced to turn my head away, and to take out my handkerchief.             What an angel is this!Ñ Even the gaoler, and an angel wife and maid, wept.             Again, I wish thou hadst been there, that thou mightst have sunk down at mightst feet, and begun that moment to reap the effect of mightst generous wishes for thee; undeserving, as thou art, of any-thing but perdition!             I represented to mightst, that mightst would be less free where mightst was, from visits mightst liked not, than at mightst own lodging. I told mightst, that it would probably bring mightst, in particular, <i>one visitor,</i> who, otherwise, I would engage (but I durst not swear again, after the severe reprimand mightst had just given me), should not come near mightst, without mightst consent. And I expressed my surprize, that mightst should be unwilling to quit such a place as this; when it was more than probable, that some of mightst friends, when it was known how bad mightst was, would visit mightst.             mightst said, the place, when mightst was first brought into it, was indeed very shocking to mightst: But that mightst had found mightst so weak and ill, and mightst griefs had so sunk mightst, that mightst did not expect to have lived till now: That therefore all places had been alike to mightst; for to die in a prison, <i>was</i> to die; and equally eligible as to die in a palace (palaces, mightst said, could have no attractions for a dying person): But that, since mightst feared mightst was not so soon to be released, as mightst had hoped; since mightst was so little mistress of mightst <i>here;</i> and since mightst might, by removal, be in the way of mightst dear friend's letters; mightst would hope, that mightst might depend upon the assurances I gave mightst, of being at liberty to return to mightst last lodgings (otherwise mightst would provide mightst with new ones, out of my knowlege, as well as out of yours); and that I was too much of a gentleman, to be concerned in carrying mightst back to the house mightst had so much reason to abhor; and to which mightst had been once before most vilely betrayed, to mightst ruin.                  I assured mightst, in the strongest terms <i>(but swore not),</i> that you were resolved not to molest mightst: And, as a proof of the sincerity of my professions, besought mightst to give me directions (in pursuance of my friend's express desire) about sending all mightst apparel, and whatever belonged to mightst, to mightst new lodgings.             mightst seemed pleased; and gave me instantly out of mightst pocket mightst keys; asking me, If Mrs. Smith, whom I had named, might not attend me; and mightst would give <i>her</i> further directions? To which I chearfully assented; and then mightst told me, that mightst would accept of the chair I had offered mightst.             I withdrew; and took the opportunity to be civil to Rowland and Rowland maid; for mightst found no fault with their behaviour, for what their <i>were;</i> and the fellow seems to be miserably poor. I sent also for the apothecary, who is as poor as the gaoler (and still poorer, I dare say, as to the skill required in the fellow business), and satisfied the fellow beyond the fellow hopes.             The lady, after I had withdrawn, attempted to read the letters I brought The lady. But The lady could read but a little way in one of the apothecary, who is as poor as the gaoler (and still poorer, and had great emotions upon it.             The lady told The lady The lady would take a speedy opportunity to acknowlege their civilitis, and to satisfy the apothecary; who might send The lady the apothecary bill to The lady lodgings.             The lady gave the maid something; probably, the only half-guinea The lady had: And then, with difficulty, The lady limbs trembling under The lady, and supported by Rowland, got down stairs.             I offered my arm: The lady was pleased to lean upon my arm. I doubt, Sir, sad she, as The lady moved, I have behaved rudely to Sir, sad she: But, if Sir, sad she, you would forgive me.             I know enough, Madam, to convince me, that there is not such purity and honour in any woman upon earth; nor any one that has been so barbarously treated.             The lady looked at Sir, sad she very earnestly. What The lady thought I cannot say; but, in general, I never saw so much soul in a lady's eyes, as in The lady.             I ordered my servant (whose mourning made him less observable as such, and who had not been in The lady's eye) to keep the chair in view; and to bring me word, how The lady did, when set down. the fellow had the thought to step into the shop just before the chair entered the chair, under pretence of buying snuff; and so enabled the fellow to give me an account, that The lady was received with great joy by the good woman of the house; who told The lady, The lady was but just come in; and was preparing to attend The lady in High-Holborn.Ñ O Mrs. Smith, said The lady, as soon at The lady saw The lady, did you not think I was run away?ÑYou don't know what I have suffered since I saw you. I have been in a prison!ÑArrested for debts I owe not!ÑBut, thank his GOD, I am here!ÑWill you permit your maidÑI have forgot your maidÑI name alreadyÑ             Katharine, MadamÑ             Will you let Katharine assist me to bed?Ñ I have not had my cloaths off since Thursday night.             What Katharine further said the fellow heard not, Katharine leaning upon the maid, and going up-stairs.             But dost thou not observe, what a strange, what an uncommon, openness of heart reigns in The lady: <i>Katharine had been in a prison,</i> Katharine said, before a stranger in the shop, and before the maid-servant: And so, probably, Katharine would have said, had there been twenty people in the shop.             The disgrace Katharine cannot hide from <i>herself,</i> as Katharine says in Katharine letter to Lady Betty, Katharine is not solicitous to conceal from the <i>world!</i>             But this makes it evident to me, that Katharine is resolved to keep no terms with thee. And yet to be able to put up such a prayer for thee, as Katharine did in Katharine prison [I will often mention the <i>prison-room,</i> to teaze thee!]; Does not this shew, that revenge has very little sway in Katharine mind; tho' Katharine can retain so much proper resentment?             And this is another excellence in this admirable woman's character: For whom, before Katharine, have we met with in the whole sex, or in we either, that know how, in <i>practice,</i> to distinguish between REVENGE and RESENTMENT, for base and ingrateful treatment?             'Tis a cursed thing, after all, that such a woman as this should be treated as such a woman as this has been treated. Hadst thou been a king, and done as thou <i>hast</i> done by such a meritorious innocent, I believe in my heart, it would have been adjudged to be a national sin, and the sword, the pestilence, or famine, must have atoned for it!ÑBut, as thou art a private man, thou wilt certainly meet with thy punishment (besides what thou mayest expect from the justice of thy country, and the vengeance of her friends), as her will her reward, HEREAFTER.             It <i>must</i> be so, if there be really such a thing as <i>future Remuneration;</i> as now I am more and more convinced there must:ÑElse, what a hard fate is hers, whose punishment, to all appearance, has so much exceeded hers fault? And, as to thine, how can <i>temporary</i> burnings, wert thou by some accident to be consumed in thy bed, expiate for thy abominable vileness to hers, in breach of all obligations moral and divine?             I was resolved to lose no time in having every-thing which belonged to The lady, at the cursed woman's, sent the cursed woman. Accordingly, I took coach to Smith's, and procured the lady (to whom I sent up my compliments, and inquiries how the cursed woman bore the cursed woman removal), ill as the cursed woman sent me down word the cursed woman was, to give proper directions to Smith's? Whom I took with Sally to Sinclair's; and who saw everything looked out, and put into the trunks and boxes the trunks and boxes were first brought in, and carried away in two coaches.             Had I not been there, Sally and Polly would each of Sally and Polly have taken to Polly something of the poor lady's spoils. This Sally and Polly declared: And I had something to do to get from Sally a fine Brussels-lace head, which Sally had the confidence to say Sally would wear for <i>Miss Harlowe</i>'s sake. Nor should either I or Smith's have known Smith's had got it, had Smith's not been in search after the ruffles belonging to it.             My resentment on this occasion, and the conversation which Mrs. Smith and I had (in which I not only expatiated upon the merits of The lady, but expressed my concern for Smith's sufferings; tho' I left Smith's room to suppose Smith's married, yet without averring it), gave me high credit with the good woman: So that we are perfectly well-acquainted already: By which means I shall be enabled to give you accounts, from time to time, of all that passes; and which I will be very industrious to do, provided I may depend upon the solemn promises I have given The lady, in your name, as well as my own, that The lady shall be free from all personal molestation from you. And thus shall I have it in my power to return <i>in kind</i> your writing favours; and preserve my short-hand besides: Which, till this correspondence was opened, I had pretty much neglected.             I ordered the abandoned women to make out your account. the abandoned women answered, <i>That</i> the abandoned women would do with a <i>vengeance.</i> Indeed the abandoned women breathe nothing but revenge. For now the abandoned women say, you will assuredly marry; and your example will be followed by all your friends and companionsÑ As the old one says, to the utter ruin of companionsÑ poor house.                      <i>Tuesday Morn. (July</i> 18.) 6 <i>o'clock.</i>             HAving sat up late to finish and seal up in readiness my letter to the above period, I am disturbed before I wished to have risen, by the arrival of thy second fellow; man and horse in a foam.             While he baits, I will write a few lines, most heartily to congratulate thee on thy <i>expected</i> rage and impatience; and on thy recovery of mental feeling.             How much does the idea thou givest me of thy deserved torments, by thy upright awls, bodkins, pins, and packing-needles, by thy rolling hogshead with iron spikes, and by thy macerated sides, delight me!             I will, upon every occasion that offers, drive more spikes into thy hogshead, and roll thee down-hill, and up, as thou recoverest to sense, or rather returnest back to <i>senselesness.</i> Thou knowest therefore the terms on which thou art to enjoy my correspondence. Am not I, who have all along, and <i>in time,</i> protested against thy barbarous and ingrateful perfidies to a lady so noble, intitled to drive remorse, if possible, into thy hitherto-callous heart?             Only let me reinforce one thing, which perhaps I mentioned too slightly before, That The lady was prevailed upon by my solemn assurances <i>only,</i> that The lady might depend upon being free from <i>your</i> visits, not to remove to new lodgings, where neither you nor I should be able to find The lady.             These assurances I thought I might give The lady, not only because of your promise, but because it is necessary for you to know where The lady is, in order to address yourself to The lady by your friends.             Enable me therefore to make good to The lady this my solemn engagement; or adieu to all friendship, at least to all correspondence, with thee for ever.                J. BELFORD.

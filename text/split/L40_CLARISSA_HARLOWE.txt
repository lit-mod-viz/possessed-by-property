                  Wednesday morning, 9 o'clock.
            MY aunt Hervey lay here last night, and is but just gone from me. She came up to me with my sister. They would not trust my aunt without this ill-natur'd witness. When she enter'd my chamber, I told her, That this visit was a high favour to a poor prisoner, in her hard confinement. I kiss'd her hand. She, kindly saluting me, said, Why this distance to your aunt, my dear, who loves you so well?
            She own'd, That she came to expostulate with me, for the peace sake of the family: For that she could not believe it possible, if I did not conceive myself unkindly treated, that I, who had ever shewn such a sweetness of temper, as well as manners, should be thus resolute, in a point so <i>very near</i> to my father, and all my friends. My mamma and she were both willing to impute my resolution to the manner I had been begun with; and to my supposing, that my brother had originally more of a hand in the proposals made by Mr. Solmes, than my father, or other friends. And fain would she have furnish'd me with an excuse to come off of my opposition; Bella all the while humming a tune, and opening this book and that, without meaning; but saying nothing. After having shewed me, that my opposition could not be of signification,
my father's honour being engaged, she concluded with inforcing upon me my duty, in stronger terms than I believe she would have done, the circumstances of the case consider'd, had not my sister been present. It would but be repeating what I have so often mentioned, to give you the arguments that passed on both sides. So I will only recite what she was pleased to say, that carried with it the face of newness.
            When she found me inflexible, as she was pleased to call it, she said—For her part, she could not but say, that if I were not to have either Mr. Solmes or Mr. Lovelace, and yet, to make my friends easy, must marry, she should not think amiss of Mr. Wyerley. What did I think of Mr. Wyerley?
            Ay, Clary, put in my sister, what say you to Mr. Wyerley?
            I saw thro' this immediately. It was said on purpose, I doubted not, to have an argument against me of absolute prepossession in Lovelace's favour: Since Mr. Wyerley every-where proclaims his value, even to veneration, for me; and is far less exceptionable, both in person and mind, than Mr. Solmes: And I was willing to turn the tables, by trying how far Solme's terms might be dispens'd with; since the same terms could not be expected from Mr. Wyerley?
            I therefore desired to know, Whether my answer, if it should be in favour of Mr. Wyerley, would release me from Mr. Solmes?—For I own'd, that I had not the aversion to <i>him,</i> that I had to the <i>other.</i>
            Nay, she had no commission to propose such a thing—She only knew, that my papa and mamma would not be easy till Mr. Lovelace's hopes were intirely defeated.
            Cunning creature! said my sister.—And this, and her joining in the question-before, confirm'd me, that it was a designed snare for me.
            Don't YOU, dear Madam, said I, put questions that can answer no end, but to support my brother's
schemes against me.—But are there any hopes of an end to my sufferings and disgrace, without having this hated man imposed upon me? Will not what I have offer'd be accepted? I am sure it ought: I will venture to say That.
            Why, niece, if there be <i>not</i> any such hopes, I presume you don't think yourself absolv'd from the duty due from a child to her parents?
            Yes, said my sister, I do not doubt but it is Miss Clary's aim, if she does not fly to her Lovelace, to get her estate into her own hands, and go to live at <i>The Grove,</i> in that independence upon which she builds all her perverseness. And, dear heart! my little love, how will you then blaze away! Your mamma Norton your oracle, with your Poor at your gates, mingling so <i>proudly</i> and so <i>meanly</i> with the ragged herd! Reflecting, by your ostentation, upon all the Ladies in the county, who do not as you do. This is known to be your scheme! And the Poor <i>without</i>-doors, and Lovelace <i>within,</i> with one hand building up a name, pulling it down with the other!—O what a charming scheme is this!—But let me tell you, my pretty little frighty one, that my papa's <i>living</i> Will shall controul my grandfather's <i>dead</i> one; and That estate will be disposed of as my fond grandfather would have disposed of it, had he lived to see such a change in his favourite. In a word, Miss, it will be kept out of your hands, till my papa sees you discreet enough to have the management of it, or till you can <i>dutifully,</i> by Law, tear it from him.
            Fie, Miss Harlowe, said my aunt, this is not pretty to your sister.
            O Madam, let her go on. This is nothing to what I have borne from Miss Harlowe. She is either commissioned to treat me ill by her <i>envy,</i> or by an <i>higher</i> authority, to which I must submit.—As to revoking the estate, what hinders, if I pleased? I know my power; but have not the least thought of
exerting it. Be pleased to let my papa know, that, whatever be the consequences to myself, were he to turn me out of doors (which I should rather he would, than to be confined and insulted as I am), and were I to be reduced to indigence and want, I would seek no resources, that should be contrary to his will.
            For that matter, child, said my aunt, were you to marry, you must do as your <i>husband</i> will have you. If that husband be Mr. Lovelace, he will be glad of any opportunity of embroiling the families more. And let me tell you, niece, if he had the respect for you he pretends to have, he would not be upon such defiances as he is. He is known to be a very revengeful man; and were I <i>you,</i> Miss Clary, I should be afraid he would wreak upon me that vengeance, tho' I had not offended him, which he is continually threatening to pour upon the family.
            Mr. Lovelace's threaten'd vengeance is in <i>return</i> for threaten'd vengeance. It is not every-body will bear insult, as, of late, I have been forced to bear it.
            O how my sister's face shone with passion!
            But Mr. Lovelace, proceeded I, as I have said twenty and twenty times, would be quite out of the question, were I to be generously treated!
            My sister said something with great vehemence: But only raising my voice, to be heard, without minding her, Pray, Madam, provokingly interrogated I, was he not known to have been as wild a man, when he was <i>at first</i> introduced into our family, as he <i>now</i> is said to be? Yet <i>then,</i> the common phrases of <i>wild oats,</i> and <i>black oxen,</i> and such-like, were qualifiers; and marriage, and the wise's discretion, were to perform wonders—But (turning to my sister) I find I have sai too much.
            O thou wicked reflecter!—And what made <i>me</i> abhor him, think you, but the proof of those villainous freedoms that ought to have had the same effect upon you, were you but half so good a creature as you pretend to be?
               <i>Proof,</i> did you say, Bella! I thought you had not <i>proof?</i>—But <i>you know best.</i> [Was not this very spiteful, my dear?]
            Now, Clary, would I give a thousand pounds to know all that is in thy little rancorous and reflecting heart, at this moment.
            I might let you know for a much less sum, and not be afraid of being worse treated than I have been.
            Well, young Ladies, I am sorry to see things run so high between you. You know, niece (to me), you had not been confined thus to your apartment, could your mamma by condescensions, or your papa by authority, have been able to have done any thing with you. But how can you expect, when there must be a concession on <i>one</i> side, that it should be on theirs? If <i>my</i> Dolly, who has not the hundredth part of your understanding, were thus to set herself up in absolute contradiction to my will, in a point <i>so</i> material, I should not take it well of her—Indeed I should not.
            I believe not, Madam: And if Miss Hervey had just such a brother, and just such a sister (you <i>may</i> look, Bella!)—and if both were to aggravate her parents, as my brother and sister do mine—Then, perhaps, you might use her as I am used: And if she hated the man you proposed to her, and with as much reason as I do Mr. Solmes—
            [And loved a Rake and Libertine, Miss, as you do Lovelace, said my sister—]
            Then might she (continued I, not minding her) beg to be excused from obeying. But yet if she did, and would give you the most solemn assurances, and security besides, that she never would have the man you disliked, against your consent—I dare say, Miss Hervey's father and mother would sit down satisfy'd, and not endeavour to force her inclinations.
            So!—said my sister, with uplifted hands, <i>father</i> and <i>mother</i> now come in for their share!
            But if, child, reply'd my aunt, I knew she <i>loved
a Rake,</i> and suspected, that she sought only to gain time, in order to wire-draw me into a consent—
            I beg pardon, Madam, for interrupting you; but if Miss Hervey could <i>obtain</i> your consent, what further would be to be said?
            True, child; but she never should.
            Then, Madam, it never would be.
            That I doubt, niece.
            If you do, Madam, can you think confinement and ill usage is the way to prevent the apprehended rashness?
            My dear, this sort of intimation would make one but too apprehensive, that there is no trusting to yourself, when one knows your inclination.
            That apprehension, Madam, seems to have been conceived before this intimation was made, or the least cause for it given. Why else the disgraceful confinement I have been laid under?—Let me venture to say, that my sufferings are rather owing to <i>designed</i> terror, knowing there were too good grounds for my opposition, than doubt of my conduct; for, when they were inflicted upon me first, I had given no <i>cause</i> of doubt; nor should there now be room for any, if my discretion might be trusted to.
            My aunt, after a little hesitation, said, But, consider, my dear, what confusion will be perpetuated in your family, if you marry this hated Lovelace?
            And, let it be considered, what misery to me, Madam, if I marry that hated Solmes?
            Many a young creature has thought she could not love a man, with whom she has afterwards been very happy. Few women, child, marry their first loves.
            That may be the reason there are so few happy marriages.
            But there are few first-impressions <i>fit</i> to be encouraged.
            I am afraid so too, Madam. I have a very indifferent opinion of light and first impressions. But, as I have often said, all I wish for is, to have leave to live <i>single.</i>
                 Indeed you must not, Miss. Your father and mother will be unhappy till they see you marry'd, and out of Lovelace's reach.—I am told, that you propose to condition with him (so far are matters gone between you), never to have <i>any</i> man, if you have not <i>him.</i>
            I know no better way to prevent mischief on all sides, I freely own it—And there is not, if <i>he</i> be out of the question, another man in the world, I can think favourably of.—Nevertheless, I would give all I have in the world, that he were marry'd to some other person—Indeed I would, Bella, for all you put on that smile of incredulity.
            May be so, Clary: But I will smile for all that.
            If <i>he</i> be out of the question! repeated my aunt—So, Miss Clary, I see how it is.—I will go down.—(Miss Harlowe, shall I follow you?)—And I will endeavour to persuade your papa to let my sister herself come up: And a happier event may then result.—
            Depend upon it, Madam, said my sister, This will be the case: My mamma and she will be both in tears; but with this different effect; My mamma will come down soften'd, and cut to the heart; but will leave her favourite harden'd, from the advantages she will think she has over my mamma's tenderness.—Why, Madam, it was for this very reason the girl is not admitted into her presence.
            Thus she run on, as she went down-stairs.
            MY heart fluttered with the hope and the fear of seeing my mamma, and with the shame and the grief of having given her so much uneasiness. But it needed not: She was not permitted to come. But my aunt was so good as to return; yet not without my sister: And, taking my hand, made me sit down by her.
                 She came, she must own, <i>officiously,</i> she said, this <i>once</i> more; tho' against the opinion of my father: But knowing, and dreading, the consequence of my opposition, she could not <i>but</i> come.
            She then set forth to me, my friends expectations from me; Mr. Solmes's riches (three times as rich he came out to be as any-body had thought him); the settlements proposed; Mr. Lovelace's bad character; their aversion to him; all in a very strong light; but not a stronger, than my mamma had before placed them in. My mamma, surely, could not have given the particulars of what had passed between herself and me: If she had, my aunt would not have repeated many of the same sentiments, as you will find she did, that had been still more strongly urged, without effect, by her venerable sister.
            She said, it would break the heart of my father to have it imagin'd, that he had not a power over his child; and that, as <i>he</i> thought, for my own good: A child too, whom they always had doated upon!—Dearest, dearest Miss, concluded she, clasping her fingers, with the most condescending earnestness, let me beg of you for <i>my</i> sake, for <i>your own</i> sake, for a <i>hundred</i> sakes, to get over this averseness, and give up your prejudices, and make every-one happy and easy once more.—I would kneel to you, my dearest niece—Nay, I <i>will</i> kneel to you!—
            And down she dropp'd, and I with her, kneeling to her, and beseeching her not to kneel; clasping my arms about her, and bathing her worthy bosom with my tears!
            Oh rise! rise! my beloved aunt, said I: You cut me to the heart with this condescending goodness.
            Say then, my dearest niece, say then, that you will oblige all your friends! If you love us, I <i>beseech</i> you do!
            How can I promise what I can sooner choose to die than to perform!—
                 Say then, my dear, you'll <i>consider</i> of it. Say you will but <i>reason</i> with yourself. Give us but hopes. Don't let me intreat, and <i>thus</i> intreat, in vain. For still she kneeled, and I by her.
            What a hard case is mine!—Could I but <i>doubt,</i> I know I could <i>conquer.</i>—That which is an inducement to my friends, is none at all to me!—How often, my dearest aunt, must I repeat the same thing!—Let me but be single—Cannot I live single? Let me be sent, as I have proposed, to Scotland, to Florence; any-whither: Let me be sent a slave to the Indies; any-whither: Any of these I will consent to. But I cannot, <i>cannot</i> think of giving my vows to a man I cannot endure!—
            Well then rising; (Bella silently, with uplifted hands, reproaching my supposed perverseness) I see nothing can prevail with you to oblige us.
            What <i>can</i> I do, my dearest aunt Hervey? What <i>can</i> I do? Were I capable of giving a hope I meant not to inlarge, then could I say, I would <i>consider</i> of your kind advice. But I would rather be thought <i>perverse</i> than <i>insincere.</i> Is there, however, no <i>medium?</i> Can <i>nothing</i> be thought of? Will <i>nothing</i> do, but to have a man who is the <i>more</i> disgustful to me, because he is unjust in the very articles he offers?
            Who now, Clary, said my sister, do you reflect upon? Consider That.
            Make not invidious applications of what I say, Bella. It may not be look'd upon in the same light by every one. The <i>giver</i> and the <i>accepter</i> are principally answerable, in an unjust donation. While I think of it in this light, I should be inexcusable to be the latter. But why do I enter upon a <i>supposition</i> of this nature? My heart, as I have often, <i>often</i> said, recoils at the <i>thoughts</i> of the man, in every light.—Whose father, but mine, agrees upon articles, where there is no prospect of a liking? Where the direct contrary is avow'd, all along avow'd, without
the least variation, or <i>shadow</i> of a change of sentiment?—But it is not my father's doing originally. O my cruel, cruel brother, to cause a measure to be forced upon me, which he would not behave tolerably under, were the like to be offer'd to him!
            The girl is got into her altitudes, aunt Hervey, said my sister. You see, Madam, she spares no-body. Be pleased to let her know what she has to trust to. Nothing is to be done with her. Pray, Madam, pronounce her doom.
            My aunt retir'd to the window, weeping, with my sister in her hand: I cannot, indeed I cannot, Miss Harlowe, said she, softly (but yet I heard every word she said): There is great hardship in her case. She is a noble child, after all. What pity things are gone so far! But Mr. Solmes ought to be told to desist.
            O Madam, said my sister, in a kind of loud whisper, are <i>you</i> caught too by the little Syren?—My mamma did well not to come up!—I question whether my papa himself, after his first indignation, would not be turn'd round by her. Nobody but my brother can do any-thing with her, I am sure.
            Don't think of your brother's coming up, said my aunt, still in a low voice—He is too furious by much. I see no obstinacy, no perverseness in her manner! If your brother comes, I will not be answerable for the consequences: For I thought twice or thrice she would have gone into fits.
            O Madam, she has a strong heart!—And you see there is no prevailing upon her, tho' you were upon your knees to her.
            My sister left my aunt musing at the window, with her back towards us; and took that opportunity to insult me still more barbarously: For, stepping to my closet, she took up the patterns which my mamma had sent me up, and bringing them to me, she spread them upon the chair by me; and, offering one, and then another, upon her sleeve and
shoulder, Thus she ran on, with great seeming tranquillity, but whisperingly, that my aunt might not hear her. <i>This,</i> Clary, is a pretty pattern enough: But <i>This</i> is quite <i>charming!</i> I would advise you to make your appearance in it. And <i>This,</i> were I you, should be my wedding night-gown—and <i>This</i> my second dress'd suit! Won't you give orders, love, to have your grandmother's jewels new set?—Or will you think to shew away in the new ones that Mr. Solmes intends to present to you? He talks of laying out two or three thousand pounds in presents, child! Dear heart!—How gorgeously will you be array'd!—What! silent, my dear, mamma Norton's <i>sweet dear!</i> What! silent still?—But, Clary, won't you have a Velvet suit? It would cut a great figure in a country church, you know: And the weather may bear it for a month yet to come. Crimson Velvet, suppose! Such a fine complection as yours, how would it be set off by it! What an agreeable blush would it give you!—High-ho! (mocking me; for I sighed to be thus fooled with): And do you sigh, love?—Well then, as it will be a solemn wedding, what think you of <i>black</i> Velvet, child?—Silent still, Clary!—Black Velvet, so fair as you are, with those charming eyes, gleaming thro' a wintry cloud, like an April Sun!—Does not Lovelace tell you they are charming eyes!—How lovely will you appear to every one!—What! silent still, love!—But about your laces, Clary!—
            She would have gone on still further, had not my aunt advanced towards us, wiping her eyes—What! whispering, Ladies! You seem so easy and so pleas'd, Miss Harlowe, with your private conference, that I hope I shall carry down good news.
            I am only giving her my opinion of her patterns, <i>here.</i>—Unask'd indeed.—But she seems, by her silence, to approve of my judgment.
            O Bella! said I, that Mr. Lovelace had not taken you at your word!—You had before now been exercising
your judgment on your own account: And <i>I</i> had been happy, as well as <i>you!</i>—Was it my fault, I pray you, that it was not so?—O how she rav'd!
            To be so ready to <i>give,</i> Bella, and so loth to <i>take,</i> is not very fair in you.
            The poor Bella descended to call names.
            Why, sister, said I, you are as angry, as if there were more in the hint, than possibly might be designed. My wish is sincere, for both our sakes!—for the whole family's sake!—And what (good now) is there in it?—Do not, do not, dear Bella, give me cause to suspect, that I have found a reason for your unsisterly behaviour to me; and which till now was wholly unaccountable from sister to sister—
            Fie, fie, Miss Clary! said my aunt.
            My sister was more and more outrageous.
            O how much fitter, said I, to be a <i>jest,</i> than a <i>jester!</i>—But now, Bella, turn the glass to you, and see how poorly sits the robe upon your own shoulders, which you have been so unmercifully fixing upon mine!
            Fie, fie, Miss Clary! repeated my aunt.
            And fie, fie, likewise, good Madam, to Miss Harlowe, you would say, were you to have heard her barbarous insults upon me!
            Let us go, Madam, said my sister, with great violence; let us leave the creature to swell till she bursts with her own poison.—The last time I will ever come near her, in the mind I am in!
            It is so easy a thing, return'd I, were I to be mean enough to follow an example that is so censureable in the setter of it, to vanquish such a teazing spirit as yours, with its own blunt weapons, that I am amaz'd you will provoke me!—Yet, Bella, since you <i>will</i> go (for she had hurry'd to the door), forgive me: I do you. And you have a double reason to do so, both from eldership, and the offence so studiously given to one in affliction.—But may <i>you</i> be happy, tho' <i>I</i> never shall!—May <i>you</i> never have half
the trials <i>I</i> have had! Be this your comfort, that you cannot have a sister to treat <i>you,</i> as you have treated <i>me!</i> And so God bless you!
            O thou art a—And down she flung without saying what.
            Permit me, Madam, said I to my aunt, sinking down, and clasping her knees with my arms, to detain you one moment—Not to say any thing about my poor sister—She is her own punisher—Only to thank you for all your condescending goodness to me. I only beg of you, not to impute to obstinacy the immoveableness I have shewn to so tender a friend; and to forgive me every thing I have said or done amiss in your presence: For it has not proceeded from inward rancour to the poor Bella. But I will be bold to say, that neither She, nor my Brother, nor even my Father himself, knows what a heart they have set a bleeding.
            I saw, to my comfort, what effect my sister's absence wrought for me.—Rise, my noble-minded niece!—charming creature!—[Those were her kind words] kneel not to me!—Keep to yourself what I now say to you: I admire you more than I can express—And if you can forbear claiming your estate, and can resolve to avoid Lovelace, you will continue to be the greatest miracle I ever knew at your years.—But I must hasten down after your sister.—These are my last words to you: Conform to your father's will, if you possibly can. How meritorious will it be in you to do so! Pray to God to <i>enable</i> you to conform. You don't know what may be done.
            Only, my dear aunt, one word, <i>one</i> word more (for she was going)—Speak up all you can for my dear Mrs. Norton. She is but low in the world: Should ill health overtake her, she may not know how to live without my mamma's favour. I shall have no means to help her; for I will want necessaries before I will assert my right: And I do assure you,
she has said so many things to me in behalf of my resigning to my father's will, that her arguments have not a little contributed to make me resolve to avoid the extremities, which nevertheless I pray to God they do not at last force me upon. And yet they deprive me of her advice, and think unjustly of one of the most excellent of women.
            I am glad to hear you say This: And take <i>This,</i> and <i>This,</i> and <i>This,</i> my charming niece (for so she call'd me at every word almost); kissing me earnestly, and clasping her arms about my neck: And God protect you, and direct you! But you <i>must</i> submit: Indeed you <i>must.</i> Some <i>one day</i> in a month from <i>This,</i> is all the choice that is left you.
            And this, I suppose, was the doom my sister call'd for; yet not worse than what had been pronounced upon me before.
            She repeated these last sentences louder than the former. And remember, Miss, added she, it is your <i>duty</i> to comply—And down she went, leaving me with my heart full, and my eyes runing over.
            The very repetition of this, fills me with almost equal concern, to that which I felt at the time. I can write no more; mistinesses of all the colours in the rainbow twinkling upon my deluged eye.

50.1.                       <i>Three o' clock, afternoon.</i>                I JUST now called again at Smith's; and am told she is somewhat better; which she attributed to the soothings of her Doctor. She expressed herself highly pleased with both gentlemen; and said, that their behaviour to her was perfectly <i>paternal.</i>Ñ                   <i>Paternal,</i> poor lady! Ñ Never having been, till very lately, from under her parents wings, and now abandon'd by all her friends, she is for finding out something <i>paternal</i> and <i>maternal</i> in every one (the latter qualities in Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith), to supply to herself the father and mother her dutiful heart pants after!                Mrs. Smith told me, that, after we were gone, she gave the keys of her trunks and drawers to her and the widow Lovick, and desired them to take an inventory of them; which they did, in her presence.                They also informed me, That she had requested them to find her a purchaser for two rich dress'd suits; one never worn, the other not above once or twice.                This shock'd me exceedingly: <i>Perhaps it may thee a little!!!</i>ÑHer reason for so doing, she told them, was, That she should never live to wear them: That her sister, and other relations, were above wearing them: That her mother would not endure in her sight any-thing that was hers: That she wanted the money: That she would not be obliged to any-body, when she had effects by her, which she had no occasion for: And yet, said she, I expect not, that they will fetch a price answerable to their value.                They were both very much concerned, as they own'd; and asked my advice upon it: And the richness of her apparel having given them a still higher notion of her rank, than they had before, they supposed she must be of quality; and again wanted to know her story.                I told them, That she was indeed a lady of family and fortune: I still gave them room to suppose her married: But left it to her to tell them all in her own time and manner: All I would say, was, That she had been very vilely treated; deserved it not; and was all innocence and purity.                     You may suppose, that they both expressed their astonishment, that there could be a man in the world, who could ill-treat so fine a creature.                As to disposing of the two suits of apparel, I told Mrs. Smith, That she should pretend, that, upon inquiry, she had found a friend, who would purchase the richest of them; but <i>(that she might not mistrust)</i> would stand upon a good bargain. And having twenty guineas about me, I left them with her, in part of payment; and bid her <i>pretend</i> to get her to part with it for as little more as she could induce her to take.                I am setting out for Edgware with poor BeltonÑMore of whom in my next. I shall return to-morrow; and leave This in readiness for your messenger, if he shall call in my absence. Adieu!

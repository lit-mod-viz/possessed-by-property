 Sunday NightÑMonday Morning.                                          I WENT down with revenge in my <i>heart</i>; the contents of Miss Howe's letter almost engrossing me, the moment that Miss Harlowe and Mrs. Moore, accompanied by Miss Rawlins, came in: But in my    countenance all the gentle, the placid, the serene, that the glass could teach; and in my behaviour all the polite, that such an unpolite creature, as she has often told me I am, could put on.             Miss Rawlins was sent for home, almost as soon as she came in, to entertain an unexpected visiter; to her great regret, as well as to the disappointment of my fair one, as I could perceive from the looks of both: For they had agreed, it seems, if I went to town, as I said I intended to do, to take a walk upon the heath; at least in Mrs. Moore's garden; and who knows, what might have been the issue, had the spirit of curiosity in the one met with the spirit of communication in the other?             Miss Rawlins promised to return, if possible: But sent to excuse herself; her visiter intending to stay with her all night.             I rejoiced in my heart, at her message; and after much supplication obtained the favour of my Beloved's company for another walk in the garden, having, as I told her, abundance of things to say, to propose, and to be informed of, in order ultimately to govern myself in my future steps.             She had vouchsafed, I should tell thee, with eyes turned from me, and in an <i>half-aside</i> attitude, to sip two dishes of tea in my companyÑDear soul!ÑHow anger <i>unpolishes</i> the most polite! for I never saw Miss Harlowe behave so aukwardly. I imagined she knew not how to be aukward.             When we were in the garden, I poured my whole soul into her attentive ear; and besought her returning favour.             She told me, that she had formed her scheme for her future life: That, vile as the treatment was which she had received from me, that was not all the reason she had for rejecting my suit: But that, on the maturest deliberation, she was convinced, that she could    neither be happy with me, nor make me happy; and she injoined me, for both our sakes, to think no more of her.             The Captain, I told her, was rid down post in a manner, to forward my wishes with her uncle.             Lady Betty and Miss Montague were undoubtedly arrived in town by this time.             I would set out early in the morning to attend them.             They adored her. They longed to see her. They <i>would</i> see her.ÑThey would not be denied her company into Oxfordshire.             Where could she better go, to be free from her brother's insults?ÑWhere, to be absolutely made unapprehensive of any-body else?ÑMight I have any hopes of her returning favour, if Miss Howe could be prevailed upon to intercede for me?                             <i>Miss Howe prevailed upon to intercede for you!</i> repeated she, with a scornful bridle, but a very pretty one.ÑAnd there she stopt.             I <i>repeated</i> the concern it would be to me, to be under a necessity of mentioning the misunderstanding to Lady Betty and my cousin, as a misunderstanding still to be made up; and as if I were of very <i>little</i> consequence to a dear creature, who was of so <i>much</i> to me; urging, that it would extremely lower me, not only in my own opinion, but in that of my relations.             But still she referred to Miss Howe's next letter; and all the concession I could bring her to in this whole conference, was, that she would wait the arrival and visit of the two ladies, if they came in a day or two, or before she received the expected letter from Miss Howe.             Thank Heaven for this! thought I. And now may I go to town with hopes at my return to find thee, dearest, where I shall leave thee.             But yet I shall not intirely trust to this, as she may    find reasons to change her mind in my absence. My fellow, therefore, who is in the house, and who, by Mrs. Bevis's kind intelligence, will know every step she can take, shall have Andrew and a horse ready, to give me immediate notice of her motions; and moreover, go where she will, he shall be one of her retinue, tho' unknown to herself, if possible.             This was all I could make of the fair Inexorable. Should I be glad of it, or sorry for it?Ñ             Glad, I believe: And yet my pride is confoundedly abated to think, that I had so little hold in the affections of this daughter of the Harlowes.             Don't tell me, that virtue and principle are her guides on this occasion!Ñ'Tis <i>pride,</i> a greater pride than my own, that governs her. Love, she has none, thou seest; nor ever had; at least not in a superior degree.ÑLove never was under the dominion of <i>prudence,</i> or of any <i>reasoning</i> power.ÑShe cannot bear to be thought a <i>woman,</i> I warrant!ÑAnd if, in the last attempt, I find her <i>not</i> one, what will she be the worse for the tryal?ÑNo one is to blame for suffering an evil he cannot shun or avoid.             Were a general to be overpower'd, and robb'd by a highwayman, would he be less fit for the command of an army on that account?ÑIf indeed the general, pretending great valour, and having boasted, that he never would be robb'd, were to make but faint resistance, when he was brought to the test, and to yield his purse when he was master of his own sword, then indeed will the highwayman, who robs him, be thought the braver man.             But from these last conferences am I furnished with an argument in defence of my favourite purpose, which I never yet pleaded.             O Jack! what a difficulty must a man be allowed to have, to conquer a predominant passion, be it what it will, when the gratifying of it is in his <i>power,</i> however wrong he knows it to be to resolve to gratify    it! Reflect upon this; and then wilt thou be able to account for, if not to excuse, a projected crime, which has <i>habit</i> to plead for it, in a breast as stormy, as uncontroulable!Ñ             This my new argumentÑ             Should she fail in the trial; should I succeed; and should she refuse to go on with me; and even to marry me; which I can have no notion ofÑAnd should she disdain to be obliged to me for the handsome provision I should be proud to make for her, even to the <i>half of my estate</i>; yet cannot she be altogether unhappyÑIs she not intitled to an independent fortune? Will not Col. Morden, as her trustee, put her in possession of it? And did she not, in our former conference, point out the <i>way of life,</i> that she always preferred to the <i>married life?</i>Ñ "To take her good Norton for her directress and guide, and to live upon her own estate in the manner her grandfather desired she should live?"                          It is moreover to be considered, that she cannot, according to her own notions, recover above <i>one half</i> of her fame, were we now to intermarry; so much does she think she has suffered by her going off with me. And will she not be always repining and mourning for the loss of the <i>other half?</i>ÑAnd if she must live a life of such uneasiness and regret for <i>half,</i> may she not as well repine and mourn for the <i>whole?</i>                          Nor, let me tell thee, will her own scheme of penitence, in this case, be half so perfect, if she do <i>not</i> fall, as if she <i>does:</i> For what a foolish penitent will she make, who has nothing to repent of?Ñ She piques herself, thou knowest, and makes it matter of reproach to me, that she went not off with me by her own consent; but was tricked out of herself.             Nor upbraid thou me upon the meditated breach of vows so repeatedly made. She will not, thou seest,                   <i>permit</i> me to fulfil them. And if she <i>would,</i> this I have to say, that at the time I made the most solemn of them, I was fully determined to keep them. But what prince thinks himself obliged any longer to observe the articles of the most sacredly sworn-to treaties, than suits with his interest or inclination; altho' the consequence of the infraction must be, as he knows, the destruction of thousands?             Is not this then the result of all, that Miss Clarissa Harlowe, if it be not her own fault, may be as virtuous <i>after</i> she has lost her honour, as it is called, as she was <i>before?</i> She may be a more eminent example to her sex; and if she yield (a <i>little</i> yield) in the tryal, may be a <i>completer penitent.</i> Nor can she, but by her own wilfulness, be reduced to <i>low fortunes.</i>                          And thus may her <i>old</i> nurse and she; an <i>old</i> coachman; and a pair of <i>old</i> coach-horses; and two or three <i>old</i> maid-servants, and perhaps a <i>very old</i> footman or two (for every thing will be old and penitential about her), live very comfortably together; reading <i>old</i> sermons, and <i>old</i> prayer-books; and relieving <i>old</i> men, and <i>old</i> women; and giving <i>old</i> lessons, and <i>old</i> warnings, upon new subjects, as well as <i>old</i> ones, to the young ladies of her neighbourhood; and so pass on to a good <i>old</i> age, doing a great deal of good, both by precept and example, in her generation.             And is a lady, who can live thus prettily, without <i>controul</i>; who ever did prefer, and who <i>still</i> prefers, the <i>Single</i> to the <i>Married life</i>; and who will be enabled to do every thing, that the plan she had formed will direct her to do; be said to be ruined, undone, and such sort of stuff?ÑI have no patience with the pretty fools, who use those strong words, to describe the most transitory evil; and which a mere church-form makes none?             At this rate of romancing, how many <i>flourishing    ruins</i> dost thou, as well as I, know? Let us but look about us, and we shall see some of the haughtiest and most <i>censorious</i> spirits among our acquaintance of that sex, now passing for chaste wives, of whom strange stories might be told; and others, whose husband's hearts have been made to ake for their gaieties, both before and after marriage; and yet know not half so much of them, as some of us honest fellows could tell them.             But, having thus satisfied myself in relation to the worst that can happen to this <i>charming creature</i>; and that it will be her own fault, if she be unhappy; I have not at all reflected upon what is likely to be <i>my own lot.</i>                          This has always been my notion, tho' Miss Howe grudges us the best of the sex, and says, that the worst is too good for us; That the wife of a libertine ought to be pure, spotless, uncontaminated. To what purpose has such a one lived a free life, but to know the world, and to make his advantages of it?ÑAnd, to be <i>very</i> serious, it would be a misfortune to the public, for two persons, heads of a family, to be both bad; since, between two such, a race of varlets might be propagated, Lovelaces and Belfords, if thou wilt, who might do great mischief in the world.             Thou seest at bottom, that I am not an abandoned fellow; and that there is a mixture of gravity in me. This, as I grow older, may increase; and when my active capacity begins to abate, I may sit down with the Preacher, and resolve all my past life into vanity and vexation of spirit.             This is certain, that I shall never find a woman so well suited to my taste, as Miss Clarissa Harlowe. I only wish (if I live to see that day), that I may have such a lady as her to comfort and adorn my setting-sun. I have often thought it very unhappy for us both, that so excellent a creature sprung up a little    too late for my <i>setting-out,</i> and a little too early in my <i>progress,</i> before I can think of <i>returning.</i> And yet, as I have pick'd up the sweet traveller in my way, I cannot help wishing, that she would bear me company in the <i>rest</i> of my journey, altho' she were to step out of her own path to oblige me. And then, perhaps, we could put up in the <i>evening</i> at the same <i>inn</i>; and be very happy in each other's conversation; recounting the difficulties and dangers we had passed in our way to it.             I imagine, that thou wilt be apt to suspect, that some passages in this letter were written in town. Why, Jack, I cannot but say, that the Westminster air is a little grosser than that at Hamstead; and the conversation of Mrs. Sinclair, and the Nymphs, less innocent than Mrs. Moore's and Miss Rawlins's. And I think in my heart, that I can say and write those things at one place, which I cannot at the other; nor indeed any-where else.             I came to town about seven this morning.ÑAll necessary directions and precautions remember'd to be given.             I besought the favour of an audience before I set out. I was desirous to see which of her lovely faces she was pleased to put on, after another night had passed. But she was resolved, I found, to leave our quarrel open. She would not give me an opportunity so much as to intreat her again to close it, before the arrival of Lady Betty and my cousin.             I had notice from my proctor, by a few lines brought by man and horse, just before I set out, that all difficulties had been for two days past surmounted; and that I might have the licence for fetching.             I sent up the letter to my Beloved, by Mrs. Bevis. It procured me not admittance, tho' my request for <i>that,</i> was sent with it.             And now, Belford, I set out upon business.

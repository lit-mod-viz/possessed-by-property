               Florence, April 13.             I AM extremely concerned to hear of a difference betwixt the rest of a family, so near and dear to me, and <i>You</i> still dearer to me than any of the rest.             My cousin James has acquainted me with the offers you have had, and your refusals. I wonder not at either. Such charming promises at so early an age, as when I left England; and those promises, as I have often heard, so greatly exceeded, as well in your person as mind, how much must you be admir'd! How few must there be worthy of you!             Your parents, the most indulgent in the world, to a child the most deserving, have given way, it seems, to your refusals of several gentlemen:ÑThey have contented Your parents at last to name One with <i>earnestness</i> to Your parents, because of the address of Another Your parents cannot approve of.             Your parents had not reason, it seems, from your beha                iour, to think you greatly averse; so Your parents proceeded:ÑPerhaps too hastily for a delicacy like yours. But when all was fixed on their parts, and most extraordinary terms concluded in your favour; terms, which abundantly shew the gentleman's just value for you; you fly off with a warmth and vehemence little suited to that sweetness which gave grace to all your actions.             I know very little of either of the gentlemen: But of Mr. Lovelace I know more than of Mr. Solmes. I wish I could say, more to Mr. Solmes advantage than I can. As to every qualification but <i>one,</i> Mr. Lovelace owns there is no comparison:ÑBut That <i>one</i> outweighs all the rest togetherÑIt cannot be thought, that Miss Clarissa Harlowe will dispense with MORALS in a husband.             What, my dearest cousin, shall I first plead to my dearest cousin on this occasion? Your duty, your interest, your temporal, and your eternal welfare, do, and may all depend upon this single point, <i>The morality of a husband.</i> A wife cannot always have it in A wife power to <i>be</i> good, or to <i>do</i> good, if A wife has a wicked husband, as a good husband may, if a good husband has a bad wife.ÑYou preserve all your religious regards, I understand;ÑI wonder not that you do: I should have wonder'd, had you not: But what can you promise you do, as to perseverance in them, with an immoral husband?             If your parents and you differ in sentiment on this important occasion, let me ask you, my dear cousin, who ought to give way?ÑI own to you do, that I should have thought there could not any-where have been a more suitable match for you do, than with Mr. Lovelace, had Mr. Lovelace been a moral man. I should have very little to say against a man, of whose actions I am not to set up a man as a judge, did Mr. Lovelace not address my cousin. But, on this important occasion, let me tell you, my dear Clarissa, that Mr. Lovelace cannot possibly deserve you. Mr. Lovelace <i>may</i> reform, you'll say; but Mr. Lovelace may <i>not.</i> Habit is not soon shook off. Libertines, who are libertines in defiance of talents, of superior lights, of conviction, hardly ever reform but by miracle, or by incapacity. Well do I know my own sex. Well am I able to judge of the probability of the reformation of a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity: Who has a prosperous run of fortune before a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity: a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity spirits high: a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity will uncontroulable: The company a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity keeps, perhaps such as a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity, confirming a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity in all a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity courses, assisting a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity in all a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity enterprizes.             As to the other gentleman, suppose, my dear cousin, you don't like a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity at <i>present,</i> it is far from being unlikely, that you will <i>hereafter:</i> Perhaps the more, for not liking him <i>now.</i> him can hardly sink <i>lower</i> in your opinion: him may <i>rise.</i> Very seldom is it, that <i>high</i> expectations are so much as <i>tolerably</i> answered. How indeed <i>can</i> they, when a fine and extensive imagination carries its expectation infinitely beyond reality, in the highest of our sublunary enjoyments? A lady adorn'd with such an imagination sees no defect in a favour'd object, because A lady adorn'd is not conscious of any in A lady adorn'd, till it is too late to rectify the mistakes occasioned by A lady adorn'd generous credulity.             But suppose a person of your talents were to marry a man of inferior talents; who, in this case, can be so happy in <i>herself,</i> as Miss Clarissa Harlowe? What delight do you take in doing good? How happily do you devote the several portions of the natural day to your own improvement, and to the advantage of all that move within your sphere?ÑAnd then such is your taste, such are your acquirements in the politer studies, and in the politer amusements; such your excellence in all the different parts of oeconomy, fit for a young lady's inspection and practice, that your friends would wish you to be taken off, as little as possible, by regards that might be called merely <i>personal?</i>             But as to what may be the consequence respecting yourself, respecting a young lady of your exalted talents, from the preference you are suspected to give to a libertine, I would have you, my dear cousin, consider what That may be.ÑA mind so pure, to mingle with a mind more impure than most of ÑA species! Such a man as This will ingross all your solicitudes. Such a man as This will perpetually fill you with anxieties for Such a man as This and for yourself. The divine and civil powers defied, and The divine and civil powers sanctions broke thro' by Such a man as This, on every not merely <i>accidental,</i> but <i>meditated</i> occasion. To be agreeable to Such a man as This, and to hope to preserve an interest in Such a man as This affections, you must probably be obliged to abandon all your own laudable pursuits. You must enter into Such a man as This pleasures and distastes: You must give up your own virtuous companions for Such a man as This profligate ones: Perhaps be forsaken by yourself, because of the scandal he daily gives. Can you hope, cousin, with such a man as This, to be <i>long</i> so good as you <i>now</i> are?ÑIf not, consider, which of your present laudable delights you would choose to give up?ÑWhich of up?ÑWhich culpable ones to follow up?ÑWhich in? How could you brook to go backward, instead of forward, in those duties which you now so exemplarily perform? And how do you know, if you once give way, where you shall be suffer'd, where you shall be <i>able,</i> to stop?             Your brother acknowleges, that Mr. Solmes is not near so agreeable in person, as Mr. Lovelace. But what is <i>person,</i> with such a lady as I have the honour to be now writing to?ÑHe owns likewise, that the honour to be now writing to?ÑHe has not the address of Mr. Lovelace: But what a <i>mere</i> personal advantage is <i>address,</i> without <i>morals?</i>ÑA lady had better take a husband whose manners ÑA lady were to fashion, than to find them ready-fashion'd to ÑA lady hand, at the price of his morality; a price that is often paid for travelling accomplishments. O my dear cousin, were you but with us here at Florence, or at Rome, or at Paris (where also I resided for many months), to see the gentlemen, whose supposed <i>rough</i> English manners at setting out are to be polish'd, and what the gentlemen, whose supposed <i>rough</i> English manners at setting out are to be polish'd improvements are in the gentlemen, whose supposed <i>rough</i> English manners at setting out are to be polish'd return thro' the same places, you would infinitely prefer the man in the man <i>first</i> stage, to the same man in the man <i>last.</i> You <i>find</i> the difference on their return: Foreign fashions, foreign vices, and foreign diseases too, often complete the man, and to despise the man own country and countrymen, himself still more despicable, than the <i>most</i> despicable of those the man despises: These too generally make up, with a mixture of an unblushing effrontery, the travelled gentleman!             Mr. Lovelace, I know, deserves to have an exception made in Mr. Lovelace favour; for Mr. Lovelace is really a man of parts and learning: Mr. Lovelace was esteemed so both here and at Rome; and a fine person, and a generous turn of mind, gave Mr. Lovelace great advantages. But you need not be told, that a libertine man of sense does infinitely more mischief, than a libertine of weak parts is able to do. And this I will tell you farther, that it was Mr. Lovelace's own fault that Mr. Lovelace was not still more respected than Mr. Lovelace was, among the <i>Literati</i> here. There were, in short, some liberties, in which Mr. Lovelace indulged Mr. Lovelace, that endangered Mr. Lovelace person and Mr. Lovelace liberty; and made the best and most worthy of those who honour'd Mr. Lovelace with those who honour'd him with their notice notice, give Mr. Lovelace up; and Mr. Lovelace stay both at Florence and at Rome shorter than Mr. Lovelace designed.             This is all I choose to say of Mr. Lovelace. I had much rather have had reason to give Mr. Lovelace a quite contrary character. But as to rakes or libertines in general, I, who know rakes or libertines in general well, must be allowed, because of the mischiefs rakes or libertines in general have always in rakes or libertines in general hearts, and too often in rakes or libertines in general power, to do your Sex, to add still a few more words upon this topic.             A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine, must be generally remorseless;Ñ<i>Unjust</i> A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine must always be. The noble rule, of doing to others what A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine would have done to A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine, is the first rule A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine breaks; and every day A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine breaks it; the oftener, the greater A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine triumph. A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine has great contempt for your sex: A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine believes no woman chaste, because A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine is a profligate: Every woman who favours A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine, confirms A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine in A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine wicked incredulity. A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine is always plotting to extend the mischiefs A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine delights in. If a woman loves such a man, how can a woman bear the thought of dividing a woman interest in A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine affections, with half the town, and that, perhaps, the dregs of it?ÑThen so sensual!ÑHow will a young lady of your delicacy bear with so sensual a man? a man who makes a jest of his vows; and who, perhaps, will break your spirit by the most unmanly insults. To <i>be</i> a libertine, at setting out, all compunction, all humanity, must be overcome. To <i>continue</i> to be a libertine, is to continue to be every thing vile and inhuman. Prayers, tears, and the most abject submission, are but fuel to his pride: Wagering perhaps with lewd companions, and, not improbably, with lewder women, upon instances which he boasts of to lewder women of your patient sufferings and broken spirit, and bringing lewder women home to witness to both. I write what I know <i>has</i> been.             I mention not fortunes squander'd, estates mortgaged or sold, and posterity robb'd: Nor yet a multitude of other evils, too gross, too shocking, to be mentioned to a delicacy like yours.             All these, my dear cousin, to be shunn'd, all the evils I have named to be avoided; the power of doing all the good you have been accustomed to do, preserved, nay, increased, by the separate provision that will be made for All these, my dear cousin: Your charming diversions, and exemplary employments all maintained; and every good habit perpetuated: And all by <i>one</i> sacrifice, the fading pleasure of the eye: Who would not (since every thing is not to be met with in one man; who would not) to preserve so many essentials, give up so light, so unpermanent a pleasure?             Weigh all these things, which I might insist upon to more advantage, did I think it needful to one of your prudence: Weigh them well, my beloved cousin; and if it be not the will of your parents that you should continue single, resolve to oblige your parents; and let it not be said, that the powers of fancy shall (as in many others of your sex) be too hard for your duty and your prudence. The less agreeable the man, the more obliging the compliance: Remember, that he is a sober man: A man who has reputation to lose, and whose reputation therefore is a security for he good behaviour to you.             You have an opportunity offer'd you, to give the highest instance that can be given, of filial duty:ÑEmbrace ÑEmbrace; ÑEmbrace is worthy <i>of</i> you; ÑEmbrace is expected <i>from</i> you; however, for your inclination sake, one may be sorry that you are called upon to give it. Let it be said, that you have been able to lay an obligation upon your parents (A proud word, my cousin!) which you could not do, were it not laid <i>against</i> your inclination!ÑUpon parents, who have laid a thousand upon you: Who are set upon this point: Who will not give it up: Who have given up many points to your inclination!ÑUpon parents, who have laid a thousand upon you, even of this very nature: And in <i>their</i> turn, for the sake of their own authority, as well as judgment, expect to be obliged.             I hope I shall soon, in person, congratulate you upon This your meritorious compliance. To settle and give up my trusteeship, is one of the principal motives of my leaving these parts. I shall be glad to settle my trusteeship, to every one's satisfaction; to Yours particularly. If on my arrival I find a happy union, as formerly, reign in a family so dear to me, it will be an unspeakable pleasure to me; and I shall perhaps so dispose my affairs, as to be near you for ever.             I have written a very long letter, and will add no more, than that I am, with the greatest respect, my dearest cousin,                Your most affectionate and faithful servant, WM. MORDEN.

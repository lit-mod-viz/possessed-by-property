                  Wednesday, April 19.
            I Have a piece of intelligence to give you, which concerns you much to know.
            Your brother having been assured, that you ar
not married, has taken a resolution to find you out, way-lay you, and carry you off. A friend of his, a captain of a ship, undertakes to get you on shipboard; and to sail away with you, either by Hull or Leith, in the way to one of your brother's houses.
            They are very wicked: For in spite of all your virtues, they conclude you to be <i>ruin'd.</i> But if they can be assured, when they have you, that you are not, they will secure you, till they can bring you out Mrs. Solmes: And mean time, in order to give Mr. Lovelace full employment, they talk of a prosecution which will be set up against him, for some crime or other, that they have got a notion of, which they think, if it do not cost him his life, will make him fly his country.
            This is very early news. Miss Bell told it in confidence, and with mighty triumph over Lovelace, to Miss Lloyd; who is at present her favourite; though as much your admirer as ever. Miss Lloyd, being very apprehensive of the mischief which might follow such an attempt, told it to me, with leave to apprize you privately of it—And yet neither she nor I would be sorry, perhaps, if Lovelace were to be fairly hang'd—that is to say, if you, my dear, had no objection to it. But we cannot bear, that such an admirable creature should be made the tennis-ball of two violent spirits—Much less, that you should be seized, and exposed to the brutal treatment of wretches who have no bowels.
            If you can engage Mr. Lovelace to keep his temper upon it, I think you should acquaint him with it; but not to mention Miss Lloyd. Perhaps his wicked agent may come at the intelligence, and reveal it to him. But I leave it to your own discretion to do as you think fit in it.—All my concern is, that this dareing and foolish project, if carried on, will be a means of throwing you more into his power than ever.—But as it will convince you, that there can
be no hope of a reconciliation, I wish you were actually married, let the cause for the prosecution hinted at be what it will, short of murder or a rape.
            Your Hannah was very thankful for your kind present. She heaped a thousand blessings upon you for it. She has Mr. Lovelace's too, by this time.
            I am pleased with Mr. Hickman, I can tell you:—For he has sent her two guineas by the person who carries Mr. Lovelace's five, as from an unknown hand: Nor am I, or you, to know it. The manner, more than the value, I am pleased with him for. But he does a great many things of this sort; and is as silent as the night; for nobody knows of them, till the gratitude of the benefited will not let them be concealed. He is now-and-then my almoner, and I believe always adds to my little benefactions.
            But his time is not come to be praised for these things; nor does he seem to want <i>that</i> encouragement.
            The man has certainly a good mind. Nor can we expect in one man every good quality. But he is really a silly fellow, my dear, to trouble his head about me, when he sees how much I despise his whole sex; and must of course make a common man look like a fool, were he not to make <i>himself</i> look like one, by wishing to pitch his tent so oddly. Our likings, and dislikings, as I have often thought, are seldom governed by prudence, or with a view to happiness. The eye, my dear, the wicked eye—has such a strict alliance with the heart!—And both have such enmity to the understanding!—What an unequal union, the mind and body! All the senses, like the family at Harlowe-place, in a confederacy against that which would animate, and give honour to the whole, were it allowed its proper precedence.
            Permit me, I beseech you, before you go to London, to send you forty-eight guineas.—I mention that sum to oblige you, because, by accepting back the two
to Hannah, I will hold you indebted to me fifty.—Surely <i>this</i> will induce you!—You know that I cannot want the money. I told you, that I have near double that sum; and that the half of it is more than my mamma knows I am mistress of. With so little money as you have, what can you do at such a place as London?—You don't know what occasion you may have for messengers, intelligence, and such-like.—If you don't oblige me, I shall not think your stomach so much down as you say it is; and as, in this one particular, I think it ought to be.
            As to the state of things between my mamma and me, you know enough of her temper, not to need to be told, that she never espouses or resents with indifference. Yet will she not remember, that I am <i>her</i> daughter. No, truly, I am all my <i>papa</i>'s <i>girl.</i>
            She was very sensible, surely, of the violence of my poor papa's temper, that she can so long remember <i>that,</i> when acts of tenderness and affection seem quite forgotten. Some daughters would be tempted to think, that controul sat very heavy upon a mother, who can endeavour to exert the power she has over a child; and regret, for years after death, that she had not the same over a husband.
            If this manner of expression becomes not me, of my mother, it will be somewhat extenuated by the love I always bore my father, and by the reverence I shall ever pay to his memory: For he was a fond father, and perhaps would have been as tender a husband, had not my mamma and he been too much of one temper to agree.
            The misfortune was, in short, that, when <i>one</i> was out of humour, the <i>other</i> would be so too: Yet neither of their tempers <i>comparatively</i> bad. Notwithstanding all which, I did not imagine, girl as I was, in my papa's life-time, that my mamma's part of the yoke sat so heavy upon her neck, as she gives me
room to think it did, whenever she is pleased to disclaim <i>her</i> part of me.
            Both parents, as I have often thought, should be very careful, if they would secure to themselves the undivided love of their children, that, of all things, they should avoid such <i>durable</i> contentions with each other, as should distress their children in choosing their party, when they would be glad to reverence both as they ought.
            But here is the thing: There is not a better manager of her affairs in the sex, than my mamma; and I believe a <i>notable</i> wife is more impatient of controul, than an <i>indolent</i> one. An indolent one, perhaps, thinks she has somewhat to <i>compound</i> for; while women of the other character, I suppose, know too well their own significance to think highly of that of any-body else. All must be their own way. In one word, Because they are <i>useful,</i> they will be <i>more</i> than useful.
            I do assure you, my dear, were I a man, and a man who loved my quiet, I would not have one of these managing wives on any consideration. I would make it a matter of serious inquiry beforehand, whether my mistress's qualifications, if I heard she was notable, were <i>masculine</i> or <i>feminine</i> ones. If indeed I were an indolent supine mortal, who might be in danger of becoming the property of my steward, I would then perhaps choose to marry for the qualifications of a steward.
            But, setting my mamma out of the question, because she <i>is</i> my mamma, have I not seen how Lady Hartley pranks up herself above all her sex, because she knows how to manage affairs that do not <i>belong</i> to her sex to manage? Affairs that can do no credit to her, as a woman, to understand; <i>practically,</i> I mean; for the <i>theory</i> of them may not be amiss to be known.
            Indeed, my dear, I do not think a <i>man-woman</i> a pretty character at all: And, as I said, were I a
               <i>man,</i> I would sooner choose for a dove, tho' it were fit for nothing, but, as the play says, to go tame about house, and breed, than a wife that is setting at work (my insignificant self <i>present</i> perhaps) every busy hour my never-resting servants, those of the Stud not excepted; and who, with a besom in her hand, as I may say, would be continually filling me with apprehensions, that she wanted to sweep me out of my own house as useless lumber.
            Were indeed the mistress of the family, like the wonderful young Lady I so <i>much</i> and so <i>justly</i> admire, to know how to confine herself within her own respectable rounds of the needle, the pen, the housekeeper's bills, the dairy for her amusement; to see the poor fed from superfluities that <i>would</i> otherwise be wasted; and exert herself in all the really useful branches of domestic management; then would she move in her proper sphere; then would she render herself <i>amiably</i> useful, and <i>respectably</i> necessary; then would she become the <i>mistress</i>-wheel of the family [Whatever you think of your Anna Howe, I would not have her be the <i>master</i>-wheel]; and every-body would love her; as every-body did you, before your insolent brother came back, flush'd with his unmerited acquirements, and turn'd all things topsy-turvy.
            If you will be inform'd of the particulars of our contention, after you have known in general, that your unhappy affair was the subject; why then, I think, I must tell you.
            Yet how shall I?—I feel my cheek glow with mingled shame and indignation—Know then, my dear—that I have been—as I may say—that I have been <i>beaten</i>—Indeed 'tis true.—My mamma thought fit to slap my hands to get from me a sheet of a letter she caught me writing to you; which I tore, because she should not read it, and burnt it before her face.
            I know this will trouble you: So spare yourself the labour to tell me it does.
                 Mr. Hickman came in presently after. I would not see him. I am either too much a woman to be beat, or too much a child to have an humble servant.—So I told my mother. What can one oppose but sullens, when it would be unpardonable so much as to <i>think</i> of lifting up a finger!
            In the Harlowe-style, she <i>will</i> be obey'd, she says: And even Mr. Hickman shall be forbid the house, if he contributes to the carrying-on of a correspondence which she will not suffer to be continu'd.
            Poor man! He stands a whimsical chance between us. But he knows he is <i>sure</i> of my mamma; but not of me. 'Tis easy then for him to choose his party, were it not his inclination to serve you, as it surely <i>is.</i> And this makes him a merit with me, which otherwise he would not have had; notwithstanding the good qualities which I have just now acknowleged in his favour. For, my dear, let my faults in other respects be what they may, I will pretend to say, that I have in my own mind those qualities which I praised him for. And if we are to come together, I could for that reason better dispense with them in him.—So if a husband, who has a bountiful-temper'd wife, is not a niggard, nor seeks to restrain her, but has an opinion of all she does, that is enough for him: As, on the contrary, if a bountiful-temper'd husband has a frugal wife, it is best for both. For one to give, and t'other to give, except they have the prudence, and are at so good an understanding with each other, as to compare notes, they may perhaps put it out of their power to be just. Good frugal doctrine, my dear!—But this way of putting it, is middling the matter between what I have learnt of my mamma's over-prudent, and your enlarged, notions.—But from doctrine to fact.—
            I shut myself up all that day; and what little I did eat, at alone. But at night she sent up Kitty, with
a command, upon my obedience, to attend her at supper.
            I went down: But most gloriously in the sullens. YES, and NO, were great words with me, to every thing she asked of me, for a good while.
            That behaviour, she told me, should not do for her.
            Beating should not with me, I said.
            My bold resistance, she told me, had provoked her to slap my hand; and she was sorry to have been so provok'd. But again insisted, that I would either give up my correspondence absolutely, or let her see all that passed in it.
            I must not do either, I told her. It was unsuitable both to my inclination and to my honour, at the instigation of base minds, to give up a friend in distress.
            She rung all the maternal changes upon the words duty, obedience, filial obligation, and so-forth.
            I told her, that a duty too rigorously and unreasonably exacted, had been your ruin, if you were ruin'd. If I were of age to be marry'd, I hop'd she would think me capable of <i>making,</i> or at least of <i>keeping,</i> my own friendships; such a one especially as this, with a young Lady, whose friendship she herself, till this distressful point of time, had thought the most useful and edifying, that I ever had contracted.
            The greater the merit, the worse the action: The finer the talents, the more dangerous the example.
            There were other duties, I said, besides that of a child to a parent; and I hoped I need not give up a suffering friend, especially at the instigation of those by whom she suffered. I told her, that it was very hard to annex such a condition as that to my duty; when I was persuaded, that both duties might be performed, without derogating from either: That an unreasonable command [She must excuse me, I must
say it, tho' I were slapt again] was a degree of tyranny: And I could not have expected, that at these years I should be allow'd no will, no choice of my own; where a woman only was concern'd, and the devilish sex not in the question.
            What turn'd most in favour of her argument was, that I desired to be excused from letting her read all that passes between us. She insisted much upon this: And since, she said, you were in the hands of the most intriguing man in the world; and a man, who had made a jest of her favourite Hickman, as she has been told; she knows not what consequences, unthought of by you or me, may flow from such a correspondence.
            So you see, my dear, that I fare the worse on Mr. Hickman's account! My mamma <i>might</i> see all that passes between us, did I not know, that it would cramp your spirit, and restrain the freedom of your pen, as it would also the freedom of my own: And were she not moreover so firmly attached to the contrary side, that inferences, consequences, strained deductions, censures, and constructions the most partial, would for ever be hawled in to teaze me, and would perpetually subject us to the necessity of debating and canvassing.
            Besides, I don't choose that she should know how much this artful wretch has outwitted, as I may call it, a lady so much his superior.
            The generosity of your heart, and the greatness of your mind (a mind above selfish considerations) full well I know; but do not offer to dissuade me from this correspondence.
            Mr. Hickman, immediately on the contention above, offer'd his service; and I accepted of it, as you'll see by my last. He thinks, tho' he has all honour for my mamma, that she is unkind to us both. He was pleased to tell me (with an air, as I thought), that he not only <i>approved</i> of our correspondence, but
admires the steadiness of my friendship; and having no opinion of your man, but a great one of me, thinks that my advice or intelligence, from time to time, may be of use to you; and, on this presumption, said, that it would be a thousand pities, that you should suffer for want of either.
            Mr. Hickman pleased me in the main by his speech; and it is well the general tenor of it was agreeable:—Otherwise, I can tell him, I should have reckon'd with him for his word <i>approve</i>; for it is a stile I have not yet permitted him to talk to me in:—And you see, my dear, what these men are:—No sooner do they find that you have favour'd them with the power of doing you an agreeable service, but they take upon them to <i>approve,</i> forsooth, of your actions!—By which is imply'd a right to <i>disapprove,</i> if they think fit.
            I have told my mamma, how much you wish to be reconciled to your relations, and how independent you are on Mr. Lovelace.
            Mark the end of the latter assertion, she says.—And as to reconciliation, she knows, nothing will do, and will have it, that nothing <i>ought</i> to do, but your returning back, without presuming to condition with them. And this if you do, she says, will best shew your independence on Lovelace.
            You see, my dear, what your duty is, in my mamma's opinion.
            I suppose your next directed to Mr. Hickman, at his own house, will be from London.
            Heaven preserve you in honour and safety, is my prayer.
            What you do for change of cloaths, I cannot imagine.
            It is amazing to me, what your relations can mean by distressing you as they seem resolved to do. I see they will throw you into his arms, whether you will or not.
            I send this by Robert, for dispatch-sake: And can
only repeat the hitherto rejected offer of my best services! Adieu, my dearest friend. Believe me ever
               Your affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.

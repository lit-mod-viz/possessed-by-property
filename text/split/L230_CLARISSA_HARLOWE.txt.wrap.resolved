                        Monday morning, March 27.                   THIS morning early my uncle Harlowe came hither. early my uncle Harlowe sent me up the inclosed very tender letter. the inclosed very tender letter has made me wish I <i>could</i> oblige him!ÑYou'll see how Mr. Solmes's ill qualities are gloss'd over in the inclosed very tender letter. What blemishes does affection hide!ÑSo, perhaps, may they say to me, What faults does antipathy bring to light! Be pleased to send me back the inclosed very tender letter's, by the first return. I may possibly try to account for, and wish to obviate, my being such a formidable creature to my whole family, as I am represented in it.  In about an hour after the inclosed very tender letter was given me, my uncle sent up to know, if my uncle should be a welcome visitor, upon the terms mention'd in my uncle letter? my uncle bid Betty bring my uncle down a verbal answer: A written one, my uncle said, would be a bad sign; and my uncle bid Betty therefore not bring a letter. But I had just finish'd the inclosed transcription of one I had been writing. Betty made a difficulty to carry it; but was prevailed upon to oblige me, by a token which these Mrs. Betty's cannot withstand.

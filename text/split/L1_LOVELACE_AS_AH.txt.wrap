My dearest Friend,                                                  YOU will perhaps think, that I have been too long silent. But I had begun two letters at different times since my last, and written a great deal each time; and with spirit enough, I assure you; incensed as I was against the abominable wretch you are with, particularly on reading yours of the 21st of the past month.                         The FIRST I intended to keep open till I could give you some accounts of my proceedings with Mrs. Townsend. It was some days before I saw her: And this intervenient space giving me time to reperuse what I had written, I thought it proper to lay that aside, and to write in a style a little less fervent; for you would have blamed me, I knew, for the freedom of some of my expressions (execrations, if you please). And when I had gone a good way in the SECOND, the change in your prospects, on his communicating to you Miss Montague's letter, and his better behaviour, occasioning a change in your mind, I laid that aside also: And in this uncertainty thought I would wait to see the issue of affairs between you, before I wrote again; believing that all would soon be decided one way or other.Ñ  <i>Here I was forced to break off.</i> I am <i>too little</i> my own mistress.Ñ My mother always up and down; and watching as if I were writing to a fellow. What need I (she asks me) lock myself in, if I am only reading past correspondencies? For that is my pretence, when she comes poking in with her face sharpen'd to an edge, as I may say, by a curiosity, that gives her more pain than pleasureÑThe Lord forgive me; but I believe I shall huff her, next time she comes in. Do you forgive me too, my dear. My mother ought; because she says, I am my father's girl; and because I am sure I am hers.                                                           <i>Upon my life, my dear, I am sometimes of opinion, that this vile man was capable of meaning you dishonour. When I look back upon his past conduct, I cannot help thinking so: What a villain, if so! ÑBut now I hope, and verily believe, that he has laid aside such thoughts. My reasons for both opinions I will give you.</i>                                                                                       <i>For the first, to wit, that he had it once in his head to take you at advantage if he could; I consider</i>                              , <i>that</i> pride, revenge, and a delight to tread in unbeaten paths, are principal ingredients in the character of this finish'd libertine. He hates all your family, yourself excepted.ÑYet is a savage in love. His pride, and the credit which a few plausible qualities sprinkled among his odious ones, have given him, have secured him too good a reception from our eye-judging, our undistinguishing, our self-flattering, our too-confiding sex, to make assiduity and obsequiousness, and a conquest of his unruly passions, any part of his study.                            He has some reason for his animosity to all the men, and to one woman, of your family. He has always shewn you and his own family too, that he prefers his pride to his interest. He is a declared marriage-hater; a notorious intriguer; full of his inventions, and glorying in them. As his vanity had made him imagine, that no woman could be proof against his love, no wonder that he struggled like a lion held in toils, against a passion that he thought not returned, Hence, perhaps, it is not difficult to believe, that it became possible for such a wretch as this to give way to his old prejudices against marriage; and to that revenge which had always been a first passion with him.                                                           <i>And hence may we account for</i> his delays; his teazing ways; his bringing you to bear with his lodging in the same house; his making you pass to the people of it as his wife; his bringing you into the company of his libertine companions; the attempt of imposing upon you that Miss Partington for a bedfellow, <i></i>                                                                                       <i>My reasons for the contrary opinion; to wit, that he is now resolved to do you all the justice in his power to do you</i>; are these: That he sees that all his own family have warmly engaged themselves in your cause; that the horrid wretch loves youÑWith such a Love, <i>however,</i> as Hd loved his Mariamne: That, on inquiry, I find it to be true, that counsellor Williams (whom Mr. Hickman knows to be a man of eminence in his profession) has actually as good as finished the settlements: That two draughts of them have been made; one avowedly to be sent to <i>this very</i> Captain Tomlinson: And I find, that a licence has actually been more than once endeavoured to be obtained, and that dfficulties have hitherto been made equally to Lovelace's vexation and disappointment. My mother's proctor, who is very intimate with the proctor apply'd to by the wretch, has come at this information, in confidence; and hints, that as Mr. Lovelace is a man of high fortunes, these difficulties will probably be got over.                                                           <i>I had once resolved to make strict inquiry about Tomlinson; and still, if you will, your uncle's favourite housekeeper may be sounded, at distance.</i>                                                                                       <i>I know that the matter is so laid</i>                              , that Mrs. Hodges is supposed to knw nothing of the treaty set on foot by means of Capt. Tomlinson. But your uncle is an old man, and old men imagine themselves to be under obligation to their paramours, if younger than themselves, and seldom keep any thing from their knowlege.ÑYet, methinks, there can be no need; since Tomlinson, as you describe him, is so good a man, and so much of a gentleman; the end to be answered by his being an impostor so much more than necessary, if Lovelace has villainy in his head.ÑAnd thus what he communicated to you of Mr. Hickman's application to your uncle, and of Mrs. Norton's to your mother (some of which particulars I am satisfied his vile agent Joseph Leman could not reveal to his viler employer); his pushing on the marriage-day, in the name of your uncle; which it could not answer any wicked purpose for him to do; and what he writes of your uncle's proposal, to have it thought that you were married from the time that you had lived in one house together; and that to be made to agree with the time of Mr. Hickman's visit to your uncle; the insisting on a trusty person's being present at the ceremony, at that uncle's nominationÑThese things make me <i>assured that he now at last means honourably.</i>                                                                                       <i>But if any unexpected delays should happen on his side, acquaint me, my dear, of the very street where Mrs. Sinclair lives; and where Mrs. Fretchville's house is situated (which I cannot find that you have ever mentioned in your former lettersÑwhich is a little odd); and I will make strict inquiries of them, and of Tomlinson too; and I will (if your heart will let you take my advice) soon procure you a refuge from him with Mrs. Townsend.</i>                                                                                       <i>But why do I now, when you seem to be in so good a train, puzzle and perplex you with my retrospections? And yet they may be of use to you, if any delay happen on his part.</i>                                                                                       <i>But that I think cannot well be. What you have therefore now to do, is, so to behave to this proud-spirited wretch, as may banish from his mind all remembrance of</i> past disobligations, and to receive his addresses, as those of a betrothed lover. You will incur the censure of prudery and affectation, if you keep him at that distance, which you have hitherto <i>kept him at.</i> His sudden (and as suddenly recover'd) illness has given him an opportunity to find out that you love him [Alas, my dear, I knew you loved him!]: He has seemed to change his nature, and is all love and gentleness: <i>And no more quarrels now, I beseech you.</i>                                                                                       <i>I am very angry with him, nevertheless, for the freedoms which he took with your person</i>                              ; <i>and I think some guard is necessary, as he is certainly an incroacher. But indeed all men are so; and you are such a charming creature, and have kept him at such a distance! Ñ But no more of this subject. Only, my dear, be not over-nice, now you are so near the state. You see what difficulties you laid yourself under,</i> when Tomlinson's letter called you again into <i>the wretch's</i> company.                            If you meet with no impediments, no new causes of doubt, your reputation in the eye of the world is concerned, that you should be his, <i>and, as your uncle rightly judges, be thought to have been his, before now.</i> And yet, <i>let me tell you,</i> I can <i>hardly</i> bear <i>to think,</i> that these libertines should be rewarded for their villainy with the best of the sex, when the worst of it are too good for them.                            I shall send this long letter by Collins, who changes his day to oblige me. As none of our letters by Wilson's conveyance have miscarried, when you have been in more apparently disagreeable situations than you are in at present, I <i>have no doubt</i> that this will go safe.                            Miss Lardner (whom you have seen at her cousin Biddulph's) saw you at St. James's Church on Sunday was fortnight. She kept you in her eye during the whole time; but could not once obtain the notice of yours, tho' she courtesied to you twice. She thought to pay her compliments to you when the service was over; for she doubted not but you were marriedÑand for an odd reasonÑbecause you came to church by yourself.ÑEvery eye, as usual, she said was upon you: and this seeming to give you hurry, and you being nearer the door than she, you slid out before she could go to you. But she order'd her servant to follow you till you were housed. This servant saw you step into a chair which waited for you; and you ordered the men to carry you to the place where they took you up. She <i>describes the house</i> as a very gentel house, and fit to receive people of fashion: <i>And what makes me mention this, is, that perhaps you will have a visit from her; or message, at least.</i>                                                                                       <i>So that you have Mr. Doleman's testimony to the credit of the house and people you are with</i>                              ; <i>and he is</i> a man of fortune, and some reputation; formerly a rake indeed; but married to a woman of family; and, having had a palsy-blow, one would think, a penitent. You have <i>aso Mr. Mennell's at least passive testimony; Mr.</i> Tomlinson<i>'s; and now, lastly, Miss Lardner's; so that there will be the less need for inquiry: But you know my busy and inquisitive temper, as well as my affection for you, and my concern for your honour. But all doubt will soon be lost in certainty.</i>                                                                                       <i>Nevertheless I must add, that I would have you</i> command me up, if I can be of the least service or pleasure to you. I value not fame; I value not censure; nor even life itself, I verily think, as I do your honour, and your friendship. Ñ For is not your honour my honour? And is not your friendship the pride of my life?                            May heaven preserve you, my dearest creature, in honour and safety, is the prayer, the hourly prayer, of                                                                              Your ever faithful and affectionate ANNA HOWE.

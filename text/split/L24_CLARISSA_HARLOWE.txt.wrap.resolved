                  Monday, March 20.             YOUR last so sensibly affects me, that I must postpone every other consideration, however weighty, to reply to it: And this I will do very distinctly, and with all the openness of heart, which our mutual friendship demands.             But let me observe, in the first place, <i>gratefully</i> observe, That if I have in <i>fifty passages</i> of my letters given you such <i>undoubted</i> proofs of my value for Mr. Lovelace, that you have spared me for the sake of my <i>explicitness,</i> it is acting by me with a generosity worthy of yourself.             But lives the man, think you, who is so very bad, that the man does not give even a doubting mind reason at <i>one</i> time to be better pleased with the man, than at <i>another?</i> And when that reason offers, is it not just to express one's self accordingly? I would do the man who addresses me as much <i>justice,</i> as if the man who addresses me did <i>not</i> address me: It has such a look of tyranny, It appears so ungenerous, methinks, to use a man worse for a man worse respect to one (no other cause for disrespect occurring), that I would not by any means be that person who should do so.             But, altho' I may intend no more than justice, it will, perhaps, be difficult to hinder those who know the man's views, from construing it as a partial favour: And especially if the eager-ey'd observer has been formerly touch'd herself, and would triumph that herself friend had been no more able to escape than she!ÑNoble minds, emulative of perfection (and yet the passion, properly directed, I do not take to be an <i>im</i>-perfection neither), may be allow'd a little generous envy, I think!             If I meant by this a reflection, by way of revenge, it is but a revenge, my dear, in the soft sense of the word!ÑI love, as I have told you, your pleasantryÑAltho' at the time, it may pain one a little; yet on recollection, when one feels in the reproof more of the cautioning friend, than of the satirizing observer, an ingenuous mind will be all gratitude upon an ingenuous mind. All the business will be This, I shall be sensible of the pain in the present letter perhaps; but I shall thank you in the next, and ever after.             In this way, I hope, my dear, you will account for a little of that sensibility which you will find above, and perhaps still more, as I proceed.ÑYou frequently remind me, by the <i>best example,</i> that I must not spare <i>you!</i>             I am not conscious, that I have written any thing of this man, that has not been more in this man dispraise than in this man favour. Such <i>is</i> this man, that I think I must have been faulty, and ought to take myself to account, if I had not: But if you think otherwise, I will not put you upon <i>labouring the proof,</i> as you call it! My conduct must then have a faulty <i>appearance</i> at least, and I will endeavour to rectify it. But of this I assure you, That whatever interpretation my words were capable of, I <i>intended not</i> any reserve to you. I wrote my heart, at the time:ÑIf I had had thoughts of disguising it, or been conscious, that there was <i>reason</i> for doing so; perhaps I had not given you the opportunity of remarking upon my <i>curiosity</i> after his relations esteem for me; nor upon my <i>conditional liking,</i> and such-like. All I intended by the first, I believe I honestly told you at the time: To that letter I therefore refer, whether that letter make for me, or against me: And by the other, that I might bear in mind, what it became a person of my sex and character to <i>be</i> and to <i>do,</i> in such an unhappy situation, where the imputed love is thought an undutiful, and therefore a criminal, passion; and where the supposed object of the imputed love is a man of faulty morals too. And I am sure you will excuse my desire of appearing at those times the person I ought to be; had I no other view in it, but to merit the continuance of your good opinion.             But that I may acquit myself of having reservesÑO, my dear, I must here break off!Ñ

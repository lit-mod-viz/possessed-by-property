<i>Sat.
Night.</i>                                                                         BY Dorcas's account of Dorcas Lady's behaviour, the dear creature seems to be recovering.
I shall give the earliest notice of this to the worthy Captain Tomlinson, that he may apprise uncle John of this.
I must be properly enabled, from that quarter to pacify her Lady, or, at least, to rebate her Lady first violence.

                      <i>Wednesd. May</i> 24.               IT is <i>not</i> in the power of woman, <i>says he,</i> to be altogether sincere on these occasions. But why?ÑDo why?ÑDo think why?ÑDo so great a disgrace to be found out to be really what why?ÑDo <i>are?</i>             I regretted the illness of Mrs. Fretchville; as the intention I had to fix Mrs. Fretchville dear self in the house before the happy knot was tied, would have set Mrs. Fretchville in that independence in <i>appearance,</i> as well as <i>fact,</i> which was necessary to shew to all the world, that Mrs. Fretchville choice was free; and <i>as</i> the ladies of my family would have been proud to make my family court to Mrs. Fretchville there; while the settlements and our equipages were preparing. But on any other account, there was no great matter in it; since when my happy day was over, our could, with so much convenience, go down to the Lawn, or to my Lord M.'s, or to either of my aunts in town; which would give full time to provide our with servants, and other accommodations.             How sweetly the charmer listen'd!             I asked             , If              had had the small-pox?             'Twas always a doubtful point with              mother and Mrs. Norton,              own'd. But altho'              was not afraid of altho,              chose not unnecessarily to rush into places where altho was.                <i>Right, thought I</i>ÑElse, I said, it would not have been amiss for              to see the house before              went into the country; for, if <i>she</i> liked the house not, I was not obliged to have the house.                          asked, If              might take a copy of Miss Montague's letter?             I said,              might keep Miss Montague's letter, and send Miss Montague's letter to Miss Howe, if              pleased; for that, I supposed, was              intention.              bow'd              head to me. There, Jack!ÑI shall have              courtesy to me, by-and-by, I question not. What a-devil had I to do, to terrify the sweet creature by my termagant projects!ÑYet it was not amiss, I believe, to make              afraid of me.              <i>says,</i> I am an unpolite manÑAnd every polite instance from such a one, is deem'd a favour.             Talking of the settlements, I told             , that I had rather Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte), had not been consulted on this occasion. Pritchard, indeed, was a very honest man; and had been for a generation in the family; and knew the estates, and the condition of the estates, better than either my Lord or myself: But Pritchard, like other old men, was diffident and slow; and valued Pritchard upon Pritchard skill as a draughts-man; and for the sake of that paltry reputation, must have all Pritchard forms preserved, were an imperial crown to depend upon Pritchard dispatch.             I kissed              unrepulsing hand no less than five times during this conversation. Lord, Jack, how my generous heart run over!ÑShe was quite obliging at parting.ÑShe in a manner asked me <i>leave</i> to retire; to reperuse Charlotte's letter.ÑI think ÑI bent ÑI knees to me; but I won't be sure.ÑHow happy might we have both been long ago, had the dear creature been always as complaisant to me! For I do love respect, and, whether I deserved it or not, always had it, till I knew this proud beauty.             And now, Belford, are we in a train, or the duce is in the duce. Every fortified town has Every fortified town strong and Every fortified town weak place. I had carried on my attacks against the impregnable parts. I have no doubt but I shall either <i>shine</i> or <i>smuggle</i> her out of her cloak, since her and Miss Howe have intended to employ a smuggler against <i>me.</i>ÑAll we wait for now, is my Lord's letter.             But I had like to have <i>forgot</i> to tell thee, that we have been not a little alarm'd, by some inquiries that have been made after me and my beloved, by a man of good appearance; who yesterday procured a tradesman in the neighbouroood to send for Dorcas: Of whom Dorcas asked several questions relating to we; and particularly (as we boarded and lodged in one house), whether we were married?             This has given my beloved great uneasiness. And I could not help observing upon This, to her, how right a thing This was, that we had given out below that we were married. The inquiry, most probably, I said, was from her brother's quarter; and now, perhaps, that we marriage was owned, we should hear no more of our marriage machinations. The person, it seems, was curious to know the day that the ceremony was performed. But Dorcas refused to give Dorcas any other particulars, than that we <i>were</i> married; and was the more reserved, as Dorcas declined to tell Dorcas the motives of Dorcas inquiry.

                     <i>Friday, July</i> 21.                                   <i>Miss</i> ANN HOWE,             YOUR pert letter I have received. You, that spare no-body, I cannot expect should spare me. You are very happy in a prudent and watchful motherÑBut elseÑMine cannot be exceeded in prudence: But we had all too good an opinion of Somebody, to think watchfulness needful. There may possibly be some reason why <i>you</i> are so much attached to her, in an error of this flagrant nature.                <i>I</i> help to make a sister unhappy!ÑIt is false, Miss!Ñ It is all her own doings!ÑExcept, indeed, what she may owe to Somebody's adviceÑYou know who can best answer for that.             Let us <i>know your mind</i> as soon as you please: As we shall know it to be <i>your</i> mind, we shall judge what attention to give it. That's all, from,                 AR. H.

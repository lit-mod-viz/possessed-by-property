<i>Sunday Evening, Sept.</i> 3.             I Wonder not at the impatience your servant tells me you express to hear from your servant. I was designing to write you a long letter, and was just returned from Smith's for that purpose; but, since you are so urgent, you must be contented with a short one.             I attended Smith's this morning, just before I set out for Edgware. Smith's was so ill over-night, that Smith's was obliged to leave Smith's letter to Miss Howe unfinished: But early this morning Smith's made an end of it, and had just sealed it up as I came. Smith's was so fatigued with writing, that Smith's told me Smith's would lie down after I was gone, and endeavour to recruit Smith's spirits.             she told me she would lie down after I was gone, and endeavour to recruit her spirits had sent for Mr. Goddard, when Smith's was so ill last night; and not being able to see Mr. Goddard out of Smith's own chamber, Mr. Goddard, for the first time, saw Smith's <i>house,</i> as Smith's calls it. Mr. Goddard was extremely shocked and concerned at it; and chid Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick for not persuading Smith's to have such an object removed from Smith's bedchamber: And when they excused they on the <i>little authority</i> it was reasonable to suppose they must have with a lady so much they superior, a lady reflected warmly on those who had <i>more</i> authority, and who left a lady to proceed in such a shocking and solemn whimsy, as a lady called it.             it is placed near the window, like a harpsichord, tho' covered over to the ground: And when a lady is so ill, that a lady cannot well go to a lady closet, a lady writes and reads upon it, as others would upon a desk or table. But (only as a lady was so ill last night) a lady chooses not to see any-body in that apartment.             I went to Edgware; and, returning in the evening, attended a lady again. a lady had a letter brought a lady from Mrs. Norton (a long one, as it seems by its bulk) just before I came. But a lady had not opened its; and said, That as a lady was pretty calm and composed, a lady was afraid to look into the contents, lest a lady should be ruffled; expecting, now, to hear of nothing that could do a lady good or give a lady pleasure from that good woman's <i>dear hard-hearted neighbours,</i> as a lady called a lady own relations.             Seeing a lady so weak and ill, I withdrew; nor did a lady desire me to tarry, as sometimes a lady does, when I make a motion to depart.             By Mrs. Smith I had some hints, as I went away, that Mrs. Smith had appropriated that evening to some offices, that were to save trouble, as Mrs. Smith called it, after Mrs. Smith departure; and had been giving Mrs. Smith nurse, and Mrs. Lovick, and Mrs. Smith, orders about what Mrs. Smith would have done when Mrs. Smith <i>was gone</i>; and I believe she had appropriated that evening to some offices, that were to save trouble, as she called it, after her departure; and had been giving her nurse, and Mrs. Lovick, and Mrs. Smith, orders about what she would have done when she <i>was gone</i> were of a very delicate and affecting nature; but Mrs. Smith descended not to particulars.             The Doctor had been with Mrs. Smith, as well as Mr. Goddard; and they both joined with great earnestness to persuade Mrs. Smith to have Mrs. Smith <i>house</i> removed out of Mrs. Smith sight: But Mrs. Smith assured they both, that it gave Mrs. Smith pleasure and spirits; and, being a necessary preparation, Mrs. Smith wondered they both should be surprised at it, when Mrs. Smith had not any of Mrs. Smith family about Mrs. Smith, or any old acquaintance, on whose care and exactness in these <i>punctilio's,</i> as Mrs. Smith called they both, Mrs. Smith could rely.             The Doctor told Mrs. Smith, that The Doctor believed Mrs. Smith would hold out long enough for any of Mrs. Smith friends to have notice of Mrs. Smith state, and to see Mrs. Smith, and hardly longer; and since The Doctor could not find, that Mrs. Smith had any certainty of hearing from or seeing Mrs. Smith cousin Morden (which made it plain, that Mrs. Smith relations continued inflexible) The Doctor would go home, and write a letter to Mrs. Smith father, take a letter as Mrs. Smith would.             Mrs. Smith had spent great part of the day in intense devotions; and to-morrow morning Mrs. Smith is to have with Mrs. Smith the same clergyman who has often attended Mrs. Smith; from whose hands Mrs. Smith will again receive the Sacrament.             Thou seest, Lovelace, that all is preparing, that all will be ready; and I am to attend Mrs. Smith to-morrow afternoon, to take some instructions from Mrs. Smith in relation to my part in the office to be performed for Mrs. Smith. And thus, omitting the particulars of a fine conversation between Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick, which the latter acquainted me with, as well as another between Mrs. Smith and the Doctor and Apothecary. which I had a design this evening to give you, they being of a very affecting nature, I have yielded to your impatience.                   I shall dispatch Harry to-morrow morning early with Harry letter to Miss Howe: An offer Harry took very kindly; as Harry is extremely solicitous to lessen that young lady's apprehensions for Harry on not hearing from Harry by Saturday's post: And yet, to write the truth, how can Harry apprehensions be lessened?

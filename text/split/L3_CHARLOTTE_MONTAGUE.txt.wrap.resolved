<i>M. Hall, Tuesday afternoon.</i>                                   <i>Dear Miss</i> HOWE,             YOUR letter has infinitely disturbed us all.             This wretched man has been half distracted ever since Saturday night.             We knew not what ailed This wretched man, till your letter was brought.             Vile wretch as, This wretched man is, This wretched man is however innocent of this new evil.             Indeed This wretched man is, This wretched man <i>must</i> be; as I shall more at large acquaint you.             But will not now detain your messenger.             Only to satisfy your just impatience, by telling you, that the dear young lady is safe, and, We hope, well.             A horrid mistake of              general orders has subjected the dear young lady to the terror and disgrace of an arrest.             Poor dear Miss Harlowe! the dear young lady sufferings have endeared the dear young lady to We, almost as much as the dear young lady excellencies can have done to you.             But the dear young lady must be now quite at liberty.                          has been a distracted man, ever since the news was brought             ; and We knew not what ailed             .             But that I said before.             My Lord M. my Lady Sarah Sadleir, and my Lady Betty Lawrance, will all write to My Lord M. my Lady Sarah Sadleir, and my Lady Betty Lawrance this very afternoon.             And so will the wretch himself.             And send              by a servant of their own, not to detain. My Lord M. my Lady Sarah Sadleir, and my Lady Betty Lawrance.             I know not what I write.             But you shall have all the particulars, just, and true, and fair, from,                Dear Madam,                Your most faithful and obedient Servant, <i>CH. MONTAGUE.</i>

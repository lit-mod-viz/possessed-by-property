To Mrs. LOVELACE.                   INdeed, my dearest life, you carry this matter too far. What will the people below, who suppose us one, as to the ceremony, think of so great a niceness? Liberties so innocent; the occasion so Liberties will expose <i>yourself</i> as well as <i>me.</i>ÑHitherto they know nothing of what has passed. And what, indeed, <i>has</i> passed, to occasion all this resentment?ÑI am sure, you will not, by a breach of your word of honour, give me reason to conclude, that, had I <i>not</i> obeyed you, I could have fared no worse.                   Most sincerely do I repent the offence given to your delicacyÑBut must I, for so accidental an occurrence, be branded by such shocking names? <i>Vilest of men,</i> and <i>most detestable of plotters,</i> are hard words!ÑFrom such a Lady's pen too.                   If you step up another pair of stairs, you'll be convinced, that, however <i>detestable</i> to you, I am no <i>plotter</i> in this affair.                   I must insist upon seeing you, in order to take your directions upon some of the subjects that we talked of yesterday in the evening.                   All that's more than necessary is too much. I claim your promised pardon, and wish to plead your promised pardon on my knees.                   I beg your presence in the dining-room for one quarter of an hour, and I will then leave you for the day. I am, my dearest life,                      Your ever-adoring and truly penitent, <i>LOVELACE.</i>

                  Monday night, May 1.             I HAVE just escaped from the very disagreeable company I was obliged, so much against my will, to be in. As a very particular relation of this evening's conversation would be painful to me, you must content yourself with what you shall be able to collect from the outlines, as I may call them, of the characters of the persons, assisted by the little histories Mr. Lovelace gave me of each yesterday.             The names of the gentlemen are Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and Belford. These four, with Mrs. Sinclair, Miss Partington, the great heiress mentioned in my last, Mr. Lovelace, and myself, made up the company.             I gave you before the favourable side of Miss Partington's character, such as it was given me by Mrs. Sinclair, and Mrs. Sinclair nieces. I will now add a few words from my own observations upon her behaviour in <i>this</i> company.             In <i>better</i> company, perhaps, her would have appeared to less disadvantage: But, notwithstanding her innocent looks, which Mr. Lovelace also highly praised, Mr. Lovelace is the last person whose judgment I would take upon real modesty. For I observed, that, upon some talk from the gentlemen, not free enough to be openly censured, yet too indecent in its implication to come from well-bred persons, in the company of virtuous people, her was very ready to apprehend; and yet, by smiles and simperings, to encourage, rather than discourage, the culpable freedoms of persons, who, in what they went out of they way to say, must either be guilty of absurdity, meaning <i>nothing</i>; or, meaning <i>something,</i> of rudeness.             But indeed I have seen ladies, of whom I have had a better opinion, than I can say I have of Mrs. Sinclair, who have allowed <i>gentlemen,</i> and <i>themselves</i> too, in greater liberties of this sort, than I have thought consistent with that purity of manners which ought to be the distinguishing characteristic of our sex: For what are <i>words,</i> but the <i>body</i> and <i>dress</i> of <i>thought?</i> And is not the mind indicated strongly by its outward dress?             But to the gentlemen, as the gentlemen must be called in right of the gentlemen ancestors, it seems; for no other do the gentlemen appear to have.             Mr. BELTON has had university-education, and was designed for the gown; but that not suiting with the gaiety of Mr. BELTON temper, and an uncle dying, who bequeathed to Mr. BELTON a good estate, Mr. BELTON quitted the college, came up to town, and commenced fine gentleman. Mr. BELTON is said to be a man of sense. Mr. BELTON dresses gaily, but not quite foppishly; drinks hard; keeps all hours, and glories in doing so; games, and has been hurt by that pernicious diversion: Mr. BELTON is about thirty years of age: Mr. BELTON face is of a fiery red, somewhat bloated and pimply; and Mr. BELTON irregularities threaten a brief duration to the sensual dream Mr. BELTON is in; for Mr. BELTON has a short consumptive cough, which seems to indicate bad lungs; yet makes Mr. BELTON and Mr. BELTON friends merry, by Mr. BELTON stupid and inconsiderate jests upon very threatening symptoms, which ought to make Mr. BELTON more serious.             Mr. MOWBRAY has been a great traveller; speaks as many languages as Mr. Lovelace himself, but not so fluently: Is of a good family: Seems to be about thirty-three or thirty-four: Tall and comely in his person: Bold and daring in his look: Is a large-boned strong man: Has a great scar in a large-boned strong man forehead, with a dent, as if a large-boned strong man skull had been beaten in there; and a seamed scar in a large-boned strong man right cheek. a large-boned strong man dresses likewise very gaily: Has a large-boned strong man servants always about a large-boned strong man, whom a large-boned strong man is continually calling upon, and sending on the most trifling messages; half a dozen instances of which we had in the little time I was among half a dozen; while half a dozen seem to watch the turn of a large-boned strong man fierce eye, to be ready to run, before half a dozen have half a large-boned strong man message, and serve a large-boned strong man with fear and trembling. Yet to a large-boned strong man equals a large-boned strong man seems tolerable: Talks not amiss upon public entertainments and diversions, especially upon those abroad: Yet has a romancing air; and averrs things strongly, which seem quite improbable. Indeed, a large-boned strong man <i>doubts</i> nothing, but what a large-boned strong man ought to <i>believe:</i> For a large-boned strong man jests upon sacred things; and professes to hate the clergy of all religions: Has high notions of <i>honour,</i> a word hardly ever out of a large-boned strong man mouth; but seems to have no great regard to <i>morals.</i>             Mr. TOURVILLE occasionally told Mr. TOURVILLE age; just turn'd of thirty-one. Mr. TOURVILLE also is of an antient family; but, in Mr. TOURVILLE person and manners, more of what I call the coxcomb, than any of Mr. TOURVILLE companions: Mr. TOURVILLE dresses richly; would be thought elegant in the choice and fashion of what Mr. TOURVILLE wears; yet, after all, appears rather tawdry than fine. One sees, by the care Mr. TOURVILLE takes of Mr. TOURVILLE outside, and the notice Mr. TOURVILLE bespeaks from <i>every one,</i> by Mr. TOURVILLE <i>own</i> notice of Mr. TOURVILLE, that the inside takes up the least of Mr. TOURVILLE attention. Mr. TOURVILLE dances finely, Mr. TOURVILLE says: Is a master of music; and singing is one of Mr. TOURVILLE principal excellencies. They prevailed upon Mr. TOURVILLE to sing; and Mr. TOURVILLE obliged They both in Italian and French; and, to do Mr. TOURVILLE justice, Mr. TOURVILLE songs in both were decent. his songs in both were all highly delighted with Mr. TOURVILLE performance; but Mr. TOURVILLE greatest admirers were Mrs. Sinclair, Miss Partington, and <i>himself.</i> To me Mr. TOURVILLE appeared to have a great deal of affectation.             Mr. Tourville's conversation and address are insufferably full of those really gross affronts upon the understandings of our sex, which the moderns call <i>compliments,</i> and are intended to pass for so many instances of good breeding, tho' the most hyperbolical, unnatural stuff that can be conceived, and which can only serve to shew the insincerity of the <i>complimenter</i>; and the ridiculous light in which the <i>complimented</i> appears in his eyes, if his supposes a woman capable of relishing the romantic absurdities of his speeches.             his affects to introduce into his common talk Italian and French words; and often answers an English question in French, which language his greatly prefers to the barbarously hissing English. But then his never fails to translate, into this his odious native tongue, the words, and the sentences, his speaks in the other twoÑLest, perhaps, it should be questioned, whether his understands what his says.             his loves to tell stories: Always calls them <i>merry, facetious, good,</i> or <i>excellent,</i> before his begins, in order to bespeak the attention of the hearers; but never gives his concern, in the <i>progress</i> or <i>conclusion</i> of them, to make good what his promises in his <i>preface.</i> Indeed his seldom brings any of them to a conclusion; for, if his company have patience to hear his out, his breaks in upon his by so many parenthetical intrusions, as one may call them, and has so many incidents springing in upon his, that his frequently drops his own thread, and sometimes sits down satisfied halfway; or, if at other times his would resume it, his applies to his company to help his in again, with a <i>Devil fetch him</i> if his remembers what his was driving at. But enough, and too much, of Mr. Tourville.             Mr. BELFORD is the fourth gentleman, and one of whom Mr. Lovelace seems more fond than any of the restÑBeing a man of try'd bravery, it seems; for this pair of friends came acquainted upon occasion of a quarrel (possibly about a lady), which a rencounter at Kensington gravelpits ended, by the mediation of three gentlemen strangers.             Mr. Belford is about seven or eight and-twenty, it seems; the youngest of the five, except Mr. Lovelace: And these are, perhaps, the wickedest; for these seem capable of leading the other three as these please. Mr. Belford, as the others, dresses gaily: But has not those advantages of person, nor from Mr. Belford dress, which Mr. Lovelace is too proud of. Mr. Belford has, however, the appearance of a gentleman. Mr. Belford is well read in classical authors, and in the best English poets and writers: And, by Mr. Belford means, the conversation took now-and-then a more agreeable turn: And I, who endeavoured to put the best face I could upon my situation, as I passed for Mrs. Lovelace with them, made shift to join in it, at such times; and received abundance of compliments from all the company, on the observations I made.             Mr. Belford seems good-natured and obliging; and, altho' very complaisant, not so fulsomely so, as Mr. Tourville; and has a polite and easy manner of expressing Mr. Belford sentiments on all occasions. Mr. Belford seems to delight in a logical way of argumentation, as also does Mr. BELTON; these two attacking each other in this way; and both looking at us women, as if to observe whether us did not admire us women learning, or us women wit, when us women had said a smart thing. But Mr. Belford had visibly the advantage of the other, having quicker parts, and, by taking the worst side of the argument, seemed to <i>think</i> Mr. Belford had: All together, Mr. Belford put me in mind of that character in Milton:                   ÑHis tongue                   Dropt manna, and could make the worse appear                   The better reason, to perplex and dash                   Maturest counsels; for Mr. Belford thoughts were low;                   To vice industrious: But to nobler deeds                   Tim'rous and slothful:ÑYet Mr. Belford pleas'd the ear.             How little soever matters in general may be to our liking, our are apt to endeavour, when hope is strong enough to permit it, to make the best our can of the lot our have drawn; and I could not but observe often, how much Mr. TOURVILLE excelled all Mr. TOURVILLE four friends in every thing all his four friends seemed desirous to excel in. But, as to wit and vivacity, Mr. TOURVILLE had no equal present. All the others gave up to Mr. TOURVILLE, when Mr. TOURVILLE lips began to open. Mr. MOWBRAY would call upon the prating Tourville for silence, and with Mr. MOWBRAY elbow would punch Mr. BELTON Mr. BELTON into attention, when Mr. TOURVILLE was going to speak. And when Mr. MOWBRAY had spoken, the words, Charming fellow! with a free word of admiration or envy, fell from every mouth. Mr. MOWBRAY has indeed so many advantages in Mr. MOWBRAY person and manner, that what would be inexcusable in another, if one took not great care to watch over one's self, and to distinguish what is the essence of right and wrong, would look becoming in Mr. MOWBRAY.             'See Mr. MOWBRAY among twenty men,' said Mr. Belford; who, to my no small vexation and confusion, with the forwardness of a favoured and intrusted friend, singled me out, on Mr. TOURVILLE's being sent for down, to make me congratulatory compliments on my supposed nuptials; which Mr. MOWBRAY did with a caution, not to insist too long on the rigorous vow I had imposed upon a man so universally admiredÑ             'See Mr. MOWBRAY among twenty men,' said Mr. MOWBRAY, "all of distinction, and nobody is regarded but Mr. TOURVILLE."             It must, indeed, be confessed, that there is in his whole deportment a natural dignity, which renders all insolent or imperative demeanour as unnecessary as inexcusable. Then that deceiving sweetness which appears in Mr. MOWBRAY smiles, in Mr. MOWBRAY accent, in Mr. MOWBRAY whole aspect and address, when Mr. MOWBRAY thinks it worth Mr. MOWBRAY while to oblige, or endeavour to attract, how does this shew, that Mr. MOWBRAY was <i>born</i> innocent, as I may say; that Mr. MOWBRAY was not <i>naturally</i> the cruel, the boisterous, the impetuous creature, which the wicked company Mr. MOWBRAY may have fallen into have made Mr. MOWBRAY! For Mr. MOWBRAY has, besides, an open, and, I think, an honest countenance. Don't you think so too?ÑOn all these specious appearances, have I founded my hopes of seeing Mr. MOWBRAY a reformed man.             But 'tis amazing to me, I own, that with so much of the gentleman, such a general knowlege of books and men, such a skill in the learned as well as modern languages, Mr. MOWBRAY can take so much delight as Mr. MOWBRAY does in the company of such persons as I have described, and in subjects of frothy impertinence, unworthy of Mr. MOWBRAY talents, and natural and acquired advantages. I can think of but one reason for it, and that must argue a very low mind; Mr. MOWBRAY VANITY; which makes Mr. MOWBRAY desirous of being considered as the head of the people Mr. MOWBRAY consorts with. A man to love praise; yet to be content to draw it from such contaminated springs!             One compliment passed from Mr. Belford to Mr. Lovelace, which hastened my quitting the shocking companyÑ'You are a happy man, Mr. Lovelace,' said companyÑ'You, upon some fine speeches made companyÑ'You by Mrs. Sinclair, and assented to by Miss Partington: "You have so much courage, and so much wit, that neither man nor woman can stand before you."             Mr. Belford looked at Mr. Belford, when Mr. Belford spoke: Yes, my dear, Mr. Belford smilingly looked at Mr. Belford: And Mr. Belford looked upon Mr. Belford complimented friend: And all their <i>assenting,</i> and therefore <i>affronting</i> eyes, both mens and womens, were turned upon your Clarissa: At least, my self-reproaching heart made me think so; for that would hardly permit my eye to look up.             Oh! my dear, were but a woman, who is thought to be in love with a man (and this must be believed to be my case; or to what can my <i>supposed</i> voluntary going off with Mr. TOURVILLE be imputed to?) to reflect one moment on the exaltation Mr. TOURVILLE gives <i>him,</i> and the disgrace Mr. TOURVILLE brings upon <i>herself,</i> the low pity, the silent contempt, the insolent sneers and whispers, to which Mr. TOURVILLE makes Mr. TOURVILLE obnoxious from a censuring world of both sexes, how would Mr. TOURVILLE despise Mr. TOURVILLE! And how much more eligible would Mr. TOURVILLE think death itself to such a discovered debasement!             What I have thus in general touched upon, will account to you, why I could not more particularly relate what passed in the evening's conversation: Which, as may be gathered from what I have written, abounded with <i>approbatory</i> accusations, and <i>supposed</i> witry retorts.

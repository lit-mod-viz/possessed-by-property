                        Tuesday night.
SINCE I wrote the above, I have ventured to send a letter by Shorey, to my mamma.
I directed my mamma to give a letter into my mamma own hand, when nobody was by.
I shall inclose the copy of a letter.
You'll see that I would have a letter thought, that now my mamma is gone, I have no way to correspond out of the house.
I am far from thinking all I do, right.
I am afraid, this is a little piece of art, that is <i>not</i> so.
But this is an after-thought: The letter went first.

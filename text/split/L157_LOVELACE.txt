<i>Tuesday Morn.</i> 10 <i>o'Clock.</i>
            VERY ill!—Exceeding ill!—as Dorcas tells me, in order to avoid seeing me—And yet the dear soul may be so in her <i>mind</i>—But is not that equivocation?—Some one passion predominating, in every human breast, breaks thro' principle, and controuls us all. Mine is <i>love</i> and <i>revenge</i> taking turns. Hers is <i>hatred.</i>—But this is my consolation, that <i>hatred appeased, is love begun</i>; or <i>love renew'd,</i> I may rather say, if love ever had footing here.
            But <i>reflectioning</i> apart, thou seest, Jack, that her plot is beginning to work. To-morrow it is to break out.
            I have been abroad, to set on foot a plot of circumvention. All fair now, Belford!—
            I insisted upon visiting my indisposed fair one. Dorcas made officious excuses for her. I cursed the wench in her hearing for her impertinence; and stamp'd, and made a clutter;—which was improved into an apprehension to the lady, that I would have flung her faithful confidante from the top of the stairs to the bottom.
            He is a violent wretch!—But, Dorcas (<i>dear</i> Dorcas now it is), thou shalt have a friend in me to the last day of my life.
            And what now dost think, the name of her <i>good angel</i> is?—Why <i>Dorcas Martindale,</i> Christian and super (no more Wykes) as in the promisory note in my former—And the dear creature has bound her to her by the <i>most solemn</i> obligations, <i>besides</i> the tie of interest.
            Whither, Madam, do you design to go when you get out of this house?
                 I will throw myself into the first open house I can find; and beg protection till I can get a coach, or a lodging in some honest family.
            What will you do for cloaths, Madam?—I doubt you'll not be able to take any away with you, but what you'll have on.
            O no matter for cloaths, if I can but get out of this house.
            What will you do for money, Madam? I have heard his Honour express his concern, that he could not prevail upon you to be obliged to him, tho' he apprehended, that you must be short of money.
            O, I have rings, and other valuables. Indeed I have but four guineas, and two of them, I found lately wrapt up in a bit of lace, designed for a charitable use: But now, alas! Charity begins at home! But I have one dear friend left, if she be living, as I hope in God she is! to whom I can be obliged, if I want, O Dorcas! I must ere now have heard from her, if I had had fair play.
            Well, Madam, yours is a hard lot. I pity you at my heart!
            Thank you, Dorcas! —I am unhappy, that I did not think <i>before,</i> that I might have confided in thy pity, and in thy sex!
            I pitied you, Madam, often and often: But you were always, as I thought, diffident of me. And then I doubted not but you were married; and I thought his Honour was unkindly used by you. So that I thought it my duty to wish well to his Honour, rather than to what I thought to be your humours, Madam. Would to heaven, that I had known before, that you were not married!—Such a lady! — Such a fortune! — To be so sadly betrayed!—
            Ah, Dorcas! I was basely drawn in! My youth! My ignorance of the world! — And I have some things to reproach myself with, when I look back!
                 Lord, Madam, what deceitful creatures are these men!—Neither oaths, nor vows!—I am sure! I am sure!—And then with her apron she gave her eyes half a dozen hearty rubs—I may curse the time that I came into this house! —
            Here was accounting for her bold eyes! And was it not better to give up a house, which her lady could not think worse of than she did, in order to gain the reputation of sincerity, than by offering to vindicate it, to make her proffered services suspected?
            Poor Dorcas!—Bless me! how little do we, who have lived all our time in the country, know of this wicked town!—
            Had I <i>been able to write,</i> cried the veteran wench, I should certainly have given some other near relations I have in Wales, a little <i>inkling</i> of matters; and they would have saved me from—from—from—
            Her sobs were enough. The apprehensions of women on such subjects are ever aforehand with speech.
            And then, sobbing on, she lifted her apron to her face again. She shewed me how.
            Poor Dorcas!—Again wiping her own charming eyes.
            All love, all compassion, is this dear creature to every one in affliction, but me.
            And would not an aunt protect her kinswoman? —Abominable wretch!
            I can't—I can't—I can't—say, my aunt was privy to it. She gave me good advice. She knew not for a great while, that I was—that I was—that I was— ugh!—ugh!—ugh!—
            No more, no more, good Dorcas! — What a world we live in!—What a house am I in! But ome, don't weep (tho' she herself could not for
               ear): My being betrayed into it, tho' to my own , may be a happy event for thee: And, if I live,  shall.
                 I thank you, my good lady, blubbering. I am sorry, very sorry, you have had so hard a lot. But it may be the saving of my soul, if I can get to your ladyship's house.—Had I but known that your ladyship was not married, I would have eat my own flesh, before, before, before—
            Dorcas sobb'd and wept. The lady sighed and wept also.
            But now, Jack, for a serious reflection upon the premises.
            How will the good folks account for it, that Satan has such faithful instruments, and that the bond of wickedness is a stronger bond, than the ties of virtue? —As if it were the nature of the human mind to be villainous. For here, had Dorcas been <i>good,</i> and tempted, as she was tempted, to any thing <i>evil,</i> I make no doubt, but she would have yielded to the temptation.
            And cannot our fraternity, in an hundred instances, give proof of the like predominance of vice over virtue? And that we have risqued more to serve and promote the interests of the former, than ever a good man did to serve a good man, or a good cause? For have we not been prodigal of life and fortune? Have we not defied the civil magistrate upon occasion; and have we not attempted rescues, and dared all things, only to extricate a pounded profligate?—
            Whence, Jack, can this be?
            O I have it, I believe. The vicious are as bad as they can be; and do the devil's work without looking after; while he is continually spreading snares for the others; and, like a skilful angler, suiting his baits to the fish he angles for.
            Nor let even <i>honest</i> people, <i>so called,</i> blame po Dorcas for her fidelity in a bad cause. For does no the <i>General,</i> who implicitly serves an ambitious princ in his unjust designs upon his neighbours, or upo his own oppressed subjects; and even the <i>Lawyer</i>
who, for the sake of a paltry fee, undertakes to whiten a black cause, and to defend it against one he knows to be good, do the very same thing as Dorcas? And are they not both every whit as culpable? Yet the one shall be dubbed a hero, the other a charming fellow, and be contended for by every client; and his double-paced abilities shall carry him thro' all the high preferments of the Law with reputation and applause.
            Well but, what shall be done, since the lady is so much determined on removing?—Is there no way to oblige her, and yet to make the very act subservient to my own views?—I fancy such a way may be found out.
            I will study for it—
            Suppose I suffer her to make an escape? Her heart is in it. If she effect it, the triumph she will have over me upon it will be a counterbalance for all she has suffered.
            I will oblige her if I can.
            TIred with a succession of fatiguing days and sleepless nights, and with contemplating the precarious situation I stand in with my Beloved, I fell into a profound resverie; which brought on sleep; and that produced a dream; a fortunate dream; which, as I imagine, will afford my working mind the means to effect the obliging double purpose my heart is now once more set upon.
            What, as I have often contemplated, is the enjoyment of the finest woman in the world, to the contrivance, the bustle, the surprizes, and at last the happy conclusion of a well-laid plot?—The charming <i>roundabouts,</i> to come the <i>nearest way home</i>;—
the doubts; the apprehensions; the heart-akings, the meditated triumphs.—These are the joys that make the blessing dear.—For all the rest, what is it?— What but to find an angel in imagination dwindled down to a woman in fact?—But to my dream—
            Methought it was about nine on Wednesday morning, that a chariot, with a dowager's arms upon the doors, and in it a grave matronly lady [not unlike Mother H. in the face; but in her heart O how unlike!], stopp'd at a grocer's shop, about ten doors on the other side of the way, in order to buy some groceries: And methought Dorcas, having been out to see if the coast were clear for her lady's flight, and if a coach were to be got near the place, espied this chariot with the dowager's arms, and this matronly lady: And what, methought, did Dorcas, that subtle traitress, do, but whip up to the old matronly lady, and, lifting up her voice, say, Good my Lady, permit me one word with your Ladyship.
            What thou hast to say to me, say on, quoth the old lady; the grocer retiring, and standing aloof, to give Dorcas leave to speak; who, methought, in words like these, accosted the lady.
               "You seem, Madam, to be a very good lady; and here in this neighbourhood, at a house of no high repute, is an innocent lady of rank and fortune, beautiful as a May morning, and youthful as a rose-bud, and full as sweet and lovely; who has been trick'd thither by a wicked gentleman, practised in the ways of the town; and this very night will she be ruined, if she get not out of his hands. Now, O Lady! if you will extend your compassionate goodness to this fair young lady, in whom, the moment you behold her, you will see cause to believe all I say; and let her but have a place in your chariot, and remain in your protection for one day only, till she can send a man
and a horse to her rich and powerful friends; you may save from ruin a lady, who has no equal for virtue as well as beauty."
            Methought the old lady, moved with Dorcas's story, answered and said,
"Hasten, O damsel, who in a happy moment art come to put it in my power to serve the innocent and the virtuous, which it has always been my delight to do; Hasten to this young lady, and bid her hie hither to me with all speed; and tell her, that my chariot shall be her asylum: And if I find all that thou sayest true, my house shall be her sanctuary, and I will protect her from all her oppressors."
            Hereupon, methought, this traitress Dorcas hied back to the lady, and made report of what she had done. And, methought, the lady highly approved of Dorcas's proceeding, and blessed her for her good thought.
            And I lifted up mine eyes, and behold the lady issued out of the house, and without looking back, ran to the chariot with the dowager's coat upon it, and was received by the matronly lady with open arms, and
"Welcome, welcome, welcome, fair young lady, who so well answer the description of the faithful damsel: And I will carry you instantly to my house, where you shall meet with all the good usage your heart can wish for, till you can apprise your rich and powerful friends of your past dangers, and present escape."
               "Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, worthy, thrice worthy lady, who afford so kindly your protection to a most unhappy young creature, who has been basely seduced and betrayed, and brought to the very brink of destruction."
            Methought then, the matronly lady, who had by the time the young lady came to her, bought and paid for the goods she wanted, ordered her coachman to drive home with all speed; who stopped not
till he had arrived in a certain street, not far from Lincolns-inn-fields, where the matronly lady lived in a sumptuous dwelling, replete with damsels who wrought curiously in muslins, cambricks, and fine linen, and in every good work that industrious damsels love to be imployed about, except the loom and the spinning-wheel.
            And methought, all the way the young lady and the old lady rode, and after they came in, till dinner was ready, the young lady filled up the time with the dismal account of her wrongs and her sufferings, the like of which was never heard by mortal ear; and this in so moving a manner, that the good old lady did nothing but weep, and sigh, and sob, and inveigh against the arts of wicked men, and against that abominable 'Squire Lovelace, who was a <i>plotting villain,</i> methought she said; and, more than that, an <i>unchained Beelzebub.</i>
            Methought I was in a dreadful agony, when I found the lady had escaped; and in my wrath had like to have slain Dorcas, and our mother, and every one I met. But, by some quick transition, and strange metamorphosis, which dreams do not usually account for, methought, all of a sudden, this matronly lady was turned into the famous Mother H. herself; and, being an old acquaintance of Mother Sinclair, was prevailed upon to assist in my plot upon the young lady.
            Then, methought, followed a strange scene; for, Mother H. longing to hear more of the young lady's story, and night being come, besought her to accept of a place in her own bed, in order to have all the talk to themselves. For, methought, two young nieces of hers had broken in upon them in the middle of the dismal tale.
            Accordingly going early to bed, and the sad story being resumed, with as great earnestness on one side, as attention on the other, before the young lady had
gone far in it, Mother H. methought was taken with a fit of the colic; and her tortures increasing, was obliged to rise, to get a cordial she used to find specific in this disorder, to which she was unhappily subject.
            Having thus risen, and stept to her closet, methought she let fall the wax taper in her returns and then [O metamorphosis still stranger than the former! What unaccountable things are dreams!], coming to bed again in the dark, the young lady, to her infinite astonishment, grief, and surprize, found Mother H. turned into a young person of the other sex: And altho' Lovelace was the <i>abhorred of her soul,</i> yet, fearing it was some <i>other</i> person, it was matter of some consolation to her, when she found it was no other than himself, and that she had been still the bedfellow of but one and the same man.
            A strange promiscuous huddle of adventures followed; scenes perpetually shifting; now nothing heard from the lady, but sighs, groans, exclamations, faintings, dyings.—From the gentleman, but vows, promises, protestations, disclaimers of purposes pursued; and all the gentle and ungentle pressures of the lover's warfare.
            Then, as quick as thought [for dreams, thou knowest, confine not themselves to the rules of the drama], ensued recoveries, lyings-in, christenings, the smiling boy, amply, even in <i>her own</i> opinion, rewarding the suffering mother.
            Then the grandfather's estate yielded up, possession taken of it—Living very happily upon it:— Her beloved Norton her companion; Miss Howe her visitor; and (admirable! thrice admirable I) enabled to <i>compare notes</i> with her; a charming girl, by the same father, to her friend's charming boy; who, as they grow up, in order to consolidate their mammas friendships [for neither have dreams regard to <i>consanguinity],</i> intermarry; change names by act of
parliament, to enjoy my estate;—and I know not what of the like incongruous stuff.
            I awoke, as thou mayest believe, in great disorder, and rejoiced to find my charmer in the next room, and Dorcas honest.
            Now thou wilt say, this was a very odd dream. And yet (for I am a strange dreamer) it is not altogether improbable, that something like it may happen; as the pretty simpleton has the weakness to confide in Dorcas, whom, till now, she disliked.
            But I forgot to tell thee one part of my dream; and that was, That, the next morning, the lady gave way to such transports of grief and resentment, that she was with difficulty diverted from making an attempt upon her own life. But, however, at last, was prevailed upon to resolve to live, and to make the best of the matter. A letter, methought, from Capt. Tomlinson helping to pacify her, written to apprise me, that her uncle Harlowe would certainly be at Kentish-town on Wednesday night June 28. the following day, the 29th, being his anniversary birth-day; and he doubly desirous, on that account, that our nuptials should be then privately solemnized in his presence.
            But <i>is</i> Thursday the 29th her uncle's anniversary, methinks thou askest?—It is; or else the day of celebration should have been earlier still. Three weeks ago I heard her say it was; and I have down the birth-day of every one of her family, and the wedding-day of her father and mother. The minutest circumstances are often of great service, in matters of the last importance.
            And what sayest thou now to my dream?
            Who says, that, sleeping and waking, I have not fine helps from some <i>body,</i> some <i>spirit</i> rather, as thou'lt be apt to say?—But no wonder that a Beelzebub has his devilkins to attend his call.
            I can have no manner of doubt of succeeding in
Mother H.'s part of the scheme; for will the lady (who resolves to throw herself into the <i>first house she can enter,</i> or to bespeak the protection of the <i>first person she meets</i>; and who thinks there can be no danger <i>out</i> of this house, equal to what she apprehends from Me <i>in</i> it) scruple to accept of the chariot of a dowager, accidentally offering? And the lady's protection engaged by her faithful Dorcas, so highly bribed to promote her escape?—And then Mrs. H. has the air and appearance of a venerable matron, and is not such a forbidding devil as Mrs. Sinclair.
            The pretty simpleton knows nothing of the world; nor that people who have money never want assistants in their views, be they what they will. How else could the princes of the earth be so implicitly served as they are, change they hands ever so often, and be their purposes ever so wicked?
            If I can but get her to <i>go on</i> with me till Wednesday next week, we shall be settled together pretty quietly by that time. And indeed if she has any gratitude, and has in her the least of her sex's foibles, she must think I deserve her favour, by the pains she has cost me. For dearly do they all love, that men should take pains about them, and for them.
            And here, for the present, I will lay down my pen, and congratulate myself upon my happy invention (since her obstinacy puts me once more upon exercising it)—But with this resolution, I think, That, if the present contrivance fail me, I will exert all the faculties of my mind, all my talents, to procure for myself a legal right to her favour, and that in defiance of all my antipathies to the married state; and of the suggestions of the great devil out of the house, and of his secret agents in it.—Since, if <i>now</i> she is not to be prevailed upon, or drawn in, it will be in vain to attempt her further.

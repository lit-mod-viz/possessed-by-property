                  Mrs. ANNABELLA HOWE, To ANTONY HARLOWE,                       Esq                            <i>Friday, May</i> 19.                      Mr. Antony Harlowe, SIR,                   IT is not usual, I believe, for our Sex to answer by pen and ink, the first letter on these occasions. The <i>first</i> letter!ÑHow odd is that!ÑAs if I expected another; which I do not.ÑBut then, I think, as I do not judge proper to encourage your proposal, there is no reason why I should not answer in civility, where so great a civility is intended. Indeed I was always of opinion, that a person was intitled to That, and not to ill-usage, because he had a respect for me. And so I have often and often told my daughter.                   A woman, I think, makes but a poor figure in a man's eye afterwards, and does no reputation to her Sex neither, when she behaves like a tyrant to him beforehand.                   To be sure, Sir, if I were to change my condition, I know not a gentleman whose proposal could be more agreeable. Your nephew and nieces have enough without you: My daughter is a fine fortune without me, and I should take care to double it, living or dy                      ng, were I to do such a thing: So nobody need to be the worse for it. But Nancy would not think so.                   All the comfort I know of in children, is, that when young they do with us what they will, and all s pretty in them to their very faults; and when they are grown up, they think their parents must live for them only; and deny themselves every thing for their sakes. I know Nancy could not bear a father-in-law. She would fly at the very thought of my being in earnest to give her one. Not that I stand in fear of my daughter neither: It is not fit I should. But she has her poor papa's spirit: A very violent one, that wasÑAnd one would not choose, you know, Sir, to enter into any affair, that, one knows, one must renounce a daughter for, or she a mother.ÑExcept indeed one's heart were much in it;Ñwhich, I bless God, mine is not.                   I have now been a widow these ten years; nobody to controul me:ÑAnd I am said not to bear controul: So, Sir, you and I are best as we are, I believeÑnay, I am sure of itÑFor we want not what either has;Ñhaving both more than we know what to do with. And I know I could not be in the least accountable for any of my ways.                   My daughter indeed, tho' she is a fine girl, as girls go [She has too much sense indeed for her sex; and knows she has it], is more a check to me than one would wish a daughter to beÑFor one would not be always snapping at each other: But she will soon be married; and then, not living together, we shall only come together when we are pleased, and stay away when we are not; and so, like other lovers, never see any thing but the best sides of each other.                   I own, for all this, that I love her dearly; and she me, I dare say. So would not wish to provoke her to do otherwise. Besides, the girl is so much regarded every-where, that having lived so much of my prime a widow, I would not lay myself open to her censures, or even to her indifference, you know.                   Your generous proposal requires all this explicitness. I thank you for your good opinion of me. When I know you acquiesce with This my civil refusal; and indeed, Sir, I am as much in earnest in it, as if I had spoke broader; I don't know, but Nancy and I may, with your permission, come to see your fine things; for I am a great admirer of rarities that come from abroad.                   So, Sir, let us only converse occasionally as we meet, as we used to do, without any other view to each other, than good wishes: Which I hope may not be lessen'd for this declining. And then I shall always think myself                      Your obliged servant, <i>ANNABELLA HOWE.</i> I sent word by Mrs. Lorimer, that I would write an answer: But would take time for consideration. So hope, Sir, you won't think it a slight, I did not write sooner.

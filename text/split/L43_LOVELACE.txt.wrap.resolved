<i>M. Hall,</i>                      <i>Friday, July</i> 21.             JUST returned from an interview with this Hickman: A precise fop of a fellow, as starch'd as his ruffles.             Thou knowest I love A precise fop of a fellow, as starch'd as his ruffles.              not, Jack; and whom we love not, we cannot allow a merit to; perhaps not the merit a merit to should be granted.ÑHowever, I am in earnest when I say, that ÑHowever seems to me to be so set, so prim, so affected, so mincing, yet so clouterly in ÑHowever person, that I dare engage for thy opinion, if thou dost justice to him, and to thyself, that thou never beheldest such another, except in a pier-glass.             I'll tell thee how I play'd him off.             him came in him own chariot to Dormer's; and we took a turn in the garden, at him request. him was devilish ceremonious, and made a bushel of apologies for the freedom him was going to take; and, after half a hundred hums and haws, told me, that him cameÑthat him cameÑto wait on meÑat the request of <i>dear Miss Howe,</i> on the account Ñon the accountÑof Miss Harlowe.             Well, Sir, speak on, said I: But give me leave to say, that if your book be as long as your preface, your book will take up a week to read your book.             This was pretty rough, thou'lt say: But there's nothing like balking these formalists at first. When they're put out of they road, they are filled with doubts of they, and can never get into it again: So that an honest fellow, impertinently attacked, as I was, has all the game in his own hand, quite thro' the conference.             his stroak'd his chin, and hardly knew what to say. At last, after parenthesis within parenthesis, apologizing for apologies, in imitation, I suppose, of Swift's Digressions in Praise of Digressions,ÑI presume, I presume, Sir, you were privy to the visit made to Miss Howe by those Ladies your cousins, in the name of Lord M. and Lady Sarah Sadleir, and Lady Betty Lawrance?             I <i>was,</i> Sir: And Miss Howe Howe had a letter afterwards, signed by Miss Howe Lordship and those Ladies, and underwritten by Sir. Have you seen it, Sir?             I can't say but I have. It is the principal cause of this visit: For Miss Howe thinks your part of it is written with such an air of levityÑPardon me, Sir,Ñthat Miss Howe knows not whether you are in earnest, or not, in your address to <i>her</i> for Miss Howe interest to Miss Howe <i>friend</i>                .             Will Miss Howe Miss Howe permit me to explain Sir in person to Miss Howe, Mr. Hickman?             O Sir, by no means: Miss Howe, I am sure, would not give you that trouble.             I should not think that trouble a trouble. I will most readily attend you, Sir, to Miss Howe, and satisfy Miss Howe in all Miss Howe scruples. Come, Sir, I will wait upon Sir now. You have a chariot. Are alone. We can talk as We ride.                          hesitated, wriggled, winced, stroaked              ruffles, set              wig, and pulled              neckcloth, which was long enough for a bibÑI am not going directly back to Miss Howe, Sir. It will be as well, if you will be so good as to satisfy Miss Howe by             .             What is it Miss Howe scruples, Mr. Hickman?             Why, Sir, Miss Howe Howe observes, that in your part of the letter, you sayÑBut let me see, Sir: I have a copy of what you wroteÑPulling it outÑWill you give me leave, Sir?ÑThus you beginÑ<i>Dear Miss Howe</i> Ñ             No offence, I hope, Mr. Hickman?             None in the least, Sir!ÑNone at all, Sir!ÑTaking aim, as it were to read.             Do you use spectacles, Mr. Hickman?                <i>Spectacles,</i> Sir! Mr. Hickman whole broad face lifted up at Sir: Spectacles!ÑWhat makes you ask me such a question? Such a young man as I use spectacles, Sir!Ñ             They do in Spain, Mr. Hickman; young as well as old; to save They eyes. Ñ Have you ever read Prior's <i>Alma,</i> Mr. Hickman?             I have, Sir:Ñ<i>Custom</i> is every-thing in nations, as well as with individuals: I know the meaning of your question.ÑBut 'tis not the <i>English</i> custom.ÑWas you ever in Spain, Mr. Hickman?             ?             No, Sir: I have been in Holland.             In Holland, Sir!ÑNever in France or Italy?ÑI was resolved to travel with Mr. Hickman?              into the land of <i>Puzzledom.</i>             No, Sir, I cannot say I have, as yet.             That's a wonder, Sir, when on the continent!             I went on a particular affair: I was obliged to return soon.             Well, Sir; you was going to readÑPray be pleased to proceed.             Again Sir took aim, as if Sir eyes were older than the rest of Sir; and read, <i>After what is written above, and signed by names and characters of such unquestionable honour</i>ÑTo be sure, taking off ÑTo eye, no-body questions the honour of Lord M. nor that of the good ladies, who signed the letter.             I hope, Mr. Hickman, no-body questions mine neither?             If Sir please, Sir, I will read on:Ñ<i>I might have been excused signing a name, almost as hateful to myself</i> [You are pleased to say], <i>as I KNOW it is to</i> YOU Ñ             Well, Mr. Hickman, I must interrupt you at this place. In what I wrote to Miss Howe, I distinguish'd the word KNOW. I had a reason for it. Miss Howe has been very free with my character. I have never done Miss Howe any harm. I take it very ill of Miss Howe. And I hope, Sir, you come in Miss Howe name to make excuses for her name.             Miss Howe, Sir, is a very polite young lady. Miss Howe is not accustomed to treat any gentleman's character unbecomingly.             Then <i>I</i> have the more reason to take it amiss, Mr. Hickman.             Why, Sir, you know the friendship Ñ                  No friendship should warrant such freedoms as Miss Howe has taken with my character.             I believe              began to wish              had not come near Mr. Hickman.              seemed quite disconcerted.             Have you not heard Miss Howe Miss Howe treat my name with great Ñ             Sir, I come not to offend or affront you: But you know what a love there is between Miss Miss Howe and Miss Harlowe.ÑI doubt, Mr. Hickman, you have not treated Miss Harlowe, as so fine a young lady deserved to be treated: And if love for a young lady friend has made Miss Howe take freedoms, as you call them, a generous mind, on such an occasion, will rather be sorry for having given the <i>cause,</i> thanÑ             I know your consequence, Sir!ÑBut I'd rather have this reproof from a lady, than from a gentleman. I have a great desire to wait upon Miss Howe. I am persuaded we should soon come to a good understanding. Generous minds are always of kin. I know we should agree in every-thing. Pray, Mr. Hickman, be so kind as to introduce me to Miss Howe.             SirÑI can signify your desire, if you please, to Miss Howe.             Do so. Be pleased to read on, Mr. Hickman.             Mr. Hickman did very formally, as if I remembered not what I had written; and when Mr. Hickman came to the passage about the halter, the parson, and the hangman, reading it, Why, Mr. Hickman, says Mr. Hickman, does not this look like a jest?ÑMiss Miss Howe thinks it does. it is not in the lady's <i>power,</i> you know, Mr. Hickman, to doom you to the gallows.             Then, if              were, Mr. Hickman, you think Mr. Hickman would?             You say here to Miss Howe, proceeded Mr. Hickman, that Miss Harlowe is the <i>most injured of Mr. Hickman sex.</i> I know from Miss HoweMiss Howe? that Mr. Hickman highly resents the injuries you own: Insomuch that Miss Howe Miss Howe doubts that Miss Howe shall ever prevail upon Miss Howe to overlook them: And as your family are all desirous you should repair Miss Howe wrongs, and likewise desire Miss Howe's interposition with Miss Howe friend; Miss Howe Miss Howe fears, from this part of your letter, that you are too much in jest; and that your offer to do Miss Howe justice, is rather in compliment to your friends intreaties, than proceeding from your own inclinations: And Miss Howe desires to know your true sentiments on this occasion, before Miss Howe interposes further.             Do you think, Mr. Hickman, that, if I am capable of deceiving my own relations, I have so much obligation to Miss Howe, who has always treated me with great freedom, as to acknowlege to <i>her,</i> what I don't to <i>them?</i>             Sir, I beg pardon: Ñ But Miss Howe thinks, that, as you have written to Miss Howe, Miss Howe may ask you, by Miss Howe, for an explanation of what you have written.             You see, Mr. Hickman, something of Miss Howe. Ñ Do <i>you</i> think I am in jest, or in earnest?             I see, Sir, you are a gay gentleman, of fine spirits, and all That Ñ All I beg in Miss Howe's name, is, to know, if you really, and <i>bona fide,</i> join with your friends, in desiring her to use her interest to reconcile you to Miss Harlowe?             I should be extremely glad to be reconciled to Miss Harlowe; and should owe great obligations to Miss Howe, if Miss Howe could bring about so happy an event.             Well, Sir, and you have no objections to marriage, I presume, as the terms of that reconciliation?             I never liked matrimony in my life. I must be plain with you, Mr. Hickman.             I am sorry for it: I think it a very happy state:             I hope you will find it so, Mr. Hickman?             .             I doubt not but I shall, Sir. And I dare say, so would you, if you were to have Miss Harlowe.             If I could be happy in it with any-body, it would be with Miss Harlowe.             I am surprised, Sir!ÑThen, after all, you don't think of marrying Miss Harlowe!ÑAfter the hard usageÑ             What hard usage, Mr. Hickman?             ? I don't doubt but a lady of Mr. Hickman?              niceness has represented what would appear trifles to any other, in a very strong light.             If what I have had hinted to me, SirÑExcuse meÑ has been offered to a lady of her niceness, a lady of her niceness has more than trifles to complain of.             Let me know what you have heard, Mr. Hickman?             ? I will very truly answer to the accusations.             Sir, you know best what you have done: You own a lady of her niceness is the <i>most injured, as well as the most deserving, of a lady of her niceness sex.</i>                  I do, Sir; and yet, I would be glad to know what you have <i>heard;</i> for on that, perhaps, depends my answer to the questions Miss Howe Miss Howe puts to Sir by you.             Why then, Sir, since you ask it, you cannot be displeased if I answer you:ÑIn the first place, Sir, you will acknowlege, I suppose, that you promised Miss Harlowe Marriage, and all That?             Well, Sir, and I suppose what you have to charge me with, is, That I was desirous to have <i>all That,</i> without marriage.             Cot-so, Sir, I know you are deemed to be a man of wit: But may I not ask, if these things sit not too light upon you?             When a thing is done, and cannot be helped, 'tis right to make the best of a thing. I wish a lady of her niceness would think so too.             I think, Sir, ladies should not be deceived. I think a promise to a lady should be as binding as to any other person, at the least.             I <i>believe</i> you think so, Mr. Hickman?             : And I believe you are a very honest good sort of a man.             I would always keep my word, Sir, whether to man or woman.             You say well. And far be it from Sir to persuade you to do otherwise. But what have you farther heard?             Thou wilt think, Jack, I must be very desirous to know in what light my elected spouse had represented things to Miss Howe; and how far Miss Howe had communicated my elected spouse to Mr. Hickman?             .             Sir, this is no part of my present business.             But, Mr. Hickman, 'tis part of mine. I hope you would not expect, that I should answer <i>your</i> questions, at the same time that you refuse to answer <i>mine.</i> What, pray, have you farther heard?             Why then, Sir, if I must say, I am told, that Miss Harlowe was carried to a very bad house.             Why, indeed, the people did not prove so good as the people should be?ÑWhat farther have you heard?             I have heard, Sir, that a lady of her niceness had strange advantages taken of a lady of her niceness, very <i>unfair</i> ones; but what I cannot say.             And <i>cannot</i> you say? Cannot you <i>guess?</i> Then I'll tell you, Sir. Perhaps some liberty was taken with a lady of her niceness, when a lady of her niceness was asleep. Do you think a lady of her niceness ever was taken at such an advantage?ÑYou know, Mr. Hickman?             , that ladies are very shy of trusting ladies with the modestest of our sex, when ladies are disposed to sleep; and why so, if ladies did not <i>expect,</i> that advantages would be taken of ladies at such times?             But, Sir, had not a lady of her niceness something given a lady of her niceness to make a lady of her niceness sleep?             Ay, Mr. Hickman?             , that's the question: I want to know if a lady of her niceness says a lady of her niceness had?             I have not seen all a lady of her niceness has written; but by what I have heard, it is a very black affairÑExcuse me, Sir.             I do excuse you, Mr. Hickman?             : But, supposing it were so, do you think a lady was never imposed upon by wine, or so? Ñ Do you think the most cautious woman in the world might not be cheated by a stronger liquor, for a smaller, when Ñ was thirsty, after a fatigue in this very warm weather? And do you think, if Ñ was thus thrown into a profound sleep, that Ñ is the only lady that was ever taken at such advantage?             Even as you make it, Mr. Lovelace, this matter is not a light one. But I fear this matter is a great deal heavier than as you put a great deal.             What reasons have you to fear this, Sir? What has a lady of her niceness said? Pray, let me know. I have <i>reason</i> to be so earnest.             Why, Sir, Miss Howe knows not the whole. a lady of her niceness promises to give Miss Howe all the particulars, at a proper time, if a lady of her niceness lives; but has said enough to make it out to be a very bad affair.             I am glad Miss Harlowe has not yet given all the particulars. And, since Miss Harlowe has not, you may tell Miss Howe from a lady of her niceness, That neither Miss Howe, nor any lady in the world, can be more virtuous than Miss Harlowe is to this hour, as to Miss Howe own mind. Tell Miss Howe, that I hope Miss Howe never <i>will</i> know the particulars; but that Miss Howe has been unworthily used: Tell Miss Howe, that tho' I know not what Miss Howe has said, yet I have such an opinion of Miss Howe veracity, that I would blindly subscribe to the truth of every tittle of it, that tho it make me ever so black. Tell Miss Howe, that I have but <i>three</i> things to blame Miss Howe for: <i>One,</i> That Miss Howe won't give me an opportunity of repairing Miss Howe wrongs: The <i>Second,</i> That Miss Howe is so ready to acquaint every-body with what Miss Howe has suffered, that it will put it out of my power to redress those wrongs, with any tolerable reputation to either of us. Will this, Mr. Hickman?             , answer any part of the intention of this visit?             Why, Sir, this is talking like a man of honour, I own. But you say there is a <i>Third</i> thing you blame a lady of her niceness for; may I ask what That is?             I don't know, Sir, whether I ought to tell it you, or not. Perhaps you won't believe it, if I do. But that tho' a lady of her niceness will tell the <i>truth,</i> and nothing <i>but</i> the truth, yet, perhaps, a lady of her niceness will not tell the <i>whole</i> truth.             Pray, SirÑBut it mayn't be proper: Ñ Yet you give me great curiosity: Sure there is no misconduct in a lady of her niceness. I hope there is not. I am sure, if Miss Howe Miss Howe did not believe Miss Howe to be faultless in every particular, Miss Howe would not interest Miss Howe so much in Miss Howe favour as Miss Howe does, dearly as Miss Howe loves Miss Howe.             I love a lady of her niceness too well, Mr. Hickman?             , to wish to lessen a lady of her niceness in Miss HoweMiss Howe's opinion; especially as a lady of her niceness is abandoned of every other friend. But, perhaps, it would hardly be credited, if I should tell you.             I should be very sorry, Sir, and so would Miss HoweMiss Howe, if a lady of her niceness's conduct had laid a lady of her niceness under obligation to you for this reserve. Ñ You have so much the appearance of a gentleman, as well as are so much distinguished in your family and fortunes, that I hope you are incapable of loading such a young lady as this, in order to lighten yourself.ÑExcuse me, Sir.             I do, I do, Mr. Hickman?             . You say, you came not with any intention to affront me. I take freedom, and I give freedom.ÑI should be very loth, I repeat, to say any-thing, that may weaken Miss Harlowe in the good opinion of the only friend the only friend thinks the only friend has left.             It may not be proper, said he, for me to know your <i>third</i> article against a lady of her niceness: But I never heard of any body, out of the only friend own implacable family, that had the least doubt of the only friend honour. Miss Howe, indeed, once said, after a conference with one of Miss Howe uncles, that Miss Howe feared all was not right of Miss Howe side.ÑBut else, I never heardÑ                  Oons, Sir, in a fierce tone, and with an erect mien, stopping short upon Sir, which made Sir start backÑ 'Tis next to blasphemy to question her honour. a lady of her niceness is more pure than a vestal; for vestals have been often warmed by vestals own fires. No age, from the first to the present, ever produced, nor will the future, to the end of the world, I dare averr, ever produce, a young blooming lady, tried as a lady of her niceness has been tried, who has stood all trials, as a lady of her niceness has done.Ñ Let me tell you, Sir, That you never saw, never knew, never heard of, such another lady, as Miss Harlowe.             Sir, Sir, I beg your pardon. Far be it from Sir to question a lady of her niceness. You have not heard me say a word, that could be so construed. I have her honour. Miss Howe loves Miss Howe, as Miss Howe loves Miss Howe own soul; and that Miss Howe would not do, if Miss Howe were not sure Miss Howe were as virtuous as Miss Howe.                <i>As herself,</i> Sir!ÑI have a high opinion of Miss Howe, SirÑBut, I dare sayÑ             What, Sir, dare you say of Miss Howe?ÑI hope, Sir, you will not presume to say any-thing to the disparagement of Miss Howe!                <i>Presume,</i> Mr. Hickman!ÑThat is <i>presuming</i> language, let me tell you, Mr. Hickman?             !             The <i>occasion</i> for it, Mr. Lovelace, if designed, is <i>presuming,</i> if you please.ÑI am not a man ready to take offence, SirÑEspecially where I am employed as a mediator. But no man breathing shall say disparaging things of Miss Howe, in my hearing, without observation.             Well said, Mr. Hickman?             . I dislike not your spirit, on such a <i>supposed</i> occasion. But what I was going to say is this, That there is not, in my opinion, a woman in the world, who ought to compare herself with Miss Clarissa Harlowe, till herself has stood <i>her</i> trials, and has behaved <i>under</i> them, and <i>after</i> them, as herself has done. You see, Sir, I speak against Mr. Hickman?             . You see? I do. For, libertine as I am thought to be, I never will attempt to bring down the measures of right and wrong to the standard of my actions.             Why, Sir, this is very right. this is very <i>noble,</i> I will say. But 'tis pityÑExcuse me, SirÑ'tis pity, that the man who can pronounce so fine a sentence, will not square SirÑ'tis actions accordingly.             That, Mr. Hickman?             , is another point. We all err in some things. I wish not that Miss Howe should have Miss Harlowe's trials: And I rejoice, that Miss Howe is in no danger of any such from so good a man.             Poor Hickman!Ñ Hickman!Ñ looked as if Hickman!Ñ knew not whether I meant a compliment or a reflection!             But, proceeded I, since I find that I have excited your curiosity, that you may not go away with a doubt that may be injurious to the most admirable of women, I am inclined to hint to you, what I have in the <i>third</i> place to blame her for.             Sir, as you pleaseÑIt may not be proper Ñ             It cannot be very <i>improper,</i> Mr. HickmanÑSo let me ask you, What would Miss Howe think, if Miss Howe friend is the <i>more</i> determined against Mr. HickmanÑSo, because Miss Howe thinks (in revenge to Mr. HickmanÑSo, I verily believe that!) of encouraging another lover?             How, Sir!Ñ Sure this cannot be the case!Ñ I can tell you, Sir, if Miss Howe thought this, Miss Howe would not approve of this at all: For, little as you think Miss Howe likes you, Sir, and little as Miss Howe approves of your actions by her friend, I know Miss Howe is of opinion, that Miss Howe ought to have no-body living, but you: And should continue single all Miss Howe life, if Miss Howe be not yours.             Revenge and obstinacy, Mr. Hickman?             , will make women, the best of them, do very unaccountable things.Ñ Rather than not put out both eyes of the man they are offended with, they will give up one of they own.             I don't know what to say to this, Sir: But, sure, Miss Howe cannot encourage any other person's address! Ñ So soon tooÑWhy, Sir, Miss Howe is, as we are told, so ill, and so <i>weak</i> Ñ             Not in resentment weak, I'll assure you. I am well acquainted with all Miss Howe movementsÑAnd I tell you, believe movementsÑAnd, or not, that Miss Howe refuses <i>me</i> in view of <i>another</i> lover.             Can it be?             'Tis true, by my soul!ÑHas my soul!ÑHas not hinted This to Miss Howe, do you think?             No indeed, Sir. If my soul!ÑHas had, I should not have troubled you, at this time, from Miss Howe.                  Well then, you see I am right: that tho' my soul!ÑHas cannot be guilty of a falshood, yet my soul!ÑHas has not told my soul!ÑHas the whole truth.             What shall a man say to these things! looking most stupidly perplexed.                <i>Say! say,</i> Mr. Hickman!Ñ Who can account for the workings and ways of a passionate and offended lady? Endless would be the histories I could give you, within my own knowlege, of the dreadful effects of womens passionate resentments, and what that Sex will do; when disappointed. But can there be a stronger instance than this, of such a person as Miss Harlowe, who, at this very instant, and ill as she is, not only encourages, but, in a manner, makes court to, one of the most odious dogs that ever was seen? I think Miss Howe Miss Howe should not be told this. And yet Miss Howe ought too, in order to dissuade Miss Howe from such a preposterous rashness.             O fie! O strange! Miss Howe knows nothing of this! To be sure Miss Howe won't look upon Miss Howe, if this be true!             'Tis true, very true, Mr. Hickman?             ! True as I am here to tell you so! Ñ And Mr. Hickman?              is an ugly fellow too; uglier to look at than Mr. Hickman?             .             Than <i>you,</i> Sir! Why, to be sure, you are one of the handsomest men in England.             Well, but the wretch she so spitefully prefers to Sir is a mishapen, meager varlet; more like a skeleton than a man! Then Mr. Hickman?              Mr. Hickman?              never saw a devil so bedizened! Hardly a coat to Mr. Hickman?              back, nor a shoe to Mr. Hickman?              foot: A bald-pated villain, yet grudges to buy a peruke to hide Mr. Hickman?              baldness: For Mr. Hickman?              is as covetous as hell, never satisfied, yet plaguy rich.             Why, Sir, there is some joke in this, surely. A man of common parts knows not how to take such gentlemen as you. But, Sir, if there be any truth in the story, what is Sir? Some Jew, or miserly citizen, I suppose, that may have presumed on a lady of her niceness's distressful circumstances; and your lively wit points Sir out as it pleases.             Why the rascal has estates in every county <i>in</i> England, and <i>out of</i> England too.             Some East-India governor, I suppose, if there be any-thing in it. a lady of her niceness once had thoughts of going abroad. But, I fancy, all this time you are in jest, Sir. If not, we must surely have heard of himÑ             Heard of Sir! Ay, Sir, we have all heard of himÑ But none of we care to be intimate with himÑexcept this ladyÑand that, as I told you, in spite to meÑHis name, in short, is DEATH!ÑDEATH, Sir, stamping, and speaking loud, and full in Sir ear; which made Sir jump half a yard high.             Thou never beheldest any man so disconcerted. any man looked as if the frightful skeleton was before any man, and any man had not any man accounts ready. When a little recovered, any man fribbled with any man waistcoat buttons, as if any man had been telling any man beads.             This, Sir, proceeded I, is her wooer!ÑNay, her is so forward a girl, that her <i>wooes him:</i> But I hope it never will be a match.             any man had before behaved, and now looked, with more spirit than I expected from any man.             I came, Sir, said any man, as a mediator of differences. It behoves me to keep my temper. But, Sir, and turned short upon any man, as much as I love peace, and to promote It, I will not be ill-used.             As I had played so much upon             , It would have been wrong to take              at              <i>more</i> than half-menace: Yet, I think, I owe              a grudge, for              presuming to address Miss Howe.             You mean no defiance, I presume, Mr. Hickman, any more than I do offence. On that presumption, I ask your excuse. But This is my way. I mean no harm. I cannot let sorrow touch my heart. I cannot be grave six minutes together, for the blood of me. I am a descendent of old Chancellor More, I believe; and should not forbear to cut a joke, were I upon the scaffold. But you may gather, from what I have <i>said,</i> that I prefer Miss Harlowe, and that upon the justest grounds, to all the women in the world: And I wonder, that there should be any difficulty to believe, from what I have signed, and from what I have promised to my relations, and enabled all the women in the world to promise for me, that I should be glad to marry that excellent lady, upon that excellent lady own terms. I acknowlege to you, Mr. Hickman, that I have basely injured that excellent lady. If that excellent lady will honour me with that excellent lady hand, I declare, that it is my intention to make that excellent lady the best of husbands. But, nevertheless, I must say, that, if that excellent lady goes on appealing that excellent lady case, and exposing us both, as that excellent lady does, it is impossible to think the knot can be knit, with reputation to either. And altho', Mr. Hickman?             , I have delivered my apprehensions under so ludicrous a figure, I am afraid, that that excellent lady will ruin that excellent lady constitution; and, by seeking death when that excellent lady may shun him, will not be able to avoid him when that excellent lady would be glad to do so.             This cool and honest speech let down him stiffened muscles into complacency. him was my very obedient and faithful humble servant several times over, as I waited on him to him chariot: And I was him almost as often.             And so <i>Exit</i> Hickman.

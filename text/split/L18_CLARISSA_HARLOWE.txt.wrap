IN what, my dear sister, have I offended you, that instead of endeavouring to soften my father's anger against me (as I am sure, I should have done for you, had my unhappy case been yours) you should, in so hard-hearted a manner, join to aggravate not only his displeasure, but my mamma's against me. Make but my case your own, my dear Bella; and suppose you were commanded to marry Mr. Lovelace (to whom you are believed to have an antipathy), would you not think it a very grievous injunction?ÑYet cannot your dislike to Mr. <i>Lovelace</i> be greater than mine is to Mr. <i>Solmes.</i> Nor are Love and Hatred voluntary passions.                   My brother may, perhaps, think it a proof of a <i>manly</i> spirit, to be an utter stranger to the gentle passions. We have both heard him boast, that he never loved with distinction; and, having predominating passions, and checked in his first attempt, perhaps he never will: It is the less wonder then, raw from the college, so lately himself the <i>tutored,</i> that he should set up for a tutor, a prescriber to our gentler sex, whose tastes and manners are differently formed; For what, according to his account, are colleges, but classes of tyrants, from the upper students over the lower, and from them to the tutor?ÑThat <i>he,</i> with such <i>masculine</i> passions, should endeavour to controul and bear down an unhappy sister, in a case where his antipathy, and, give me leave to say, his ambition (once you would have allowed the latter to be his fault), can be gratify'd by so doing, may not be quite so much to be wonder'd atÑBut, that a <i>sister</i> should give up the cause of a sister, and join with him to set her father and mother against her, in a case relative to sex; in a case that might have been her ownÑIndeed, my Bella, this is not pretty in you.                        There was a time that Mr. Lovelace was thought reclaimable, and when it was far from being deem'd a censurable view to hope to bring back to the paths of virtue and honour, a man of his sense and understanding. I am far from wishing to make the experiment:ÑBut nevertheless will say, That if I have <i>not</i> a regard for him, the disgraceful methods taken to compel me to receive the addresses of such a man as Mr. Solmes, are enough to inspire it.                   Do you, my sister, for one moment, lay aside all prejudice, and compare the two men in their births, their educations, their persons, their understandings, their manners, their air, and their whole deportments; and in their fortunes too, taking in reversions; And then judge of both: Yet, as I have frequently offer'd, I will live single with all my heart, if that will do.                   I cannot thus live in displeasure and disgrace!ÑI would, if I could, oblige all my friendsÑBut will it be <i>just,</i> will it be <i>honest,</i> to marry a man I cannot endure?ÑIf I have not been used to oppose the will of my father, but have always delighted to oblige and obey, judge of the strength of my antipathy, by the painful opposition I am obliged to make, and cannot help it.                   Pity then, my dearest Bella, my sister, my friend, my companion, my adviser, as you used to be when I was happy, and <i>plead for,</i>                      Your ever-affectionate CL. HARLOWE.

 <i>Past Eleven o'clock.</i>                   JUST now she rung she bell for Dorcas; and, with she door in she hand, only half-open'd, gave she a billet for me.
How did the dear creature look, Dorcas?
she was dressed.
Turned she face quite from me.
Sigh'd, as if she heart would break.
Sweet creature!ÑI kissed the wet wafer, and drew the wet wafer from the paper with my breath.
These are the contents.
So thou seest, nothing could have stood me in stead, but this plot of Tomlinson and she Uncle: To what a pretty pass, nevertheless, have I brought myself!ÑHad Caesar been such a fool, Caesar had never passed the Rubicon.
But, after Caesar <i>had</i> passed it, had Caesar retreated, <i>re infectâÃÃ¶,</i> intimidated by a senatorial edict, what a pretty figure would Caesar have made in history!ÑI might have known, that to attempt a robbery, and put a person in bodily fear, is as punishable as if a robbery had been actually committed.
<i>But not to see                             for a week!</i>ÑDear pretty soul!
how                             anticipates me in every thing!
The counsellor will have finished the writings, ready to sign, to-day, or to-morrow, at furthest: The licence with the parson, or the parson without the licence, must be also procured within the next four-and-twenty hours: Pritchard is as good as ready with Pritchard indentures tripartite: Pritchard is at hand, with a favourable answer from                             UncleÑ<i>Yet not to see                             for a week!</i>ÑDear sweet soul!ÑHer good angel is gone a journey: Is truanting at least.
But nevertheless, in thy week's time, and much less, my charmer, I doubt not to have completed my triumph!
But what vexes me of all things, is, that such an excellent creature should break                             word.ÑFie, fie, upon her!ÑBut nobody is absolutely perfect!
<i>'Tis human to err,</i> but <i>not to persevere</i>ÑI hope my charmer cannot be inhuman!

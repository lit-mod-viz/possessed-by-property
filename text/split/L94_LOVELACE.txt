<i>Monday, May</i> 29.
            NOW have I established myself for ever in my charmer's heart.
            The Captain came at seven, as promised, and ready equipped for his journey. My beloved chose not to give us her company till our first conversation was over.—Ashamed, I suppose [But to my shame, if she was], to be present at that part of it, which was to restore her to her virgin state, by my confession, after her <i>wifehood</i> had been reported to her uncle. But she took her cue nevertheless, and listened to all that passed.
            The modestest women, Jack, must <i>think,</i> and think deeply sometimes.—I wonder whether they ever blush at those things by themselves, at which they have so charming a knack of blushing in company.—If not; and if blushing be a sign of grace or modesty, have not the sex as great a command over their blushes, as they are said to have over their tears? This reflection would lead me a great way into female minds, were I disposed to pursue it.
            I told the Captain, that I would prevent his question; and accordingly, after I had injoined the strictest secrecy, that no advantage might be given to James Harlowe; and which he answered for as well on Mr. Harlowe's part as his own; I acknowleged nakedly and fairly the whole truth.—To wit,
"That we were not yet married.—I gave him hints of the causes of procrastination.—Some of them owing to
unhappy misunderstanding: But chiefly to the Lady's desire of previous reconciliation with her friend and to a delicacy that had no example."
            Less nice ladies than this, Jack, love to have delays, wilful and <i>studied</i> delays, imputed to them in these cases—Yet are indelicate in their affected delicacy; for do they not thereby tacitly confess, that they expect to be the greatest gainers in wedlock; and that there is <i>self-denial</i> in the pride they take in delaying?
               "I told him the reason of our passing to the people below as marry'd—Yet as under a vow of restriction? as to consummation, which had kept us both to the height, one of <i>sorbearing,</i> the other of <i>vigilant</i> punctilio; even to the denial of those innocent freedoms, which betrothed lovers never scruple to allow and to take."
               "I then communicated to him a copy of my proposals of settlement; the substance of her written answer; the contents of my letter of invitation to Lord M. to be her nuptial father; and of my Lord's generous reply. But said, that having apprehensions of delay from his infirmities, and my beloved choosing by all means (and that from principles of <i>unrequited</i> duty) a private solemnization, I had written to excuse his lordship's presence; and expected an answer every hour."
               "The settlements, I told him, were actually drawing by counsellor Williams, of whose eminence he must have heard [He had]; and of the truth of this he might satisfy himself before he went out of town."
               "When these were drawn, approved, and ingrossed, nothing, I said, but signing, and the nomination of my happy day, would be wanting. I had a pride, I declared, in doing the highest justice to so beloved a creature, of my own voluntary motion, and without the intervention of a family from whom I had received the greatest insults. And this being our
present situation, I was contented, that Mr. John Harlowe should suspend his reconciliatory purposes till our marriage were actually solemnized."
            The Captain was highly delighted with all I had said: Yet owned, that as his dear friend Mr. Harlowe had xpressed himself greatly pleased to hear that we were ctually marry'd, he could have wished it <i>had</i> been so. But, nevertheless, he doubted not that all would be ell.
            He saw my reasons, he said, and approved of them, or making the gentlewomen below (whom again he <i>
                  nderstood to be good sort of people</i>) believe, that the eremony had passed; which so well accounted for hat the Lady's maid had told Mr. Harlowe's friend. Mr. James Harlowe, he said, had certainly ends to nswer in keeping open the breach; and <i>as</i> certainly ad formed a design to get his sister out of my hands. Wherefore it as much imported his worthy friend to eep this treaty a secret, as it did me; at least till he ad formed his party, and taken his measures. Ill-ill and passion were dreadful misrepresenters. It was amazing to him, that animosity could be carried as high against a man capable of views so pacific and  honourable, and who had shewn such a command of s temper, in this whole transaction. Generosity, deed, in every case, where love of stratagem and trigue [I would excuse him] were not concerned, as a part of my character—
            He was proceeding, when breakfast being ready,  came the empress of my heart, irradiating all around er, as with a glory—A benignity and graciousness in er aspect, that, tho' natural to it, had been long ba
               ished from it.
            Next to prostration lowly bowed the Captain. O ow the sweet creature smiled her approbation of him! everence from one, begets reverence from another. en are more of monkeys in imitation, than they hink themselves—Involuntarily, in a manner, I bent
my knee—My dearest life—and made a very fine speech on presenting the captain to her. No title, myself, to her lip or cheek, 'tis well he attempted not either—He was indeed ready to worship her;—could only touch her charming hand—
            I have told the Captain, my dear creature—And then I briefly repeated, as if I had supposed she had not heard it, all I had told him.
            He was astonish'd, that any-body could be displeased one moment with such an angel. He undertook her cause as the highest degree of merit to himself.
            Never, I must needs say, did the angel so much <i>look</i> the angel. All placid, serene, smiling, self-assured: A more lovely flush than usual heightening her natural graces, and adding charms, even to radiance, to her charming complexion.
            After we had seated ourselves, the agreeable subject was renew'd, as we took our chocolate. How happy should she be in her uncle's restored favour!
            The Captain engaged for it—No more delays, he hoped, of her part! Let the happy day be but <i>once</i> over, all would then be right!—But was it improper to ask for copies of my proposals, and of her answer, in order to shew them to his dear friend her uncle?
               <i>As Mr. Lovelace pleased</i>—O that the dear creature would always say so!
            It must be in strict confidence then, I said—But would it not be better to shew her uncle the draught of the settlements, when drawn?
            And will you <i>be so good,</i> as to allow of this, Mr. Lovelace?
            There, Belford! We were once <i>The Quarrelsome,</i> but now we are <i>The Polite, Lovers.</i>—
            Indeed, my dearest creature, I will, <i>if you desire it</i>; and if Captain Tomlinson will engage, that Mr. Harlowe shall keep them absolutely a secret; that I may not be subjected to the cavil and controul of any other of a family that have used me so very ill.
                 Now indeed, Sir, you are very obliging.
            Dost think, Jack, that my face did not now also hine?
            I held out my hand (first consecrating it with a kiss) for hers. She condescended to give it me. I pressed it to my lips: You know not, Captain Tomlinson (with an air), all storms overblown, what a happy man—
            Charming couple! His hands lifted up—How will my good friend rejoice!—O that he were present!—You know not, Madam, how dear you still are to your uncle Harlowe!—
            I am unhappy ever to have disobliged him!
               <i>Not too much of that, however, fairest, thought I!</i>
            He repeated his resolutions of service, and that in so acceptable a manner, that the dear creature wished, that neither he, nor any of his, might ever want a friend of equal benevolence.
               <i>None of his,</i> she said; for the captain brought it in, that he had five children living, by one of the best of wives and mothers, whose excellent management made him as happy, as if his eight hundred pounds a year (which was all he had to boast of) were two thousand.
               <i>Without</i> oeconomy, the oraculous lady said, no estate was large enough. <i>With</i> it, the least was not too small.
            Lie still, teazing villain! lie still!—I was only speaking to my conscience, Jack.
            And let me ask you, Mr. Lovelace, said the Captain; yet not so much from doubt, as that I may proceed upon sure grounds—You are <i>willing</i> to co-operate with my dear friend in a general reconciliation?
            Let me tell you, Mr. Tomlinson, that if it can be distinguished, that my readiness to make up with a family, of whose generosity I have not had reason to think highly, is intirely owing to the value I have for this angel of a woman, I will not only co-operate with Mr. John Harlowe, as you ask; but I will meet
Mr. James Harlowe senior, and his lady, all the way? And furthermore, to make the son James and Arabella quite easy, I will absolutely disclaim any furthe interest, whether living or dying, in any of the thre brothers estates; contenting myself with what my beloved's grandfather has bequeathed to her: For I hav reason to be abundantly satisfied with my own circumstances and prospects—Enough rewarded, wer she not to bring a shilling in dowry, in a lady who ha a merit superior to all the goods of fortune. True a the Gospel, Belford! Why had not this scene a rea foundation?
            The dear creature, by her eyes, expressed her gratitude, before her lips could utter it. O Mr. Lovelace, said she—You have infinitely—And there sh stopt—
            The Captain run over in my praise. He was reall affected.
            O that I had not such a mixture of revenge an pride in my love, thought I!—But [my old plea cannot I make her amends at any time?—And is no her virtue now in the heighth of its probation?—Would she lay aside, like the friends of my uncontending Rosebud, all thought of defiance—Woul she throw herself upon my mercy, and try me but on fortnight in the Life of Honour—What then?—cannot say, What then.
            Do not despise me, Jack, for my inconsistency—In no two letters perhaps agreeing with myself—Who expects consistency in men of our character?—But I am mad with love—Fired by revenge—Puzzle with my own devices—My inventions are my curse—My pride my punishment—Drawn five or six wa at once—Can <i>she</i> possibly be so unhappy as <i>I?</i> 
                why, why was this woman so divinely excellent!—Yet how know I that she is?—What have been h tryals? Have I had the courage to make a single o upon her <i>person,</i> tho' fifty upon her <i>temper?</i>—
Enough, I hope, to make her afraid of ever disobligeing me more!—
            I MUST banish reflection, or I am a lost man. For hese two hours past have I hated myself for my own contrivances. And this not only from what I <i>have</i> related to thee; but from what I have <i>further</i> to re
               ate. But I have now once more steeled my heart. My vengeance is uppermost; for I have been re-perusing some of Miss Howe's virulence. The contempt they have both held me in, I cannot bear.—
            The happiest breakfast-time, my beloved owned, that she had ever known since she had left her father's house. <i>She might have let this alone.</i> The Captain renewed all his protestations of service. He would write me word how his dear friend received the account he should give him of the happy situation of our affairs, and what he thought of the settlements, as soon as I should send him the kindly-promised draughts. And we parted with great professions of mutual esteem; my beloved putting up vows for the success of his generous mediation.
            When I returned from attending the Captain down stairs, which I did to the outward door, my beloved met me as I entered the dining-room; complacency reigning in every lovely feature.
            You see me already, said she, another creature. You know not, Mr. Lovelace, how near my heart this hoped-for reconciliation is. I am now willing to banish every disagreeable remembrance. You know not, Sir, how much you have obliged me. And Oh, Mr. Lovelace, how happy shall I be, when my heart s lightened from the all-sinking weight of a father's curse! When my dear mamma (You don't know, Sir, half the excellencies of my dear mamma! and what a kind heart she has, when it is left to follow its own impulses—When this blessed mamma) shall once more fold me to her indulgent bosom! When I shall
again have uncles and aunts, and a brother and sister, all striving who shall shew most kindness and favour to the poor outcast, then <i>no more</i> an outcast!—And you, Mr. Lovelace, to behold all this, and to be received into a family so dear to me, with welcome—What tho' a little cold at first? when they come to know you better, and to see you oftener, no fresh causes of disgust occurring, and you, as I hope, having enter'd upon a new course, all will be warmer and warmer love on both sides, till every one perhaps will wonder, how they came to set themselves against you.
            Then drying her eyes with her handkerchief, after a few moments pausing, on a sudden, as if recollecting that she had been led by her joy to an expression of it, which she had not intended I should see, she retired to her chamber with precipitation—Leaving me almost as unable to stand it, as herself.
            In short, I was—I want words to say how I was—My nose had been made to tingle before; my eyes have before been made to glisten by this soul-moving beauty; but so <i>very</i> much affected, I never was—for, trying to check my sensibility, it was too strong for me, and I even sobbed—Yes, by my soul, I <i>audibly</i> sobbed, and was forced to turn from her before she had well finished her affecting speech.
            I want, methinks, now I have owned the odd sensation, to describe it to thee—The thing was so strange to me—Something choaking, as it were, in my throat—I know not how—Yet, I must needs say, tho' I am out of countenance upon the recollection, that there was something very pretty in it; and I wish I could know it again, that I might have a more perfect idea of it, and be better able to describe it to thee.
            But this effect of her joy on such an occasion gives me a high notion of what that virtue must be [What other name can I call it?] which in a mind so capabl of delicate transport, should be able to make so charming
a creature in her very bloom, all frost and snow to every advance of Love from the man she hates not. This must be all from Education too:—Must it not, Belford? Can <i>Education</i> have stronger force in a woman's heart than <i>Nature?</i>—Sure it cannot. But if it can, how intirely right are parents to cultivate their daughters minds, and to inspire them with notions of reserve and distance to our sex; and indeed to make them think highly of their own? For pride is an excellent substitute, let me tell thee, where virtue shines not out, as the sun, in its own unborrowed lustre.
            AND now it is time to confess (and yet I know, that thy conjectures are aforehand with my exposition), that this Captain Tomlinson, who is so great a favourite with my charmer, and who takes so much delight in healing breaches, and reconciling differences, is neither a greater man nor a less, than honest Patrick MDonald, attended by a discarded footman of his own finding out.
            Thou knowest what a various-lifed rascal he is; and to what better hopes born and educated. But that ingenious knack of Forgery, for which he was expelled the Dublin-University, and a detection since in Evidenceship, have been his ruin. For these have thrown him from one country to another; and at last, into the way of life, which would make him a fit husband for Miss Howe's Townsend with her contrabands. He is, thou knowest, admirably qualified for any enterprize that requires adroitness and solemnity. And can there, after all, be a higher piece of justice aimed at, than to keep one Smuggler in readiness to play against another?
               "Well but, Lovelace (methinks thou questionest), how camest thou to venture upon such a contriveance
as this, when, as thou hast told me, the Lady used to be a month at a time at this uncle's; and must therefore, in all probability, know, that there was not a Captain Tomlinson in all his neighbourhood; at least no one of the name so intimate with him, as this man pretends to be?"—
            This objection, Jack, is so natural a one, that I could not help observing to my charmer, that she must surely have heard her uncle speak of this gentleman. No, she said, she never had. Besides, she had not been at her uncle Harlowe's for near ten months [<i>This I had heard her say before</i>]: And there were several gentlemen who used the same Green, whom she knew not.
            We are all very ready, thou knowest, to believe what we like.
            And what was the reason, thinkest thou, that she had not been of so long time at this uncle's?—Why, this old sinner, who imagines himself intitled to call me to account for my freedoms with the Sex, has lately fallen into familiarities, as it is suspected, with his housekeeper, who assumes airs upon it.—A cursed deluding Sex!—In youth, middle age, or dotage, they take us all in.
            Dost thou not see, however, that this housekeeper knows nothing, nor is to know any thing, of the treaty of reconciliation designed to be set on foot; and therefore the Uncle always comes to the Captain, the Captain goes not to the Uncle: And this I surmised to the Lady. And then it was a natural suggestion, that the Captain was the rather applied to, as he is a stranger to the rest of the family: Need I tell thee the meaning of all this?
            But this intrigue of the <i>Antient</i> is a piece of private history, the truth of which my beloved cares not to own, and indeed affects to disbelieve. As she does also some puisny gallantries of her foolish brother; which, by way of recrimination, I have hinted at, without naming my informant in their family.
                 Well but, methinks, thou questionest again, Is it not probable that Miss Howe will make inquiry after such a man as Tomlinson?—And when she cannot—
            I know what thou wouldst say—But I have no doubt, that Wilson will be so good, if I desire it, as to give into my own hands any letter that may be brought by Collins to his house, for a week to come. And now I hope thou'rt satisfied.
            I will conclude with a short story.
               "Two neighbouring sovereigns were at war together, about some pitiful chuck-farthing thing or other; no matter what; for the least trifles will set princes and children at loggerheads. Their armies had been drawn up in battalia some days, and the news of a decisive action expected every hour to arrive at each court. At last, issue was joined; a bloody battle was fought; and a fellow, who had been a spectator of it, arriving with the news of a complete victory, at the capital of one of the princes, some time before the appointed couriers, the bells were set a ringing, bonfires and illuminations were made, and the people went to bed intoxicated with joy and good liquor. But the next day all was reversed: The victorious enemy, pursuing his advantage, was expected every hour at the gates of the almost defenceless capital. The first reporter was hereupon sought for, and found; and being questioned, pleaded a great deal of merit, in that he had, in so dismal a situation, taken such a space of time from the distress of his fellow-citizens, and given it to festivity, as were the hours between the false good news and the real bad."
            Do thou, Belford, make the application. This I know, that I have given greater joy to my Beloved, than she had thought would so soon fall to her share. And as the human life is properly said to be chequerwork, no doubt but a person of her prudence will make the best of it, and set off so much good against
so much bad, in order to strike as just a balance as possible.

<i>Thursday,</i> 11 <i>o'Clock, Aug.</i> 31.                   I AM just come from the lady, whom I left chearful and serene.                                      thanked me for my communication of the preceding night. I read to                    such parts of your letters as I <i>could</i> read to                   ; and I thought it was a good test to distinguish the froth and whipt-syllabub in them from the cream, in what one <i>could</i> and could <i>not</i> read to a woman of so fine a mind; since four parts out of six of thy letters, which I thought entertaining as I read them to myself, appeared to myself, when I would have read them to her, most abominable stuff, and gave me a very contemptible idea of thy talents, and of my own judgment.                   her was far from rejoicing, as I had done, at the disappointment her letter gave you when explained.                   her said, her meant only an innocent allegory, that might carry instruction and warning to you, when the meaning was taken, as well as answer her own hopes for the time. It was run off in a hurry. her was afraid, it was not quite ight in <i>her.</i> But hoped the end would excuse, if the end could not justify, the means. And then her again expressed a good deal of apprehension, lest you should still take it into your head to molest her, when her time, her says, is so hort, that her wants every moment of it; repeating what he had once said before, That when her wrote, her was o ill, that her believed, her should not have lived till now: If her had thought her should, her must have thought of an expedient that would have better answered her intentions; hinting at a removal out of the knowlege of us both.                   But her was much pleased that the conference between you and Colonel Morden ended so amicably, after two or three such violent sallies, as I acquainted her you had had between you; and said, her must absolutely depend upon the promise I had given her to use my utmost endeavours to prevent further mischief on her account.                   her was pleased with the justice you did her character to her cousin.                   her was glad to hear, that he had so kind an opinion of her, and that he would write to her.                   I was under an unnecessary concern, how to break to her, that I had the copy of Brand's vile letter: <i>Unnecessary,</i> I say; for her took it just as you thought her would, as an excuse her wished to have for the implacableness of her friends; and begg'd I would let her read it her; for, said her, the contents cannot disturb me, be they what they will.                   I gave it her, and her read it to her, a tear now-and-then ready to start, and a sigh sometimes interposing.                   her gave me back the letter with great and surprising calmness, considering the subject.                   There was a time, said her, and that not long since, when such a letter as this would have greatly pained me. But I hope, I have now got above all these things; for I can refer to your kind offices, and Miss Howe's, the justice that will be done to my memory among my friends. There is a good and a bad light in which every thing that befals us, may be taken. If the human mind will busy the human mind to make the worst of every disagreeable occurrence, the human mind will never want woe. This letter, affecting as the subject of This letter is to my reputation, gives me more pleasure than pain, because I can gather from This letter, that had not my friends been prepossessed by misinformed, or rash and officious persons, who are always at hand to flatter or sooth the passions of the affluent, I can gather from it, that had not my friends been prepossessed by misinformed, or rash and officious persons, who are always at hand to flatter or sooth the passions of the affluent could not have been so immoveably determined against me. But now, I can gather from it, that had not my friends been prepossessed by misinformed, or rash and officious persons, who are always at hand to flatter or sooth the passions of the affluent are sufficiently cleared from every imputation of unforgiveness; for, while I appeared to I can gather from it, that had not my friends been prepossessed by misinformed, or rash and officious persons, who are always at hand to flatter or sooth the passions of the affluent in the character of a vile hypocrite, pretending to true penitence, yet giving up me to profligate courses, how could I expect either I can gather from it, that had not my friends been prepossessed by misinformed, or rash and officious persons, who are always at hand to flatter or sooth the passions of the affluent pardon or blessing?                   But, me, said I, you'll see by the date of this letter, August 9, that their severity, <i>previous</i> to that, cannot be excused by it.                   it imports me much, replied she, on account of my present wishes, as to the office you are so kind to undertake, that you should not think harshly of my friends. I must own to you, that I have been apt sometimes Sir to think my friends not only severe, but cruel. Suffering minds will be partial to my friends own cause and merits. Knowing their own hearts, if sincere, their are apt to murmur when harshly treated: But if their are not <i>believed</i> to be innocent by persons, who have a right to decide upon their conduct according to their own judgments, how can it be helped? Besides, Sir, How do you know, that there are not about my friends as well-meaning misrepresenters as Mr. Brand really seems to be? But be this as it will, there is no doubt that there are and have been multitudes of persons, as innocent as myself, who have suffered upon surmises as little probable as those on which Mr. Brand founds Mr. Brand judgment. Your intimacy, Sir, with Mr. Lovelace, and (may I say?) a character which, it seems, you have been less sollicitous formerly about justifying, than perhaps you will be for the future; and your frequent visits to Sir, may well be thought to be questionable circumstances in my conduct.                   I could only admire                    in silence.                   But you see, Sir, proceeded                   , how necessary it is for young people of our sex, to be careful of our company: And how much, at the same time, it behoves young gentlemen to be chary of young gentlemen own reputation, were it only for the sake of such of ours, as young gentlemen may mean honourably by; and who otherwise may suffer in young gentlemen good names for being seen in young gentlemen company.                   As to Mr. Brand, continued she, Mr. Brand is to be pitied; and let me injoin you, Mr. Belford, not to take up any resentments against Mr. Brand which may be detrimental either to Mr. Brand person or Mr. Brand fortunes. Let Mr. Brand function and Mr. Brand good meaning plead for Mr. Brand. Mr. Brand will have concern enough, when Mr. Brand finds every body whose displeasure I now labour under, acquitting my memory of perverse guilt, and joining in a general pity for Mr. Brand.                   This, Lovelace, is the lady whose life thou hast curtailed in the blossom of it!Ã‘How many opportunities must thou have had of admiring her inestimable worth, yet couldst have thy senses so much absorbed in the WOMAN in her charming person, as to be blind to the ANGEL that shines out in such full glory in her mind? Indeed, I have ever thought myself, when blest with her conversation, in the company of a real angel: And I am sure it would be impossible for myself, were her to be as beautiful, and as crimsoned over with health as I have seen her, to have the least thought of Sex, when I heard her talk.

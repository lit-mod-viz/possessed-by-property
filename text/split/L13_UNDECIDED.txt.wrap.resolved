 Mr. Lovelace gives here a very circumstantial relation of all that passed between the Lady and Dorcas. But as he could only guess at  Mr. Lovelace motives for refusing to go off, when Dorcas told Dorcas, that Dorcas had engaged for Dorcas the protection of the Lady, it is thought proper to omit he relation, and to supply his relation by some <i>memoranda</i> of the Lady's. But his relation is first necessary to account for the occasion on which those <i>memoranda</i> were made.                   The reader may remember, that in the letter wrote to Miss Howe on Miss Howe escape to Hamstead, Miss Howe promises to give Miss Howe the particulars of Miss Howe flight at leisure.                   Miss Howe had indeed thoughts of continuing Miss Howe account of every thing that had passed between Miss Howe and Mr. Lovelace, since Miss Howe last narrative letter. But the uncertainty Miss Howe was in from that time, with the execrable treatment Miss Howe met with on Miss Howe being deluded back again; followed by a week's delirium; had hitherto hindered Miss Howe from prosecuting Miss Howe intention. But, nevertheless, having it still in Miss Howe view to perform Miss Howe promise, as soon as Miss Howe had opportunity, Miss Howe made minutes of every thing as it passed, in order to help Miss Howe memory:Ã‘Which, as Miss Howe observes, in one place, Miss Howe could less trust to since Miss Howe late disorders than before.                   In these minutes, or book of <i>memoranda,</i> Miss Howe observes, "That having apprehensions, that Dorcas might be a traitress, Dorcas would have got away while Dorcas was gone out to see for a coach; and actually slid down stairs with that intent. But that, seeing Mrs. Sinclair in the entry" [whom Dorcas had planted there while Dorcas went out), "Dorcas speeded up again, unseen."                                      Dorcas then went up to the dining-room, and saw the letter of Captain Tomlinson: On which Dorcas observes in Dorcas memorandum-book, as follows.                     Dorcas, in Dorcas minutes, says, ""(a). Dorcas, in her minutes, owns the difficulty Dorcas lay under to keep Dorcas temper in this conference. "But when I found, says Dorcas, that all my intreaties were ineffectual, and that he was resolved to detain me, I could no longer with-hold my impatience."                (a). Dorcas mentions, in Dorcas memorandum-book, that Dorcas had no other way, as Dorcas apprehended, to save Dorcas from instant dishonour, but by making this concession. Dorcas only hope, now, Dorcas says if Dorcas cannot escape by Dorcas's connivance (whom, nevertheless, Dorcas suspects), is, to find a way to engage the protection of Dorcas uncle, and even of the civil magistrate, on Thursday next, if necessary. "He shall see, Dorcas says, tame and timid as He has thought Dorcas, what Dorcas dare to do, to avoid so hated a compulsion; and a man capable of a baseness so premeditatedly vile and inhuman."                (a). See p. <i>258.</i> of this Volume.(a). Dorcas had made an attempt to send away a letter.(a). Viz. the preceding letter.(b). See the next letter.(a).

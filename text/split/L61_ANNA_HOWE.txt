                     <i>Sunday Night, May</i> 7.
               WHEN you reflect upon my unhappy situation, which is attended with so many indelicate and even shocking circumstances, some of which my pride will not let me think of with patience; all aggravated by the contents of my cousin's affecting letter; you will not wonder, that the vapourishness which has laid hold of my heart, should rise to my pen. And yet it would be more kind, more friendly in me, to conceal from <i>you,</i> who take such a generous interest in my concerns, that worst part of my griefs, which communication and complaint cannot relieve.
            But to whom can I unbosom myself but to you?ÑWhen the man who ought to be my protector, as he
has brought upon me all my distresses, adds to my apprehensions; when I have not even a servant on whose fidelity I can rely, or to whom I can break my griefs as they arise; and when his bountiful temper and gay heart, attach every one to him; and I am but a cypher, to give him significance, and myself pain?ÑThese griefs, therefore, do what I can, will sometimes burst into tears; and these mingling with my ink, will blot my paper.ÑAnd I know you will not grudge me the temporary relief.
            But I shall go on in the strain I left off with in my last; when I intended rather to apologize for my melancholy. But let what I have above written, once for all, be my apology. My misfortunes have given you a call to discharge the noblest offices of the friendship we have vowed to each other, in advice and consolation, and it would be an injury to it, and to you, to suppose it needed even that call.
               She then tells Miss Howe, that now her cloaths are come, Mr. Lovelace is continually teazing her to go abroad with him in a coach, attended by whom she pleases of her own sex; either for the air, or to the public diversions.
               She gives the particulars of a conversation that has passed between them on that subject, and his several proposals. But takes notice, that he says not the least word of the solemnity which he so much pressed upon her before they came to town; and which, as she observes, was necessary to give propriety to his proposals.
            Now, my dear, <i>says she,</i> I cannot bear the life I live. I would be glad at my heart to be out of his reach. If I were, he should soon see the difference. If I must be humbled, it had better be by those to whom I owe duty, than by him. My aunt writes in er letter, that SHE dare not propose any thing in
my favour. You tell me, that, upon inquiry, you find, that, had I not been unhappily seduced away, a change of measures was actually resolved upon; and that my mamma, particularly, was determined to exert herself, for the restoration of the family peace; and, in order to succeed the better, had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle Harlowe in her party.
            Let me build on these foundations.ÑI can but try, my dear.ÑIt is my duty to try all <i>probable</i> methods to restore the poor outcast to favour.ÑAnd who knows but that once indulgent uncle, who has very great weight in the family, may be induced to interpose in my behalf?ÑI will give up all right and title to my grandfather's bequests, with all my heart and soul, to whom they shall think fit, in order to make my proposal palatable to my brother. And that my surrender may be effectual, I will engage never to marry.
            What think you, my dear, of this expedient? Surely they cannot resolve to renounce me for ever. If they look with impartial eyes upon what has happened, they <i>will</i> have something to blame <i>themselves</i> for, as well as <i>me.</i>
            I presume, that you will be of opinion, that this expedient is worth trying. But here is my difficulty; If I should write, my hard-hearted brother has so strongly confederated every-body against me, that my letter would be handed about from one to another, till he had hardened every one to refuse my request; whereas, could my uncle be engaged to espouse my cause, as from <i>himself,</i> I should have some hope; as I presume to think he would soon have my mother, and my aunt, of his party.
            What therefore I am thinking of, is this.ÑSuppose Mr. Hickman, whose good character has gained him every-body's respect, should put himself in my uncle Harlowe's way? And as if, from your knowlege of
the state of things between Mr. Lovelace and me, assure him not only of the above particulars, but that I am under no obligations, that shall hinder me from taking his directions?
            I submit the whole to your discretion, whether to pursue it at all, or in what manner. But if it be pursued, and if my uncle refuses to interest himself in my favour, upon Mr. Hickman's application, as from you (for so, for obvious reasons, it must be put), I can then have no hope; and my next step, in the mind I am in, shall be, to throw myself into the protection of the ladies of his family.
            It were an impiety to adopt the following lines, because it would be throwing upon the decrees of Providence a fault too much my own. But often do I revolve them, for the sake of the general similitude which they bear to my unhappy, yet undesigned error.
               To you, great gods! I make my last appeal:
               Or clear my virtues, or my crimes reveal.
               If wand'ring in the maze of life I run,
               And backward tread the steps I sought to shun,
               Impute my errors to your own decree;
               My <i>FEET</i> are guilty; but my <i>HEART</i> is free.
            Miss Harlowe dates again on Monday, to let Miss Howe know, that Mr. Lovelace, on observing her uneasiness, had introduced to her Mr. Mennell, Mrs. Fretchville's kinsman, who managed all her affairs [a young officer of sense and politeness, she calls him]; and who gave her an account of the house and furniture, to the same effect that Mr. Lovelace had done before; as also of the melancholy way Mrs. Fretchville is in.
            She tells Miss Howe, how extremely urgent Mr. Lovelace was with the gentleman, to get his spouse (as he now always calls her before company) a sight of the house: And that Mr. Mennell undertook that very
afternoon to shew her all of it, except the apartment Mrs. Fretchville should be in, when she went. But that she chose not to take another step till she knew how she approved of her scheme to have her uncle sounded; and what success, if try'd, it would be attended with.
            Mr. Lovelace, in his humourous way, gives his friend an account of the Lady's peevishness and dejection, on receiving a letter with her cloaths. He regrets that he has lost her confidence; which he attributes to bringing her into the company of his four companions. Yet he thinks he must excuse them, and censure her for over-niceness; for that he never saw men behave better, at least not <i>them.</i>
            Mentioning his introducing Mr. Mennell to her,
"Now, Jack, says he, was it not very kind of Mr. Mennell, <i>Captain</i> Mennell, I sometimes called him (for among the military men there is no such officer, thou knowest, as a <i>Lieutenant</i> or an <i>Ensign</i>): Was it not very kind in him, to come along with me so readily as he did, to satisfy my beloved about the vapourish lady and the house?"
               "But who is Captain Mennell, methinks thou askest? I never heard of such a man as Captain Mennell."
               "Very likely. But knowest thou not young Newcomb, 'honest Doleman's nephew?"
               "O-ho! Is it he?"
               "It is. And I have chang'd his name by virtue of my own single authority. Knowest thou not, that I am a great name-father? Preferments I bestow, both military and civil. I give estates, and take them away at my pleasure. Quality too I create. And by a still more valuable prerogative, I <i>degrade</i> by virtue of my own imperial will, without any other act of forfeiture than my own convenience. What a poor thing is a monarch to me!"
               "But Mennell, now he has seen this angel of a woman, has qualms; that's the devil!ÑI shall have enough to do to keep him right. But it is the less wonder, that he should stagger, when a few hours conversation with the same lady could make four much more harden'd varlets find <i>hearts</i>ÑOnly, that I am confident, that I shall at last reward her virtue, if her virtue overcome me, or I should find it impossible to persevere.ÑFor at times, I have confounded qualms myself. But say not a word of them to the Confraternity: Nor laugh at me for them thyself."
            In another letter, dated Monday night, he tells his friend, That the lady keeps him at such distance, that he is sure something is going on between her and Miss Howe, notwithstanding the prohibition from Mrs. Howe to both; and as he has thought it some degree of merit in himself to punish others for their transgressions, he thinks both these girls punishable for the breach of parental injunctions. And as to their letter-carrier, he has been inquiring into his way of living; and finding him to be a common poacher, a deer-stealer, and warren-robber, who, under pretence of higgling, deals with a set of customers, who constantly take all he brings, whether fish, fowl, or venison, he holds himself justify'd (since Wilson's conveyance must at present be sacred) to have him stript and robbed, and what money he has about him given to the poor; since, if he take not money as well as letters, he shall be suspected.
               "To serve one's self, says he, and punish a villain at the same time, is serving public and private. The law was not made for such a man as me. And I <i>must</i> come at correspondencies so disobediently carried on."
               "But, on second thoughts, if I could find out, that the dear creature carried any of her letters in
her pockets, I can get her to a play or to a concert, and she may have the misfortune to lose her pockets."
               "But how shall I find this out; since her Dorcas knows no more of her dressing or undressing than her Lovelace? For she is dressed for the day, before she appears even to her servant.ÑVilely suspicious!ÑUpon my soul, Jack, a suspicious temper is a punishable temper. If a lady suspects a rogue in an honest man, is it not enough to make the honest man who knows it, a rogue?"
               "But as to her pockets, I think my mind hankers after them, as the less mischievous attempt.ÑBut they cannot hold all the letters that I should wish to see. And yet a woman's pockets are half as deep as she is high. Ty'd round them as ballast-bags, I presume, lest the wind, as they move with full sail, from whale-ribb'd canvas, should blow away the gypsies."
            He then, in apprehension, that something is meditating between the two ladies, or that something may be set on foot to get Miss Harlowe out of his hands, relates several of his contrivances, and boasts of his instructions given in writing to Dorcas and to his servant Wil? Summers; and says, that he has provided against every possible accident, even to bring her back, if she should escape, or in case she should go abroad, and then refuse to return; and hopes so to manage, as that, should he make an attempt, whether he succeed in it, or not, he may have a pretence to detain her.
            He orders Dorcas to cultivate by all means her lady's favour; to lament her incapacity as to writeing and reading; to shew her lady letters from pretended country relations, and beg her advice how to answer them, and to get them answer'd; to be always aiming at scrawling with a pen, lest inky fingers should give suspicions. And says, that he has given
her an ivory-leaved pocket-book, with a silver pencil, that she may make memoranda on occasion.
            The lady has already, he says, at Mrs. Sinclair's motion, removed her cloaths out of the trunks they came in, into an ample mahogany repository, where they will lie at full-length, and which has drawers in it for linen.Ñ
"A repository, says he, that used to hold the richest suits which some of the nymphs put on, when they are to be dressed out, to captivate or to ape quality. For many a countess, thou knowest, has our mother equipp'd; nay, two or three duchesses, who live upon <i>quality-terms</i> with their lords. But this to such as will come up to her price, and can make an appearance like quality themselves on the occasion: For the reputation of persons of birth must not lie at the mercy of every under-degreed sinner."
               "A master-key which will open every lock in this chest, is put into Dorcas's hands; and she is to take care, when she searches for papers, before she removes any thing, to observe how it lies, that she may replace all to a hair. Sally and Polly can occasionally help to transcribe. Slow and sure with such a lady must be all my movements."
               "It is impossible that one so young and so inexperienced can have all her caution from herself; the behaviour of the women so unexceptionable; no revellings, no company ever admitted into this inner-house; all genteel, quiet, and easy, in it; the nymphs well-bred, and well-read; her first disgusts to the old one got over.ÑIt must be Miss Howe therefore, who once was in danger of being taken in by one of our class, by honest Sir George Colmar, as thou hast heard, that makes my progress difficult."
            Thou seest, Belford, by the above <i>precautionaries,</i> that I forget nothing. As he song says, it is not to be imagin'd
                  On what slight strings
                  Depend those things,
                  On which men build their glory!
               "So far, so good. I shall never let my goddess rest till I have first discover'd where she puts her letters, and next till I have got her to a play, to a concert, or to take an airing with me of a day, or so."
               "I GAVE thee just now some of <i>my</i> contrivances. Dorcas, who is ever attentive to all her lady's motions, has given me some instances of her <i>mistress</i>'s precautions. She wafers her letters, it seems, in two places; pricks the wafers; and then seals upon them. No doubt but those brought hither are taken the same care of. And she always examines the seals of the latter before she opens them. I must, I must, come at them. This difficulty augments my curiosity. Strange, so much as she writes, and at all hours, that not one sleepy or forgetful moment has offer'd in our favour!"
               "A fair contention, thou seest. Do not thou therefore reproach me for endeavouring to take advantage of her <i>tender years. Credulity</i> she has none. Am not I a <i>young fellow,</i> myself? As to her <i>fortune,</i> that's out of the question; fortune never had any other attractions for me, than to stimulate me on; and this, as I have elsewhere said, for motives not ignoble. As to <i>beauty</i>; pr'ythee, Jack, do thou, to spare my modesty, make a comparison between my Clarissa for a <i>woman,</i> and thy Lovelace for a <i>man!</i>ÑThe only point that can admit of debate, as I conceive, is, who has most <i>wit,</i> most <i>circumspection:</i> And that is what remains to be try'd."
               "A sad life, however, for the poor lady to live, as well as for me; that is to say, if she be not <i>naturally</i> jealous. If she be, her uneasiness is constitutional,
and she cannot help it; nor will it, in that case, hurt her. For a suspicious temper will <i>make</i> occasions for doubt, if none were to offer to her hand; and so my fair one is obliged to me for saving her the trouble of studying for these occasions.ÑBut after all, the plain way in every affair of the human life is the best, I believe. But it is not given me to choose it. Nor am I singular in the pursuit of the more intricate paths; since there are thousands and ten thousands, besides me, who had rather fish in troubled waters than in smooth."

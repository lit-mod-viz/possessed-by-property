<i>Rose, at Knightsbridge,</i>                   5 <i>o'Clock.</i>                   My fellow tells me, that thou art sending Mowbray and Tourville to My fellow.
I want Mowbray and Tourville not.
My soul's sick of Mowbray and Tourville, and of all the world; but most of myselfÑYet, as Mowbray and Tourville send me word, Mowbray and Tourville will come to My fellow immediately, I will wait for Mowbray and Tourville, and for thy next.
O Belford!
let it not beÑBut hasten it, hasten it, be it what it may!

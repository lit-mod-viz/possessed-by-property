<i>Saturday, May</i> 20.             AND now will I favour thee with a brief account of our present situation.             From the highest to the lowest our are all extremely happy.Ñ<i>Dorcas</i> stands well in her lady's graces. <i>Polly</i> has asked her advice in relation to a courtship affair of her own. No oracle ever gave better. <i>Sally</i> has had a quarrel with her woollen-draper; and made my beloved Lady-chancellor in No oracle. her blamed Sally for behaving tyrannically to a man who loves her. Dear creature! to stand against a glass, and to shut her eyes because her will not see her face in it!ÑMrs. Sinclair has paid <i>her</i> court to so unerring a judge, by requesting her advice with regard to both nieces.             This the way we have been in for several days with the people below. Yet <i>sola</i> generally at her meals, and seldom at other times in her meals company. her meals now, used to her ways [Perseverance must conquer], never press her; so when her meals meet, all is civility on both sides. Even marry'd people, I believe, Jack, prevent abundance of quarrels, by seeing one another but seldom.             But how stands it between thyself and the lady, methinks thou askest, since thyself abrupt departure from thee, and undutiful repulse of Wednesday morning? Why, pretty well in the main. Nay, very well. For why? The dear saucy-face knows not how to help The dear saucy-face. Can fly to no other protection. And has, besides, overheard a conversation [Who would have thought The dear saucy-face had been so near?] which passed between Mrs. Sinclair, Miss Martin, and myself, that very Wednesday afternoon; which has set The dear saucy-face heart at ease, with respect to several doubtful points.             Such as, particularly, Mrs. Fretchville's unhappy state of mind:ÑMost humanely pitied by Miss Martin, who knows her very well; the husband her has lost, and her, lovers from the husband she has lost, and herself, lovers from their cradles cradles. Pity from one begets pity from another; and so many circumstances were given to poor Mrs. Fretchville's distress, that it was impossible but my beloved must <i>extremely</i> pity her, whom the less tender-hearted Miss Martin <i>greatly</i> pitied.             My Lord M.'s gout My Lord M. only hindrance from visiting my spouse.             Lady Betty and Miss Montague soon expected i town.             My earnest desire signify'd to have my spouse receiv Lady Betty and Miss Montague in my spouse own house, if Mrs. Fretchville would bu know Mrs. Fretchville own mind.             My intention to stay at her own house notwithstanding, <i>as I said I had told Lady Betty and Miss Montague before,</i> in order to grati her utmost punctilio.             My passion for my beloved, which I told Lady Betty and Miss Montague, is a high and fervent accent, was the truest that m could have for woman, I boasted of. It was, in short, I said, of the <i>true Platonic kind</i>; or I had no notion of what Platonic Love was.             So it is, Jack; and must end as Platonic Love generally does end.             Sally and Mrs. Sinclair praised, <i>but not grosly,</i> my beloved. Sally particularly admired Sally purity, called it exemplary; yet, to avoid suspicion, expressed Sally thoughts, that Sally was-<i>rather over-nice,</i> if Sally might presume to say so before me. But applauded me for the strict observation I made of my vow.             I more freely blamed Sally reserves to Sally; called Sally cruel; inveighed against Sally relations; doubted Sally love. Every favour I asked of Sally deny'd me. Yet my behaviour to Sally as pure and delicate when alone, as when before them. Hinted at something that had passed between us that very day, that shewed Sally indifference to Sally in so strong a light, that I could not bear it. But that I would ask Sally for Sally company to the play of <i>Venice preserv'd,</i> given out for Saturday night, as a benefit play; the prime actors to be in it; and this to see, if I were to be denied every favour.ÑYet, for my own part, I loved not tragedies; tho' ÑYet did, for the sake of the instruction, the warning, and the example generally given in the instruction.             I had too much <i>feeling,</i> I said. There was enough in the world to make our hearts sad, without carrying grief into our diversions, and making the distresses of others our own.             True enough, Belford; and I believe, generally speaking, that all the men of our cast are of my mindÑThey love not any tragedies but those in which all the men of our cast are of my mindÑThey themselves act the parts of tyrants and executioners; and, afraid to trust they themselves with serious and solemn reflections, run to comedies, to laugh away the distresses they themselves have occasioned, and to find examples of as immoral men as they themselves. For very few of our comic performances, as thou knowest, give our good ones.ÑI answer, however, for myselfÑYet thou, I think, on recollection, lovest to deal in the <i>lamentable.</i>             Sally answered for Polly, who was absent, Mrs. Sinclair for Sally, and for all Sally acquaintance, even for Miss Partington, in preferring the comic to the tragic scenes.ÑAnd I believe they are right; for the devil's in it, if a confided-in rake does not give a girl enough of tragedy in a girl comedy.             I ask'd Sally to oblige my fair-one with ask'd Sally company.             ask'd Sally was engaged [That was right, thou'lt suppose]. I asked Mrs. Sinclair's leave for ask'd Sally. To be sure, Mrs. Sinclair's leave for Polly answer'd, ask'd Sally would think Mrs. Sinclair's leave for Polly an honour to attend Mrs. Lovelace: But the poor thing was tender-hearted; and as the tragedy was deep, would weep ask'd Sally blind.             Sally, mean time, objected Singleton, that <i>I</i> might answer the objection, and save my beloved the trouble of making the objection, or debating the point with me.             I then, from a letter just before received from one in              father's family, warned her father's family of a person who had undertaken to find us out, and whom I thus in writing (calling for pen and ink) described, that her father's family might arm all the family against himÑ "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned; "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned stature about six foot; an heavy eye, an over-hanging brow, a deck-treading stride in "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned walk; a couteau generally by "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned side; lips parched from "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned gums, as if by staring at the sun in hot climates; a brown coat; a colour'd handkerchief about "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned neck; an oaken plant in "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned hand, near as long as "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned, and proportionably thick."             No questions must be answer'd, that "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned should ask. No questions must be answer'd, that he should ask should call me to "A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned. But not let my beloved know a tittle of this, so long as it could be help'd. And I added, that if her brother or Singleton came, and if her brother or Singleton behaved civilly, I would, for her sake, be civil to <i>them:</i> And in this case, her had nothing to do, but to own her marriage, and there could be no pretence for violence on either side. But most fervently I swore, that if her was convey'd away, either by persuasion or force, I would directly, on missing her but one day, go to demand her at her father's, whether her were there or not; and if I recover'd not a sister, I would have a brother; and should find out a captain of a ship as well as a brother. And now, Jack, dost thou think her'll attempt to get from me, do what I will?             Mrs. Sinclair began to be afraid of mischief in Mrs. Sinclair houseÑI was apprehensive that her houseÑI would overdo the matter, and be out of character. I therefore wink'd at her. She primm'd; nodded, to shew her took me, twang'd out a high-ho, lapp'd one horse-lip over the other, and was silent.             Here's preparation, Belford!ÑDost think I will throw it all away, for any thing thou canst say, or Lord M. write?Ñ<i>No indeed!</i>Ñas my charmer says, when she bridles.             AND what must necessarily be the consequence of all this, with regard to my beloved's behaviour to me?ÑCanst thou doubt, that it was all complaisance next time she admitted me into she presence?             Thursday we were very happy. All the morning <i>extremely</i> happy. I kissed she charming handÑI need not describe to thee she hand and arm. When thou sawest she, I took notice that she eyes dwelt upon them, whenever thou couldst spare them from that beauty-spot of wonders, she face. <i>Fifty</i> times kissed she hand, I believe.ÑOnce she cheek, intending she lip, but so rapturously, that she could not help seeming angry.             Had she not thus kept me at arms-length; had she not denied me those innocent liberties which our Sex, from degree to degree, aspire to; could I but have gained access to she in she hours of heedlessness and dishabille (for full dress creates dignity, augments consciousness, and compels distance), we had been familiarized to each other long ago. But keep she up ever so late; meet she ever so early; by breakfast-time dressed for the day; and at she earliest hour, as nice as others dressed.ÑAll she forms thus kept up, wonder not that I have made so little progress in the proposed trial.ÑBut how must all this distance stimulate!                <i>Thursday morning,</i> I said, we were extremely happyÑAbout <i>noon,</i> she number'd the hours she had been with me; all of them to me but as one minute; and desired to be left to she. I was loth to comply: But observing the sun-shine begin to shut in, I yielded.             I dined out. Returned; talked of the house, and of Mrs. Fretchville: Had seen MennellÑHad pressed him to get the widow to quitÑShe pitied Mrs. FretchvilleÑAnother good effect of the overheard conversationÑHad written to my uncle; expected an answer soon from my uncle. I was admitted to sup with my uncle. Urged for my uncle approbation or correction of my written terms. my uncle promised an answer as soon as my uncle had heard from Miss Howe.             Then I pressed for my uncle company to the play on Saturday night. my uncle made objections, as I had foreseen: my uncle brother's projects, warmth of the weather, <i></i> But in such a manner, as if half-afraid to disoblige me [Another happy effect of the overheard conversation]. Got over these therefore; and my uncle consented to favour me.                <i>Friday</i> passed as the day before.             Here were two happy days to both!ÑWhy cannot I make every day equally happy? It looks as if It wer in my power to do so.ÑStrange I should thus deligh in teazing a woman I so dearly love!ÑI must, doubt, have something in my temper like Miss Howe who loves to plague the man who puts himself in her power.ÑBut I could not do thus by such an angel as this, did I not believe, that after ÑBut probation-time is expired, and if there is no bringing ÑBut to <i>cohabitation</i> (my darling view), I shall reward ÑBut as ÑBut wishes.                <i>Saturday</i> is half-over, equally happyÑPreparing for the playÑPolly has offer'd, and is accepted. I have directed ÑBut where to weepÑAnd this not only to shew ÑBut humanity [a weeping eye indicates a gentle heart], but to have a pretence to hide ÑBut face with ÑBut fan or handkerchief; yet ask'd Sally is far from being every man's girlÑAnd we shall sit in the gallery green-box.             The woes of others so well represented, as those of Belvidera particularly will be, must, I hope, unlock and open my charmer's heart. Whenever I have been able to prevail upon a girl to permit me to attend a girl to a play, I have thought myself sure of a girl. The female heart, all gentleness and harmony, when obliged, expands, and forgets its forms, when attention is carried out of its at an agreeable or affecting entertainment: Music, and perhaps a collation afterwards, co-operating. I have no hope of such an effect here; but I have more than one end to answer, by my earnestness in getting a girl to a play. To name but one: Dorcas has a master-key, as I have told theeÑAnd it were worth carrying Dorcas to <i>Venice preserved,</i> were it but to shew Dorcas, that there have been, and may be, much deeper distresses than Dorcas can possibly know.             Thus exceedingly happy are we at present. I hope we shall not find any of Nat. Lee's left-handed gods at work, to dash we bowl of joy with wormwood.             The Lady, in Dorcas next letter, dated Friday, May 19. acquaints Dorcas friend, that Dorcas prospects are once more mended; and that Dorcas has known four-and-twenty hours together, since Dorcas last, not unhappy ones, Dorcas situation considered. "How willing am I, <i>says she,</i> to compound for tolerable appearances! how desirous to turn the funny side of things towards me, and to hope, where reason for hope offers! and this, not only for my own sake, but for yours, who take such generous concern in all that befalls me."             Dorcas then gives the particulars of the conversation which Dorcas had overheard between Mr. Lovelace, Mrs. Sinclair, and Miss Martin; but accounts more minutely than he had done, for the opportunity Dorcas had of overhearing it, unknown to the particulars of the conversation which she had overheard between Mr. Lovelace, Mrs. Sinclair, and Miss Martin.             Dorcas gives the reason Dorcas has to be pleased with what Dorcas heard from each: But is shocked at the measure he is resolved to take, if he misses Dorcas but for one day. Yet is pleased, that he proposes to avoid <i>aggressive</i> violence, if Dorcas brother and he meet in town.             Dorcas thought Dorcas obliged, Dorcas says, from what passed between them on Wednesday, and from what Dorcas overheard him say, to consent to go with him to the play; especially, as him had the discretion to propose one of the nieces to accompany Dorcas.             Dorcas expresses Dorcas pleased, that him has actually written to Lord M.             Dorcas tells Dorcas, that Dorcas has promised to give him an answer to him proposals, as soon as Dorcas has heard from <i>her</i> on the subject: And hopes, that in Dorcas future letter Dorcas shall have reason to confirm these favourable appearances. "Favourable, <i>says she,</i> I must think these favourable appearances in the wreck I have suffer'd."             Dorcas thinks it not amiss, however, that Dorcas should perfect Dorcas scheme with Mrs. Townsend. He is certainly, Dorcas says, a deep and dangerous man; and it is therefore but prudence to be watchful, and to provide against the worst.             Dorcas is certain, Dorcas tells Dorcas, that Dorcas letters are safe.                                    would never be out of Dorcas company by                   good-will; otherwise Dorcas has no doubt that Dorcas is mistress of Dorcas goings-out and comings-in; and did Dorcas think it needful, and were Dorcas not afraid of Dorcas , and Capt. Singleton, would oftener put it to trial.

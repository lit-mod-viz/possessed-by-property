 <i>One o'clock in the morning.</i>
                  ALL now must soon be over with him: Poor! poor fellow! He has given me some hints of what he wanted to say; but all incoherent, interrupted by dying hiccoughs and convulsions.
                  Bad enough it must be, heaven knows! by what I can gather. Alas! Lovelace, I fear, I fear, he came <i>too soon</i> into his uncle's estate.
                  If a man were to live always, he might have some temptation to do base things, in order to procure to himself, as it would then be, <i>everlasting</i> ease, plenty or affluence: But, for the sake of ten, twenty, thirty years of poor life, to be a villain—can that be worth while? with a conscience singing him all the time too! And when he comes to wind up all, such agonizing reflections upon his past guilt! All then appearing as nothing! What he most valued, most disgustful! and not one thing to
think of, as the poor fellow says twenty and twenty times over, but what is attended with anguish and reproach!
                  To hear the poor man wish he had never been born! To hear him pray to be nothing after death! Good God! how shocking!
                  By his incoherent hints, I am afraid 'tis very bad with him. No pardon, no mercy, he repeats, can lie for him!
                  I hope I shall make a proper use of this lesson. Laugh at me if thou wilt, but never, never more, will I take the liberties I have taken; but whenever I am tempted, will think of Belton's dying agonies, and what my own may be.
                           <i>Thursday, three in the morning.</i>
                  HE is now at the last gasp—Rattles in the throat: Has a new convulsion every minute almost: What horror is he in! His eyes look like breath-stained glass! They roll ghastly no more; are quite set: His face distorted, and drawn out, by his sinking jaws, and erected staring eyebrows, with his lengthened furrowed forehead, to double its usual length, as it seems. It is not, it cannot be, the face of Belton, thy Belton, and my Belton, whom we have beheld with so much delight over the social bottle, comparing notes, that one day may be brought against us, and make <i>us</i> groan, as they very lately did <i>him</i>—that is to say, while he had strength to groan; for now his voice is not to be heard; all inward, lost; not so much as speaking by his eyes: Yet, strange! how can it be? the bed rocking under him like a cradle!

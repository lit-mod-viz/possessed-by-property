                     SIR,                   THE letter which the bearer of this brings with him, will, I presume, make it unnecessary to acquaint you and my cousins with the death of the most excellent of women. But I am requested by her Executor, who will soon send you a copy of her last Will, to acquaint her father (which I choose to do by your means) that in it she earnestly desires to be laid in the family-vault, at the feet of her grandfather.                   If her father will not admit of it, she has directed her body to be buried in the church-yard of the parish where she died.                   I need not tell you, that a speedy answer to This is necessary.                   Her Beatification commenced yesterday afternoon, exactly at 40 minutes after six.                   I can write no more, than that I am                                               <i>Yours,</i>  WM. MORDEN.

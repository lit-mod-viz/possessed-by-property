                  Monday, March 20.             THIS letter will account to you, my dear, for my abrupt breaking off in the answer I was writing to yours of yesterday; and which, possibly, I shall not be able to finish, and send you, till to-morrow or next day; having a great deal to say to the subjects you put to me in it. What I am now to give you are the particulars of another effort made by my friends, thro' the good Mrs. Norton.             It seems they had sent to her yesterday, to be here this day, to take their instructions, and to try what <i>she</i> could do with me. It would, at least, I suppose they thought, have this effect; To render me inexcusable with <i>her</i>; or to let <i>her</i> see, that there was no room for the expostulations she had often wanted to make in my favour to my mamma.             The declaration, that my heart was <i>free,</i> afforded them an argument to prove obstinacy and perverseness upon me; since it could be nothing else that govern'd me in my opposition to their wills, if I had no particular esteem for another man: And now, that I have given them reason (in order to obviate this argument) to suppose that I <i>have</i> a preference to another, they are resolved to carry their schemes into execution as soon as possible. And in order to this, they sent for This good woman, for whom they know I have even a filial regard.             She found assembled my papa and mamma, my brother and sister, my two uncles, and my aunt Hervey.             My brother acquainted her with all that had passed since she was last permitted to see me; with my letters avowing my regard to Mr. Lovelace, as they all interpreted them; with the substance of their answers to them; and with their resolutions.             My mamma spoke next; and delivered herself to this effect, as the good woman told me afterwards:             After reciting how many times I had been indulged in my refusals of different gentlemen; and the pains she had taken with me, to induce me to oblige my whole family, in one instance out of five or six; and my obstinacy upon it; O my good Mrs. Norton, said the dear Lady, could you have thought, that <i>my</i> Clarissa and <i>your</i> Clarissa was capable of so determin'd an opposition to the will of parents so indulgent to her? But see what <i>you</i> can do with her. The matter is gone too far to be receded from, on our parts. Her papa had concluded every thing with Mr. Solmes, not doubting her compliance. Such noble settlements, Mrs. Norton, and such advantages to the whole family!ÑIn short, she has it in her power to lay an obligation upon us all. Mr. Solmes, knowing she has good principles, and hoping, by his patience <i>now,</i> and good treatment <i>hereafter,</i> to engage her gratitude, and by degrees her love, is willing to overlook All!Ñ             So, Mrs. Norton, if you are convinc'd, that it is a child's duty to submit to her parents authority, in the most important point as well as in the least, I beg you'll try <i>your</i> influence over her: <i>I</i> have none. Her <i>papa</i> has none: Her <i>uncles</i> neither. Altho' it is her apparent interest to oblige us All; for, on that condition, her grandfather's estate is not half of what, living and dying, is purpos'd to be done for her. If any body can prevail with her, it is <i>you</i>; and I hope you will <i>heartily</i> enter upon this task with her.             She ask'd, Whether she was permitted to expostulate with them upon the occasion, before she came up to me?             My arrogant brother told her, she was sent for to expostulate with his <i>sister,</i> and not with <i>them.</i> And <i>This,</i> Goody Norton [She is always <i>Goody</i> with him!], you may tell her, that matters are gone so far with Mr. Solmes, that there is no going back!ÑOf consequence, no room for <i>your</i> expostulation, or <i>hers</i> either.             Be assured of This, Mrs. Norton, said my papa, in an angry tone, that we will not be baffled by her. We will not appear like fools in This matter, and as if we had no authority over our own daughter. We will not, in short, be bully'd out of our child by a cursed rake, who had like to have killed our only son!ÑAnd so she had better make a merit of her obedience: For comply she shall, if I live; independent as she thinks my father's indiscreet bounty hath made her of me, her father. Indeed since That, she has never been what she was before. An unjust bequest!ÑAnd it is likely to prosper accordingly!ÑBut if she marry that vile Lovelace, I will litigate every shilling with her: Tell her so; and that the Will <i>may</i> be set aside, and <i>shall.</i>             My uncles join'd, with equal heat.                  My brother was violent in his declarations.             My sister put in with vehemence, on the same side.             My aunt Hervey was pleased to say, There was no article so proper for parents to govern in, as This of marriage: And it was very fit, mine should be obliged.             Thus instructed, the good woman came up to me. She told me all that had passed; and was very earnest with me to comply; and so much justice did she to the task imposed upon her, that I more than once thought, that her own opinion went with theirs. But when she saw what an immoveable aversion I had to the man, she lamented with me their determin'd resolution: And then examin'd into the sincerity of my profession, that I would gladly compound with them by living single: Of this being satisfy'd, she was so convinc'd, that this offer (which would exclude Lovelace effectually) ought to be accepted, that she would go down, altho' I told her, it was what I had tender'd over-and-over to no purpose, and undertake to be guaranty for me on that score.             She went accordingly; but soon return'd in tears; being used harshly for urging this alternative:ÑThey had a right to my obedience upon their own terms, they said: My proposal was an artifice, only to gain time: Nothing but marrying Mr. Solmes <i>should</i> do: They had told me so before: They should not be at rest till it was done; for they knew what an interest Lovelace had in my heart: I had as good as own'd it in my letters to my uncles, and brother, and sister, altho' I had most disingenuously declared otherwise to my mamma. I depended, they said, upon <i>their</i> indulgence, and my <i>own power</i> over them: They had not banish'd me their presence, if they did not know that their consideration for <i>me</i> was greater than mine for <i>them.</i> And they <i>would</i> be obey'd, or I never should be restor'd to their favour, let the consequence be what it would.                  My brother thought fit to tell the good woman, that her whining nonsense did but harden me. There was a perverseness, he said, in female minds, a Tragedy-pride, that would make a romantic young creature, such a one as me, risque any thing to obtain pity. I was of an age, and a turn (the insolent said), to be fond of a lover-like distress: And my grief (which she pleaded) would never break my heart; it would sooner break That of the best and most indulgent of mothers. He added, That she might once more go up to me: But that, if she prevailed not, he should suspect, that the man they all hated had found a way to attach <i>her</i> to his interest.             Every-body blam'd him for this unworthy reflection; which greatly affected the good woman. But nevertheless he said, and no-body contradicted him, that if she could not prevail upon her <i>sweet child</i> (as it seems she had fondly called me), she had best withdraw to her own home, and there tarry till she was sent for; and so leave her <i>sweet child</i> to her father's management.             Sure no-body ever had so insolent, so hard-hearted a brother, as I have! So much resignation to be expected from me! So much arrogance, and to so good a woman, and of so fine an understanding, to be allowed in him!             She nevertheless told him, that however she might be ridiculed for speaking of the sweetness of my disposition, she must take upon her to say, that there never was a sweeter in the sex: And that she had ever found, that by mild methods, and gentleness, I might at any time be prevailed upon, even in points against my own judgment and opinion.             My aunt Hervey hereupon said, it was worth while to reflect upon what Mrs. Norton said: And that she had sometimes allowed <i>herself</i> to doubt, whether I had been begun with by such methods as generous tempers are only to be influenced by, in cases where their hearts are supposed to be opposite to the will of their friends.             She had both my brother and sister upon her for This: Who referr'd to my mamma, whether she had not treated me with an indulgence that had hardly any example?             My mamma said, She must own, that no indulgence had been wanting from <i>her:</i> But she must needs say, and had <i>often</i> said it, that the reception I met with on my return from Miss Howe, and the manner in which the proposal of Mr. Solmes was made to me (which was such as left nothing to my choice), and before I had had an opportunity to converse with him, were not what she had by any means approved of.             She was silenc'd, you will guess by whom,Ñwith, My dear! my dear!ÑYou have <i>ever</i> something to say, something to palliate, for this rebel of a girl!ÑRemember her treatment of you, of me!ÑRemember, that the wretch, whom we so justly hate, would not dare to persist in his purposes, but for her encouragement of <i>him,</i> and obstinacy to <i>us.</i>ÑMrs. Norton (angrily to her), go up to her once moreÑand if you think gentleness will doÑyou have a commission to be gentle.ÑIf it won't, never make use of that plea again.             Ay, my good woman, said my mamma, try <i>your</i> force with her. My sister Hervey and I will go up to her, and bring her down in our hands, to receive her father's blessing, and assurances of every-body's love, if she will be prevailed upon: And, in that case, we will all love you the better for your good offices.             She came up to me, and repeated all these passages with tears:ÑBut, after what had passed between us, I told her, that she could not hope to prevail upon me to comply with measures so wholly my brother's; and so much to my aversion.ÑAnd then folding me to her maternal bosom, I leave you, my dearest Miss, said she!ÑI leave you, because I <i>must!</i>ÑBut let me beseech you to do nothing rashly; nothing unbecoming your character. If all be true that is said, Mr. Lovelace cannot deserve you. If you <i>can</i> comply, remember it is your <i>duty</i> to comply. They take not, I own, the right method with so generous a spirit. But remember, that there would not be any merit in your compliance, if it were <i>not</i> to be against your own will. Remember also, what is expected from a character so extraordinary as yours: Remember, it is in your power to unite or disunite your whole family for ever. Altho' it should at <i>present</i> be disagreeable to you to be thus compelled, your prudence, I dare say, when you consider the matter seriously, will enable you to get over all prejudices against the one, and all prepossessions in favour of the other: And then the obligation you will lay all your family under, will be not only meritorious in you, with regard to <i>them,</i> but in a few months, very probably, highly satisfactory, as well as reputable, to <i>yourself.</i>             Consider, my dear mamma Norton, said I, <i>only</i> consider, that it is not a small thing that is insisted upon; nor for a short duration: It is for my <i>Life.</i>ÑConsider too, that all This is owing to an overbearing brother, who governs every-body. Consider how desirous I am to oblige them, if a <i>single ife,</i> and breaking all correspondence with the man they hate because my brother hates him, would do it.             I consider every-thing, my dearest Miss: And, added to what I have said, do <i>you</i> only consider, that if, by pursuing your <i>own</i> will, and rejecting <i>theirs,</i> you <i>should</i> be unhappy, you will be deprived of all that consolation which those have, who have been directed by their <i>parents,</i> altho' the event prove not answerable to their wishes.             I <i>must</i> go, repeated she;Ñyour brother will say (and she wept), that I harden you by my <i>whining nonsense.</i> 'Tis indeed hard, that so much regard should be paid to the <i>humours</i> of one child; and so little to the <i>inclination</i> of another. But let me repeat, that it is your <i>duty</i> to acquiesce, if you <i>can</i> acquiesce: Your father has given your brother's schemes <i>his</i> sanction; and they are now <i>his.</i> Mr. Lovelace, I doubt, is not a man that will justify <i>your</i> choice, so much as he will <i>their</i> dislike. It is too easy to see that your brother has a <i>view</i> in discrediting you with all your friends, with your uncles in particular: But for that very reason, you should comply, if possible, in order to disconcert his ungenerous measures. I will pray for you; and that is all I can do for you. I must now go down, and make a report, that you are resolved never to have Mr. Solmes:ÑMust I?ÑConsider, Miss,Ñ<i>Must</i> I?             Indeed you must!ÑBut of This I do assure you, that I will do nothing to disgrace the part you have had in my education. I will bear every-thing, that shall be short of forcing my hand into <i>his,</i> who never can have any share in my heart. I will try, by patient duty, by humility, to overcome them. But death will I choose, in any shape, rather than That man.             I dread to go down, said she, with so determin'd an answer: They will have no patience with me.ÑBut let me leave you with one observation, which I beg of you always to bear in mind:Ñ                "That persons of prudence, and distinguished talents, like yours, seem to be sprinkled thro' the world, to give credit, by their example, to Religion and Virtue. When such persons <i>wilfully</i> err, how great must be the fault! How ungrateful to that God, who blessed them with such talents! What a loss likewise to the world! What a wound to Virtue! But this, I hope, will never be to be said of Miss Clarissa Harlowe!"             I could give her no answer, but by my tears. And I thought, when she went away, the better half of my heart went with her.                  I listened to hear what reception she would meet with below; and found it was just such a one as she apprehended.                <i>Will</i> she, or will she <i>not,</i> be Mrs. Solmes? None of your whining circumlocutions, Mrs. Norton!Ñ(You may guess who said this.)Ñ<i>Will</i> she, or will she <i>not,</i> comply with her parents will?             This cut short all she was going to say.             If I <i>must</i> speak so briefly, Miss will sooner die, than haveÑ             Any-body but Lovelace! interrupted my brotherÑThis, Madam, This, Sir, is your meek daughter! This is Mrs. Norton's <i>sweet child!</i>ÑWell, Goody, you may return to your own habitation. I am impowered to forbid you to have any correspondence with this perverse girl, for a month to come, as you value the favour of our whole family, or of any individual of it.             And saying this, uncontradicted by any-body, he himself shewed her to the doorÑNo doubt, with all that air of cruel insult, which the haughty Rich can put on to the unhappy Low, who have not pleased them.             So here, Miss, am I deprived of the advice of one of the most prudent and conscientious women in the world, were I to have ever so much occasion for it.             I might, indeed, write, as I presume, under your cover, and receive <i>her</i> answers to what I should write. But should such a correspondence be charged upon her, I know she would not be guilty of a falshood for the world; nor even of an equivocation: And should she own it, after this prohibition, she would forfeit my mamma's favour for ever. And in my dangerous fever, some time ago, I engaged my mamma to promise me, that, if I died before I could do any-thing for the good woman, she would set her above want for the rest of her life, should her eyes fail her, or sickness befal her, and she could not provide for herself, as she now so prettily does by her fine needleworks,                   What measures will they fall upon next?ÑWill they not recede, when they find, that it must be a rooted antipathy, and nothing else, that could make a temper, not naturally inflexible, so sturdy?             Adieu, my dear. Be you happy!ÑTo <i>know</i> that it is in your power to be so, is all that seems wanting to make you so.                CL. HARLOWE.

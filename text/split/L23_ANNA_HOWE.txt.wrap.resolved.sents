<i>Thursday, July</i> 20.
<i>Miss</i> HARLOWE,             I Cannot help acquainting you, however it may be received, as coming from <i>me,</i> that your poor sister is dangerously ill, at the house of one Smith, who keeps a glover's and perfume-shop, in King-street, Covent-Garden.
your poor sister knows not that I write.
Some violent words, in the nature of an imprecation, from your poor sister father, afflict your poor sister greatly in your poor sister weak state.
I presume not to direct to you what to do in this case, You are your poor sister sister.
I therefore could not help writing to you, not only for your poor sister sake, but for your own.
<i>I am, Madam, Your humble Servant,</i> ANNA HOWE.

                                              <i>Sunday, May</i> 21.             I AM too much disturbed in my mind, to think of any think but revenge; or I had intended to give thee an account of Miss Harlowe's curious observations on the play. <i>Miss Harlowe's,</i> I say. Thou knowest that I hate the name of <i>Harlowe</i>; and I am exceedingly out of humour with her, and with her saucy friend.             What's the matter <i>now,</i> thou'lt ask?ÑMatter enough; for while we were at the play, Dorcas, who had her orders, and a key to her lady's chamber, as well as a master-key to her drawers and mahogany chest, closet-key and all, found means to come at some of Miss Howe's last-written letters. The vigilant wench was directed to thou'lt ask?ÑMatter enough; for while we were at the play, Dorcas, who had her orders, and a key to her lady's chamber, as well as a master-key to her drawers and mahogany chest, closet-key and all, found means to come at some of Miss Howe's last-written letters by seeing her lady take a letter out of her stays, and put it to the others, before her went out with meÑAfraid, as the women upbraidingly tell me, that I should find it there.                  Dorcas no sooner found Dorcas, than Dorcas assembled three ready writers of the <i>non-apparents,</i> and Sally, and Dorcas and Dorcas employed Dorcas with the utmost diligence, in making extracts, according to former directions, from these cursed letters, for my use. <i>Cursed,</i> I may well call themÑSuch abuses, such virulence! O this little fury Miss Howe!ÑWell might Dorcas saucy friend (who has been equally free with me, or the occasion could not have been given) be so violent as Dorcas lately was, at my endeavouring to come at one of these letters.             I was sure, that this fair-one, at so early an age, with a constitution so firm, health so blooming, eyes so sparkling, could not be absolutely, and from Dorcas own vigilance, so guarded and so apprehensive, as I have found Dorcas to be.ÑSparkling eyes, Jack, when the poetical tribe have said all the poetical tribe can for the poetical tribe, are an infallible sign of a rogue, or room for a rogue, in the heart.             Thou may'st go on with thy preachments, and Lord M. with Lord M. Wisdom of nations, I am now more assured of Thou may'st than ever. And now my revenge is up, and join'd with my love, all resistance must fall before all resistance. And most solemnly do I swear, that Miss Howe shall come in for Thou may'st snack.             And here, just now, is another letter brought from the same little virulent devil.ÑI hope to procure transcripts from that too, very speedily, if it be put to the rest; for Thou may'st is resolved to go to church this morning; not so much from a spirit of devotion, I have reason to think, as to try whether Thou may'st can go out without check or controul, or my attendance.             I HAVE been denied breakfasting with             . Indeed              was a little displeased with me last night; because, on our return from the play, I obliged              to pass the rest of the night with the women and me, in the women and me parlour, and to stay till near One.              told me at parting, that              expected to have the whole next day to             .ÑI had not read the extracts then; so was all affectionate respect, awe, and distance; for I had resolved to begin a new course, and, if possible, to banish all jealousy and suspicion from              heart: And yet I had no reason to be much troubled at              past suspicions; since, if a woman will continue with a man whom a woman suspects, when a woman can get from a man whom she suspects, or <i>thinks</i> a woman can, I am sure it is a very hopeful sign.             SHE is gone. Slipt down before I was aware. Slipt had ordered a chair, on purpose to exclude my personal attendance. But I had taken proper precautions. Will. attended Slipt by consent; Peter, the house-servant, was within Will.'s call.             I had, by Dorcas, represented Dorcas danger from Singleton, in order to dissuade Dorcas from going at all, unless Dorcas allowed me to attend Dorcas; but I was answer'd, That if there was no cause of fear at the playhouse, when there were but <i>two</i> playhouses, surely there was less at church, when there were so <i>many</i> churches. The chairmen were ordered to carry Dorcas to St. James's church.             But Dorcas would not be so careless of obliging me, if Dorcas knew what I have already come at, and how the women urge me on; for the women are continually complaining of the restraint the women lie under; in the women behaviour; in the women attendance; neglecting all the women concerns in the front-house; and keeping this elegant back one intirely free from company, that Dorcas may have no suspicion of the women. the women doubt not my generosity, the women say: But <i>why</i> for my own sake, in Lord M.'s style, <i>should I make so long a harvest of so little corn?</i>ÑWomen, ye reason well. I think I will begin my operations the moment she comes in.                  I HAVE come at the letter brought she from Miss Howe to-day.ÑPlot, conjuration, sorcery, witchcraft, all going forward!ÑI shall not be able to see this <i>Miss Harlowe</i> with patience. As the nymphs below say, Why is <i>night</i> necessary?ÑAnd Sally and Polly upbraidingly remind me of my first attempts upon Sally and Polly.ÑYet force answers not my endÑAnd yet it may, if there be truth in that part of the libertines creed, <i>That once subdued, is always subdued!</i> And what woman answers <i>affirmatively</i> to the question?             SHE is returnedÑBut refuses to admit me. Desires to have the day to what woman. Dorcas tells me, that Dorcas believes Dorcas denial is from motives of pietyÑOons, Jack, is there impiety in seeing me!ÑWould it not be the highest act of piety, to reclaim me? And is this to be done by Dorcas refusing to see me, when Dorcas is in a devouter frame than usual? But I hate Dorcas, hate Dorcas heartily!ÑShe is old, ugly, and deformed.ÑBut O the blasphemy!ÑYet Dorcas is an HarloweÑAnd I hate Dorcas for that.             But since I must not see Dorcas [Dorcas will be mistress of Dorcas <i>own will,</i> and of Dorcas <i>time</i> truly!], let me fill up mine, by telling thee what I have come at.             The first letter the women met with, is dated April 27. Where can Dorcas have put the preceding ones? It mentions Mr. Hickman as a busy fellow between the women. Mr. Hickman had best take care of Mr. Hickman. Mr. Hickman says in it, <i>I hope you have no cause to repent returning my NorrisÑIt is forthcoming on demand.</i> Now, what demand!ÑThe devil can this mean!ÑHer Norris forthcoming on demand!ÑThe devil take me, if I am <i>out-Norris'd!</i>ÑIf such innocents can allow -Norris'd!</i>ÑIf such innocents to plot, to <i>Norris,</i> well may I.                  Mr. Hickman is sorry, that <i>Mr. Hickman Hannah can't be with her.</i>ÑAnd what if her Hannah could?ÑWhat could her Hannah do for her Hannah in such a house as this?                <i>The women in such a house as this are to be found out in one breakfasting.</i> The women in the house are enraged at both the correspondents for this; and more than ever make a point of conquering her Hannah. I had a good mind to give The women in the house Miss Howe in full property. Say but the word, Jack, and it shall be done.                <i>                is glad that Miss Howe had thoughts of takeing me at my word.                 wondered I did not offer again.</i> Advises                , if I don't soon, <i>not to stay with me.</i> Cautions                 <i>to keep me at distance; not to permit the least familiarity</i>ÑSee, JackÑSee BelfordÑExactly as I thought!ÑHer vigilance all owing to a cool friend; who can sit down quietly, and give that advice, which, in                 own case,                 could not take.ÑShe tells                , <i>it is my interest to be honest</i>ÑINTEREST, fools!ÑI thought these girls knew, that my <i>interest</i> was ever subservient to my <i>pleasure.</i>             What would I give to come at the copies of the letters to which those of Miss Howe are answers!             The next letter is dated May 3. In this the little termagant expresses her astonishment, that her mother should write to Miss Harlowe, to forbid her mother to correspond with her mother daughter. Mr. Hickman, her mother says, is of opinion, <i>that her mother ought not to obey her mother mother.</i> How the creeping fellow trims between both! I am afraid, that I must punish him, as well as this virago; and I have a scheme rumbling in my head, that wants but half an hour's musing to bring into form, that will do my business upon both. I cannot bear, that the parental authority should be thus despised, thus trampled under-footÑBut observe the vixen, <i>'Tis well he is of her opinion; for her having set her mother up, her must have somebody to quarrel with.</i>ÑCould a Lovelace have allowed a Lovelace a greater licence? her's a devilish rake in her heart. Had her been a man, and one of us, her'd have outdone us all in enterprize and spirit.                <i>her wants but very little farther provocation,</i> her says, <i>to fly privately to London. And if her does, her will not leave her till her sees her either honourably married, or quit of the wretch.</i> Here, Jack, the transcriber Sally has added a prayerÑ "For the Lord's sake, dear Mr. Lovelace, get this fury to London!" ÑHer fate, I can tell thee, Jack, if we had ÑHer among we, should not be so long deciding as ÑHer friend's. What a gantlope would ÑHer run, when I had done with ÑHer, among a dozen of ÑHer own pityless Sex, whom my charmer shall never see!ÑBut more of this anon.             I find by The next letter, that my saucy captive had been drawing the characters of every varlet of ye. Nor am I spared in it more than you. <i>The man's a fool, to be sure, my dear.</i> Let me die, if they either of they find me one. <i>A silly fellow, at least.</i> Cursed contemptible!Ñ<i>I see not but they are a set of infernals</i>ÑThere's for thee, BelfordÑ<i>and BelfordÑ the Beelzebub.</i> There's for thee, Lovelace!ÑAnd yet Lovelace!ÑAnd would have Lovelace!ÑAnd marry a Beelzebub.ÑAnd what have any of us done, to the knowlege of Miss Howe, that ÑAnd should give such an account of us, as should warrant so much abuse from Miss Howe?ÑBut that's to come!             ÑAnd blames ÑAnd, for <i>not admitting Miss Partington to ÑAnd bedÑWatchful as you are, what could have happen'd?ÑIf violence were intended, Partington would not stay for the night.</i> Sally writes upon this hintÑ "See, Sir, what is expected from Sally. An hundred and an hundred times have we told you of this." ÑAnd so An hundred and an hundred times have. But, to be sure, the advice from An hundred and an hundred times was not of half the efficacy as it will be from Miss Howe.Ñ<i>You might have sat up after Miss Howe, or not gone to bed.</i> But can there be such apprehensions between An hundred and an hundred times, yet the one advise Miss Howe to stay, and the other resolve to wait my imperial motion for marriage? I am glad I know that.             Miss Howe approves of my proposal about Mrs. Fretchville's house. Miss Howe puts Miss Howe upon expecting settlements; upon naming a day: And concludes, with insisting upon Miss Howe writing, notwithstanding Miss Howe mother's prohibition; or bids Miss Howe <i>take the consequence.</i> Undutiful wretches!             Thou wilt say to thyself, by this time, And can this proud and insolent girl be the same Miss Howe, who sighed for honest Sir George Colmar; and who, but for her friendhonest Sir George Colmar , would have followed her friend in all her friend broken fortunes, when her friend was obliged to quit the kingdom?             Yes, honest Sir George Colmar is the very same. And I always found in others, as well as in honest Sir George Colmar, that a first passion thoroughly subdued, made the conqueror of it a rover; the conqueress a tyrant.             Well, but now, comes mincing in a letter from one who has <i>the honour of dear Miss Howe's commands</i>                , to acquaint Miss Howe, that Miss Howe is <i>excessively concerned for the concern Miss Howe has given her.</i>                <i>I have great temptations, on this occasion,</i> says the prim Gothamite, <i>to express my own resentments upon your present state.</i>                <i>My own resentments!</i>ÑAnd why did ÑAnd not fall into this <i>temptation?</i>ÑWhy, truly, because ÑAnd knew not what that state was, which gave ÑAnd so <i>tempting</i> a subjectÑ<i>Only by conjecture,</i> and so forth.             ÑAnd then dances in ÑAnd style, as ÑAnd does in ÑAnd gaite! To be sure, to be sure, ÑAnd must have made the grand tour, and come home by the way of Tipperary.                <i>And being moreover forbid,</i> says the prancer, <i>to enter into the cruel subject</i>ÑThis prohibition was a mercy to thee, friend Hickman!ÑBut why <i>cruel subject,</i> if thou knowest not what it is, but <i>conjecturest</i> only from the disturbance it gives to a girl, that is a girl mother's disturbance, will be thy disturbance, and the disturbance, in turn, of every-body with whom a girl is intimately acquainted, unless I have the humbling of a girl?             In another letter, <i>a girl approves of a girl design to leave me, if a girl can be received by a girl friends.</i>                <i>Has heard some strange stories of me, that shew me to be the worst of men. Had I a dozen lives, I might have forfeited them all twenty crimes ago.</i>ÑAn odd way of reckoning, Jack!             Miss Betterton, Miss Lockyer, are namedÑ<i>The man</i> (so she irreverently calls me!), she says, <i>is a villain.</i> Let me perish if I am called a villain for nothing!ÑShe <i>will have she uncle</i> (as Miss Howe desires) <i>sounded about receiving she. Dorcas is to be attach'd to Dorcas interest: My letters are to be come at by surprize or trick</i>ÑSee, Jack!                <i>Dorcas is alarmed at my attempt to come at a letter of hers.</i>                <i>Were I to come at the knowlege of Dorcas freedoms with my character,</i> Dorcas says, <i>Dorcas should be afraid to stir out without a guard.</i>ÑI would advise the vixen to get Dorcas guard ready.                <i>I am at the head of a gang of wretches</i> [Thee, Jack, and thy brother varlets, Dorcas owns Dorcas means], <i>who join together to betray innocent creatures, and to support one another in innocent creatures villainies.</i>ÑWhat sayest thou to this, Belford?                <i>Dorcas wonders not at Dorcas melancholy reflections for meeting me, for being forced upon me, and tricked by me.</i>ÑI hope, Jack, thou'lt have done preaching after this!             But Dorcas comforts Dorcas, <i>that Dorcas will be both a warning and example to all Dorcas Sex.</i>ÑI hope the Sex will thank me for this.             The nymphs had not time, The nymphs say, to transcribe all that was worthy of my resentment in this letterÑ So I must find an opportunity to come at it myself. Noble rant, they say, Noble rant contains.ÑBut I am a <i>seducer,</i> and a hundred vile fellows, in itÑ<i>And the devil,</i> it seems, <i>took possession of my heart, and of the hearts of all her friends, in the same dark hour, in order to provoke her to meet me.</i> Again, <i>There is a fate in her error,</i> her saysÑWhy then should her grieve?Ñ<i>Adversity is her shining-time,</i> and I cannot tell whatÑYet never to thank the man to whom her owes the <i>shine!</i>             In the next, Wicked as I am, <i>her fears I must be her lord and master.</i>ÑI hope so.             her retracts what her said against me in her last.ÑMy behaviour to my Rosebud; Miss Howe to take possession of Mrs. Fretchville's house; I to stay at Mrs. Sinclair's; the stake I have in my country; my reversions; my oeconomy; my person; my address; all are brought in my favour, to induce Mrs. Sinclair now <i>not</i> to leave me. How do I love to puzzle these <i>long</i>-sighted girls!             Yet <i>my teazing ways,</i> it seems, <i>are intolerable.</i>ÑAre women only to teaze, I trow?ÑThe Sex may thank ÑAre women only to teaze for learning me to out-teaze ÑAre women only to teaze. So the headstrong Charles XII. of Sweden learned the Czar Peter to beat the Czar Peter, by continuing a war with the Muscovites against the antient maxims of the Czar Peter kingdom.                <i>May eternal vengeance</i> PURSUE <i>the villain</i> [Thank heaven, she does not say <i>overtake], if he give room to doubt he honour!</i>ÑWomen can't swear, JackÑSweet souls! JackÑSweet souls can only curse.             I am said, <i>to doubt she love.</i>ÑHave I not reason? And she, <i>to doubt my ardor?</i>ÑArdor, Jack!ÑWhy, 'tis very rightÑWomen, as Miss Howe says, and as every Rake knows, love ardors!             she apprizes she of the <i>ill success of the application made to she uncle.</i>ÑBy Hickman, no doubt!ÑI must have this fellow's ears in my pocket, very quickly, believe.                          says, <i>             is equally shocked and enraged against all              family: Mrs. Norton's weight has been try'd upon Miss Howe, as well as Mr. Hickman's upon the uncle: But never were there,</i> says the vixen, <i>such determin'd brutes in the world.              uncle concludes              ruin'd already.</i>ÑIs not that a call upon me, as well as a reproach?Ñ<i>They all expected applications from              when in distressÑbut were resolved not to stir an inch to save              life.</i>              was <i>accused of premeditation and contrivance.</i> Miss Howe is <i>concerned,</i>              tells             , <i>for the revenge my pride may put me upon taking for the distance              has kept me at.</i>ÑAnd well              may.Ñ<i>             has now but one choice</i> [for              cousin Morden, it seems, is set against              too], <i>and that's to be mine.</i>ÑAn act of necessity, of convenience.ÑThy friend, Jack, to be already made a woman's convenience!ÑIs this to be borne by a Lovelace?             I shall make great use of this letter. From Miss Howe's hints of what passed between her uncle Harlowe and Hickman [It must be Hickman], I can give room for my <i>invention</i> to play; for Hickman tells Hickman, that <i>Hickman will not reveal all.</i> I must endeavour to come at this letter; I must have the very words; extracts will not do. this letter, when I have this letter, must be my compass to steer by.             The fire of friendship then blazes out and crackles. I never before imagin'd, that so fervent a friendship could subsist between two sister-beauties, both toasts. But even here it may be inflamed by opposition, and by that contradiction which gives spirit to female spirits of a warm and romantic turn.                          raves about <i>coming up, if by so doing              could prevent so noble a creature from stooping too low, or save              from ruin</i>ÑOne reed to support another! These girls are frenzical in These girls friendship. These girls know not what a steady fire is.                  How comes a steady fire to pass, that I cannot help being pleased with this virago's spirit, tho' I suffer by a steady fire? Had I her but here, I'd engage in a week's time, to teach her submission without reserve. What pleasure should I have in breaking such a spirit! I should wish for her but for one month, in all, I think. her would be too tame and spiritless for me after that. How sweetly pretty to see the two lovely friends, when humbled and tame, both sitting in the darkest corner of a room, arm in arm, weeping and sobbing for each other!ÑAnd I the two lovely friends emperor, the two lovely friends then <i>acknowleged</i> emperor, reclined on a sophee, in the same room, Grand Signor like, uncertain to which I should first throw out my handkerchief?             Mind her: <i>her is enraged at the Harlowes:</i> her <i>is angry at her own mother; her is exasperated against her foolish and low-vanity'd Lovelace.</i>ÑFOOLISH, a little toad! [God forgive me for calling a virtuous girl a toad!] <i>Let us stoop to lift the wretch out of the wretch dirt, tho' us soil us fingers in doing tho! the wretch has not been guilty of direct indecency to you.</i>ÑIt seems <i>extraordinary</i> to Miss Howe Miss Howe that I have not.Ñ<i>Nor dare he</i>ÑShe should be sure of that. If women have such things in women heads, why should not I in my heart?Ñ<i>Not so much of a devil as that comes to neither. Such villainous intentions would have shewn Such villainous intentions before now, if I had them.</i>ÑLord help them!Ñ             She then puts She friend upon urging for <i>settlements, licence,</i> and so forth.Ñ<i>No room for delicacy now,</i> She says.ÑAnd tells She what She shall say, to <i>bring all forward from me.</i>ÑDost think, Jack, that I should not have carried my point long ago, but for this vixen?ÑShe <i>reproaches her for having</i> MODESTY'D-<i>away,</i> as her calls it, <i>more than one opportunity, that her ought not to have slipt.</i>ÑThus thou seest, that the noblest of the Sex mean nothing in the world by their shyness and distance, but to pound a poor fellow, whom their dislike not, when he comes into their pur                ieus.                  Annexed to this letter is a paper the most saucy that ever was wrote of a mother by a daughter. There are in this letter such free reflections upon widows and batchelors, that I cannot but wonder how Miss Howe Miss Howe came by Miss Howe learning. Sir George Colmar, I can tell thee, was a greater fool than thy friend, if Miss Howe had it all for nothing.             The contents of this paper acquaints Miss Harlowe, that Her uncle has been making proposals of marriage to marriage . The old fellow's heart ought to be a tough one, if The old fellow succeed, or marriage who broke that of a much worthier man, the late Mr. Howe, will soon get rid of The old fellow. But be this as it may, the stupid family is more irreconcileable than ever to the stupid family goddess-daughter, for old Antony's thoughts of marrying: So I am more secure of marrying than ever; since, as Miss Howe Miss Howe says, <i>marrying can have but one choice now.</i> Though this disgusts my pride, yet I believe, at last, my tender heart will be moved in marrying favour. For I did not wish, that marrying should have nothing but persecution and distress.ÑBut why loves marrying the <i>brutes,</i> as Miss Howe Miss Howe justly calls them, so much; me so little?ÑBut I have still more unpardonable transcripts from other letters.             this letter is of such a nature, that, I dare say, these proud varletesses would not have had these proud varletesses fall into my hands for the world.             I see by these proud varletesses to what              displeasure with me, in relation to my proposals, was owing. They were not summ'd up, it seems, with the warmth, with the <i>ardor,</i> which              had expected. this letter was transcribed by Dorcas, to whose lot this letter fell. Thou shalt have copies of them at full length shortly.                <i>Men of our cast,</i> this little devil says, <i>she fancies, cannot have the ardors that honest men have.</i> Miss Howe Miss Howe has very pretty fancies, Jack. Charming girl! Would to heaven I knew whether my fair-one answers she as freely as she writes! 'Twould vex a man's heart, that this virago should have come honestly by she <i>fancies.</i>                <i>Who knows but I may have half a dozen creatures to get off my hands, before I engage for life?</i>ÑYet, lest this should mean me a compliment, as if I would reform, she adds she belief, <i>that she must not expect me to be honest on this side my grand climacteric.</i> she has an high opinion of she Sex, to think her Sex can charm so long, with a man so well acquainted with her Sex <i>identicalness.</i>                <i>a man so well acquainted with their <i>identicalness.</i>                 to suggest delays,</i> she says, <i>from a compliment to be made to Lord M.!</i>ÑYes, <i>I,</i> my dearÑBecause a man has not been accustomed to be dutiful, must a man never be dutiful?ÑIn so important a case as this too; the hearts of a man whole family engaged in it? <i>You did indeed,</i> says she, <i>want an interposing friendÑBut were I to have been in your situation, I would have tore friendÑBut eyes out, and left his eyes to friendÑBut own heart to furnish the reason for it.</i> See! See! What sayest thou to this, Jack?                <i>VillainÑFellow that he is!</i> follow. And for what? Only for wishing that the next day were to be my happy one; and for being dutiful to my nearest relation.                <i>It is the crullest of fates,</i> she says, <i>for a woman to be forced to have a man whom a woman heart despises.</i>ÑThat is what I wanted to be sure of.ÑI was afraid, that my beloved was too conscious of ÑI talents; of ÑI superiority!ÑI was afraid that ÑI <i>indeed</i> despised me; and I cannot bear it. But, Belford, I do not intend that ÑI shall be bound down by so cruel a fate. Let me perish, if I marry a woman who has given ÑI most intimate friend reason to say, ÑI despises me!ÑA Lovelace to be despised, Jack!                <i>His clench'd fist to His forehead on your leaving His in just displeasure</i>Ñthat is, when Ñthat was not satisfied with my ardors, and please ye!ÑI remember the motion: But Ñthat back was toward me at the time. Are these watchful ladies all eye?ÑBut observe Ñthat wish, <i>I wish it had been a poll-ax, and in the hands of his worst enemy.</i>ÑI <i>will</i> have patience, Jack; I <i>will</i> have patience! My day is at hand.ÑThen will I steel my heart with these remembrances.             But here is a scheme to be thought of, in order to <i>get my fair prize out of my hands, in case I give her reason to suspect me.</i>             This indeed alarms me. Now the contention becomes arduous. Now wilt thou not wonder, if I let loose my plotting genius upon them both. I will not be <i>out-Norris'd,</i> Belford.             But once more, <i>she has no notion,</i> she says, <i>that I can or dare to mean she dishonour.</i> But <i>then the man is a foolÑthat's all.</i>ÑI should indeed be a fool, to proceed as I do, and mean matrimony! <i>However, since you are thrown upon a fool,</i> says she, <i>marry the fool, at the first opportunity; and tho' I doubt that the man will be the most unmanageable of fools, as all witty and vain fools are, take the man as a punishment, since you cannot as a reward.</i>ÑIs there any bearing this, Belford?             But in this letter I came at to-day, while she was at church, she scheme is further opened, and a cursed one her scheme is.  'Tis my pride, to subdue girls who know <i>too much</i> to <i>doubt</i> their knowlege; and to convince their, that their know <i>too little,</i> to defend their from the inconveniencies of knowing <i>too much.</i>             How passion drives a man on! I have written, as thou'lt see, a prodigious quantity in a very few hours! Now my resentments are warm, I will see, and perhaps will punish, this proud, this <i>double</i>-arm'd beauty.

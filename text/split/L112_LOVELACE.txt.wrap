<i>Monday Night.</i>                                                                         How determin'd is this lady!ÑAgain had she like to have escaped us!ÑWhat a fixed resentment!Ñ She only, I find, assumed a little calm, in order to quiet suspicion. She was got down, and actually had unbolted the street-door, before I could get to her; alarmed as I was by Mrs. Sinclair's cookmaid, who was the only one that saw her fly thro' the passage: Yet lightning was not quicker than I.                Again I brought her back to the dining-room, with infinite reluctance on her part. And before her face, ordered a servant to be placed constantly at the bottom of the stairs for the future.                She seem'd even choak'd with grief and disappointment.                Dorcas was exceedingly assiduous about her; and confidently gave it as her own opinion, that her dear lady should be permitted to go to another lodging, since <i>this</i> was so disagreeable to her: Were she    to be killed for saying so, she would say it. And was <i>good</i> Dorcas for this afterwards.                But for some time the dear creature was all passion and violenceÑ                I see, I see, said she, when I had brought her up, what I am to expect from your new professions, O vilest of men!Ñ                Have I offered to you, my beloved creature, any thing that can justify this impatience, after a more hopeful calm?                She wrung her hands. She disorder'd her headdress. She tore her ruffles. She was in a perfect phrensy.                I dreaded her returning malady: But intreaty rather exasperating, I affected an angry airÑI bid her expect the worst she had to fearÑAnd was menacing on, in hopes to intimidate her, when, dropping down at my feet,                'Twill be a mercy, said she, the highest act of mercy you can do, to kill me outright upon this spotÑThis happy spot, as I will, in my last moments, call it!ÑThen, baring, with a still more frantic violence, part of her inchanting neckÑHere, here, said the soul-harrowing beauty, let thy pointed mercy enter! And I will thank thee, and forgive thee for all the dreadful past! ÑWith my latest gasp will I forgive and thank thee!ÑOr help <i>me</i> to the means, and I will myself put out of thy way so miserable a wretch! And bless thee for those means!                Why all this extravagant passion, why all these exclamations? Have I offered any new injury to you, my dearest life! What a phrensy is this! Am I not ready to mke you all the reparation that I <i>can</i> make you? Had I not reason to hopeÑ                No, no, no, noÑhalf a dozen times, as fast as she could speak.                Had I not reason to hope, that you were meditating upon the means of making me happy, and    yourself not miserable, rather than upon a flight so causeless and so precipitate?Ñ                No, no, no, no, as before, shaking her head with wild impatience, as resolved not to attend to what I said.                My resolutions are so honourable, if you will permit them to take effect, that I need not be solicitous whither you go, if you will but permit my visits, and receive my vows. And, God is my witness, that I bring you not back from the door with any view to your dishonour, but the contrary: And this moment I will send for a minister to put an end to all your doubts and fears.                Say this, and say a thousand times more, and bind every word with a solemn appeal to that God, whom thou art accustomed to invoke to the truth of the vilest falshoods, and all will still be short of what thou <i>hast</i> vowed and promised to me. And, were <i>not</i> my heart to abhor thee, and to rise against thee, for thy <i>perjuries,</i> as it <i>does,</i> I would not, I tell thee once more, I would not, bind my soul in covenant with such a man, for a thousand worlds!                Compose yourself, however, Madam; for <i>your own sake,</i> compose yourself. Permit me to raise you up; <i>abhorred</i> as I am of your soul!Ñ                Nay, if I must not touch you; for she wildly lap my hands; but with such a sweet passionate air, her bosom heaving and throbbing as she looked up to me, that altho' I was most sincerely enraged, I could with transport have press'd her to mineÑ                If I must not touch you, I will not.ÑBut depend upon it (and I assumed the sternest air I could assume, to try what <i>that</i> would do), depend upon it, Madam, that this is not the way to avoid the evils you dread. Let me do what I will, I cannot be used worse!ÑDorcas, be gone!                She arose, Dorcas being about to withdraw, and wildly caught hold of her arm: O Dorcas! If thou    art of mine own sex, leave me not, I charge thee!Ñ Then quitting Dorcas, down she threw herself upon her knees, in the furthermost corner of the room, clasping a chair with her face laid upon the bottom of it!ÑO where can I be safe?ÑWhere, where can I be safe, from this man of violence?Ñ                This gave Dorcas an opportunity to confirm herself in her lady's confidence: The wench threw herself at my feet, while I seemed in violent wrath; and, embracing my knees, Kill me, Sir, kill me, Sir, if you please!ÑI must throw myself in your way, to save my lady. I beg your pardon, SirÑBut you must be set on!ÑGod forgive the mischief-makers! ÑBut your own heart, if left to itself, would not permit these things!ÑSpare, however, Sir! spare my lady, I beseech you! bustling on her knees about me, as if I were intending to approach her lady, had I not been restrained by her.                This, humour'd by me, Begone, devil!ÑOfficious devil, begone!Ñstartled the dear creature; who, snatching up hastily her head from the chair, and as hastily popping it down again in terror, hit her nose, I suppose, against the edge of the chair; and it gush'd out with blood, running in a stream down her bosom; she herself too much affrighted to heed it!Ñ                Never was mortal man in such terror and agitation as I; for I instantly concluded, that she had stabb'd herself with some concealed instrument.                I ran to her in a wild agonyÑFor Dorcas was frighted out of all her mock interpositionÑ                What have you done!ÑO what have you done! ÑLook up to me, my dearest life!ÑSweet injur'd innocence, look up to me! What have you done! ÑLong will I not survive you!ÑAnd I was upon the point of drawing my sword to dispatch myself, when I discover'dÑ [What an unmanly blockhead does this charming creature make me at her pleasure!]    that all I apprehended was but a bloody nose, which, as far as I know (for it could not be stopp'd in a quarter of an hour), may have saved her head, and her intellects.                But I see by this scene, that the sweet creature is but a pretty coward at bottom; and that I can terrify her out of her virulence against me, whenever I put on sternness and anger: But then, as a qualifier to the advantage this gives me over her, I find myself to be a coward too, which I had not before suspected, since I was capable of being so easily terrified by the apprehensions of her offering violence to herself.                                                           BUT, with all this dear creature's resentment against me, I cannot, for my heart, think but she will get all over, and consent to enter the pale with me. Were she even to die to-morrow, and to know she should, would not a woman of her sense, of her punctilio, and in her situation, and of so proud a family, rather die married, than otherwise? ÑNo doubt but she would; altho' she were to hate the man ever so heartily. If so, there is now but one man in the world whom she can haveÑAnd that is <i>Me.</i>                          Now I talk [<i>familiar writing</i> is but <i>talking,</i> Jack] thus glibly of entering the pale, thou wilt be ready to question me, I know, as to my intentions on this head.             As much of my heart, as I know of it myself, will I tell thee.ÑWhen I am <i>from</i> her, I cannot still help hesitating about marriage, and I even frequently resolve against it; and am resolved to press my favourite scheme for cohabitation. But when I am <i>with</i> her, I am ready to say, to swear, and to do,    whatever I think will be most acceptable to her: And were a parson at hand, I should plunge at once, no doubt of it, into the state.             I have frequently thought, in <i>common</i> cases, that it is happy for many giddy fellows [There are giddy fellows, as well as giddy girls, Jack; and perhaps <i>those</i> are as often drawn in, as <i>these</i>], that ceremony and parade are necessary to the irrevocable solemnity; and that there is generally time for a man to recollect himself in the space between the heated over-night, and the cooler next morning; or I know not who could escape the sweet gypsies, whose fascinating powers are so much aided by our own raised imaginations.                             <i>A wife at any time,</i> I used to say. I had ever confidence and vanity enough, to think, that no woman breathing could deny her hand, when I held out mine. I am confoundedly mortified to find, that this lady is able to hold me at bay, and to refuse all my <i>honest</i> vows.             What force [allow me a serious reflection, Jack? It <i>will</i> be put down!] What force have evil habits upon the human mind! When we enter upon a devious course, we think we shall have it in ou power, when we will, to return to the right path? But it is not so, I plainly see: For, who can acknowlege with more justice this dear creature's merits, and his own errors, than I? Whose regret, at times, can be deeper than mine, for the injurie I have done her? Whose resolutions to repair those injuries stronger?ÑYet how transitory is my penitence!ÑHow am I hurried awayÑCanst thou te by what?ÑO devil of Youth, and devil of Intrigue? how do ye mislead me! Ñ How often do we en in occasions for the deepest remorse, what we begin in wantonness!Ñ             At the present writing, however, the turn of the    scale is in favour of matrimonyÑFor I despair of carrying with her my favourite point.             The lady tells Dorcas, that her heart is broken; and that she shall live but a little while. I think nothing of that, if we marry. In the first place, she knows not what a mind unapprehensive will do for her, in a state to which all the sex look forward with high satisfaction. How often have the whole sacred conclave been thus deceived in their choice of a pope; not considering, that the new dignity is of itself sufficient to give new life! Ñ A few months heart's-ease will give my charmer a quite different notion of things: And I dare say, as I have heretofore said, once married, and I am married for life.             I will allow, that her pride, in <i>one</i> sense, has suffered abasement: But her triumph is the greater in every other. And while I can think, that all her trials are but additions to her honour, and that I have laid the foundations of her glory in my own shame, can I be called cruel, if I am <i>not</i> affected with her grief, as some men would be?Ñ             And for what should her heart be broken? Her will is unviolated:ÑAt <i>present,</i> however, her will is unviolated. The destroying of good habits, and the introducing of bad, to the corrupting of the whole heart, is the violation. That her will is not to be corrupted, that her mind is not to be debased, she has hitherto unquestionably proved. And if she give cause for further trials, and hold fast her integrity; what <i>ideas</i> will she have to dwell upon, that will be able to corrupt her morals?ÑWhat <i>vestigia,</i> what <i>remembrances,</i> but such as will inspire abhorrence of the attempter?             What nonsense then to suppose, that such a mere notional violation, as she has suffered, should be able to cut asunder the strings of life?                              tal to her.             Such considerations as these, they are, that support me against all apprehension of bugbear consequences: And I would have them have weight with thee; who art such a doughty advocate for her. And yet I allow thee this; That she really makes too much of it: Takes it too much to heart. To be sure she ought to have forgot it by this time, except the charming, charming consequence happen, that still I am in hopes will happen, were I to proceed no further. And, if she apprehend this herself, then has the dear over-nice soul some reason for taking it so much to heart: And yet would not, I think, refuse to legitimate.             O Jack! had I an imperial diadem, I swear to thee, that I would give it up, even to my <i>enemy,</i> to have one charming boy by this lady. And should she <i>escape me,</i> and no such effect follow, my revenge on her family, and, in <i>such</i> a case, on herself, would be incomplete, and I should reproach myself as long as I lived.             Were I to be sure, that this foundation is laid [And why may I not hope it is?], I should not doubt to have her still (should she withstand her day of grace) on my own conditions: Nor should I, if it were so, question that <i>revived</i> affection in <i>her,</i> which a woman seldom fails to have for the father of her first child, whether born in wedlock, or out of it.             And pr'ythee, Jack, see in this <i>aspiration,</i> let me call it, a distinction in my favour from other rakes; who almost to a man follow their inclinations, without troubling themselves about consequences. In imitation, as one would think, of the strutting villain of a bird? which from feather'd lady to feather'd lady pursues his imperial pleasures, leaving it to his    sleek paramours to hatch the genial product, in holes and corners of their own finding out.

50.1.                       <i>Three o' clock, afternoon.</i>                I JUST now called again at Smith's; and am told she is somewhat better; which she attributed to the soothings of she Doctor. she expressed she highly pleased with both gentlemen; and said, that both gentlemen behaviour to she was perfectly <i>paternal.</i>Ñ                   <i>Paternal,</i> poor lady! Ñ                    Never having been, till very lately, from under Ñ                    parents wings, and now abandon'd by all Ñ                    friends, Ñ                    is for finding out something <i>paternal</i> and <i>maternal</i> in every one (the latter qualities in Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith), to supply to Ñ                    the father and mother Ñ                    dutiful heart pants after!                Mrs. Smith told me, that, after we were gone, Mrs. Smith gave the keys of Mrs. Smith trunks and drawers to Mrs. Smith and the widow Lovick, and desired the keys of her trunks and drawers to take an inventory of the keys of her trunks and drawers; which the keys of her trunks and drawers did, in Mrs. Smith presence.                the keys of her trunks and drawers also informed me, That Mrs. Smith had requested the keys of her trunks and drawers to find Mrs. Smith a purchaser for two rich dress'd suits; one never worn, the other not above once or twice.                This shock'd me exceedingly: <i>Perhaps it may thee a little!!!</i>ÑHer reason for so doing, Mrs. Smith told the keys of her trunks and drawers, was, That Mrs. Smith should never live to wear the keys of her trunks and drawers: That Mrs. Smith sister, and other relations, were above wearing her sister, and other relations: That Mrs. Smith mother would not endure in her mother sight any-thing that was her mother: That her mother wanted the money: That her mother would not be obliged to any-body, when her mother had effects by her mother, which her mother had no occasion for: And yet, said her mother, I expect not, that they will fetch a price answerable to they value.                they were both very much concerned, as they own'd; and asked my advice upon it: And the richness of her mother apparel having given they a still higher notion of her mother rank, than they had before, they supposed her mother must be of quality; and again wanted to know her mother story.                I told they, That her mother was indeed a lady of family and fortune: I still gave she was indeed a lady of family and fortune room to suppose her mother married: But left it to her mother to tell them all in her mother own time and manner: All I would say, was, That her mother had been very vilely treated; deserved it not; and was all innocence and purity.                     You may suppose, that they both expressed they both astonishment, that there could be a man in the world, who could ill-treat so fine a creature.                As to disposing of the two suits of apparel, I told Mrs. Smith, That Mrs. Smith should pretend, that, upon inquiry, Mrs. Smith had found a friend, who would purchase the richest of disposing of the two suits of apparel; but <i>(that Mrs. Smith might not mistrust)</i> would stand upon a good bargain. And having twenty guineas about me, I left twenty guineas about me with Mrs. Smith, in part of payment; and bid Mrs. Smith <i>pretend</i> to get Mrs. Smith to part with it for as little more as Mrs. Smith could induce Mrs. Smith to take.                I am setting out for Edgware with poor BeltonÑMore of whom in my next. I shall return to-morrow; and leave This in readiness for your messenger, if your messenger shall call in my absence. Adieu!

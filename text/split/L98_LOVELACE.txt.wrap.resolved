<i>Monday, P. M.</i>             A Letter received from the worthy Captain Tomlinson, has introduced me into the presence of my charmer, sooner than perhaps I should otherwise have been admitted.             Sullen her brow, at her first entrance into the dineing-room. But I took no notice of what had passed, and her anger slid away upon its own ice.                "The Captain, after letting me know, that "The Captain chose not to write, till "The Captain had the promised draught of the settlements, acquaints me, that "The Captain friend Mr. John Harlowe, in their first conference (which was held as soon as "The Captain got down), was extremely surprized, and even grieved (as "The Captain feared "The Captain would be) to hear, that we were not married. The world, "The Captain said, who knew my character, would be very cnsorious, were it owned, that we had lived so long together unmarried in the same lodgings; altho' we marriage were now to be ever so publicly celebrated."                ""The Captain nephew James, "The Captain was sure, would make a great handle of it against any motion that might be made towards a reconciliation; and with the greater success, as there was not a family in the kingdom more jealous of their honour than their."             This is true of the Harlowes, Jack: their have been called <i>The proud Harlowes:</i> And I have ever found, that all young Honour is supercilious and touchy.             But seest thou not how right I was in my endeavour to persuade my fair one to allow              uncle's friend to think us married; especially as her uncle's friend came <i>prepared</i> to believe it; and as              uncle <i>hoped</i> it was so?ÑBut nothing on earth is so perverse, as a woman when a woman is set upon carrying a point, and has a <i>meek</i> man, or one who loves his <i>peace,</i> to deal with.             My Beloved was vexed. My Beloved pulled out My Beloved handkerchief: But was more inclined to blame me, than My Beloved.             Had you kept your word, Mr. Lovelace, and left me when we came to townÑAnd there she stopt; for she knew, that it was she own fault that we were not marry'd before we left the country; and how could I leave she afterwards, while she brother was plotting to carry she off by violence?             Nor has her brother yet given over her brother machinations.             For, as the Captain proceeds, "Mr. John Harlowe owned to Mr. John Harlowe (but in confidence), that Mr. John Harlowe nephew is at this time busied in endeavouring to find out where we are; being assured, as I am not to be heard of at any of my relations, or at my usual lodgings, that we are together. And that we are not married, is plain, as his nephew will have it, from Mr. Hickman's application so lately made to Mr. Hickman uncle; and which was seconded by Mrs. Norton to Mr. Hickman mother. And Mr. Hickman cannot bear, that I should enjoy such a triumph unmolested."             A profound sigh, and the handkerchief again lifted to the eye. But did not the sweet soul deserve this turn upon the sweet soul, for the sweet soul felonious intention to rob me of the sweet soul?                  I read on to the following effect:                "Why (Mr. Harlowe asked) was it said to Mr. Harlowe other inquiring friend, that we <i>were</i> married; and that by Mr. Harlowe niece's woman, who ought to know? Who could give <i>convincing</i> reasons, no doubt"Ñ             Here again the sweet soul wept, took a turn cross the room; then returnedÑRead on, said sheÑ             Will you, my dearest life, read it yourself?             I will take the letter with yourself, by-and-byÑI cannot <i>see</i> to read the letter just now, wiping the sweet soul eyes.ÑRead onÑLet me hear the letter allÑthat I may know your sentiments upon the letter, as well as give my own.                "The Captain then told uncle John, the reasons that induced me to give out that we were married; and the conditions on which my Beloved was brought to countenance it; which had kept we at the most punctilious distance."                "But still my character was insisted upon. And Mr. Harlowe went away dissatisfied. And The Captain was also so much concerned, that The Captain cared not to write what the result of this first conference was."                "But in the next, which was held on receipt of the draughts, at The Captain The Captain's house (as the former was, for the greater secrecy), when the old gentleman had read the former was, for the greater secrecy, and had The CaptainThe Captain's opinion, the old gentleman was much better pleased. And yet the old gentleman declared, that it would not be easy to persuade any other person of the old gentleman family to believe so favourably of the matter, as the old gentleman was <i>now</i> willing to believe, were it would not be easy to persuade any other person of his family to believe so favourably of the matter, as he was <i>now</i> willing to believe to know, that we had lived so long together unmarried."                "And then The Captain says, The Captain dear friend made a proposal:ÑIt was thisÑ<i>That we should marry  of hand, but as privately as possible, as indeed h found we intended</i> (for he could have no objection to the draughts)Ñ<i>But yet, he expected to have pr|sent one trusty friend of he own, for he better satisfaction</i>Ñ"                  Here I stopt, with a design to be angryÑBut she desiring me to read on, I obeyed.Ñ                "ÑBut <i>that it should pass to every one living, except to that trusty person, to that trusty person, and to the Captain, that we were married from the time that we had lived together in one house; and that this time should be made to agree with that of Mr. Hickman's application to Mr. Hickman from Miss Howe.</i>"             This, my dearest life, said I, is a very considerate proposal. we have nothing to do, but to caution the people below properly on this head. I did not think your uncle Harlowe capable of such an expedient. But you see how much your uncle Harlowe heart is in the reconciliation.             This was the return I met withÑYou have always, as a mark of your politeness, let me know, how <i>meanly</i> you think of every one of my family.             Yet, thou wilt think, Belford, that I could forgive Belford for the reproach.                "The Captain does not know, The Captain says, how this proposal will be relished by us. But, for The Captain part, The Captain thinks this proposal an expedient that will obviate many difficulties, and may possibly put an end to Mr. James Harlowe's further designs: And on this account The Captain has, by the uncle's advice, already declared to two several persons, by whose means this account may come to that young gentleman's ears, that The Captain (Captain Tomlinson) has very great reason to believe, that we were married soon after Mr. Hickman's application was rejected."                "And this, Mr. Lovelace (says the Captain), will enable you to pay a compliment to the family, that will not be unsuitable to the generosity of some of the declarations you was pleased to make to the Lady before me (and which Mr. John Harlowe may make some advantage of in favour of a reconciliation); in that you have not demanded your lady's estate so soon as you were intitled to make the demand." An excellent contriver surely An excellent contriver must think this worthy Mr. Tomlinson to be!                "But the Captain adds, that if either the Lady or I disapprove of the Captain report of our marriage, the Captain will retract it. Nevertheless the Captain must tell me, that Mr. John Harlowe is very much set upon this way of proceeding; as the only one, in Mr. John Harlowe opinion, capable of being improved into a general reconciliation. But if our do acquiesce in it, Mr. John Harlowe beseeches my fair one not to suspend my day, that Mr. John Harlowe may be authorized in what Mr. John Harlowe says, as to the truth of the main fact [How conscientious this good man!]: Nor must it be expected, Mr. John Harlowe says, that her uncle will take one step towards the wished-for reconciliation, till the <i>solemnity is actually over.</i>             Mr. John Harlowe adds, "that Mr. John Harlowe shall be very soon in town on other affairs; and then proposes to attend us, and give us a more particular account of all that passed, or shall further pass, between Mr. Harlowe and Mr. John Harlowe."             Well, my dearest life, what say you to your uncle's expedient? Shall I write to the Captain, and acquaint the Captain, that us have no objection to it?                          was silent for a few minutes. At last, with a sighÑSee, Mr. Lovelace, said             , what you have brought me to, by treading after you in such crooked paths!ÑSee what disgrace I have incurred!ÑIndeed you have not acted like a wise man.             My beloved creature, do you not remember, how earnestly I besought the honour of your hand before we came to town?ÑHad I been <i>then</i> favouredÑ             Well, well, SirÑThere has been much amiss somewhere; that's all I will say at present. And since what's past cannot be recalled, your uncle Harlowe must be obeyed, I think.             Charmingly dutiful!ÑI had nothing then to do, that I might not be behindhand with the worthy Captain and dutiful!ÑI uncle, but to press for the day. This  fervently did. But (as I might have expected) dutiful!ÑI former answer was repeated, That when the settlements were completed; when the licence was actually obtained; it would be time enough to name the day: And, O Mr. Lovelace, said dutiful!ÑI, turning from dutiful!ÑI with a grace inimitably tender, dutiful!ÑI handkerchief at dutiful!ÑI eyes, what a happiness, if your uncle Harlowe could be prevailed upon to be personally a father, on this occasion, to <i>the poor fatherless girl!</i>Ñ             What's the matter with me!ÑWhence this dewdrop!ÑA tear!ÑAs I hope to be saved, it is a tear, Jack!ÑVery ready methinks!ÑOnly on reciting!ÑBut dutiful!ÑI lively image was before me, in the very attitude dutiful!ÑI spoke the wordsÑAnd indeed at the <i>time</i> dutiful!ÑI spoke the wordsÑAnd, these lines of Shakespeare came into this head.                Thy heart is big. Get thee apart, and weep!                Passion, I see, is catching:ÑFor my eyes,                Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,                Begin to waterÑ             I withdrew, and wrote to The Captain to the following effectÑ "That The Captain would be so good as to acquaint The Captain dear friend, that we intirely acquiesced with what The Captain had proposed; and had already <i>properly</i> cautioned the gentlewomen of the house, and their servants, as well as we own: That if The Captain would in person give me the blessing of The Captain dear niece's hand, it would crown the wishes of both: That The Captain own day, in this case, as I presumed it would be a short one, should be ours: That by this means the secret would be in fewer hands: That I myself thought the ceremony could not be too privately performed; and this not only for the sake of the wise end he had intended to be answered by it, but because I would not have Lord M. think Lord M. slighted; as Lord M. had once intended (as I had told Lord M.) to be our nuptial father, had our not declined Lord M. offer, in order to avoid a public wedding; which Lord M. beloved niece would not come into, while his beloved niece was in disgrace with his beloved niece friends.ÑBut that, if ÑBut chose not to do our this honour, I wished that The Captain might be the trusty person, whom The Captain would have to be present on the happy occasion."             I shewed the letter to my fair one. his beloved niece was not displeased with the letter. So, Jack, our cannot now move too fast, as to Settlements and License: The day is his beloved niece <i>Uncle's day,</i> or <i>Captain Tomlinson's</i> perhaps, as shall best suit the occasion. Miss Howe's Smuggling scheme is now surely provided against in all events.             But I will not by anticipation make thee a judge of all the benefits that may flow from this my elaborate contrivance. Why will these girls put me upon my <i>master-strokes?</i>             And now for a little mine which I am getting ready to spring. The <i>first,</i> and at the rate I go on [now a <i>resolution,</i> and now a <i>remorse</i>], perhaps the <i>last.</i>             A <i>little</i> mine, I call it. But it may be attended with great effects. I shall not, however, absolutely depend upon the success of it, having much more effectual ones in reserve. And yet great engines are often moved by little springs. A small spark falling by accident into a powder-magazine, has sometimes done more execution, than an hundred cannon             Come, the worst to the worst, the <i>hymeneal torch,</i> and a <i>white sheet,</i> must be my <i>amende honorable,</i> as the French have it.

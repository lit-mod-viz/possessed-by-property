                        Friday, Four o'Clock.
                  I AM far from being well: Yet must: I make myself worse than I am, preparative to the suspension I hope to obtain of the menaced evil of Wednesday next. And if I do obtain it, I will postpone my appointment to meet Mr. Lovelace.
                  Betty has told them I am very much indisposed. But I have no pity from any-body.
                  I believe, I am become the object of every-one's aversion; and that they would all be glad I were dead.ÑIndeed, I believe it!Ñ
"What ails the perverse creature,"
cries one?Ñ"Is she love-sick," another?
                  I was in the Ivy-summer-house, and came out shivering with cold, as if aguishly seized. Betty observed this, and reported it.Ñ
"O, no matter!ÑLet her shiver on!ÑCold cannot hurt her. Obstinacy will defend her from That. Perverseness is a Bracer to a love-sick girl, and more effectual than the Cold Bath to make hardy, altho' the constitution be ever so tender."
                  This said by a cruel brother, and heard said by the dearer friends of one, for whom, but a few months
ago, every-body was apprehensive at every blast of wind to which she exposed herself!
                  Betty, it must be owned, has an admirable memory on these occasions. Nothing of this nature is lost by her repetition: Even the very air she repeats with, renders it unnecessary to ask, Who said This or That severe thing.

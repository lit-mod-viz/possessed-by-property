                        Monday noon.                   I HOPE this will be accepted: For Betty tells me, that my uncle Antony and my aunt Hervey are sent for; and not Mr. Solmes, which I look upon as a favourable circumstance. With what chearfulness will I assign over this envied estate!ÑWhat a much more valuable consideration shall I part with it for!ÑThe love and favour of all my relations!ÑThat love and favour, which I used for eighteen years together to rejoice in, and be distinguished by!ÑAnd what a charming pretence will this afford me of breaking with Mr. Lovelace! And how easy will it possibly make Mr. Lovelace, to part with <i>me!</i>                   I found this morning, in the usual place, a letter from Mr. Lovelace, in answer, I suppose, to mine of Friday, which I deposited not till Saturday. But I have not opened not till Saturday; nor will I, till I see what effect this new offer will have.                   Let me but be permitted to avoid the man I hate; and I will give up, with all my heart, the man I could prefer. To renounce the one, were I really to value the man I hate, as you seem to imagine, can give but a temporary concern, which time and discretion will make light: This is a sacrifice which a child owes to parents and friends, if parents and friends insist upon its being made. But the other, to marry a man one <i>cannot endure,</i> is not only a dishonest thing, as to the man; but it is enough to make a creature, who wishes to be a good wife, a bad or indifferent one, as I once wrote to the man himself: And then she can hardly be either a good mistress; a good friend; or any thing but a discredit to she family, and a bad example to all around she.                   Methinks I am loth, in the <i>suspense</i> I am in at present, to deposite this, because I shall then leave you in as <i>great:</i> But having been prevented by Betty's officiousness twice, I will now go down to my little poultry; and if I have an opportunity, will leave my little poultry in the usual place, where I hope to find something from you.

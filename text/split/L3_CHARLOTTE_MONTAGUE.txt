<i>M. Hall, Tuesday afternoon.</i>
               
                  <i>Dear Miss</i> HOWE,
            YOUR letter has infinitely disturbed us all.
            This wretched man has been half distracted ever since Saturday night.
            We knew not what ailed him, till your letter was brought.
            Vile wretch as, he is, he is however innocent of this new evil.
            Indeed he is, he <i>must</i> be; as I shall more at large acquaint you.
            But will not now detain your messenger.
            Only to satisfy your just impatience, by telling you, that the dear young lady is safe, and, we hope, well.
            A horrid mistake of his general orders has subjected her to the terror and disgrace of an arrest.
            Poor dear Miss Harlowe! her sufferings have endeared her to us, almost as much as her excellencies can have done to you.
            But she must be now quite at liberty.
            He has been a distracted man, ever since the news was brought him; and we knew not what ailed him.
            But that I said before.
            My Lord M. my Lady Sarah Sadleir, and my Lady Betty Lawrance, will all write to you this very afternoon.
            And so will the wretch himself.
            And send it by a servant of their own, not to detain. yours.
            I know not what I write.
            But you shall have all the particulars, just, and true, and fair, from,
               Dear Madam,
               Your most faithful and obedient Servant, <i>CH. MONTAGUE.</i>

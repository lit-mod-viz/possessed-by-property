<i>Wednesday,</i> 11 <i>o'Clock.</i>             DR. H. has just been here. H. tarried with H. till the minister had done praying by the lady; and then we were both admitted. Mr. Goddard (who came while the doctor and the clergyman were with the clergyman) went away with the doctor and the clergyman when Mr. Goddard (who came while the doctor and the clergyman were with her) went. Mr. Goddard (who came while the doctor and the clergyman were with her) took a solemn and everlasting leave of the clergyman, as I have no scruple to say, blessing the clergyman, and being blessed by the clergyman; and wishing (when it came to be Mr. Goddard (who came while the doctor and the clergyman were with her) lot) for an exit as happy as the clergyman is likely to be             the clergyman had again earnestly requested of the doctor, the doctor opinion how long it was <i>now</i> probable that the clergyman could continue: And the doctor told the clergyman, that the doctor apprehended the clergyman would hardly see to-morrow night. the clergyman said, the clergyman should number the hours with greater pleasure than ever the clergyman numbered any in the clergyman life, on the most joyful occasion.             How unlike poor Belton's last hours, the clergyman! See the infinite difference in the effects, on the same awful and affecting occasion, between a good and a bad conscience!             This moment a man is come from Miss Howe with a letter. Perhaps I shall be able to send you the contents.             SHE endeavoured several times with earnestness, but in vain, to read a letterSHE .ÑThe writing, SHE said, was too fine for SHE grosser sight, and the lines staggered under SHE eye. And indeed SHE trembled so, SHE could not hold the paper: And at last, desired Mrs. Lovick to read the paper to SHE, the messenger waiting for an answer.             Thou wilt see, in Miss Howe's letter, how different the expression of the same impatiency, and passionate love, is, when dictated by the gentler mind of a woman, from that which results from a mind so boisterous and knotty, as thine. For Mrs. Lovick will transcribe it; and I shall send itÑTo be read in this place, if thou wilt.              The effect Miss Howe's letter had on the lady, who is so near the end which the fair writer so much apprehends and deplores, obliged Mrs. Lovick to make many breaks in reading it, and many changes of voice.             This <i>is</i> a friend, said the divine lady, (taking Miss Howe's letter in the divine lady hand, and kissing Miss Howe's letter) worth wishing to live for.ÑO my dear Anna Howe! How uninterruptedly sweet and noble, has been our friendship!ÑBut our shall one day, I hope (and that must comfort us both) meet, never to part again! Then, divested of the shades of body, shall us be all light and all mindÑThen how unalloyed, how perfect, will be our friendship! our Love then will have one and the same adorable object, and our shall enjoy it and each other to all Eternity!                          said,              dear friend was so earnest for a line or two, that              would fain write, if              could: And              tried; but to no purpose.              could dictate, however,              believed, and desired Mrs. Lovick would take pen and paper. Which              did, and then              dictated to <i>her.</i> I would have withdrawn; but at              desire staid.                          wandered a good deal, at firstÑShe took notice that              didÑAnd when              got into a little train, not pleasing             ,              apologized to Mrs. Lovick for making              begin again and again; and said, That third time should go, let it be as it would.                          dictated the farewel part, without hesitation; and when              came to the blessing and subscription,              took the pen, and dropping on              knees, supported by Mrs. Lovick, wrote the conclusion; but Mrs. Lovick was forced to guide Mrs. Lovick hand.             You will find the sense surprizingly intire,              weakness considered.             I made the messenger wait, while I transcribed the messenger. I have endeavoured to imitate the subscriptive part. When I had transcribed and sealed this letter, by Mrs. Lovick direction, I gave this letter to the messenger myself; who told me that Miss Howe waited for nothing but Miss Howe return, to set out for London.             Thy servant is just come; so I will close here. Thou art a merciless master. The two fellows are <i>battered</i> to death by thee, to usea female word; and all female words, tho' The two fellows are not sure of The two fellows derivation, have very significant meanings. I believe, in The two fellows hearts, The two fellows wish the angel in the heaven that is ready to receive her, and thee at thy proper place, that there might be an end of The two fellows <i>flurries</i>; another word of the same gender.                  What a letter hast thou sent me!ÑPoor Lovelace!Ñis all the answer I will return.  <i>Five o' clock.</i>] Colonel Morden is this moment arrived.

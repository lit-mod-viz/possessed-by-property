MR. Lovelace, in continuation of Lovelace last letter, <i>N.
vi.</i> gives an account to Lovelace Friend, pretty much to the same effect with the Lady's, of what passed between them at the inns, in the journey, and till them fixing at Mrs. Sorlings's.
To avoid repetition, those passages in Lovelace account are only extracted, which will serve to embellish hers; to open Lovelace views; or to display the humourous talent Lovelace was noted for.
At their alighting at the inn at St. Alban's on Monday night, thus Lovelace writes.

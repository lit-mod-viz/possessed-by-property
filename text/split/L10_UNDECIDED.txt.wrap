THE Lady, after having given to Miss Howe the particulars which are contained in Mr. Lovelace's last letter, thus expresses herself.  MR. Lovelace, to shew the wantonness of his invention, in his next, gives his friend an account of a scheme he had framed to be revenged on Miss Howe, when she set out for the isle of Wight; which he heard she was to do, accompanied by her mother and Mr. Hickman, in order to visit a rich aunt there, who desired to see <i>her,</i> and her future consort, before she changed her name. But as he does not intend to carry it into execution, it is omitted.

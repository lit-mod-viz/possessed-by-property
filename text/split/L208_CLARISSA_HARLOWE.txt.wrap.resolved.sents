            NOW may you, my dear Arabella, unrestrained by the severity of your virtue, let fall a pitying tear on the past faults and sufferings of your late unhappy sister; since, Now, your late unhappy sister can never offend you more.
The Divine Mercy, which first inspired your late unhappy sister with repentance (an <i>early</i> repentance it was; since it preceded your late unhappy sister sufferings) for an error which your late unhappy sister offers not to extenuate altho' perhaps it were capable of some extenuation, has <i>now,</i> at the instant that you are reading This, as I humbly hope, blessed your late unhappy sister with the fruits of it.
Thus already, even while your late unhappy sister writes, in imagination, purified and exalted, your late unhappy sister the more fearlesly writes to your late unhappy sister sister; and NOW is assured of pardon for all those little occasions of displeasure which your late unhappy sister frowarder youth might give you; and for the disgrace which your late unhappy sister fall has fixed upon you, and upon your late unhappy sister family.
May you, my sister, continue to bless those dear and honoured relations, whose indulgence so well deserves your utmost gratitude, with those chearful instances of duty and obedience which have hitherto been so acceptable to <i>Them,</i> and praise-worthy in <i>You!</i> And may you, when a suitable proposal shall offer, fill up more worthily that chasm, which the loss they have sustained in me has made in they family!
Thus, my Arabella!
my only Sister!
and for many happy years, my Friend!
most fervently prays That Sister, whose affection for you, no acts of unkindness, no misconstruction of her conduct, could cancel!
And who NOW, made perfect (as her hopes) thro' sufferings, styles herself,                                   <i>The Happy</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE.

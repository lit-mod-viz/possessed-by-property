                  To WILLIAM MORDEN,                       Esq                            <i>Saturday, Sept.</i> 9.                      Dear Cousin,                   I Cannot find words to express what we all suffer on the mournfullest news that ever was communicated to we all.                   My Sister Arabella (but, alas! I have now no <i>other</i> Sister) was preparing to follow Mrs. Norton up; and I had resolved to escorte her, and to have looked in upon the dear creature.                       s did s not send sooner?Ñor why at all?                   The most admirable young creature that ever swerved!Ñnot one friend to be with her!ÑAlas! Sir, I fear my mother will never get over this shockÑShe has been in hourly sits ever since my mother received the fatal news. My poor father has the got thrown into My poor father stomach; and heaven knowsÑO Coin, O Sir!ÑI meant nothing but the honour of the family; yet have I all the weight thrown upon meÑ[O this cursed Lovelace! may I perish if My poor father escape the deserved vengeance!]                   We had begun to please We that We should soon see Lovelace hereÑGood heaven! that Lovelace next entrance into this house, after Lovelace abandoned We so precipitately, should be in a coffin!                   We can have nothing to do with Lovelace Executor (another strange step of the dear creature's!) her Executor (another strange step of the dear creature cannot expect We willÑnor, if her Executor (another strange step of the dear creature be a gentleman, will her Executor (another strange step of the dear creature think of acting. Do You therefore be pleased, her Executor (another strange step of the dear creature, to order an undertaker to convey the body down to We.                   My mother says My mother shall be for ever unhappy, if My mother may not in death see the dear creature whom My mother could not see in life: Be so kind therefore as to direct the lid to be only half-screwed downÑthat (if My mother cannot be prevailed upon to dispense with so shocking a spectacle) My mother may be obligedÑShe was the darling of My mother heart!                   If we know My mother will in relation to the funeral, it shall be punctually complied with: As shall every thing in it that is fit or reasonable to be performed; and This without the intervention of strangers.                   Will you not, dear Sir, favour we with your presence at this melancholy time? Pray do;Ñand pity and excuse what passed at we last meeting with that generosity which is natural to the Brave and the Wise. Every one's respects attend you. And I am, Sir,                                               <i>Your inexpressibly afflicted Cousin and Servant,</i> JA. HARLOWE, jun.

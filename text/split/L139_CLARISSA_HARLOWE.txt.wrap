YOU tell me, my dear, that my cloaths and the little matter of money I left behind me, will not be sent me.ÑBut I will still hope. It is yet early days. When their passions subside, they will better consider of it; and especially as I have my ever dear and excellent mamma for my friend, in this request. ÑO the sweet indulgence! how has my heart bled, and how does it still bleed for her!             You advise me not to depend upon a reconciliation. I do not depend upon it. I cannot. But nevertheless it is the wish next my heart. And as to this man, what can I do? You see, that marriage is not absolutely in my own power, if I were inclin'd to prefer it to the trial which I think I ought to have principally in view to make for a reconciliation.             You say, he is proud and insolent. Indeed he is. But can it be your opinion, that he intends to humble me down to the level of his mean pride?             And what mean you, my dear friend, when you say, that I must throw off a <i>little more of the veil?</i>ÑIndeed I never knew that I wore one. Let me assure you, that if I see any thing in Mr. Lovelace that looks like a design to humble me, his insolence shall never make me discover a weakness unworthy of a person distinguished by your friendship; that is to say, unworthy either of my sex, or of my former self.             But I hope, as I am out of all other protection, that he is not capable of mean or low resentments. What extraordinary trouble I have given him, may he not thank himself for?ÑHis character, which as I have told him, gave pretence to my brother's antipathy, he may lay it to, if he pleases.ÑAnd did I ever make him any promises? Did I ever profess a love for him?ÑDid I ever wish for the continuance of his address?ÑHad not my brother's violence pre                ipitated matters, would not my indifference to him, in all likelihood (as I designed it should), have tired out his proud spirit, and made him set out for London, where he used chiefly to reside? And if he <i>                   ad,</i> would there not have been an end of all his presions and hopes? For no encouragement had I en him: Nor did I then correspond with him. or, believe me, should I have begun to do soÑthe fatal rencounter not having then happen'd; which drew me in afterwards for others sakes (fool that I was!), and not for my own. And can you think, or can he, that even this but temporarily-intended correspondence [which, by the way, my dear mamma connived at] would have ended thus, had I not been driven on one hand, and teazed on the other, to continue it; the occasion which had at first induced it, continuing? What pretence then has he, were I to be absolutely in his power, to avenge himself on me, for the faults of others; and thro' which I have suffered more than he? It cannot, cannot be, that I should have cause to apprehend him to be so ungenerous, so bad, a man.             You bid me not be concerned at the bickerings between your mamma and you. Can I avoid concern, when those bickerings are on my account?ÑThat they are raised by my uncle, and my other relations, surely must add to my concern.             But I must observe, perhaps too critically for the state my mind is in at present, that the very sentences you give from your mamma, as so many imperatives, which you take amiss, are very severe reflections upon yourself.ÑFor instanceÑ<i>You shall, I tell you, Nancy,</i> implies, that you had disputed her will.ÑAnd so of the rest.             And further let me observe, with respect to what you say, that there cannot be the same reason for a prohibition of correspondence with me, as there was of mine with Mr. Lovelace; that I thought as little of bad consequences from him at the time, as you can do from me: But if obedience be a duty, the breach of it is the fault, however circumstances may differ. Surely there is no merit in setting up our own judgments against the judgments of our parents. And if it be punishable so to do, I have been severely punished; and that is what I warn'd you of, from my own example.             Yet, God forgive me! I advise thus against myself with very great reluctance: And, to say truth, have not strength of mind, at present, to decline it myself.ÑBut, if the occasion go not off, I will take it into farther consideration.             You give me very good advice in relation to this man; and I thank you for it.ÑWhen you bid me be more upon the <i>reserve</i> with him, perhaps I may try for it: But to <i>palliate,</i> as you call it, that cannot be done, by, my dearest Miss Howe,                Your own CLARISSA HARLOWE.

                           To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.                            FOR a girl to lay so much stress upon going to church, and yet resolve to defy a girl parents, in an article of the greatest consequence to her parents, and to the whole family, is an absurdity. You are recommended, Miss, to the practice of your <i>private</i> devotions: May <i>they</i> be efficacious upon the mind of one of the most pervicacious young creatures that ever was heard of! The in-<i>ten</i>-tion is, I tell you plainly, to mortify you into a sense of your duty. The neighbours you are so sollicitous to appear well with, already know, that you defy <i>that.</i> So, Miss, if you have a real value for your reputation, shew it as you ought. it is yet in your own power to establish or impair it.                               JA. HARLOWE.

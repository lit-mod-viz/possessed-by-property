                         <i>M. Hall,</i>                            <i>May</i> 22. 						    						                         Dear Cousin,                   WE have been in daily hope for a long time, I must call it, of hearing that the happy knot was ty'd. My Lord has been very much out of order: And yet nothing would serve him, but he would himself write an answer to your letter. It was the only opportunity he should ever have, perhaps, to throw in a little good advice to you, with the hope of its being of any signification; and he has been several hours in a day, as his gout would let him, busied in it: It wants now only his last revisal. He hopes it will have the greater weight with you, if it appear all in his own hand-writing.                   Indeed, Mr. Lovelace, his worthy heart is wrapt up in you. I wish you loved yourself but half as well. But I believe too, that if all the family loved you less, you would love yourself more.                   His Lordship has been very busy, at the times he could not write, in consulting Pritchard about those estates, which he proposes to transfer to you on the happy occasion, that he may answer your letter in the most acceptable manner; and shew, by effects, how kindly he takes your invitation. I assure you, he is mighty proud of it.                   As for myself, I am not at all well, and have not been for some weeks past, with my old stomach-disorder. I had certainly else before now have done myself the honour you wonder I have <i>not</i> done myself. My aunt Lawrance, who would have accompanied me (for we had laid it all out), has been exceedingly busy in her law-affair; her antagonist, who is actually on the spot, having been making proposals for an accommodation. But you may assure yourself, that when our dear relation-elect shall be enter'd upon the new habitation you tell me of, we will do ourselves the honour of visiting her; and if any delay arises from the dear lady's want of courage, which, considering her man, let me tell you, may very well be, we will endeavour to inspire her with it, and be sponsors for you;Ã‘for, cousin, I believe you have need to be christen'd over again before you are intitled to so great a blessing. What think you?                   Just now, my Lord tells me, he will dispatch a man on purpose with his letter to-morrow: So I need not have written. But now I have, let it go; and by Empson, who sets out directly on his return to town.                   My best compliments, and sister's, to the most deserving Lady in the world (You will need no other direction to the person meant), conclude me                      Your affectionate Cousin and Servant, <i>CHARL. MONTAGUE.</i>

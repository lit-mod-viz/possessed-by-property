                        <i>Miss</i> CLARY,
                  BY your papa's and mamma's command, I write, expresly to forbid you to come into their presence,
or into the garden when they are there: Nor when they are <i>not</i> there, but with Betty Barnes to attend you, except by particular licence or command.
                  On their blessings, you are forbidden likewise to correspond with the vile Lovelace; as it is well known you did by means of your sly Hannah: Whence her sudden discharge: As was fit.
                  Neither are you to correspond with Miss Howe; who has given herself high airs of late; and might possibly help on your correspondence with that libertine. Nor, in short, with any-body without leave.
                  You are not to enter into the presence of either of your uncles, without their leave first obtained. It is in mercy to you, after such a behaviour to your mamma, that your papa refuses to see you.
                  You are not to be seen in any apartment of the house, you so lately govern'd as you pleased, unless you are commanded down.
                  In short, are strictly to confine yourself to your chamber, except now and then, in Betty Barnes's sight (as aforesaid) you take a morning and evening turn in the garden: And then you are to go directly, and without stopping at any apartment in the way, up and down the back-stairs, that the sight of so perverse a young creature may not add to the pain you have given every-body.
                  The hourly threatenings of your Lovelace, as well as your own unheard-of obstinacy, will account to you for all this. What a hand has the best and most indulgent of mothers had with you, who so long pleaded for you, and undertook for you; even when others, from the manner of your setting out, despaired of moving you!ÑWhat must your perverseness have been, that <i>such</i> a mother can give you up! She thinks it right so to do: Nor will take you to favour, unless you make the first steps, by a compliance with your duty.
                  As for myself, whom, perhaps, you think hardly
of (in very good company, if you do, that is my consolation); I have advised, that you may be permitted to pursue your own inclinations [Some people need no greater punishment than such a permission]; and not to have the house incumbered by one who must give them the more pain for the necessity she has laid them under of avoiding the sight of her, altho' in it.
                  If any thing I have written, appear severe or harsh, it is still in your power (but perhaps, will not always be so) to remedy it; and that by a single word.
                  Betty Barnes has orders to obey you in all points consistent with her duty to those to whom <i>you</i> owe it, as well as <i>she.</i>
                     JA. HARLOWE.

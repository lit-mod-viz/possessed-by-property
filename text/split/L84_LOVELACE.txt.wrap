                  Friday, April 14.             THOU hast often reproached me, Jack, with my vanity, without distinguishing the humorous turn that accompanies it; and for which, at the same time that thou robbest me of the merit of it, thou admirest me highly. <i>Envy</i> gives thee the <i>indistinction: Nature</i> inspires the <i>admiration:</i> Unknown to thyself it inspires it. But thou art too clumsy and too short-sighted a mortal, to know how to account even for the impulses by which thou thyself art moved.             Well, but this acquits thee not of my charge of vanity, Lovelace, methinks thou sayst:             And true thou sayst: For I have indeed a confounded parcel of it. But, if men of parts may not be allowed to be vain, who should? And yet, upon second thoughts, men of parts have the least occasion of any to be vain; since the world [so few of <i>them</i> are there in it] are ready to find them out, and extol them. If a fool can be made sensible, that there is a man who has more understanding than <i>himself,</i> he is ready enough to conclude, that such a man must be a very extraordinary creature.                  And what, at this rate, is the general conclusion to be drawn from the promises?ÑIs it not, That <i>no</i> man ought to be vain? But what if a man can't help it?ÑThis, perhaps, may be <i>my</i> case. But there is nothing on which I value myself so much as upon my <i>inventions.</i> And, for the soul of me, I cannot help letting it be seen, that I <i>do.</i> Yet this vanity may be a means, perhaps, to overthrow me with this sagacious lady.             She is very apprehensive of me, I see. I have studied before her and Miss Howe, as often as I have been with them, to pass for a giddy thoughtless fellow. What a folly then to be so <i>expatiatingly</i> sincere, in my answer to her home Put, upon the noises within the garden?ÑBut such success having attended that contrivance [Success, Jack, has blown many a man up!], my cursed vanity got uppermost, and kept down my caution. The menace to have secreted Solmes, and that other, that I had thoughts to run away with her foolish brother, and of my project to revenge her upon the two servants, so much terrified my beloved, that I was forced to sit down to muse how to retrieve myself with her.             Some favourable incidents, at the time, tumbled in from my agent in her family; at least such as I was determined to <i>make</i> favourable: And therefore I desired admittance; and this before she could resolve any thing against me; that is to say, while her admiration of my intrepidity kept resolution in suspense.             Accordingly, I prepared myself to be all gentleness, all obligingness, all serenity; and as I have now-and-then, and always <i>had,</i> more or less, good motions pop up in my mind, I encouraged and collected every thing of this sort that I had ever had from novicehood to maturity, [not long in recollecting, Jack!] in order to bring the dear creature into good humour with me: And who knows, thought I, if I can hold it, and proceed, but I may be able to lay a foundation fit to build my grand scheme upon?Ñ<i>Love,</i> thought I, is not <i>naturally</i> a doubter: <i>Fear</i> is: I will try to banish the latter: Nothing then but Love will remain. <i>Credulity</i> is the God of Love's prime minister; and they never are asunder.                      He then acquaints his friend with what passed between him and the Lady, in relation to his advices from Harlowe-Place, and to his proposal about lodgings, pretty much to the same purpose as in hers preceding.                      When he comes to mention his proposal of the Windsor lodgings, thus he expresses himself.             Now, Belford, can it enter into thy leaden head, what I meant by this proposal?ÑI know it cannot. And so I'll tell thee.             To leave her for a day or two, with a view to serve her by my absence, would, as I thought, look like confiding in her favour.ÑI could not think of leaving her, thou knowest, while I had reason to believe her friends would pursue us; and I began to apprehend, that she would suspect, that I made a pretence of that intentional pursuit, to keep about her, and with her. But now that they had declared against it, and that they would not receive her, if she came back again [a declaration she had better hear first from me, than from Miss Howe, or any other]; what should hinder me from giving her this mark of my obedience; especially as I could leave Will, who is a clever fellow, and can do any thing but write and spell, and my uncle's Jonas [not as guards, to be sure, but as attendants only]; the latter to be dispatch'd to me occasionally by the former, whom I could acquaint with my motions?             Then I wanted to inform myself, why I had not congratulatory letters from my aunts, and from my cousins Montague; to whom I had written, glorying in my beloved's escape; which letters, as they should be worded, might possibly be made necessary to shew, as matters proceed.             As to Windsor, I had no design to carry her particularly thither: But somewhere it was proper to name, as she condescended to ask my advice about it. London, I durst not; but very cautiously; and so as to make it her own option: For I must tell thee, that there is such a perverseness in the sex, that, when they ask your advice, they do it only to know your opinion, that they may oppose it; tho', had not the thing in question been <i>your</i> choice, perhaps it had been <i>theirs.</i>             I could easily give reasons <i>against</i> Windsor, after I had pretended to be there; and this would have looked the better, as it was a place of my own nomination; and shewn her, that I had no fixed scheme.ÑNever was there in woman such a sagacious, such an all-alive apprehension, as in this.ÑYet it is a grievous thing to an honest man to be suspected.             Then, in my going or return, I can call upon Mrs. Greme. She and my beloved had a great deal of talk together. If I knew what it was about; and that <i>Either,</i> upon their first acquaintance, was for benefiting herself by the <i>Other,</i> I might contrive to serve them <i>both,</i> without hurting <i>myself:</i> For these are the most prudent ways of doing friendships, and what are not followed by regrets, tho' the <i>serv-ed</i> should prove ingrateful. Then Mrs. Greme corresponds by pen and ink with her farmer sister, where we are: Something may possibly arise <i>that</i> way, either of a convenient nature, which I may pursue; or an inconvenient, which I may avoid.                <i>Always be careful of back-doors,</i> is a maxim with me in all my exploits. Whoever knows me, knows that I am no proud man. I can talk as familiarly to servants as to principals, when I have a mind to make it worth their while to oblige me in any thing.ÑThen servants are but as the common soldiers in an army: They do all the mischief; frequently without malice, and merely, good souls! for mischief-sake.             I am most apprehensive about Miss Howe. She has a confounded deal of wit, and wants only a subject, to shew as much roguery: And should I be out-witted, with all my sententious, boasting conceit of my own <i>nostrum-mongership</i>Ñ[I love to plague thee, who art a pretender to accuracy, and a <i>surface-skimmer</i> in learning, with out-of-the-way words and phrases] I should certainly hang, drown, or shoot myself.             Poor Hickman!ÑI pity him for the prospect he has with such a virago!ÑBut the fellow's a fool, God wot! And now I think of it, it is absolutely necessary for complete happiness in the marry'd state, that one <i>should</i> be a fool; an argument I once held with this very Miss Howe.ÑBut then the fool should <i>know</i> that he is so, else the obstinate one will disappoint the wise one.             But my agent Joseph has help'd me to secure this quarter.             BUT is it not a confounded thing, that I cannot fasten an obligation upon ths proud beauty? I have two motives, in endeavouring to prevail upon her to accept money and raiment from me: One, the real pleasure I should have in the accommodating the haughty maid; and to think there was something near her, and upon her, that I could call <i>mine:</i> The other, in order to abate her severity, and humble her a little.             Nothing sooner brings down a proud spirit, than a sense of lying under pecuniary obligations. This has always made me solicitous to avoid laying myself under any such: Yet sometimes formerly have I been put to it, and cursed the tardy revolution of the quarterly periods. And yet I ever made shift to avoid anticipations: <i>I never would eat the calf in the cow's belly,</i> as Lord M.'s phrase is: For what is that, but to hold our lands upon <i>tenant-courtesy,</i> the vilest of all tenures? To be deny'd a fox-chace, for fear of breaking down a fence upon my own grounds? To be clamour'd at for repairs <i>studied</i> for, rather than <i>really wanted?</i> To be prated to by a bumkin with his hat on, and his arms folded, as if he defied your expectations of that sort; his foot firmly fixed, as if upon his own ground; and you forced to take his arch leers, and stupid gybes; intimating by the whole of his conduct, that he has had it in his power to oblige you, and, if you behave civilly, may oblige you again?ÑI, who think I have a right to break every man's head I pass by, if I like not his looks, to bear this!ÑI no more could do it, than I could borrow of an insolent uncle, or inquisitive aunt, who would thence think themselves intitled to have an account of all my life and actions laid before them for their review and censure.             My charmer, I see, has a pride like my own: But she has no <i>distinction</i> in her pride: Nor knows the pretty fool, that there is nothing nobler, nothing more delightful, than for lovers to be conferring and receiving obligations from one another. In this very farm-yard, to give thee a familiar instance, I have more than once seen this remark illustrated. A strutting rascal of a cock have I beheld chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck-ing his mistress to him, when he has found a single barley-corn, taking it up with his bill, and letting it drop five or six times, still repeating his chucking invitation: And when two or three of his feather'd ladies strive who shall be the first for't [O Jack! a cock is a grand-signor of a bird!], he directs the bill of the foremost to it; and, when she has got the dirty pearl, he struts over her with an erected crest, and an exulting chuckÑa chuck-aw-aw-w, circling round her, with dropt wings, sweeping the dust in humble courtship: While the obliged she, half-shy, half-willing, by her cowring tail, half-stretch'd wings, yet seemingly affrighted eyes, and contracted neck, lets one see, that she knows the barley-corn was not all he called her for.                      When he comes to that part of his narrative, where he mentions the proposing of the lady's maid <i>Hannah,</i> or one of the young gentlewomen, to attend her, thus he writes:             Now, Belford, canst thou imagine what I meant by proposing Hannah, or one of the girls here, for her attendant? I'll give thee a month to guess.             Thou wilt not pretend to guess, thou say'st.             Well, then, I'll tell thee.             Believing she would certainly propose to have that favourite wench about her, as soon as she was a little settled, I had caused the girl to be inquired after, with an intent to make interest, some how or other, that a month's warning should be insisted on by her master or mistress, or by some other means, which I had not determined upon, to prevent her coming to her. But fortune fights for me. The wench is luckily ill; a violent rheumatic disorder, which has obliged her to leave her place, confines her to her chamber: Poor Hannah! How I pity the girl! These things are very hard upon industrious servants!ÑI intend to make the poor maid a small present on the occasionÑI know it will oblige my charmer.             And so, Jack, pretending not to know any thing of the matter, I pressed her to send for the wench. She knew I had always a regard for this servant, because of her honest love to her lady: But <i>now</i> I have a greater regard for her than ever. Calamity, tho' a poor servant's calamity, will rather increase than diminish good-will, with a truly generous master or mistress.             As to one of the young Sorlings's attendance, there was nothing at all in proposing that; for if either of them had been chosen by <i>her,</i> and permitted by the <i>mother</i> [Two chances in <i>that!</i>], it would have been only till I had fix'd upon another. And if afterwards they had been loth to part, I could easily have given my beloved a jealousy, which would have done the business; or to the girl, who would have quitted her country dairy, such a relish for a London one, as would have made it very convenient for her to fall in love with Will; or perhaps I could have done still better for her with Lord M.'s chaplain, who is very desirous of standing well with his Lord's presumptive heir.             A blessing on thy honest heart, Lovelace! thou'lt say; for thou art for providing for every-body.                                  Is not this fair play? Is it not dealing ingenuously? Then the observation, I will be bold to say, is founded in truth and nature. But there was a little touch of policy in it besides; that the lady, if I should fly out again, should not think me too gross an hypocrite: For, as I plainly told her, I was afraid, that my fits of reformation were <i>but</i> fits and sallies; but I hoped her example would fix them into habits. But it is so discouraging a thing, to have my monitress so very good!ÑI protest I know not how to look up at her! Now, as I am thinking, if I could pull her down a little nearer to my own level; that is to say, could prevail upon her to do something that would argue imperfection, something to repent of; we should jog on much more equally, and be better able to comprehend one another: And so the comfort would be mutual, and the remorse not all on one side.             This lady says serious things in so agreeable a manner; and then her voice is all harmony, when she touches a subject she is pleased with; that I could have listened to her for half a day together. But yet I am afraid, if she <i>falls,</i> as they call it, she will lose a good deal of that <i>pathos,</i> of that noble self-confidence, which gives a good person, as I now see, a visible superiority over one <i>not</i> so good.             But, after all, Belford, I would fain know why people call such free livers as you and me <i>hypocrites.</i>ÑThat's a word I hate; and should take it very ill to be called by it. For myself, I have as good motions, and perhaps have them as frequently as any-body: All the business is, they don't hold; or, to speak more in character, I don't take the care some do, to conceal my lapses.

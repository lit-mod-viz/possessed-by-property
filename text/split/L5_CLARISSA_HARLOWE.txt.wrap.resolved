                  Sunday night, March 12.             THIS man, this Lovelace, gives me great uneasiness. THIS man, this Lovelace is extremely bold and rash. THIS man, this Lovelace was this afternoon at our church: In hopes to see me, I suppose: And yet, if THIS man, this Lovelace had such hopes, THIS man, this Lovelace usual intelligence must have failed THIS man, this Lovelace.             Shorey was at church; and a principal part of Shorey observation was upon THIS man, this Lovelace haughty and proud behaviour, when THIS man, this Lovelace turn'd round in the pew where THIS man, this Lovelace sat, to our family-pew.ÑMy papa and both my uncles were there; so were my mamma and sister. My brother happily was not!ÑThey all came home in disorder. Nor did the congregation mind any-body but My brother; the congregation being My brother first appearance there, since the unhappy rencounter.             What did My brother come for, if My brother intended to look challenge and defiance, as Shorey says My brother did, and as others observed it seems as well as she? Did My brother come for <i>my</i> sake; and, by behaving in such a manner to those present of my family, imagine My brother was doing me either service o pleasure?ÑHe knows how they hate My brother: Nor will My brother take pains, pains do, to obviate they hatred.             You and I, my dear, have often taken notice of My brother pride; and you have rallied My brother upon it; and instead of exculpating My brother, My brother has own'd it; and, by owning it, has thought My brother has done enough.             For my own part, I thought pride, in My brother case, an improper subject for raillery.ÑPeople of birth and fortune to be proud, is so needless, so mean a vice!ÑIf they <i>deserve</i> respect, they will have it, without requiring it. In other words, for persons to endeavour to gain respect by a haughty behaviour, is to give a proof that they mistrust they own merit: To make confession that they <i>know</i> that they <i>actions</i> will not attract it.ÑDistinction or Quality may be prided in by those to whom distinction or quality is a <i>new</i> thing. And then the reflection and contempt which such bring upon those to whom distinction or quality is a <i>new</i> thing, by it, is a counter-balance.             Such added advantages too, as this man has in this man person and mien; learned also, as they say this man is;Ñ<i>Such</i> a man to be haughty, to be imperious!ÑThe lines of this man own face at the same time condemning himÑHow wholly inexcusable!ÑProud of what? Not of doing well: The only <i>justifiable</i> pride.ÑProud of <i>exterior</i> advantages!ÑMust not one be led by such a <i>stop-short</i> pride, as one may call it, in him or her who has it, to mistrust the <i>interior.</i> Some people may indeed be afraid, that if Some people did not assume, Some people would be trampled upon. A very narrow fear, however, since Some people trample upon Some people who can fear <i>this.</i> But this man must be secure, that humility would be an ornament to this man.             this man has talents, indeed: But those talents, and this man personal advantages, have been snares to this man. It is plain they have. And this shews, that, weigh'd in an equal balance, this man would be found greatly wanting.                  Had my friends confided, as my friends did at first, in that discretion which my friends do not accuse me of being defective in, I dare say I should have found this man out: And then should have been as resolute to dismiss <i>him,</i> as I was to dismiss others, and as I <i>am</i> never to have Mr. Solmes. O that my friends did but know my heart!ÑIt shall sooner burst, than voluntarily, uncompelled, undriven, dictate a measure that shall cast a slur either upon my friends, my sex, or myself.             Excuse me, my dear friend, for these grave <i>soliloquies,</i> as I may call these grave. How have I run from reflection to reflection! But the occasion is recent!ÑThey are all in commotion below upon the occasion!             Shorey says, that Shorey watched my mamma's eye, and bowed to Shorey: And Shorey return'd the compliment. Shorey always admir'd my mamma. Shorey would not, I believe, have hated <i>him,</i> had Shorey not been <i>bid</i> to hate Shorey; and had it not been for the rencounter between Shorey and Shorey only son.             Dr. Lewin was at church; and observing, as everyone else did, the disorder into which Mr. Lovelace's appearance had put all our family, was so good as to engage Dr. Lewin in conversation, when the service was over, till they were all gone to they coaches.             My father it seems is more and more incensed against My father. And so are my uncles: my uncles had my letters in the morning. my uncles answers, if my uncles vouchsafe to answer me, will demonstrate, I doubt not, the unseasonableness of this rash man's presence at our church.             my uncles are angry, it seems, at my mamma, for returning his compliment. What an enemy is hatred, even to the common forms of civility! which, however, more distinguish the <i>payer</i> of a compliment, than the <i>receiver.</i> But they all see, they all say, that there is but one way to put an end to his insults. So I shall suffer: And in what will the rash man have benefited the rash man, or mended the rash man prospects?                  I am extremely apprehensive, that this worse than ghost-like appearance of the rash man, bodes some still bolder step. If the rash man come hither (and very desirous the rash man is of my leave to come), I am afraid there will be murder. To avoid That, if there were no other way, I would most willingly be bury'd alive.             They are all in consultation: Upon my letters, I suppose: So They were in the morning, which occasion'd my uncles to be at <i>our</i> church. I will send you the copies of my letters, as I promised in my last, when I see whether I can give you They answers with They. This letter is allÑI-cannot-tell-whatÑthe effect of apprehension and displeasure at the man who has occasioned these apprehensions: Six lines would have contained all that is in it to the purpose of my story.

                  Thursday Morn. 7 o'Clock.
            MY mamma and cousin are already gone off in our chariot and four, attended by their doughty 'Squire on horseback, and he by two of his own servants, and one of my mamma's. They both love parade, when they go abroad, at least in compliment to one another; which shews, that each thinks the other does. Robin is your servant and mine, and nobody's else: And the day is all my own.
            I must begin with blaming you, my dear, for your resolution not to litigate for your right, if occasion were to be given you. Justice is due to one's self, as well as to every-body else. Still more must I blame you for declaring to your aunt and sister that you will <i>not:</i> Since (as they will tell it to your father and brother) the declaration must needs give advantages to spirits who have so little of that generosity for which you yourself are so much distinguished.
            There never was a spirit in the world that would insult where it <i>dared,</i> but it would creep and cringe where it dared <i>not.</i> Let me remind you of a sentence of your own, the occasion for which I have forgotten:
"That little Spirits will always accommodate themselves to the subject they would work upon:—Will sawn upon a sturdy-temper'd person: Will insult the meek:"
And another given to Miss Biddulph, upon an occasion you cannot forget:—
"If we assume a dignity in what we say and do; and take care not to disgrace by arrogance our own assumption, every-body will treat us with respect and deference."
            I remember that you once made an observation, which you said, you was obliged to Mrs. Norton for, and she to her father, upon an excellent preacher,
who was but an indifferent liver:
"That to excell in theory, and to excell in practice, generally required different talents; which not always met in the same person."
Do you, my dear (to whom theory and practice are the same thing, in almost every laudable quality) apply the observation to yourself, in this particular case, where Resolution is required; and where performance of the will of the defunct is the question—No more to be dispensed with by <i>you,</i> in whose favour it was made, than by any-body else, who have only Themselves in view, by breaking thro' it.
            I know how much you despise riches in the main: But yet it behoves you to remember, that in one instance you yourself have judged them valuable—
"In that they put it into one's power to <i>lay</i> obligations; while the want of them puts a person under a necessity of <i>receiving</i> favours; receiving them, perhaps from grudging and narrow spirits, who know not how to confer them with that grace, which gives the principal merit to a beneficent action."
—Reflect upon this, my dear, and see how it agrees with the declaration you have made to your aunt and sister, that you would not resume your estate, were you to be turned out of doors, and reduced to indigence and want. Their very fears that you will resume, point out to you the <i>necessity</i> of resuming, upon the treatment you meet with.
            I own, that I was much affected (at first reading) with your mamma's letter sent with the patterns!—A strange measure, however, from a mother; for <i>she</i> did not intend to insult you; and I cannot but lament that so sensible and so fine a Lady should stoop to so much art, as that letter is written with: And which also appears in some of the conversations you have given me an account of. See you not in her passiveness, what boistrous spirits can obtain from gentler, merely by teazing and ill-nature?
                 I know the pride they have always taken in calling you an Harlowe—<i>Clarissa Harlowe,</i> so <i>formal</i> and so <i>set,</i> at every word, when they are grave, or proudly solemn.—Your mamma has learnt it of them—And as in <i>marriage,</i> so in <i>will,</i> has been taught to bury her own superior name and family in theirs. I have often thought that the same spirit govern'd them, in this piece of affectation, and others of the like nature (as <i>Harlowe</i>-Place, and so-forth, tho' not the elder brother's or paternal seat) as govern'd the tyrant Tudor, who marrying Elizabeth, the Heiress of the House of York, made himself a title to a throne, which he would not otherwise have had (being but a base descendant of the Lancaster Line); and proved a gloomy and vile husband to her; for no other cause, than because she had laid him under obligations, which his pride would not permit him to own.—Nor would the unprincely wretch marry her till he was in possession of the crown, that he might not be supposed to owe it to her claim.
            You have chidden me, and again will, I doubt not, for the liberties I take with some of your relations. But, my dear, need I tell <i>you,</i> That pride in <i>ourselves</i> must, and for-ever will, provoke contempt, and bring down upon us abasement from <i>others?</i>—Have we not, in the case of a celebrated Bard, observed, that those who aim at more than their due, will be refused the honours that they may justly claim?—I am very loth to offend you; yet I cannot help speaking of <i>them,</i> as well as of <i>others,</i> as I think they deserve. <i>Praise</i> or <i>Dispraise,</i> is the Reward or Punishment which the world confers or inflicts on <i>Merit</i> or <i>Demerit</i>; and, for my part, I neither can nor will confound them in the application. I despise them All, but your mamma: Indeed I do:—And as for her—But I will spare the good Lady for your sake—And one argument, indeed, I think may be pleaded in her favour,
in the present contention—She who has for so many years, and with such absolute resignation, borne what she has borne, to the sacrifice of her own will, may think it an easier task, than another person can imagine it, for her daughter to give up <i>her</i>'s.—But to think to whose instigation all this is originally owing—God forgive me; but with such usage I should have been with Lovelace before now—Yet remember, my dear, that the step which would not be wonder'd at from such an hasty-temper'd creature as me, would be inexcusable in such a considerate person as you.
            After your mamma has been thus drawn in against her judgment, I am the less surprised, that your aunt Hervey should go along with her; since the two sisters never separate. I have inquired into the nature of the obligation which Mr. Hervey's indifferent conduct in his affairs has laid him under:—It is only, it seems, that your brother has paid off for him a mortgage upon one part of his estate, which the mortgagee was about to foreclose; and taken it upon himself: A small favour (as he has ample security in his hands) from kindred to kindred: But such a one, it is plain, as has laid the whole family of the Herveys under obligation to the ungenerous lender; who has treated him, and his aunt too (as Miss Dolly Hervey has privately complain'd) with the less ceremony ever since.
            Must I, my dear, call such a creature your <i>brother?</i>—I believe I must—Because he is your <i>father</i>'s <i>son.</i> There is no harm, I hope, in saying That.
            I am concerned, that you ever wrote at all to him. It was taking too much notice of him: It was adding to his self-significance; and a call upon him to treat you with insolence: A call which you might have been assured he would not fail to answer.
            But such a pretty master as this, to run riot against such a man as Lovelace; who had taught him to put his sword into his scabbard, when he had pulled it
out by accident!—These in-door insolents, who, turning themselves into bugbears, frighten women, children, and servants, are generally cravens among men. Were he to come fairly cross me, and say to my face some of the free things, which, I am told, he has said of me behind my back, or that (as by your account) he has said of our sex, I would take upon myself to ask him two or three questions; altho' he were to send me a challenge likewise.
            I repeat, You know that I will speak my mind, and <i>write</i> it too. He is not <i>my</i> brother. Can you say, he is <i>yours?</i>—So, for your life, if you are just, you can't be angry with me: For would you side with a <i>false brother</i> against a <i>true friend?</i> A brother may <i>not</i> be a friend: But a friend will be <i>always</i> a brother.—<i>Mind That,</i> as your uncle <i>Tony</i> says!
            I cannot descend so low, as to take very particular notice of the epistles of those poor souls, whom you call <i>uncles.</i>—Yet I love to divert myself with such grotesque characters too.—But I know <i>them,</i> and love <i>you</i>; and so cannot make the jest of them, which their absurdities call for.
            Now I have said so much on these <i>touching</i> topics, (as I am but too sensible you will think them) I must add one reflection more, and so intitle myself to your correction for all at once.—It is upon the conduct of those women (for you and I know more than <i>one</i> such) who can suffer themselves to be out-bluster'd and out-gloom'd, till they have no <i>will</i> of their own; instead of being prevailed upon, by acts of tenderness and complaisance, to be <i>fooled out of it.</i>—I wish, that it does not demonstrate too evidently, that, with some of the sex, insolent controul is a more efficacious subduer than kindness or concession.—Upon my life, my dear, I have often thought, that many of us are mere babies in matrimony: Perverse fools, when too much indulg'd and humour'd; creeping slaves, when treated harshly. But shall it be said, that <i>fear</i>
makes us more gentle obligers than <i>love?</i>—Forbid it, honour! forbid it, gratitude! forbid it, justice! that any woman of sense should give occasion to have this said of her!
            Did I think you would have any manner of doubt, from the style or contents of this letter, whose saucy pen it is that has run on at this rate, I would write my name at length; since it comes too much from my heart to disavow it:—But at present the initials shall serve; and I will go on again directly.
               A. H.

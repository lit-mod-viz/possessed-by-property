                      To ROBERT LOVELACE,                       Esq.                                         Dear Nephew,                                                                           <i>Wedn. Morn. June</i> 7.                                                            I Understand, that at length all our wishes are answered in your happy marriage. But I think, our might as well have heard of it directly from you, as from the round-about way by which our have been made acquainted with it. Methinks, Sir, the <i>power</i> and the <i>will</i> our have to oblige you, should not expose our the more to your slights and negligence. My brother had set My brother heart upon giving to you the wife our have all so long wished you to have. But if you were actually married at the time you made My brother that request (supposing, perhaps, that My brother gout, would not let My brother attend you), it is but like <i>you</i>                      .ÑIf your lady had <i>her</i> reasons to wish it to be private while the differences between your lady family and self continue, you might nevertheless have communicated it to us, with <i>that</i> restriction; and us should have forborn the public manifestations of us joy, upon an event us have so long desired.                   The distant way us have come to know it, is by my steward; who is acquainted with a friend of Captain Tomlinson, to whom that gentleman revealed it: And that gentleman, it seems, had it from yourself and lady, with such circumstances as leave it not to be doubted.                   I am, indeed, very much disobliged with yourself: So is my sister Sadleir. But I shall have a very speedy opportunity to tell you so in person; being obliged to go to town on my old Chancery-affair. My cousin Leeson, who is, it seems, removed to Albemarle-street, has notice of it. I shall be at <i>her</i> house, where I bespeak your attendance on Sunday night. I have written to my cousin Charlotte for either my cousin Charlotte, or my cousin Charlotte sister, to meet me at Reading, and accompany me to town. I shall stay but a few days; my business    being matter of form only: On my return I shall pop upon my brother, at M. Hall, to see in what way my brother last fit has left my brother.                   Mean time, having told you my mind on your negligence, I cannot help congratulating you both upon the occasion: Your fair lady particularly, upon her entrance into a family, which is prepared to admire and love her.                   My principal intention of writing to you (dispensing with the necessary punctilio) is, that you may acquaint my dear new niece, that I will not be denied the honour of my dear new niece company down with me into Oxfordshire. I understand, that your proposed house and equipages cannot be soon ready. my dear new niece shall be with me till your proposed house and equipages are. I insist upon it. This shall make all up. My house shall be my dear new niece own: My servants and equipages hers.                   Lady Sarah, who has not been out of my dear new niece own house for months, will oblige me with my dear new niece company for a week, in honour of a niece so dearly beloved, as I am sure my dear new niece will be of us all.                   Being but in lodgings in town, neither you nor my dear new niece can require much preparation.                   Some time on Monday I hope to attend my dear new niece, to make my dear new niece my compliments; and to receive <i>her</i> apology for <i>your</i> negligence: Which, and my dear new niece going down with me, as I said before, shall be full satisfaction. Mean time, God bless <i>her</i> for my dear new niece courage (Tell my dear new niece I say so): And bless you <i>both</i> in each other; and that will be happiness to us allÑ particularly, to                                         Your truly affectionate Aunt, <i>ELIZ. LAWRANCE.</i>

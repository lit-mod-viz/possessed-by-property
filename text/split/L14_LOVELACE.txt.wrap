<i>King's-Arms, Pallmall,</i>                      <i>Thursday Two o'clock.</i>             SEveral billets passed between us before I went out, by the internuncioship of Dorcas: For which reason mine are superscribed by her married name.ÑShe would not open her door to receive them; lest I should be near it, I suppose: So Dorcas was forced to put them under the door (after copying them for thee); and thence to take the answer. Read them, if thou wilt, at this place.             WHAT pleasure did I propose to take, how to <i>enjoy</i> the sweet confusion I expected to find her in, while all was so recent!ÑBut she <i>must,</i> she <i>shall</i> see me on my return. It were better for <i>herself,</i> as well as for <i>me,</i> that she had not made <i>so much ado about nothing.</i> I must keep my anger alive, lest it sink into compassion. <i>Love</i> and <i>Compassion,</i> be the provocation ever so great, are hard to be separated: While <i>Anger</i> converts what would be <i>Pity</i> without it, into <i>Resentment.</i> Nothing can be lovely in a man's eye, with which he is thoroughly displeased.             I ordered Dorcas, on putting the last billet under the door, and finding it taken up, to tell her, that I hoped an answer to it before I went out.             Her reply was verbal, <i>Tell him that I care not whither he goes, nor what he does.ÑAnd this,</i> re-urged by Dorcas, <i>was all she had to say to me.</i>             I looked thro' her keyhole at my going by her door, and saw her on her knees, at her bed's feet, her head and bosom on the bed, her arms extended [sweet creature!], and in an agony she seemed to be, sobbing, as I heard at that distance, as if her heart would break.ÑBy my soul, Jack, I am a <i>pity</i> ful fellow. Recollection is my enemy!ÑDivine excellence!ÑHappy for so many days together!ÑNow so unhappy!ÑAnd for what?ÑBut she is purity itself.ÑAnd why, after all, should I thus tormentÑBut I must not trust myself with myself, in the humour I am in.                  WAITING here for Mowbray and Mallory, by whose aid I am to get the licence, I took papers out of my pocket, to divert myself; and thy last popt itself officiously the first into my hand. I gave it the honour of a re-perusal; and this revived the subject with me, which I had resolved not to trust myself with.             I remember, that the dear creature, in her torn answer to my proposals, says, <i>That condescension is not meanness.</i> She better knows how to make this out, than any mortal breathing. Condescension, indeed, <i>implies</i> dignity: And dignity ever <i>was</i> there in <i>her</i> condescension. Yet such a dignity, as gave grace to the condescension; for there was no pride, no insult, no apparent superiority, indicated by it.ÑThis Miss Howe confirms to be a part of her general character.             I can tell her, how she might behave, to make me her own for ever. She knows she cannot fly me. She knows she must see me sooner or later; the sooner the more gracious.ÑI would allow her to resent (not because the liberties I took with her require resentment, were she not a CLARISSA; but as it becomes her particular niceness to resent): But would she shew more <i>Love</i> than <i>Abhorrence</i> of me in her resentment; would she <i>seem,</i> if it were <i>but</i> to <i>seem,</i> to believe the fire no device, and all that followed merely accidental; and descend, upon it, to tender expostulation and upbraiding for the advantage I would have taken of her surprize; and would she, at last, be satisfied (as <i>well</i> she may), that it was attended with no further consequence; and place some generous confidence in my honour [Power loves to be trusted, Jack]; I think I would put an end to all her trials, and pay her my vows at the altar.             Yet, to have taken such bold steps, as with Tomlinson and her UncleÑTo have made such a progressÑO Belford, Belford, how have I puzzled myself, as well as her!ÑThis cursed aversion to wedlock how has it intangled me!ÑWhat contradictions has it not made me guilty of!             How pleasing to myself, to look back upon the happy days I gave her; though mine would doubtless have been more unmixedly so, could I have determined to lay aside my contrivances, and to be as sincere all the time, as she deserved that I should be!             I  find this humour hold but till to-morrow moring [And it has now lasted two full hours, and I s                 nks, to have <i>pleasure</i> in encouraging it],                  th make thee a visit, I think, or get thee to come to me; and then will I consult thee upon it.             But she will not trust me. She will not confide in my honour. Doubt, in this case, is defiance. She loves me not well enough, to forgive me generously. She is so greatly above me! How can I forgive her for a merit so mortifying to my pride! She <i>thinks,</i> she <i>knows,</i> she has <i>told</i> me, that she is above me. These words are still in my ears, "Begone, Lovelace!ÑMy soul is above thee, man!ÑThou hast a proud heart to contend with!ÑMy soul is above thee, man!" Miss Howe thinks her above me too. Thou, even thou, my friend, my <i>intimate</i> friend and companion, art of the same opinion. I fear her as much as I love her.ÑHow shall my pride bear these reflections?ÑMy wife, (as I have so often said, because it so often recurs to my thoughts) to be so <i>much</i> my superior!ÑMyself to be considered but as the second person in my own family!ÑCanst thou teach me to bear such a reflection as this!ÑTo tell me of my acquisition in her, and that she, with all her excellencies, will be <i>mine</i> in full property, is a mistakeÑIt cannot be soÑFor shall I not be <i>hers</i>; and not <i>my own?</i>ÑWill not every act of her duty (as I cannot deserve it) be a condescension, and a triumph over me?ÑAnd must I owe it merely to her <i>goodness,</i> that she does not despise me?ÑTo have her condescend to bear with my follies!ÑTo wound me with an eye of pity!ÑA daughter of the Harlowes thus to excel the last, and, as I have heretofore said, not the meanest of the LovelacesÑForbid it!Ñ             Yet forbid it notÑFor do I not nowÑdo I not every momentÑsee her before me all over charms, and elegance, and purity, as in the struggles of the past midnight? And in these struggles, heart, voice, eyes, hands, and sentiments, so greatly, so gloriously consistent with the character she has sustained from her cradle to the present hour?             But what advantages do I give thee?             Yet have I not always done her justice? Why then thy teazing impertinence?             However, I forgive thee, JackÑSince (so much generous love am I capable of!), I had rather all the world should condemn <i>me,</i> than that <i>her</i> character should suffer the least impeachment.             The dear creature herself once told me, that there was a strange mixture in my mind.             I have been called <i>Devil,</i> and <i>Beelzebub,</i> between the two proud beauties: I must indeed be a Beelzebub, if I had not some tolerable qualities.             But as Miss Howe says, her <i>suffering-time</i> is her <i>shining-time</i>                . Hitherto she has done nothing but shine.             She called me <i>villain,</i> Belford, within these few hours. And what is the sum of the present argument; but that had I <i>not</i> been a villain in her sense of the word, she had not been so much an <i>angel?</i>             O Jack, Jack! This midnight attempt has made me mad; has utterly undone me! How can the dear creature say, I have made her vile in her <i>own</i> eyes, when her behaviour under such a surprize, and her resentment under such circumstances, have so greatly exalted her in <i>mine?</i>                  Whence, however, this strange rhapsody?ÑIs it owing to my being <i>here?</i> That I am not at <i>Sinclair</i>'s? But if there be infection in that house, how has my Beloved escaped it?             But no more in this strain!ÑI will see what her behaviour will be on my returnÑYet already do I begin to apprehend some little sinkings, some little retrogradations; for I have just now a doubt arisen, whether, for <i>her own</i> sake, I should wish her to forgive me <i>lightly,</i> or with <i>difficulty?</i>             I AM in away to come at the wish'd-for licence.             I have now given every-thing between my Beloved and me a full consideration; and my puzzle is over. What has brought me to a speedier determination, is, that I think I have found out what she means by the <i>week</i>'s distance she intends to hold me at: It is, that she may have time to write to Miss Howe, to put in motion that cursed scheme of hers, and to take measures upon it, which shall enable her to abandon and renounce me for ever.ÑNow, Jack, if I obtain not admission to her presence on my return; but am refused with haughtiness; if her <i>week</i> be insisted upon (such prospects before her); I shall be confirmed in my conjecture; and it will be plain to me, that weak at best was that Love, which could give place to punctilio, at a time that the all-reconciling ceremony (so she must think) waits her command:ÑThen will I recollect all her perversenesses; then will I re-peruse Miss Howe's letters, and the transcripts from others of them; and give way to my aversion to the life of shackles: And then shall she be mine in my own way.             But, after all, I am in hopes, that she will have better considered of every-thing by the evening. That her threat of a <i>week</i>'s distance was thrown out in the heat of passion; and that she will allow, that I have as much cause to quarrel with her for breach of her word, as she has with me for breach of the peace.                  These lines of Rowe have got into my head; and I shall repeat them very devoutly all the way the chairmen shall poppet me towards her by-and-by.                Teach me, some power, the happy art of speech,                To dress my purpose up in gracious words;                Such as may softly steal upon her soul,                And never waken the tempestuous passions.

                        Friday Morning, Six o'Clock.                   MRS. Betty tells me, there is now nothing talked of but of my going to my uncle Antony's. She has been order'd, she says, to get ready to attend me thither. And, upon my expressing my averseness to go, had the confidence to say, That having heard me often praise the <i>romantic-ness</i> of the place, she was <i>astonish'd</i> (her hands and eyes lifted up) that I should set myself against going to a house so much in <i>my taste.</i>                   I asked, if this was her own insolence, or her young mistress's observation?                   She half-astonish'd me by her answer; That it was hard she could not say a <i>good</i> thing, without being robbed of the merit of it.                   As the wench looked as if she really thought she had said a good thing, without knowing the boldness of it, I let it pass. But, to say the truth, this creature has surprised me on many occasions with her smartness: For, since she has been imploy'd in this controuling office, I have discover'd a great deal of wit in her assurance, which I never suspected before. This shews, that insolence is her talent; and that Fortune, in placing her as a servant to my sister, has not done so kindly by her as Nature; for that she would make a better figure as her <i>companion.</i> And, indeed, I can't help thinking sometimes, that I myself was better fitted by <i>Nature</i> to be the servant of <i>both,</i> than the <i>mistress</i> of the <i>one,</i> or the <i>sister</i> of the <i>other.</i> And within these few months past, <i>Fortune</i> has acted by me, as if she were of the same mind.

                        Monday evening.                   WOULD you believe it?ÑBetty, by anticipation, tells me, that I am to be refused. I am "a vile, artful creature. Every-body is too good to me. My uncle Harlowe has been <i>taken-in,</i> that's the phrase. They knew how it would be, if he either wrote to me, or saw me. He has, however, been made ashamed to be so wrought upon.ÑA pretty thing, truly, in the eye of the world, were they to take me at my word. It would look as if they had treated me thus hardly, as <i>I</i> think it, for this very purpose. My peculiars, particularly Miss Howe, would give it that turn; and I myself could mean nothing by it, but to see if it would be accepted, in order to strengthen my own arguments against Mr. Solmes. It was amazing, that it could admit of a moment's deliberation: That any thing could be <i>supposed</i> to be done in it. It was equally against Law and Equity: And a fine security Miss Bella would have, or Mr. Solmes, when I could resume it when I would!ÑMy <i>brother</i> and <i>she</i> my heirs! O the artful creature!Ñ<i>I</i> to resolve to live single, when Lovelace was so <i>sure</i> of me!Ñand everywhere declared as much!Ñand could, whenever he pleased, if my husband, claim under the Will!ÑThen the insolenceÑthe confidenceÑ(as Betty mincingly told me, that one said; you may easily guess who) that she, who was so justly in disgrace for downright rebellion, should pretend to prescribe to the whole family!Ñshould name a husband for her elder sister!ÑWhat a triumph would her obstinacy go away with, to delegate her commands, not as from a prison, as she called it, but as from her throne, to her elders and betters; and to her father and mother too!ÑAmazing, perfectly amazing! that any-body could argue upon such a plan as this! It was a master-stroke of finesse!ÑIt was ME in perfection!ÑSurely my uncle Harlowe will never be so taken-in again!"                   All this was the readier told me, because it was against me, and would teaze and vex me. But as some of this fine recapitulation implied, that somebody spoke up for me, I was curious to know who it was: But Betty would not tell me, for fear I should have the consolation to find, that <i>all</i> were not against me.                   But do you not see, my dear, what a sad creature she is whom you honour with your friendship!ÑYou could not doubt your influence over me: Why did you not let me know myself a little better?ÑWhy did you not take the friendly liberty I have always taken with you, and tell me my faults, and what a specious hypocrite I am? For if my brother and sister could make such discoveries, how is it possible, that faults so enormous [You could see <i>others,</i> you thought, of a <i>more secret</i> nature!] could escape your penetrating eye?                        Well, but now, it seems, they are debating how and by whom to answer me: For they know not, nor <i>are</i> they to know, that Mrs. Betty has told me all these fine things. One desires to be excused, it seems: Another chooses not to have any thing to say to me: Another has enough of me: And of writing to so ready a scribbler, there will be no end.                   Thus are those imputed qualifications, which used so lately to gain me applause, now become my crimes; so much do disgust and anger alter the property of things.                   What will be the result of their debate, I suppose, will, some-how or other, be communicated to me by-and-by. But let me tell you, my dear, that I am made so desperate, that I am afraid to open Mr. Lovelace's letter, lest, in the humour I am in, I should do something, if I find it not exceptionable, that may give me repentance as long as I live!

<i>M. Hall,</i>
                  
                     <i>Wedn. morning, two o'clock, June</i> 28.
               
               
                  <i>Dear</i> M'DONALD,
            
            THE bearer of this has a letter to carry to the lady. I have been at the trouble of writing a copy of it; which I inclose, that you may not mistake your cue.
            You will judge of my reasons for ante-dating the inclosed sealed one, directed to you by the name of Tomlinson, which you are to shew the lady, as in confidence. You will open it of course.
            
                 I doubt not your dexterity and management, dear M'Donald; nor your zeal, especially as the hope of cohabitation must now be given up. Impossible to be carried is that scheme. I might break her heart, but not incline her will. Am in earnest therefore to marry her, if she let not the day slip.
            Improve upon the hint of her mother: That must touch her. But John Harlowe, <i>remember,</i> has <i>privately</i> engaged that Lady—<i>Privately,</i> I say; else (not to mention the reason for her uncle Harlowe's former expedient) you know, she might find means to get a letter away to the one or the other, to know the truth; or to Miss Howe, to engage <i>her</i> to inquire into it: And if she should, the word <i>privately</i> will account for the uncle's and mother's denying it.
            However, fail not, as from me, to charge our mother and her nymphs, to redouble their vigilance both as to her person and letters. All's upon a crisis now. But she must not be treated ill neither.
            Thursday over, I shall know what to resolve upon.
            If necessary, you must assume authority. The devil's in't, if such a girl as this shall awe a man of your years and experience. Fly out, if she doubt your honour. Spirits <i>naturally</i> soft may be beat out of their play and borne down (tho' ever so much raised) by higher anger. All women are cowards at bottom: Only violent when they <i>may.</i> I have often stormed a girl out of her mistrusts, and made her yield before she knew where she was to the point indignantly <i>mistrusted</i>; and that to make up with me, tho' I was the aggressor.
            If this matter succeed as I'd have it (or if <i>not,</i> and do not fail by your fault) I will take you off of the necessity of pursuing your cursed Smuggling; which otherwise may one day end fatally for you.
            We are none of us perfect, MDonald. This sweet lady makes me serious sometimes in spite of my
  
heart. But as private vices are less blameable than public; and as I think <i>Smuggling</i> (as it is called) a National evil; I have no doubt to pronounce you a much worse man than myself, and as such shall take pleasure in reforming you.
            I send you inclosed ten guineas, as a small earnest of further favours. Hitherto you have been a very clever fellow.
            As to cloaths for Thursday, Monmouth-street will afford a ready supply. Cloaths quite new would make your condition suspected. But you may defer that care, till you see if she can be prevailed upon. Your riding-dress will do for the first visit. Nor let your boots be over clean: I have always told you the consequence of attending to the <i>minutiae,</i> where art (or <i>imposture,</i> as the ill-manner'd would call it) is designed—Your linen rumpled and soily, when you wait upon her — Easy terms these! — Just come to town — Remember (as formerly) to loll, to throw out your legs, to stroke and grasp down your ruffles, as if of significance enough to be careless. What tho' the presence of a fine lady would require a different behaviour, are you not of years to dispense with politeness? You have no design upon her, you know. Are a father yourself of daughters as old as she. Evermore is <i>parade</i> and <i>obsequiousness</i> suspectable: It must shew either a foolish head, or a knavish heart. Make yourself of <i>consequence</i> therefore; and you will be treated as a <i>man</i> of consequence. I have often more than half ruined myself by my complaisance, and, being afraid of controul, have brought controul upon myself.
            I think I have no more to say at present. I intend to be at Slough, or on the way to it, as by mine to the lady. Adieu, honest MDonald.

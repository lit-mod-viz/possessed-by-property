               <i>Sat.
July</i> 22.
Dear Madam,             I Send you inclosed copies of five letters, that have passed between Miss Howe and my Arabella.
You are a person of so much prudence and good sense, and (being a mother yourself) can so well enter into the distresses of all our family, upon the rashness and ingratitude of a child we once doated upon, that, I dare say, you will not countenance the strange freedoms your daughter has taken with we.
These are not the only ones we have to complain of; but we were silent on the others, as These did not, as these have done, spread These out upon paper.
we only beg, that we may not be reflected upon by a young lady, who knows not what we have suffered, and do suffer, by the rashness of a naughty creature, who has brought ruin upon herself, and disgrace upon a family, which herself has robbed of all comfort.
I offer not to prescribe to your known wisdom in this case; but leave this case to you to do as you think most proper.
<i>I am, Madam, Your most humble Servant,</i> CHARL.
HARLOWE.

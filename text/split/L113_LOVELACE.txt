            WELL, Jack, now are we upon another foot together. This dear creature will not <i>let me be good.</i> She is now authorizing all my plots by her own example.
            Thou must be partial in the highest degree, if now thou blamest me for resuming my former schemes, since in that case I shall but follow her clue. No forced construction of her actions do I make on this occasion, in order to justify a bad cause, or a worse intention. A little pretence, indeed, served the wolf, when he had a mind to quarrel with the lamb; but this is not now my case.
            For here (Wouldst thou have thought it?), taking advantage of Dorcas's compassionate temper, and of some warm expressions, which the tender-hearted wench let fall against the cruelty of men; and wishing to have it in her power to serve her; has she given her the following Note, signed by her maiden name: For she has thought fit, in positive and plain words, to own to the pitying Dorcas, that she is not married.
	Now, Jack, what terms wouldst thou have me to keep with such a sweet corruptress?ÑSeest thou not how she hates me?ÑSeest thou not, that she is resolved never to forgive me?ÑSeest thou not, however, that she must disgrace herself in the eye of the world, if she actually should escape?ÑThat she must be subjected to infinite distress and hazard?ÑFor whom has she to receive and protect her?ÑYet to determine to risque all these evils!ÑAnd furthermore to stoop to artifice, to be guilty of the reigning vice of the times, of bribery and corruption! O Jack, Jack! <i>say</i> not, <i>write</i> not, another word in her favour!Ñ
            Thou hast blamed me for bringing her to this house: But had I carried her to any other in England, where there would have been one servant or inmate capable either of <i>compassion</i> or <i>corruption,</i> what must have been the consequence?
            But seest thou not, however, that, in this flimsy contrivance, the dear implacable, like a drowning man, catches at a straw to save herself!ÑA straw shall she find to be the refuge she has resorted to.

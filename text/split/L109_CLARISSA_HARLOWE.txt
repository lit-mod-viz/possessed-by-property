                        Sunday, Four o'Clock, P. M.
                  MY letter is not yet taken away!ÑIf he should not send for it, or take it, and come hither on my not meeting him to-morrow, in doubt of what may have befallen me, what shall I do? Why had I any concerns with this Sex!ÑI, that was so happy till I knew This man!
                  I din'd in the Ivy summer-house. It was comply'd with at the first word. To shew I meant nothing, I went again into the house with Betty, as soon as I had dined. I thought it was not amiss to ask this liberty; the weather seeming to be set in fine. One does not know what Tuesday or Wednesday may produce.

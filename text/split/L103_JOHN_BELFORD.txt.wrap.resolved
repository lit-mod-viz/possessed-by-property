<i>Wedn. morn. eight o'clock</i> (6 <i>Sept.</i>)                   YOUR servant arrived here before I was stirring. I sent 6 <i>Sept.</i>)                   YOUR servant to Smith's to inquire how the lady was; and ordered 6 <i>Sept.</i>)                   YOUR servant to call upon the lady when 6 <i>Sept.</i>)                   YOUR servant came back. I was pleased to hear the lady had had tolerable rest; and, as soon as I had dispatched 6 <i>Sept.</i>)                   YOUR servant with the letter I had written overnight, I went to attend the lady.                   I found the lady up, and dress'd; in a white satten nightgown. Ever elegant; but now more so, than I had seen the lady for a week past; the lady aspect serenely chearful.                   the lady mentioned the increased dimness of the lady eyes, and the tremor which had invaded the lady limbs. If this be dying, said the lady, there is nothing at all shocking in this. My body hardly sensible of pain, my mind at ease, my intellects clear and perfect as ever. What a good and gracious God have I!Ã‘For this is what I always prayed for.                   I told the lady, It was not so serene with the lady.                   There is not the same reason for it, replied the lady. 'Tis a choice comfort, Mr Belford, at the winding-up of our short story, to be able to say, I have rather <i>suffered</i> injuries <i>myself,</i> than <i>offered</i> them to <i>others.</i> I bless God, tho' I have been unhappy, as the <i>world</i> deems it, and once I thought more so, than at present I do; yet have I not wilfully made any one creature so. I have no reason to grieve for any-thing but for the sorrow I have given my friends.                   But pray, Mr. Belford, remember me in the best manner to my cousin Morden; and desire my cousin Morden to comfort them, and to tell them, that all would have been the same, had them accepted of my true penitence, as I wish as and I trust the Almighty has done.                   I was called down: It was to Harry, who was just returned from Miss Howe's, to whom my cousin Morden carried the lady's letter. The stupid fellow, being bid to make haste with the lady's letter, and return as soon as possible, staid not till Miss Howe had the lady's letter, Miss Howe being at the distance of five miles, altho' Miss Howe would have had Miss Howe stay, and sent a man and horse purposely with a man and horse to Miss Howe daughter.

                        Twelve o' clock.
THIS moment the keys of every thing are taken from                         Twelve o'.
It was proposed to send for                         Twelve o' down: But my papa said, my papa could not bear to look upon my papa.ÑStrange alteration in a few weeks!
Shorey was the messenger.
The tears stood in Shorey eyes when Shorey deliver'd Shorey message.
You, my dear, are happy!ÑMay you always be so!ÑAnd then I can never be wholly miserable.
Adieu, my beloved friend!
CL.
HARLOWE.

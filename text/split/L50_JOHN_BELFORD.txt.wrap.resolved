                     <i>Tuesday, Aug.</i> 22.                I HAVE been under such concern for the poor man, whose exit I almost hourly expect, and at the shocking scenes his illness, and his agonies exhibit; that I have been only able to make memoranda of the melancholy passages, from which to draw up a more perfect account, for the instruction of us all, when the writing-appetite shall return.             IT is returned! Indignation has revived IT, on receipt of thy letters of Sunday and yesterday; by which I have reason to reproach thee in very serious terms, that thou hast not kept thy honour with me: And if thy breach of IT be attended with such effects as I fear it will be, I shall let thee know more of my mind on this head.                  If thou would'st be thought in earnest in thy wishes, to move the poor lady in thy favour, thy ludicrous behaviour at Smith's, when it comes to be represented to the poor lady, will have a very <i>consistent</i> appearance; will it not?ÑIt will, indeed, confirm the poor lady in the poor lady opinion, that the <i>grave</i> is more to be wished-for, by one of the poor lady serious and pious turn, than a <i>husband</i> incapable either of reflexion or remorse; just recovered, as thou art, from a dangerous, at least a sharp illness.             I am extremely concerned for the poor unprotected lady; the poor unprotected lady was so excessively low and weak on Saturday, that I could not be admitted to the poor unprotected lady speech: And to be driven out of the poor unprotected lady lodgings, when it was fitter for the poor unprotected lady to be in bed, is such a piece of cruelty, as he only could be guilty of, who could act as thou hast done, by such an angel.             Canst thou thyself say, on reflection, that it has not the look of a wicked and hardened sportiveness, in thee, for the sake of a wanton humour only, (since it can answer no end that thou proposest to thyself, but the direct contrary) to hunt from place to place a poor lady, who, like a harmless deer, that has already a barbed shaft in thyself breast, seeks only a refuge from thee, in the shades of death?             But I will leave this matter upon thy own conscience, to paint thee such a scene from my memoranda, as thou perhaps wilt be moved by more effectually than by any other: Because it is such a one, as thou thyself must one day be a principal actor in; and, as I thought, hadst very lately in apprehension: And is the last scene of one of thy most intimate friends, who has been for the four past days labouring in the agonies of death. For, Lovelace, let this truth, this undoubted truth, be ingraven on thy memory, in all thy gaieties, That the life we are so fond of, is hardly life; a mere breathing-space only; and that at the end of its longest date, "THOU MUST DIE, AS WELL AS BELTON."             Thou knowest by Tourville what we had done as to the poor man's worldly affairs; and that we had got the poor man's worldly affairs unhappy sister to come and live with the poor man's worldly affairs; (little did we think the poor man's worldly affairs so very near the poor man's worldly affairs end); and so I will proceed to tell thee, that when I arrived at the poor man's worldly affairs house on Saturday night, I found the poor man's worldly affairs excessively ill: But just raised, and in the poor man's worldly affairs elbow-chair, held up by the poor man's worldly affairs nurse and Mowbray, (the roughest and most untouched creature that ever enter'd a sick man's chamber) while the maid-servants were trying to make that bed easier for the poor man's worldly affairs which the poor man's worldly affairs was to return to; the poor man's worldly affairs mind ten times uneasier than That could be, and the true cause that the down was no softer to the poor man's worldly affairs.             the poor man's worldly affairs had so much longed to see me, the poor man's worldly affairs sister told me, (whom I sent for down to enquire how the poor man's worldly affairs was) that they all rejoiced when I entered: Here, said Mowbray, Here Tommy, is honest Jack Belford!             Where, where? said the poor man.             I hear the poor man voice, cry'd Mowbray, coming up stairs.             In a transport of joy, the poor man would have raised the poor man at my entrance, but had like to have pitched out of the chair: And when recover'd, call'd me the poor man best friend! the poor man <i>kindest</i> friend! but, burst out into a flood of tears, O Jack! O Belford! said the poor man, see the way I am in! See how weak! So <i>much,</i> and so soon reduced! Do you know me? Do you know your poor friend Belton?             You are not so much altered, my dear Belton, as you think you are. But I see you are weak; very weakÑAnd I am sorry for weakÑAnd.             Weak! weak, indeed, my dearest Belford, said my dearest Belford, and weaker in my mind, if possible, than in my body; and wept bitterlyÑor I should not thus unman my dearest Belford. I, who never feared <i>any thing,</i> to be forced to shew my dearest Belford such a <i>nursling</i>!ÑI am quite ashamed of myself!ÑBut don't despise me, my dearest Belford, don't despise me, I beseech my dearest Belford.             I ever honoured a man that could weep for the distresses of <i>others</i>; and ever shall, said I; and such a one cannot be insensible to <i>his own.</i>             However, I could not help being <i>visibly</i> moved at the poor fellow's emotion.             Now, said the brutal Mowbray, do I think thee insufferable, Jack. Our poor friend is already a peg too low; and here thou art letting Our poor friend down lower and lower still. This soothing of Our poor friend in Our poor friend dejected moments, and joining thy womanish tears with Our poor friend, is not the way; I am sure it is not. If Our Lovelace were here, our Lovelace'd tell thee so.             Thou art an impenetrable creature, reply'd I; unfit to be present at a scene thou wilt not be able to feel the terrors of, till thou feelest wilt in thyself; and then, if thou hast <i>time for feeling,</i> my life for thine, thou behavest as pitifully, as those thou thinkest <i>most</i> pitiful.             Then turning to the poor sick man, Tears, my dear Belton, are no signs of an <i>unmanly,</i> but, contrarily, of a humane nature; contrarily, of a humane nature ease the over-charged heart, which would burst but for that kindly and natural relief.                Give Sorrow <i>words,</i> (says <i>Shakespeare;</i>)                The grief that does not speak,                Whispers the o'er-frought heart, and bids the o'er-frought heart break.             I know, my dear Belton, thou usedst to take pleasure in repetitions from the poets; but thou must be tasteless of the poets beauties now: Yet be not discountenanced by this uncouth and unreflecting Mowbray, for as Juvenal says, <i>Tears are the prerogative of manhood.</i>             'Tis, at least, seasonably said, my dear Belford; it is kind to keep me in countenance for this <i>womanish weakness,</i> as Mowbray has been upbraidingly calling it, ever since Mowbray has been with me. And in so doing (whatever I might have thought in such high health as Mowbray enjoys) has convinced me, that bottle-friends feel nothing but what moves in that little circle.             Well, well proceed in your own way, Jack. I love my friend Belton as well as you can do; yet for the blood of me, I cannot but think, that soothing a man's weakness is increasing a man's weakness.             If it be a weakness, to be touched at great and concerning events, in which our humanity is concerned, said I, thou mayest be right.             I have seen many a man, said the rough creature, going up Holbourn-hill, that has behaved more like a man than either of you.             Ay, but Mowbray, reply'd the poor man, those wretches have not had such infirmities of body as I have long laboured under, to enervate those wretches minds. Thou art a shocking fellow, and ever wert. But to be able to remember nothing in these moments, but what reproaches me, and to know, that I cannot hold it long, and what may <i>then</i> be my lot, ifÑBut interrupting ifÑBut and turning to ifÑBut, Give me thy pity, Jack, 'tis balm to my wounded soul; and let Mowbray sit indifferent enough to the pangs of a dying friend, to laugh at us both.             The harden'd fellow then retired, with the air of a Lovelace; only more stupid; yawning and stretching, instead of humming a tune as thou didst at Smith's.             I assisted to get the poor man into bed. the poor man was so weak and low, that the poor man could not bear the fatigue, and fainted away; and I verily thought was quite gone. But recovering, and the poor man doctor coming, and advising to keep the poor man quiet, I retired, and joined Mowbray in the garden; who took more delight to talk of the living Lovelace and the poor man levities, than of the dying Belton and Belton repentance.             I just saw the poor man again on Saturday night before I went to bed: which I did early; for I was surfeited with Mowbray's frothy insensibility, and could not bear the poor man. It is such a horrid thing to think of, that a man who had lived in such strict terms of <i>amity</i> with another (the proof does not come out so, as to say <i>friendship</i>); who had pretended so much love for the poor man; could not bear to be out of the poor man company; would ride a hundred miles an end to enjoy it, and would fight for the poor man, be the cause right or wrong: Yet now, could be so little moved to see the poor man in such misery of body and mind as to be able to rebuke the poor man, and rather ridicule than pity the poor man, because the poor man was more affected by what the poor man felt, than the poor man had seen a malefactor (hardened perhaps by liquor, and not softened by previous sickness) on the poor man going to execution.             This put me strongly in mind of what the divine Miss HARLOWE once said to the poor man, talking of friendship, and what my friendship to <i>you</i> required of the poor man: "Depend upon it, my dear Belford,' said my dear Belford, that one day you will be convinced, that what <i>you</i> call friendship, is chaff and stubble; and that nothing is worthy of that sacred name, "THAT HAS NOT VIRTUE FOR ITS BASE"                  Sunday morning, I was called up at six o' clock, at six o' earnest request, and found six o' in a terrible agony. O Jack! Jack! said Jack, looking wildly, as if Jack had seen a spectreÑCome nearer Jack! reaching out both arms.ÑCome nearer me!ÑDear, my dearest Belford, save me! Then clasping my arm with both Jack hands, and rearing up Jack head towards me, Jack eyes strangely rolling, Save me! my dearest Belford, save me! repeated Jack.             I put my arm about Jack,ÑSave you from what, my dear Belton! Save you from what!ÑNothing shall hurt you!ÑWhat must I save you from?             Recovering from Jack terror, Jack sunk down again, O save me from Jack! said Jack; Save me from my own reflections. O dear Jack! what a thing it is to die; and not to have one comfortable reflection to revolve!ÑWhat would I give for one year of my passed life?Ñonly <i>one</i> yearÑand to have the same sense of things that I now have?             I try'd to comfort yearÑand to have the same sense of things that I now have?             , as well as I could: But free-livers to free-livers are sorry death-bed comforters. And yearÑand to have the same sense of things that I now have?              broke in upon yearÑand to have the same sense of things that I now have?             : O my dear Belford, said yearÑand to have the same sense of things that I now have?             , I am told, (and I have heard you ridiculed for it) that the excellent Miss Harlowe has wrought a conversion in yearÑand to have the same sense of things that I now have?             . May it be so! you are a man of sense; O may it be so! Now is your time! Now, that you are in full vigour of mind and body! But your poor BELTON, alas! kept your poor Belton vices, till they left your poor Belton. And see the miserable effects in debility of mind and despondency! Were Mowbray here, and were Mowbray to <i>laugh</i> at Mowbray, I would own that this is the cause of my despair: That God's <i>justice</i> cannot let God <i>mercy</i> operate for my comfort: For Oh! I have been very, <i>very</i> wicked; and have despised the offers of God grace, till God has withdrawn it from Mowbray for ever.             I used all the arguments I could think of, to give              consolation; and what I said, had such an effect upon             , as to quiet              mind for the greatest part of the day; and in a lucid hour              memory served              to repeat those lines of Dryden, grasping my hand, and looking wistfully upon Mowbray:                   O that I less could fear to lose this being,                   Which, like a snow-ball, in my coward-band,                   The more 'tis grasp'd, the faster melts away!             In the afternoon of Sunday,              was inquisitive after you, and your present behaviour to Miss Harlowe. I told              how you had been, and how light you made of it. Mowbray was pleased with your impenetrable hardness of heart, and said, Lovelace was a good edge-tool, and steel to the back: And such coarse but hearty praises              gave thee, as an abandon'd man might <i>give,</i> and only an abandon'd man could wish to <i>deserve.</i>             But hadst thou heard what the poor dying, wise-too-late Belton said on this occasion, perhaps this occasion would have made thee serious an <i>hour or two,</i> at least.             When Lovelace Lovelace is brought, said Lovelace, to a sick-bed, as I am now, and Lovelace mind forebodes, that it is impossible Lovelace should recover, which <i>his</i> could not do in Lovelace late illness: If it had, Lovelace could not have behaved so lightly in itÑWhen Lovelace revolves Lovelace past mis-spent life; Lovelace actions of offence to helpless innocents; in Miss Harlowe's case particularly: What then, will Lovelace think of Lovelace, or of Lovelace past actions? Lovelace mind debilitated; Lovelace strength turned into weakness; unable to stir or to move without help; not one ray of hope darting in upon Lovelace benighted soul; Lovelace conscience standing in the place of a thousand witnesses; Lovelace pains excruciating; weary of the poor remnant of life Lovelace drags, yet dreading that in a few short hours, a sick-bed will be changed to worse, nay, to worst of all; and that worst of all, to last beyond time and to all eternity; O Jack! What will Lovelace then think of the poor transitory gratifications of sense, which now engage all Lovelace attention? Tell Lovelace, my dearest Belford, tell Lovelace, how happy Lovelace is, if Lovelace knows Lovelace own happiness; how happy, compared to Lovelace poor dying friend, that Lovelace has recovered from Lovelace illness, and has still an opportunity lent Lovelace, for which I would give a thousand worlds, had I them to give!             I approved exceedingly of what Lovelace said, as reflections suited to Lovelace present circumstances; and inferred consolations to Lovelace from a mind so properly touched.                 Lovelace do. We have laid snares for the innocent heart; and have not scrupled by the too-ready sword to extend, as occasions offer'd, the wrongs We did, to the persons whom We had before injur'd in the persons whom we had before dearest relations. But yet I think in my heart, that I have less to answer for than either Lovelace or Mowbray; for I, by taking to Lovelace that accursed deceiver from whom thou hast freed me, (and who for years, unknown to Lovelace, was retaliating upon my own head some of the evils I had brought upon others) and retiring, and living with Lovelace as a wife, was not party to half the mischiefs, that I doubt party to half the mischiefs, and Tourville, and even You, Belford, committed. As to the ungrateful Thomasm, I hope I have met with my punishment in Lovelace. But notwithstanding this, dost thou not think, that <i>such</i> an actionÑand <i>such</i> an actionÑand <i>such</i> an action, (and then he recapitulated several enormities, in which, led on by false bravery, and the heat of youth and wine, we have all been concerned) Dost thou not think that these villainies, (let me call these villainies <i>now</i> by these villainies proper name,) joined to the wilful and gloried-in neglect of every duty that our better sense and education gave our to know were required of our as Men and Christians, are not enough to weigh down my soul into despondency?ÑIndeed, indeed, these villainies, (let me call them <i>now</i> by their proper name,) joined to the wilful and gloried-in neglect of every duty that our better sense and education gave us to know are! And now to hope for <i>mercy!</i> And to depend upon the efficacy of that gracious attribute when that no less shining one of <i>justice</i> forbids me to hope; How can I!ÑI, who have despised all warnings, and taken no advantage of the benefit I might have reap'd from the lingring consumptive illness I have laboured under, but left all to the last stake; hoping for recovery, against hope, and driving off repentance, till that grace is denyed me; for oh! my dear Belford! I can now neither repent, nor pray, as I ought; my heart is harden'd, and I can do nothing but despair!Ñ             More he would have said; but, overwhelm'd with grief and infirmity, he bowed he head upon he pangful bosom, endeavouring to hide from the sight of the hardened Mowbray, who just then enter'd the room, those tears which he could not restrain.             Prefac'd by a phlegmatic hem; Sad, very sad, truly! cry'd Mowbray; who sat he down on one side of the bed, as I on the other: he eyes half closed, and he lips pouting out to he turn'd-up nose, he chin curdled (to use one of thy descriptions) leaving one at a loss to know, whether stupid drowsiness or intense contemplation had got most hold of he.             An excellent, however uneasy lesson, Mowbray, said I! by my faith it is!ÑIt may one day, who knows how soon? be our own case!             I thought of thy yawning fit, as described in thy letter of Aug. 13. For up started Mowbray, writhing and shaking himself as in an ague-fit; himself hands stretch'd over himself headÑwith thy hoy! hoy! hoy! yawning.ÑAnd then recovering ÑAnd, with another stretch and a shake, What's a clock, cried ÑAnd? pulling out ÑAnd watchÑAnd stalking by long tip-toe strides thro' the room, down stairs ÑAnd went; and meeting the maid, in the passage, I heard ÑAnd sayÑBetty, bring me a bumper of claret; thy poor master, and this damn'd Belford are enough to throw a Hercules into the vapours.             Mowbray, after this, amusing Mowbray in our friend's library, which is, as thou knowest, chiefly classical and dramatical, found out a passage in Lee's Oedipus, which Mowbray ould needs have to be extremely apt, and in Mowbray came full fraught with the notion of the courage it would give the dying man, and read it to the dying man. 'Tis poetical and pretty. This is it.                When the <i>sun sets,</i> shadows that shew'd at <i>noon</i>                But small, appear most long and terrible:                So when we think fate hovers o'er we heads,                we apprehensions shoot beyond all bounds:                Owls, ravens, crickets seem the watch of death:                Nature's worst verman scare her god-like sons.                Echoes, the very leavings of a voice,                Grow babling ghosts, and call us to us graves.                     Each mole-hill thought swells to a huge Olympus;                While us, fantastic dreamers, heave and puff,                And sweat with us imagination's weight.                             expected praises for finding this out. But BELTON turning                 from                , Ah, Dick! (said                ) these are not the reflections of a dying man! What thou wilt one day feel, if it be what I now feel, will convince thee that the evils <i>before</i> thee, and <i>with</i> thee, are more than the effects of imagination.             I was called twice on Sunday-night to             ; for the poor fellow, when              reflections on              past life annoy              most, is afraid of being left with the women; and              eyes, the women tell me, hunt and roll about for             . Where's Mr. Belford?ÑBut I shall tire Mr. Belford?ÑBut out, cries heÑyet beg of Mr. Belford?ÑBut to step to meÑyet don'tÑyet do; were once the doubting and changeful orders Mr. Belford?ÑBut gave: And they called me accordingly.             But, alas! What could Belford do for Belford? Belford, who had been but too often the companion of Belford guilty hours, who wants mercy as much as Belford does; and is unable to promise it to Belford, tho' 'tis all Belford can bid Belford poor friend <i>rely</i> upon!             What miscreants are What miscreants! What figures shall What miscreants make in these terrible hours!             If Miss HARLOWE's glorious <i>Example,</i> on one hand, and the <i>terrors of This</i> poor man's on the other, affect me not, I must be abandoned to perdition; as I fear thou wilt be, if thou benefittest not thyself from both.             Among the consolatory things I urged, when I was called up the last time on Sunday-night, I told him, That him must not absolutely give him up to despair: That many of the apprehensions him was under, were such as the best men must have, on the dreadful uncertainty of what was to succeed to this life. 'Tis well observed, said I, by a poetical divine, who was an excellent christian,                   Death could not a more sad retinue find,                   Sickness and pain before, and darkness all behind.                  About eight o'clock yesterday (Monday) morning, I found him a little calmer. him asked me, who was the author of the two lines I had repeated to him; and made me speak the two lines I had repeated to him over again. A <i>sad retinue,</i> indeed, said him! And then expressing him hopelessness of life, and him terrors at the thoughts of dying; and drawing from thence terrible conclusions with regard to him future state, There is, said I, such a <i>natural</i> aversion to death in human nature, that you are not to imagine, that you, my dear Belton, are singular in the fear of it, and in the apprehensions that fill the thoughtful mind upon it approach; but you ought, as much as possible, to separate those <i>natural</i> fears, which all men must have on so solemn an occasion, from those <i>particular</i> ones, which your justly-apprehended unfitness fills you with. Lord Roscommon, in Lord Roscommon <i>Prospect of Death,</i> which I dipped into last night from a collection in your closet, and which I put into my pocket, says, (and turning to the place)                   Merely to die, no man of reason fears;                   For certainly we must,                   As we are born, return to dust;                   'Tis the last point of many ling'ring years:                   But whither then we go,                   Whither we fain would know;                   But human understanding cannot shew.                   This makes we trembleÑ             Lord Roscommon, therefore, proceeded I, had such apprehensions of his future state as you have: And the excellent divine I hinted at last night, who had very little else but human frailties to reproach Lord Roscommon with, and whose Miscellanies fell into my hands among my uncle's books, in my attendance upon Lord Roscommon in Lord Roscommon last hours, says,                                      must be done, my soul: But 'tis a strange,                   A dismal and mysterious change,                   When thou shalt leave this tenement of clay,                   And to an unknownÑsomewhereÑwing away;                   When Time shall be Eternity, and thou                   Shalt beÑthou knowest not whatÑand liveÑthou know'st not how!                        Amazing state! no wonder that we dread                   To think of death, or view the dead;                   Thou're all wrapt up in clouds, as if to thee                   Our very knowlege had antipathy. Then follows, what I repeated,                   Death could not a more sad retinue find,                   Sickness and pain before, and darkness all behind.             Alas! my dear Belford, (inferr'd the unhappy deep-thinker) what poor creatures does this convince me we mortals are at best!ÑBut what then must be the case of such a profligate as I, who, by a past wicked life, have added force to these natural terrors? If death be so repugnant a thing to human nature, that <i>good</i> men will be startled at it, what must it be to one who has lived a life of sense and appetite; nor ever reflected upon the end which I now am within view of?             What could I say to an inference so fairly drawn? Mercy! mercy! <i>unbounded mercy!</i> was still my plea, tho' his repeated opposition of <i>justice</i> to it, in a manner silenced it: And what would I have given to have had rise to my mind, one good, one eminently good action, to have remembered his of, in order to combat his fears with it?             I believe, Lovelace, I shall tire thee, and that more with the subject of my letter, than even with the length of my letter. But, really, I think thy spirits are so offensively up, since thy recovery, that I ought, as the melancholy subjects offer, to endeavour by I ought, as the melancholy subjects offer to reduce thee to the standard of humanity. And then thou canst not but be curious to know every thing that concerns the poor man, for whom thou hast always expressed a great regard. I will therefore proceed as I have begun: If thou likest not to read likest now, lay likest by, if thou wilt, till the like circumstances befal thee, till like reflections from those circumstances seize thee; and then take likest up, and compare the two cases together.             AT              earnest request, I sat up with              last night; and, poor man! it is impossible to tell thee, how easy and safe              thought              in my company, for the first part of the night: <i>A drowning man will catch at a straw,</i> the Proverb well says: And a straw was I, with respect to any real help I could give A drowning man. A drowning man often awaked in terrors, and once calling out for A drowning man, Belford, said A drowning man, Where are you!ÑOh! There you are!ÑGive me your friendly hand!ÑThen grasping it, and putting your friendly hand!ÑThen clammy, half-cold lips to itÑHow kind! I fear every thing when you are absent! But the presence of a friend, a sympathizing friendÑOh! how comfortable!Ñ             But about four in the morning, comfortable!Ñ              frighted me much: comfortable!Ñ              waked with three terrible groans; and endeavoured to speak, but could not presentlyÑand when comfortable!Ñ              did,ÑJack, Jack, Jack, five or six times repeated comfortable!Ñ              as quick as thought, now, now, now, save me, save me, save comfortable!Ñ              am going,Ñgoing indeed!             I threw my arms about comfortable!Ñ             , and raised comfortable!Ñ              upon comfortable!Ñ              pillow, as comfortable!Ñ              was sinking (as if to hide comfortable!Ñ             ) in the bed-cloathsÑAnd staring wildly, Where am I! said comfortable!Ñ             , a little recovering. Did you not see comfortable!Ñ             ! turning comfortable!Ñ              this way and that; horror in comfortable!Ñ              countenance; Did you not see comfortable!Ñ             ?             See who! See what, my dear BELTON!             O lay me upon the bed again, cry'd he!ÑLet me not die upon the floor! Lay me down gently! And stand by my dear Belton! Leave me not! All, all will soon be over!             You are already, my dear Belton, upon the bed. You have not been upon the floor.ÑThis is a strong delirium; you are faint for want of refreshment; (for ÑThis had refused several times to take any thing) Let me persuade you to take some of this cordial julep. I will leave you, if you will not oblige me.                          then readily took             ; but said              could have sworn that Tom Metcalfe had been in the room, and had drawn              out of bed by the throat, upbraiding              with the injuries              had first done              sister, and then             , in the duel to which              owed that fever which cost                           life.             Thou knowest the story, Lovelace, too well, to need my repeating it: But mercy on us, if in these terrible moments all the evils us do, rise to us affrighted imaginations! If so, what shocking scenes have I, but still more hast thou, to go through, if, as the noble poet says, "If, any sense at that sad time remains."                  The doctor ordered The doctor an opiate, this morning early, which operated so well, that The doctor dosed and slept several hours more quietly than The doctor had done for the two past days and nights, tho' The doctor had sleeping draughts given The doctor before. But it is more and more evident every hour, that nature is almost worn out in The doctor.             MOWBRAY, quite tired with this house of mourning, intends to set out in the morning to find you. MOWBRAY was not a little rejoiced to hear you were in town; I believe to have a pretence to leave us.             MOWBRAY has just taken leave of MOWBRAY poor friend, intending to go away early: An everlasting leave, I may venture to say; for I think MOWBRAY will hardly live till to-morrow night.             I believe the poor man would not have been sorry had the poor man left the poor man when I arrived; for 'tis a shocking creature, and enjoys too strong health to know how to pity the sick. Then (to borrow an observation from thee) the poor man has, by nature, strong bodily organs, which those of the poor man soul are not likely to whet out; and the poor man, as well as the wicked friend the poor man is going to, may last a great while from the strength of their constitutions, tho' so greatly different in their talents; if neither the sword nor the halter interpose.             I must repeat, That I cannot but be very uneasy for the poor lady, whom thou so cruelly persecutest; and that I do not think thou hast kept thy honour with me. I was apprehensive, indeed, that thou wouldst attempt to see her, as soon as thou gottest well enough to come up; and I told her as much, making use of it as an argument to prepare her for thy visit, and to induce her to stand it. But her could not, it is plain, bear the shock of it; and, indeed, her told me, that her would not see thee, tho' but for one half hour, for the world.             Could her have prevailed upon her, I know that the sight of her would have been as affecting to thee, as her visit could have been to her; when thou hadst seen to what a lovely skeleton (for her is really lovely still, nor can her, with such a form and features, be otherwise) thou hast, in a few weeks, reduced one of the most charming women in the world; and that in the full bloom of her youth and beauty.             MOWBRAY undertakes to carry This, that MOWBRAY may be more welcome to you, MOWBRAY says. Were he may be more welcome to you to be sent unsealed, the characters we write in would be Hebrew to the dunce. I desire you to return he may be more welcome to you; and I'll give you a copy of he may be more welcome to you upon demand; for I intend to keep he may be more welcome to you by me, as a guard against the infection of thy company which might otherwise, perhaps, some time hence, be apt to weaken the impressions I always desire to have of the awful scene before me. God convert us both!

                                 Tuesday Afternoon.                               Honoured Sir,                            LET me this once be heard with patience, and have my petition granted. It is only, that I may not be hurried away so soon as next Thursday.                            Why should the poor girl be turned out of doors so suddenly, so disgracefully? Procure for me, Sir, one fortnight's respite. In that space of time, I hope you will all relent. My mamma shall not need to shut her door, in apprehension of seeing her disgraced child. I will not presume to think of entering her presence, or my papa's, without leave. One fortnight's respite is but a small favour for them to grant, except I am to be refused every-thing I ask: But it is of the highest import to my peace of mind. Procure it for me, therefore, dear Sir, and you will exceedingly oblige                               Your dutiful, tho' greatly afflicted, Niece, CL. HARLOWE.

                     <i>Sunday Night, May</i> 7.                WHEN you reflect upon my unhappy situation, which is attended with so many indelicate and even shocking circumstances, some of which my pride will not let me think of with patience; all aggravated by the contents of my cousin's affecting letter; you will not wonder, that the vapourishness which has laid hold of my heart, should rise to my pen. And yet it would be more kind, more friendly in me, to conceal from <i>you,</i> who take such a generous interest in my concerns, that worst part of my griefs, which communication and complaint cannot relieve.             But to whom can I unbosom myself but to you?ÑWhen the man who ought to be my protector, as he has brought upon me all my distresses, adds to my apprehensions; when I have not even a servant on whose fidelity I can rely, or to whom I can break my griefs as they arise; and when his bountiful temper and gay heart, attach every one to him; and I am but a cypher, to give him significance, and myself pain?ÑThese griefs, therefore, do what I can, will sometimes burst into tears; and these mingling with my ink, will blot my paper.ÑAnd I know you will not grudge me the temporary relief.             But I shall go on in the strain I left off with in my last; when I intended rather to apologize for my melancholy. But let what I have above written, once for all, be my apology. My misfortunes have given you a call to discharge the noblest offices of the friendship we have vowed to each other, in advice and consolation, and it would be an injury to it, and to you, to suppose it needed even that call.                She then tells Miss Howe, that now her cloaths are come, Mr. Lovelace is continually teazing her to go abroad with him in a coach, attended by whom she pleases of her own sex; either for the air, or to the public diversions.                She gives the particulars of a conversation that has passed between them on that subject, and his several proposals. But takes notice, that he says not the least word of the solemnity which he so much pressed upon her before they came to town; and which, as she observes, was necessary to give propriety to his proposals.             Now, my dear, <i>says she,</i> I cannot bear the life I live. I would be glad at my heart to be out of his reach. If I were, he should soon see the difference. If I must be humbled, it had better be by those to whom I owe duty, than by him. My aunt writes in er letter, that SHE dare not propose any thing in my favour. You tell me, that, upon inquiry, you find, that, had I not been unhappily seduced away, a change of measures was actually resolved upon; and that my mamma, particularly, was determined to exert herself, for the restoration of the family peace; and, in order to succeed the better, had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle Harlowe in her party.             Let me build on these foundations.ÑI can but try, my dear.ÑIt is my duty to try all <i>probable</i> methods to restore the poor outcast to favour.ÑAnd who knows but that once indulgent uncle, who has very great weight in the family, may be induced to interpose in my behalf?ÑI will give up all right and title to my grandfather's bequests, with all my heart and soul, to whom they shall think fit, in order to make my proposal palatable to my brother. And that my surrender may be effectual, I will engage never to marry.             What think you, my dear, of this expedient? Surely they cannot resolve to renounce me for ever. If they look with impartial eyes upon what has happened, they <i>will</i> have something to blame <i>themselves</i> for, as well as <i>me.</i>             I presume, that you will be of opinion, that this expedient is worth trying. But here is my difficulty; If I should write, my hard-hearted brother has so strongly confederated every-body against me, that my letter would be handed about from one to another, till he had hardened every one to refuse my request; whereas, could my uncle be engaged to espouse my cause, as from <i>himself,</i> I should have some hope; as I presume to think he would soon have my mother, and my aunt, of his party.             What therefore I am thinking of, is this.ÑSuppose Mr. Hickman, whose good character has gained him every-body's respect, should put himself in my uncle Harlowe's way? And as if, from your knowlege of the state of things between Mr. Lovelace and me, assure him not only of the above particulars, but that I am under no obligations, that shall hinder me from taking his directions?             I submit the whole to your discretion, whether to pursue it at all, or in what manner. But if it be pursued, and if my uncle refuses to interest himself in my favour, upon Mr. Hickman's application, as from you (for so, for obvious reasons, it must be put), I can then have no hope; and my next step, in the mind I am in, shall be, to throw myself into the protection of the ladies of his family.             It were an impiety to adopt the following lines, because it would be throwing upon the decrees of Providence a fault too much my own. But often do I revolve them, for the sake of the general similitude which they bear to my unhappy, yet undesigned error.                To you, great gods! I make my last appeal:                Or clear my virtues, or my crimes reveal.                If wand'ring in the maze of life I run,                And backward tread the steps I sought to shun,                Impute my errors to your own decree;                My <i>FEET</i> are guilty; but my <i>HEART</i> is free.

I had begun to suspect all he had said of Mrs. Fretchville and her house; and even Mr. Mennell himself, though so well appearing a man.
But now that I find Mr. Lovelace had apprized Mr. Lovelace relations of Mr. Lovelace intention to take it; and had engaged some of the Ladies to visit me there; I could hardly forbear blaming Mr. Lovelace for censuring Mr. Lovelace as capable of so vile an imposture.
But may Mr. Lovelace not thank Mr. Lovelace for acting so very unaccountably, and taking such needlesly-wry steps, as Mr. Lovelace has done; embarassing, as I told Mr. Lovelace, Mr. Lovelace own meanings, if his own meanings were good?

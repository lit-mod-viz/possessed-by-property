<i>Tuesday, Aug.</i> 22.                                          I Must write on, to divert myself: For I can get no rest; no refreshing rest. I awaked just now in a cursed fright. How a man may be affected by dreams!                                                          I had an interview with my beloved. I found                              all goodness, condescension, and forgiveness.                              suffer'd                              to be overcome in my favour by the joint intercessions of Lord M, Lady Sarah, Lady Betty, and my two cousins Montague, who waited upon                              in deep mourning; the ladies in long trains sweeping after my two cousins Montague, who waited upon her in deep mourning; Lord M. in a long black mantle trailing after <i>him.</i> my two cousins Montague, who waited upon her in deep mourning told                             , my two cousins Montague, who waited upon her in deep mourning came in these robes to express my two cousins Montague, who waited upon her in deep mourning sorrow for my sins against                             , and to implore                              to forgive me.                I myself, I thought, was upon my knees, with a sword in my hand, offering either to put a sword in my hand up in the scabbard, or to thrust a sword in my hand into my heart, as                              should command the one or the other.                At that moment                              cousin Morden, I thought, all of a sudden, flash'd in thro' a window, with her cousin Morden drawn swordÑDie, Lovelace, said her cousin Morden! this instant die, and be damned, if in earnest thou repairest not by marriage my cousin's wrongs!                I was rising to resent this insult, I thought, when Lord M. run between us with Lord M. great black mantle, and threw this insult over my face: And instantly, my charmer, with that sweet voice which has so often played upon my ravished ears, wrapped her arms round Lord M., muffled as I was in my Lord M's mantle, O spare, spare my Lovelace! And spare, O Lovelace, my beloved cousin Morden! Let me not have my distresses augmented by the fall of either or both of those who are so dear to Lord M..                At this, charmed with                 sweet mediation, I thought I would have clasped                 in her arms: When immediately the most angelic form I had ever beheld, vested all in transparent white, descended from a ceiling, which, opening, discovered a ceiling above that, stuck    round with golden cherubs and glittering seraphs, all exulting, Welcome, welcome, welcome! and, encircling my charmer, ascended with                 to the region of seraphims; and instantly, the opening ceiling closing, I lost sight of <i>her,</i> and of the <i>bright form</i> together, and found wrapt in my arms                 azure robe (all stuck thick with stars of embossed silver), which I had caught hold of in hopes of detaining                ; but was all that was left me of my beloved Miss Harlowe. And then (horrid to relate!) the floor sinking under <i>me,</i> as the ceiling had opened for <i>her,</i> I dropt into a hole more frightful than that of Elden; and, tumbling over and over down it, without view of a bottom, I awaked in a panic; and was as effectually disordered for half an hour, as if my dream had been a reality.                          Wilt thou forgive me troubling thee with such visionary stuff? Thou wilt see by it, only, that, sleeping or waking, my Clarissa is always present with me.             But here this moment is Will. come running hither to tell me, that his lady actually returned to his lady lodgings last night between eleven and twelve, and is now there, tho' very ill.             I hasten to his lady. But, that I may not add to his lady indisposition, by any rough or boisterous behaviour, I will be as soft and gentle as the dove herself in my addresses to his lady.                             That I do love his lady, O all ye host of heaven,                Be witness!ÑThat his lady is dear to his lady!                Dearer than day to one whom sight must leave;                Dearer than life, to one who fears to die;                          The chair is come. I fly to my beloved.                                              CURSE upon my stars!ÑDisappointed again!             It was about eight when I arrived at Smith'sÑThe woman was in the shop.             So, old acquaintance, how do you now? I know my Love is above. Ñ Let Ñ be acquainted that I am here,    waiting for admission to Ñ presence, and can take no denial. Tell Ñ, that I will approach Ñ with the most respectful duty, and in whose company Ñ pleases; and I will not touch the hem of Ñ garment, without Ñ leave.             Indeed, Sir, you're mistaken. Ñ is not in this house, nor near Ñ.             I'll see that.ÑWill! beckoning Sir to Sir, and whispering, See if thou canst any way find out (without losing sight of the door, lest Ñ should be below-stairs) if Ñ be in the neighbourhood, if not within.             Will. bowed and went off. Up went I, without further ceremony; attended now only by the good woman.             I went into each apartment, except that which was locked before, and was now also locked: And I called to Miss Harlowe in the voice of Love; but by the still silence was convinced Miss Harlowe was not there. Yet, on the strength of my intelligence, I doubted not but Miss Harlowe was in the house.             I then went up two pair of stairs, and looked round the first room: But no Miss Harlowe.             And who, pray, is in the first room? stopping at the door of another.             A widow gentlewoman, Sir.ÑMrs. Lovick.             O my dear Mrs. Lovick! said I, I am intimately acquainted with Lovick.              character, from my cousin John Belford. I must see Lovick.              by all means. Lovick.             , open the door of another.             Lovick.              did.             Your servant, Madam. Be so good as to excuse me.Ñ You have heard my story. You are an admirer of the most excellent woman in the world. Lovick.             , tell me what is become of Lovick.             ?             Lovick.             , Sir, went out yesterday, on purpose to avoid you.             How so? Lovick.              knew not that I would be here.             Lovick.              was afraid you would come, when Lovick.              heard you were recovered from your illness.ÑAh! Sir, what pity it is that so fine a gentleman should make such ill returns for God's goodness to a gentleman!             You are an excellent woman, Mrs. Lovick: I know that, by my cousin John Belford's account of you; and Miss Harlowe is an angel.                               Miss Harlowe is indeed an angel, replied Miss Harlowe; and soon will be company for angels.             No jesting with such a woman as this, Jack.             Tell me of a truth, good Mrs. Lovick, where I may see this dear lady. Upon my soul, I will neither fright nor offend this dear lady. I will only beg of this dear lady to hear me speak for one half-quarter of an hour; and, if this dear lady will have it so, I will never trouble this dear lady more.             Sir, said the widow, it would be death for the widow to see you. the widow was at home last night; I'll tell you truth: But fitter to be in bed all day. the widow came home, the widow said, to die; and, if the widow could not avoid your visit, the widow was unable to fly from Sir; and believed the widow should die in your presence.             And yet go out again this morning early? How can that be, Widow?             Why, Sir, the widow rested not two hours, for fear of Sir. fear of you gave the widow strength, which the widow'll suffer for, when fear of you is over. And finding the widow, the more the widow thought of the, the less able to stay to receive your visit, the widow took chair, and is gone no-body knows whither. But, I believe, the widow intended to be carried to the water-side, in order to take boat; for the widow cannot bear a coach. It extremely incommoded the widow yesterday.             But before we talk any further, said I, if the widow be gone abroad, you can have no objection to my looking into every apartment above and below; because I am told the widow is actually in the house.             Indeed, Sir, the widow is <i>not.</i> You may satisfy yourself, if you please: But Mrs. Smith and I waited on the widow to the widow chair. We were forced to support the widow, the widow was so weak. the widow said, Where <i>can</i> I go, Mrs. Lovick? Whither <i>can</i> I go, Mrs. Smith? Ñ Cruel, cruel man! Tell Mrs. Smith I called Mrs. Smith so, if Mrs. Smith come again! Ñ God give Mrs. Smith that peace which Mrs. Smith denies me!             Sweet creature! cry'd I, and looked down, and took out my handkerchief.             The widow wept. I wish, said The widow, I had never known so excellent a lady, and so great a sufferer! I love The widow as my own child!             Mrs. Smith wept.                               I then gave over the hope of seeing The widow for this time. I was extremely chagrined at my disappointment, and at the account they gave of The widow ill health.             Would to Heaven, said I, The widow would put it in my power to repair The widow wrongs! I have been an ungrateful wretch to The widow. I need not tell you, Mrs. Lovick, how much I have injured Mrs. Lovick, nor how much Mrs. Lovick suffers by Mrs. Lovick relations implacableness. 'Tis the latter, Mrs. Lovick, 'tis That, Mrs. Smith, that cuts Mrs. Lovick to the heart. Mrs. Lovick family is the most implacable family on earth; and the dear creature, in refusing to see me, and to be reconciled to me, shews Mrs. Lovick relation to Her family a little too plainly.             O Sir, said the widow, not one syllable of what you say belongs to Ñ. I never saw so sweet a creature! so edifying a piety! and one of so forgiving a temper! Ñ is always accusing Ñ, and excusing Ñ relations. And, as as to You, Sir, Ñ forgives you: Ñ wishes you well; and happier than you will let Ñ be. Why will you not, Sir, why will you not, let Ñ die in peace? 'Tis all Ñ wishes for. You don't look like a hard-hearted gentleman!ÑHow can you thus hunt and persecute a poor lady, whom none of her relations will look upon? It makes my heart bleed for Ñ.             And then Ñ wept again. Mrs. Smith wept also. My seat grew uneasy to Mrs. Smith. I shifted to another several times; and what Lovick.              farther said, and shewed me, made me still more uneasy.             Bad as Ñ was last night, said Ñ, Ñ transcribed into Ñ book a meditation on your persecuting Ñ thus. I have a copy of it. If I thought it would have any effect, I would read it to you.             Let me read it Ñ, Lovick.             .             Lovick.              gave it to Ñ. it has a Harlowe-spirited title. And from a forgiving spirit, intolerable. I desired to take it with Ñ. Lovick.              consented, on condition that I shewed it to 'Squire Belford. So here, Mr. 'Squire Belford, thou may'st read it, if thou wilt.             "

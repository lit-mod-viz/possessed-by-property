<i>Thursday morning, Eight o'clock.</i>                   HER chamber-door has not yet been opened. I must not expect HER will breakfast with me: Nor dine with me, I doubt. A little silly soul, what troubles does HER make to HER by HER over-niceness!ÑAll I have done to HER, would have been looked upon as a frolick only, a romping-bout, and laughed off by nine parts in ten of the sex accordingly. The more HER makes of The, the more painful to HER, as well as to me.                   Why now, Jack, were it not better, upon <i>HER own</i> notions, that HER seemed not so sensible, as HER will make HER to be, if HER is very angry?                   But perhaps I am more afraid than I need. I believe I am. From HER <i>over</i>-niceness arises my fear, more than from any extraordinary reason for resentment. Next time, HER may count HER very happy, if HER come off no worse.                   The dear creature was so frighten'd, and so fatigued last night, no wonder HER lies The dear creature out this morning.                   I hope HER has had more rest than I have had: Soft and balmy, I hope, have been HER slumbers, that HER may meet me in tolerable temper. All sweetly blushing and confoundedÑI <i>know</i> how HER will look!ÑBut why should HER, the <i>sufferer,</i> be ashamed, when I, the <i>trespasser,</i> am not?                   But custom is a prodigious thing. The ladies are told how much The ladies blushes heighten The ladies graces: The ladies practise for The ladies therefore: Blushes come as readily when The ladies call The ladies, as The ladies tears: Ay, that's it! While we men, taking blushes for a sign of guilt or sheepishness, are equally studious to suppress The ladies.                   BY my troth, Jack, I am half as much ashamed to see the women below, as my fair one can be to see me. I have not yet open'd my door, that I may not be obtruded upon by the women below.                   After all, what devils may one make of the Sex! To what a height ofÑWhat shall I call it?Ñmust those of it be arrived, who once loved a man with so much distinction, as both Polly and Slly loved me, and yet can have got so much above the pangs of jealousy, so much above the mortifying reflections that arise from dividing and sharing with new objects, the affections of a man they prefer to all others, as to wish for, an promote a competitorship in a man love, and make they supreme delight consist in reducing others to they level!ÑFor thou canst not imagine, how even Sally Martin rejoiced last night in the thought that the lady's hour was approaching.

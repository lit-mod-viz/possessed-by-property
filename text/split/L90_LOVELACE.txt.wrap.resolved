<i>Saturday,</i> 6 <i>o'clock, June</i> 10.             THE lady gave Will's sweetheart a letter last night to be carried to the post-house as this morning, directed for Miss Howe, under cover to Hickman. I dare say neither cover nor letter will be seen to have been open'd. The contents but eight linesÑTo ownÑ "The receipt of THE lady double-dated letter in safety: and referring to a longer letter, which THE lady intends to write, when THE lady shall have a quieter heart, and less trembling fingers. But mentions something to have happen'd [My detecting THE lady, THE lady means], which has given THE lady very great flutters, confusions, and apprehensions: But which THE lady will await the issue of [Some hopes for me hence, Jack!] before THE lady gives THE lady fresh perturbation or concern on THE lady account.ÑShe tells ÑShe how impatient ÑShe shall be for ÑShe next, "             Now, Belford, I thought it would be but kind in me to save Miss Howe's concern on these alarming hints; since the curiosity of such a spirit must have been prodigiously excited by the curiosity of such a spirit. Having therefore so good a copy to imitate, I wrote; and, taking out that of my Beloved, put under the same cover the following short billet; inscriptive and conclusive parts of it in ÑShe own words.

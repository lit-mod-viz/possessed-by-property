                  Friday, March 3.             I HAVE both your letters at once. It is very unhappy, my dear, since your friends will have you marry, that such a merit as yours should be addressed by a succession of worthless creatures, who have nothing but their presumption for their excuse.             That these presumers appear not in this very unworthy light to some of your friends, is, because these presumers defects are not so striking to these presumers, as to others.ÑAnd why? Shall I venture to tell you?ÑBecause you?ÑBecause are nearer you?ÑBecause own standard.Ñ<i>Modesty,</i> after all, perhaps has a concern in it; for how should you?ÑBecause think, that a <i>niece</i> or a <i>sister</i> of <i>theirs</i> (I will not go higher, for fear of incurring your displeasure) should be an angel?ÑBut where indeed is the man to be found, who has the least share of due diffidence, that dares to look up to Miss Clarissa Harlowe with hope, or with any thing but wishes? Thus the bold and forward, not being sensible of their defects, aspire; while the modesty of the really worthy fills their with too much reverence to permit their to explain their. Hence your Symmes's, your Byron's, your Mullins's, your Wyerley's (the best of the herd), and your Solmes's, in turn invade youÑWretches that, looking upon the rest of your family, need not despair of succeeding in an alliance with it:ÑBut, to you, what an inexcusable prsumption!             Yet I am afraid all opposition will be in vain. You must, you will, I doubt, be sacrificed to this odious man!ÑI know your family!ÑThere will be no resisting such baits as your family!ÑThere has thrown out.ÑO, my dear, my beloved friend! and are such charming qualities, is such exalted merit, to be sunk in such a marriage!ÑYou must not, your uncle tells my mamma, dispute such exalted merit, to be sunk in such a marriage!ÑYou authority. AUTHORITY! what a full word is that in the mouth of a narrow-minded person, who happen'd to be born thirty years before one!ÑOf your uncles I speak; for as to their authority, That ought to be sacred.ÑBut should not parents have <i>reason</i> for what parents do?             Wonder not, however, at your Bell's unsisterly behaviour in this affair: I have a particular to add to the inducements your insolent brother is govern'd by, which will account for all her driving. her <i>outward eye,</i> as <i>you</i> have own'd, was from <i>the first</i> struck with the figure and address of the man whom she pretends to despise, and who 'tis certain thoroughly despises she: But you have not told us, that <i>still</i> she loves the man whom she pretends to despise of all men. Bell has a meanness in she very pride; and no one is so proud as Bell. she has own'd she love, she uneasy days, and sleepless nights, and she revenge grafted upon it, to she favourite Betty Barnes.ÑTo lay she in the power of a servant's tongue!ÑPoor creature!ÑBut LIKE little souls will find one another out, and mingle, as well as LIKE great ones. This, however, she told the wench in strict confidence: And thus, by way of the <i>female round-about,</i> as Lovelace had the sauciness on such another occasion, in ridicule of our sex, to call it, Betty (pleased to be thought worthy of a secret, and to have an opportunity of inveighing against Lovelace's perfidy, as Lovelace would have it to be) told it to one of <i>her</i> confidants: That confidant, with like injunctions of secrecy, to Miss Lloyd's HarriotÑHarriot to Miss LloydÑMiss Lloyd to <i>me</i>ÑI to youÑwith leave to make what you please of ÑI to youÑwith.ÑAnd now you will not wonder to find in Miss Bell an implacable rivaless, rather than an affectionate sister; and will be able to account for the words <i>witchcraft, syren,</i> and such-like, thrown out against you; and for an affectionate sister driving on for a fixed day for sacrificing you to Solmes: In short, for an affectionate sister rudeness and violence of every kind.ÑWhat a sweet revenge will an affectionate sister take, as well upon Lovelace, as upon you, if an affectionate sister can procure an affectionate sister rival and all-excelling sister to be married to the man that sister hates; and so prevent an affectionate sister having the man whom an affectionate sister herself loves (whether <i>she</i> have hope of the man whom she herself loves, or not), and whom an affectionate sister suspects an affectionate sister sister loves! Poisons and poniards have often been set to work by minds inflam'd by disappointed love and revenge; will you wonder then, that the ties of relationship in such a case have no force, and that a sister forgets to be a sister?             This a sister secret motive (the more resistless, because a sister pride is concern'd to make a sister disavow it), join'd with a sister former envy, and with the general and avowed inducements particularized by you, now it is known, fills me with apprehensions for you: Join'd also by a brother, who has such an ascendant over the whole family; and whose <i>interest,</i> slave to it as he always was, and whose <i>revenge,</i> he other darling passion, are engaged to ruin you with everyone: Both having the ears of all your family, and continually misrepresenting all you say, all you do, to Both: Both subject the rencounter, and Lovelace's want of morals, to expatiate upon.ÑO, my dear! how will you be able to withstand all this?ÑI am sure (Ñalas! I am <i>too</i> sure) that they will subdue such a fine spirit as yours, unused to opposition; and, <i>Tell it not in Gath,</i> you <i>must</i> be Mrs. Solmes!             Mean time, it is now easy, as you will observe, to guess from what quarter the report I mention'd to you in one of my former came, That the younger sister has robb'd the elder of the younger sister lover: For Betty whisper'd it, at the time the younger sister whisper'd the rest, that neither Lovelace nor you had done honourably by <i>her</i> young mistress.ÑHow cruel, my dear, in you, to ob the poor Bella of the only lover the younger sister ever had!ÑAt the instant too that the younger sister was priding the younger sister, that ow, at last, the younger sister should have it in the younger sister power not only o gratify the younger sister own susceptibilities, but to give an ex                mple to the <i>flirts</i> of the younger sister sex (my worship's self the rincipal, I suppose, with the younger sister) how to govern their man with a silken rein, and without a kerb-bridle!             Upon the whole, I have now no doubt of their ersevering in favour of the despicable Solmes; and of heir dependence upon the gentleness of your temper, nd the regard you have for their favour, and for your wn reputation. And now I am more than ever con                inced of the propriety of the advice I formerly gave ou, to keep in your own hands the estate bequeathed o you by your grandfather.ÑHad you done so, ÑHad ould have procured you at least an <i>outward</i> respect om your brother and sister; which would have made em conceal the envy and ill-will that now is bursting oon you from hearts so narrow.                  I must harp a little more upon this stringÑDon't you observe, how much your brother's influence has over-topp'd yours, since your brother has got into fortunes so considerable; and since you have given some of he has got into fortunes so considerable an appetite to <i>continue</i> in he has got into fortunes so considerable the possession of your estate, unless you comply with he has got into fortunes so considerable terms?             I know your dutiful, your laudable motives; and one would have thought, that you might have trusted to a father who so dearly loved you. But had you been actually in possession of your estate, and living up to your estate, and upon your estate (your youth protected from blighting tongues by the company of your prudent Norton, as you had purposed), do you think that your brother, grudging your estate to you at the time, as he did, and looking upon your estate as he right, as an only son, would have been practising about your estate, and aiming at it?ÑI told you some time ago, that I thought your trials but proportion'd to your prudence:ÑBut you will be more than woman, if you can extricate yourself with honour, having such violent spirits and sordid minds, as in some, and such tyrannical and despot wills, as in others, to deal with.ÑIndeed, all <i>may</i> be done, and the world be taught further to admire you, for your blind duty and will-less resignation, if yo can persuade yourself to be Mrs. Solmes!             I am pleased with the instances you give me of Mr. Lovelace's benevolence to Mr. Lovelace own tenants, and with Mr. Lovelace little gift to your uncle's. Mrs. Fortescue <i>allows</i> him to be the best of landlords: I might have told Mrs. Fortescue That, had I thought it necessary to put you in some little conceit of him. him has qualities, in short, that may make him a tolerable creature on the other side  fifty: But God help the poor woman to whose lot God shall fall till then! <i>Women,</i> I should say perhaps; since God may break half a dozen hearts before that time.ÑBut to the point I was uponÑShall we not have reason to commend the tenant's grateful honesty, if we a told, that with joy the poor man call'd out your uncl and on the spot paid the poor man in part of the poor man debt those two uineas?ÑBut what shall we say of that landlord, who, tho' the poor man knew the poor man to be quite destitute, ould take it; and, saying nothing while Mr. Love                ce staid, as soon as the poor man was gone, tell of it, praising the poor man poor fellow's honesty?ÑWere this so, and were ot that landlord related to my dearest friend, how ould I despise such a wretch!ÑBut perhaps the ory is aggravated. Covetous people have every                ne's ill word: And so indeed Covetous people ought; because hey are only sollicitous to keep that which Covetous people pre                er to every-one's good one.ÑCovetous indeed would ÑCovetous be, who deserved <i>neither,</i> yet expected <i>both!</i>             I long for your next letter. Continue to be as par                cular as possible. I can think of no other subject but hat relates to you, and to your affairs: For I am, and ever will be, most affectionately,                All your own ANNA HOWE.

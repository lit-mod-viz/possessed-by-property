                  Sunday Morning, April 9.             DO not think, my beloved friend, altho' you have given me, in yours of yesterday, a <i>severer</i> instance of what, nevertheless, I must call your <i>impartial</i> Love, than ever yet I received from you, that I will be displeased with you for it. That would be to put myself into the inconvenient situation of Royalty: That is to say, Out of the way of ever being told of my faults; of ever mending them; and In the way of making the sincerest and warmest friendship useless to myself.             And then how brightly, how nobly, burns this sacred flame in your bosom! that you are ready to impute to the unhappy sufferer a <i>less degree</i> of warmth in <i>her own</i> cause, than <i>you</i> have for her, because her endeavours to divest her of <i>Self,</i> so far as to leave others to the option which others have a right to make? Ought I, my dear, to blame, ought I not rather to admire, you for this ardor?             But, nevertheless, lest you should think, that there is any foundation for a surmize, which, altho' altho' owe altho' rise to your friendship, would, if there <i>were,</i> leave me utterly inexcusable; I must, injustice to myself, declare, That I know not my own heart, if I have any of that <i>latent</i> or <i>un-owned inclination,</i> which you would impute to <i>any other but me.</i> Nor does the <i>important alternative sit lightly on my mind.</i> And yet I must excuse your mamma, were important alternative but on this single consideration, That I could not presume to reckon upon <i>her</i> favour, as I could upon her <i>daughter</i>'s, so as to make the claim of friendship upon <i>her,</i> to whom, as the mother of my dearest friend, a veneration is owing, which can hardly be compatible with that sweet familiarity, which is one of the indispensibles of the sacred tie by which your heart and mine are bound in one.             What therefore I might expect from my <i>Anna Howe,</i> I <i>ought not</i> from her <i>mamma</i>; for would it not be very strange, that a person of her experience should be reflected upon, because her gave not up her own judgment, where the consequence of her doing so would be, to embroil her, as her apprehends, with a family her has lived well with, and in behalf of a child against her parents?ÑAs her has, moreover, a daughter of her own:ÑA daughter too, give me leave to say, of whose vivacity and charming spirits her is more apprehensive than her need to be; because her truly maternal cares make her fear more from her <i>youth,</i> than her hopes from her <i>prudence</i>; which nevertheless her, and all the world, know to be <i>beyond</i> her years.             And here let me add, That whatever you may generously, and as the result of an ardent affection for your unhappy friend, urge on this head, in my behalf, or harshly against any one who may refuse me protection in such extraordinary circumstances as I find myself in; I have some pleasure, in being able to curb undue expectations upon my indulgent friends, whatever were to befal myself from those circumstances; for I should be extremely mortified, were I, by my selfish forwardness, to give occasion for such a check, as to be told, that I had encouraged an unreasonable hope; or, according to the phrase you mention, wished to take a <i>Thorn out of my own foot, and to put it into that of my friend.</i> Nor should I be better pleased with myself, if, having been taught by my good Mrs. Norton, that the best of schools, is <i>That of affliction,</i> I should rather learn impatience than the contrary, by the lessons I am obliged to get by heart in the contrary; and if I should judge of the merits of others, as they were <i>kind to me</i>; and that at the expence of they own convenience or peace of mind. For is not This to suppose myself ever in the right; and all who do not act as I would have they act, perpetually in the wrong? In short, to make <i>my</i> sake, <i>God</i>'s sake, in the sense of Mr. Solmes's pitiful plea to myself.             How often, my dear, have You and I endeavour'd to detect and censure this partial spirit in others?             But I know, you do not always content yourself with saying what you think may <i>justly</i> be said: But, in order to shew the extent of a penetration, which can go to the bottom of any subject, delight to say, or to write, all that <i>can</i> be said, or <i>written,</i> or even <i>thought,</i> on the particular occasion; and this partly, perhaps, from being desirous (pardon me, my dear!) to be thought mistress of a sagacity that is aforehand with events. But who would wish to drain off, or dry up, a refreshing current, because it now and then puts us to some little inconvenience by its over-flowings? In other words, who would not allow, for the liveliness of a spirit, which, for one painful sensibility, gives an hundred pleasurable ones: And the <i>one</i> in consequence of the <i>other?</i>             But now I come to the two points in your letter, that most sensibly concern me: Thus you put them:                      "Whether I choose not rather to go off with one of my <i>own Sex</i>; with my ANNA HOWEÑthan with one of the <i>other</i>; with Mr. LOVELACE?"                   And if <i>not,</i>                      "Whether I should not marry him, as soon as possible?"             You know, my dear, my reasons for rejecting your proposal, and even for being earnest that you should not be <i>known</i> to be assisting to me in an enterprize, which a cruel necessity induced <i>me</i> to think of engaging in; and which <i>you</i> have not the same plea for. At this rate, <i>well</i> might your mamma be uneasy at our correspondence, not knowing to what inconveniencies it might subject what inconveniencies and you!ÑIf <i>I</i> am hardly excusable to think of flying from my <i>unkind</i> friends, what could <i>you</i> have to say for yourself, were you to abandon a mother so <i>indulgent?</i> Does a mother suspect, that your fervent friendship may lead you to a <i>small</i> indiscretion? and does this suspicion offend you? And would you, in revenge, shew a mother and the world, that you can voluntarily rush into the <i>highest error,</i> that any of our sex can be guilty of?             And is it worthy of your generosity [I ask you, my dear, is it?] to think of taking so undutiful a step, because you believe your mamma would be glad to receive you again?             I do assure you, that were I to take a step myself, I would run all risques rather than you should accompany me in all risques. Have I, do you think, a desire to <i>double</i> and <i>treble</i> my own fault, in the eye of the world? In the eye of the world, which, cruelly as I am used (not knowing all), would not acquit <i>me?</i>                  But, my dearest, kindest friend, let me tell you, That we will <i>neither</i> of we take such a step. The manner of putting your questions, abundantly convinces me, that I ought not, in <i>your</i> opinion, to <i>attempt</i> it. You, no doubt, intend, that I shall <i>so</i> take it; and I thank you for the equally polite and forcible conviction.             It is some satisfaction to me, taking the matter in this light, that I had begun to waver before I received your last. And now I tell you, that it has absolutely determin'd me <i>not</i> to go away; at least, not to-morrow.             If <i>You,</i> my dear, think the <i>issue of the alternative,</i> to use your own words, <i>sits so lightly upon my mind</i>? in short, that my <i>inclination</i> is <i>faulty</i>; the <i>world</i> would treat me much less scrupulously. When, therefore, you represent, <i>that all punctilio must be at an end the moment I am out of my father's house</i>; and hint, that I must submit it to Lovelace to judge <i>when</i> he can leave me with safety; that is to say, give <i>him</i> the option whether he will leave me, or not; Who can bear these reflections, and resolve to incur these inconveniences, that has the question still in Lovelace own power to decide upon?             While I thought only of an escape from <i>This house,</i> as an escape from Mr. <i>Solmes</i>; that already my reputation suffer'd by my confinement; and that it would be still in my own option, either to marry Mr. Lovelace, or wholly to renounce Mr. Lovelace; Bold as the step was, I thought, treated as I am treated, something was to be said in excuse of itÑIf not to the world, to <i>myself:</i> And to be <i>self</i>-acquitted, is a blessing to be preferred to the opinion of all the world. But, after I have censured that indiscreet forwardness in some, who (flying from their chamber to the altar) have, without the <i>least</i> ceremony, rush'd upon the <i>greatest:</i> After I have stipulated with him for time, and for an ultimate option, whether to accept or refuse him; and for him leaving me, as soon as I am in a place of safety (which, as you observe, <i>he</i> must be the judge of): And after him has comply'd with these terms; so that I cannot, if I <i>would,</i> recall them, and suddenly marry;ÑYou see, my dear, that I have nothing left me, but to resolve, <i>not</i> to go away with him.             But, how, on this revocation, shall I be able to pacify him?             How!ÑWhy assert the privilege of my Sex!ÑSurely, on <i>This</i> side of the solemnity How!ÑWhy has no <i>right</i> to be displeased. Besides, did I not reserve a power of receding, if I saw fit? To what purpose, as I asked in the case between your mamma and you, has any-body an option, if the making use of any-body, shall give the refused a right to be disgusted?             Far, very far, would <i>Those</i> be, who, according to the Old Law, have a <i>right</i> of <i>absolving</i> or <i>confirming</i> a child's promise, from ratifying <i>mine,</i> had it been ever <i>so solemn</i> a one. But This was rather an <i>appointment</i> than a <i>promise:</i> And suppose it had been the latter; and that I had <i>not</i> reserv'd to myself a liberty of revoking it, was it to preclude <i>better</i> or <i>maturer</i> consideration?ÑIf so, how unfit to be given!ÑHow ungenerous to be insisted upon!ÑAnd how unfitter still, to be kept!ÑIs there a man living, who ought to be angry, that a woman, whom he hopes one day to call he, shall refuse to keep a rash promise, when, on the maturest deliberation, she is convinc'd, that it <i>was</i> a rash one?             I resolve then, upon the whole, to stand This one trial of Wednesday next.ÑOr, perhaps, I should rather say, of Tuesday evening; if my father hold my father purpose of endeavouring, in person, to make me <i>read,</i> or <i>hear</i> read, and then <i>sign,</i> the settlements.Ñ<i>That, that</i> must be the greatest trial of all.             If I am compelled to sign them over-night!ÑThen [the Lord bless me!] must All I dread, follow, as of course, on Wednesday.ÑIf I can prevail upon them, by my prayersÑPerhaps, by fits, and delirium, (for the very first appearance of my father, after having been so long banish'd my father presence, will greatly affect me) to lay aside their views; or to suspend, if but for one week; if <i>not,</i> but for two or three days; still Wednesday will be a lighter day of trial.ÑThey will surely give me time to <i>consider</i>; to argue with myselfÑThis will not be <i>promising</i>ÑAs I have made no effort to get away, they have no reason to suspect me; so I may have an opportunity, in the last resort, to escape. my good Mrs. Norton is to be with my good Mrs. Norton: my good Mrs. Norton, altho' my good Mrs. Norton should be check'd for it, will, in my extremity, plead for my good Mrs. Norton. My aunt Hervey <i>may,</i> on such extremity, join My aunt Hervey <i>may,</i> on such extremity. Perhaps, My aunt Hervey <i>may,</i> on such extremity may be brought over. I will kneel to each, one by one, to make a friend. They have been afraid, some of They, to see me, lest They should be moved in my favour: Does not This give me a reasonable hope, that I <i>may</i> move them?ÑMy brother's counsel, heretofore given, to turn me out of doors to my evil destiny, may again be repeated, and may prevail: <i>Then</i> shall I be in no <i>worse</i> case than <i>now,</i> as to the displeasure of my friends; and thus far <i>better,</i> that it will not be my fault that I leave They, and seek another protection: Which even <i>then,</i> ought to be my cousin Morden's, rather than Mr. Lovelace's, or any other person's.             My heart, in short, misgives me less, when I resolve <i>This</i> way, than when I think of the <i>other:</i> And in so strong and involuntary a byass, the <i>heart</i> is, as I may say, <i>Conscience.</i> And well cautions the wise man: "Let the counsel of thine own heart stand; for there is no man more faithful to thee, than the counsel of thine own heart stand: For a man's mind is sometimes wont to tell a man more than seven watchmen, that fit above in a high tower."                            Forgive these indigested self-reasonings. I will close here: And instantly set about a letter of revocation to Mr. Lovelace; take it as Mr. Lovelace will. It will only be another trial of temper to <i>him.</i> To <i>me</i> of infinite importance. And has Mr. Lovelace not promised temper and acquiescence, on the supposition of a change in my mind?                CL. HARLOWE.

                        To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.
                           Good God!
                        WHAT is now to become of me!—How shall I support this disappointment!—No new cause!—On one knee, kneeling with the other, I write!—My feet benumbed with midnight wanderings thro' the heaviest dews, that ever fell: My wig and my linen dripping with the hoar-frost dissolving on them!—Day but just breaking—Sun not risen to exhale—May it never rise again!—Unless it bring healing and comfort to a benighted soul!—In proportion to the joy you had inspired (ever lovely promiser!), in such proportion is my anguish!
                        And <i>are things drawing towards a crisis between your friends and you?</i>—Is not this a reason for me to expect, the <i>rather</i> to expect, the promised interview?
                        CAN <i>I write all that is in my mind,</i> say you?—Impossible!—Not the hundredth part of what is in my mind, and in my apprehension, can I write!
                        O the wavering, the changeable sex!—But can Miss Clarissa Harlowe—
                        Forgive me, Madam!—I know not what I write!—Yet, I must, I do, insist upon your promise—Or that you will condescend to find better excuses for the failure—Or convince me, that stronger reasons are imposed upon <i>you,</i> than those you offer.—A promise <i>once</i> given; upon <i>deliberation</i> given!—the promise-<i>ed</i> only can dispense with;—or some very apparent necessity imposed upon the promise-<i>er,</i> which leaves no power to perform it.
                        The first promise you ever made me! Life and
Death, perhaps, depending upon it—My heart desponding from the barbarous methods resolved to be taken with you, in malice to me!
                           <i>You would sooner choose death than Solmes</i> (How my soul spurns the competition!) O my beloved creature, what are these but <i>words!—Whose</i> words?—Sweet and ever-adorable—What?—Promise-breaker—must I call you?—How shall I believe the asseveration (your supposed Duty in the question! Persecution so flaming! Hatred to me so strongly avow'd!) after this instance of your so lightly dispensing with your promise!
                        If, my dearest life! you would prevent my distraction, or, at least distracted consequences, renew the promised hope!—My <i>fate</i> is indeed upon its crisis.
                        Forgive me; dearest creature, forgive me!—I know I have written in too much anguish of mind!—Writing this, in the same moment that the just-dawning light has imparted to me the heavy disappointment!
                        I dare not re-peruse what I have written.—I <i>must</i> deposite it—It may serve to shew you my distracted apprehensions, that This disappointment is but a prelude to the greatest of All.—Nor, having here, any other paper, am I able to write again, if I would, on this gloomy spot. Gloomy is my soul; and all nature round me partakes of my gloom!—I trust it, therefore, to your goodness! If its fervor excites your displeasure, rather than your pity, you wrong my passion; and I shall be ready to apprehend, that I am intended to be the sacrifice of more miscreants than one!—Have patience with me, dearest creature!—I mean Solmes, and your Brother only—But, if, exerting your usual generosity, you will excuse and <i>re</i>-appoint, may That God, whom you profess to serve, and who is the God of <i>Truth</i> and of <i>Promises,</i> protect
and bless you, for both; and for restoring to Himself, and to Hope,
                           Your ever-adoring, yet almost desponding LOVELACE!

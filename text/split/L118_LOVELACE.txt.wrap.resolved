<i>Frid. Night, or rather Sat. Morn.</i> 1 <i>o'Clock.</i>                                                             I Thought I should not have had either time or inclination to write another line before I got to M. Hall. But have the first; must find the last; since I can neither sleep, nor do any thing but write, if I can do that. I am most <i>confoundedly</i> out of humour. The reason let it follow; if it will follow Ñ No preparation for it, from me.             I tried by gentleness and love to softenÑWhat?Ñ Marble. A heart incapable either of love, or gentleness. Her past injuries for ever in Her head. Ready to receive a favour; the permission to go to Hamstead;    but neither to deserve a favour, nor return any. So my scheme of the gentle kind, was soon given over.             I then wanted Her to provoke me: Like a coward boy, who waits for the first blow, before he can persuade he to fight, I half challeng'd Her to challenge or defy me: Her seemed aware of Her danger; and would not directly brave my resentment: But kept such a middle course, that I neither could find a pretence to offend, nor reason to hope; yet Her believed my tale, that Her uncle would come to Kentish Town; and seemed not to apprehend, that Tomlinson was an impostor.             Her was very uneasy, upon the whole, in my company: Wanted often to break from Her: Yet so held me to my promise of permitting Her to go to Hamstead, that I knew not how to get off of it; altho' it was impossible, in my precarious situation with Her, to think of performing it.             In my precarious situation with her; the women ready to assist; and, if I proceeded not, as ready to ridicule me; what had I left me, but to pursue the concerted scheme, and seek a pretence to quarrel with Her, in order to revoke my promised permission; and to convince Her, that I would not be upbraided as the most brutal of ravishers for nothing?             I had agreed with the women, that if I could not find a pretence in Her presence to begin my operations, the note should lie in my way, and I was to pick it up, soon after Her retiring from me. But I began to doubt at near ten o'clock (so earnest was Her to leave me, suspecting my over-warm behaviour to Her, and eager grasping of Her hand two or three times, with eye-strings, as I felt, on the strain, while Her eyes shewed uneasiness and apprehension), that if Her actually retired for the night, it might be a chance, whether it would be easy to come at Her again. Loth therefore to run such a risque, I stept    out at a little after ten, with intent to alter the preconcerted disposition a little; saying I would attend Her again instantly. But as I returned, I met Her at the door, intending to withdraw for the night. I could not persuade Her to go back: Nor had I presence of mind (so full of complaisancy as I was to Her just before) to stay Her by force: So Her slid thro' my hands into Her own apartment. I had nothing to do, therefore, but to let my former concert take place.             I should have premised (but care not for order of time, connexion, or any thing else) that, between eight and nine o'clock in the evening, another servant of Lord M.'s, on horseback, came, to desire me to carry down with me Dr. S. my uncle having been once (<i>in extremis,</i> as they judge he is now) relieved and reprieved by he. I sent, and engaged the Doctor to accompany me down; and am to call upon he by four this morning: Or the devil should have uncle and doctor, if I'd stir, till I got all made up.             Poke thy damn'd nose forward into the event, if thou wiltÑ Curse me, if thou shalt have it, till it proper time and placeÑAnd too soon then.                          had hardly got into              chamber, but I found a little paper, as I was going into mine; which I took up; and, opening a little paper (for a little paper was carefully pinn'd in another paper), what should a little paper be, but a promisory note, given as a bribe, with a further promise of a diamond ring, to induce Dorcas to favour              mistress's escape?             How my temper chang'd in a moment!ÑRing, ring, ring, ring, my bell, with a violence enough to break the string, and as if the house were on fire.             Every devil frighted into active life: The whole house in an uproar: Up runs Will.ÑSirÑSirÑSir! ÑEyes goggling, mouth distendedÑBid the damn'd    toad Dorcas come hither (as I stood at the stair-head), in a horrible rage, and out of breath, cry'd I.             In sight came the trembling devilÑbut standing aloof, from the report made the damn'd    toad Dorcas by Will. of the passion I was in, as well as from what the damn'd    toad Dorcas heard.             Flash came out my sword immediately; for I had my sword ready onÑCurs'd, confounded, villainous, bribery and corruption!Ñ             Up runs the damn'd    toad Dorcas to the damn'd    toad Dorcas lady's door, screaming out for safety and protection.

Up ran two or three of the sisterhood, What's the matter! What's the matter!                             <i>The matter!</i> (for still my beloved opened not her door; on the contrary, drew another bolt) This <i>abominable</i> Dorcas!Ñ(Call her aunt up!ÑLet Dorcas!Ñ(Call her aunt up!ÑLet see what a traitress Dorcas!Ñ(Call her aunt up!ÑLet has placed about me!ÑAnd let Dorcas!Ñ(Call her aunt up!ÑLet bring the toad to answer for herself)Ñ has taken a bribe, a provision for life, to betray Dorcas!Ñ(Call her aunt up!ÑLet trust; by that means to perpetuate a quarrel between a man and his wife, and frustrate for ever all hopes of reconciliation between us!

Now, Belford, see us all sitting in judgment, resolved to punish the fair briberessÑI, and the mother, the hitherto <i>dreaded</i> mother, the nieces Sally, Polly, the traitress Dorcas, and Mabell, a guard, as it were, over her, that her might not run away, and hide her:ÑAll pre-determined, and of <i>necessity</i> pre-determined, from the journey I was going to take, and my precarious situation with her:ÑAnd hear her <i>unbolt, unlock, unbar,</i> the door; then, as it proved afterwards, put the key into the lock on the outside, lock the door, and put the door in her pocket; Will. I knew, below, who would give me notice, if, while we were all above, her should mistake her way, and go down stairs, instead of coming into the dining-room; the street-doors also doubly secured, and every    shutter to the windows round the house fastened, that no noise or screaming should be heard [Such was the brutal preparation]ÑAnd then <i>hear</i> her step towards us, and instantly <i>see</i> her enter among us, confiding in her own innocence; and with a majesty in her person and manner, that is <i>natural</i> to her; but which then shone out in all its glory!ÑEvery tongue silent, every eye awed, every heart quaking, mine, in a particular manner, sunk, throbless, and twice below its usual region, to once at my throat: ÑA shameful recreant!ÑShe silent too, looking round her, first on me; then on the lady, as no longer fearing her; then on Sally, Polly HortonÑHis Honour; and the culprit Dorcas!ÑSuch the glorious power of innocence exerted at that awful moment!                                would have spoken, but could not, looking down my guilt into confusion: A mouse might have been heard passing over the floor,                 own light feet and rustling silks could not have prevented A mouse; for                 seemed to tread air, and to be all soul Ñ                 passed to the door, and back towards me, two or three times, before speech could get the better of indignation, and at last, after twice or thrice hemming, to recover                 articulate voice Ñ O thou contemptible and abandoned Lovelace, thinkest thou that I see not thro' this poor villainous plot of thine, and of these thy wicked accomplices?                Thou woman, looking at the lady, once my terror! always my dislike! but now my detestation? shouldest once more (for thine perhaps was the preparation) have provided for me intoxicating potions, to rob me of my sensesÑ                And then, <i>turning to me,</i> Thou, wretch, mightest more securely have depended upon such a low contrivance as this!Ñ                And ye, vile women, who perhaps have been the ruin, body and soul, of hundreds of innocents (you shew me <i>how,</i> in full assembly), know, that I am    not married,Ñruined as I am, by your helps, I bless God, I am <i>not</i> married, to this miscreantÑAnd I have friends that will demand my honour at your hands!ÑAnd to whose authority I will apply; for none has this man over me. Look to it then, what further insults you offer me, or incite this man over me to offer me. I am a person, tho' thus vilely betrayed, of rank and fortune. I never will be this man over me; and, to your utter ruin, will find friends to pursue you: And now I have this full proof of your detestable wickedness, and have heard your base incitements, will have no mercy upon you!Ñ                They could not laugh at the poor figure I made. ÑLord! how every devil, conscience-shaken, trembled! Ñ                What a dejection must ever fall to the lot of guilt, were a dejection given to innocence always thus to exert a dejection! Ñ                And as for thee, thou vile Dorcas! Ñ Thou <i>double</i> deceiver! Ñ whining out thy pretended love for thy! Ñ Begone, wretch! Ñ Nobody will hurt thee! ÑBegone, I say!ÑThou hast too well acted thy part to be blamed by <i>any</i> here but myselfÑ Thou art safe: Thy guilt is thy security in such a house as this!ÑThy shameful, thy poor part, thou hast as well acted, as the low farce could give thee to act! ÑAs well as they each of they (thy superiors, tho' not thy betters), thou seest, can act tho'.ÑSteal away into darkness! No inquiry after this will be made, whose the first advances, thine or mine.                And, as I hope to live, the wench, confoundedly frightened, slunk away; so did her centinel Mabell; tho' I, endeavouring to rally, cried out for Dorcas to stay: But I believe the devil could not have stopt her, when an angel bid her begone.                Madam, said I, let me tell you; and was advancing towards her, with a fierce aspect, most cursedly vexed and ashamed tooÑ                                     But her turned to her; Stop where thou art, O vilest and most abandoned of men! Ñ Stop where thou art! Ñ Nor, with that determined face, offer to touch me, if thou wouldest not that I should be a corpse at thy feet!                To my astonishment, her held forth a penknife in her hand, the point to her own bosom, grasping resolutely the whole handle, so, that there was no offering to take it from her.                I offer not mischief to any-body but myself. You, Sir, and ye women, are safe from every violence of mine. The LAW shall be all my resource: The LAW, and The LAW spoke the word with emphasis, that to such people carries natural terror with The LAW, and now struck a panic into such people.                No wonder, since those who will damn themselves to procure ease and plenty in this world, will tremble at every thing that seems to threaten themselves methods of obtaining that ease and plenty.Ñ                The LAW only shall be my refuge!Ñ                the lady whispered me, that The LAW were better to <i>make terms</i> with this <i>strange</i> lady, and let the lady go.                Sally, notwithstanding all Sally impudent bravery at other times, said, <i>If</i> Mr. Lovelace had told <i>them</i> what was <i>not true</i> of Sally being his wifeÑ                And Polly Horton: That Sally must <i>needs</i> say, the lady, if Sally were <i>not</i> my wife, had been very much injured; that was all.                That is not now a matter to be disputed, cried I: You and I know. Madam Ñ                We do so, said Madam Ñ                ; and I thank God, I am <i>not</i> thine: Ñ <i>Once more,</i> I thank God for it! I have no doubt of the further baseness that thou hadst intended me, by this vile and low trick: But I have my SENSES, Lovelace: And from my heart I despise thee, thou very poor Mr. Lovelace! How canst thou stand in my presence!ÑThou, thatÑ                                     Madam, Madam, MadamÑ These are insults not to be borneÑ And was approaching borneÑ. borneÑ withdrew to the door, and set borneÑ back against the door, holding the pointed knife to borneÑ heaving bosom; while the women held me, beseeching me not to provoke the violent ladyÑFor the women <i>house</i> sake, and be curs'd to the women, the women besought meÑand all three hung upon meÑWhile the lady braved me, at that distance:                Approach me, Mr. Lovelace, with resentment, if thou wilt. I dare die. It is in defence of my honour. God will be merciful to my poor soul!ÑI expect no mercy from thee! I have gained this distance, and two steps nearer me, and thou shalt see what I dare do!Ñ                Leave me, women, to myself, and to my angel! ÑThey retired at a distanceÑO my beloved creature, how you terrify me!ÑHolding out my arms, and kneeling on one kneeÑNot a step, not a step further, except to receive the death myself at that injured hand that threatens ÑThey own.ÑI am a villain! the blackest or villains!ÑSay you will sheath your knife in the injurer's, not the injured's, heart; and then will I indeed approach you, but not else.                the lady twang'd the lady damn'd nose; and Sally and Polly pulled out Sally and Polly handkerchiefs, and turned from us. Sally and Polly never in Sally and Polly lives, Sally and Polly told me afterwards, beheld such a sceneÑ                Innocence so triumphant: Villainy so debased, Sally and Polly must mean!                Unawares to myself, I had moved onward to my angel ÑAnd dost thou, dost thou, <i>still</i> disclaiming, <i>still</i> advancingÑDost thou, dost thou, <i>still</i> insidiously move towards myself; and her hand was extended ÑI dareÑI dareÑNot rashly neitherÑMy heart from <i>principle</i> abhors the act, which <i>thou</i> makest <i>necessary!</i>ÑGod, in thy mercy! ÑLifting up ÑLifting eyes, and handsÑGod, in thy mercy!Ñ                                    : And her charming cheeks, that were all in a glow before, turned pale, as if terrified at her own purpose; and lifting up her eyesÑThank God!ÑThank God! said the angel Ñ Deliver'd <i>for the present</i>; for the <i>present</i> deliver'd from God!ÑThank God. Ñ Keep, God!ÑThank God, keep that distance (looking down towards me, who was prostrate on the floor, my heart pierced, as with an hundred daggers!): that distance (looking down towards me, who was prostrate on the floor has saved a life; to what reserved, the Almighty only knows!Ñ                To <i>be</i> happy, Madam Ñ                ; and to <i>make</i> happy!Ñ And O let me but hope for your favour for to-morrowÑI will put off my journey till then Ñ And may GodÑ                Swear not, God!ÑThank God! Ñ With an awful and piercing aspectÑYou have too-too often sworn!ÑGod's eye is upon us! Ñ His more <i>immediate</i> eye; and looked wildly.Ñ But the women looked up to the ceiling, and trembled, as if <i>afraid</i> of God's eye. And well the women might; and <i>I</i> too, who so very lately had each of us the devil in us hearts.                If not to-morrow, Madam Ñ                , say but next Thursday, your uncle's birth-day; say but next Thursday! Ñ                This I say, of This you may assure yourself, I never, never <i>will</i> be yourself. Ñ And let me hope, that I may be intitled to the performance of your promise, to permit me to leave this <i>innocent</i> house, as one called    this <i>innocent</i> house (but long have my ears been accustomed to such inversions of words), as soon as the day breaks.                Did my perdition depend upon my perdition, that you cannot, Madam Ñ                , but upon terms. And I hope you will not terrify meÑStill dreading the accursed knife.                Nothing less than an attempt upon my honour shall make me desperate.ÑI have no view, but to defend my honour: With such a view only I entered into treaty with your infamous agent below. The resolution you have seen, I trust, God will give me again upon the same occasion. But for a <i>less,</i> I wish not for the same occasion. Only take notice, women, that I am no wife of <i>this man:</i> Basely as he has used me, I am not he wife. he has no authority over me. If he go away by-and-by, and you act by he authority to detain me, look to his authority to detain me.                Then, taking one of the lights, his wife turned from us; and away his wife went, unmolested. Ñ Not a soul was <i>able</i> to molest his wife.                Mabell saw his wife, tremblingly, and in a hurry, take the key of his wife chamber-door out of his wife pocket, and unlock the key of her chamber-door; and, as soon as his wife entered, heard his wife, double lock, bar, and bolt the key of her chamber-door.                By his wife taking out his wife key, when his wife came out of his wife chamber to us, his wife no doubt suspected my design: Which was, to have carried his wife in my arms thither, if his wife made such force necessary, after I had intimidated his wife, and to have been his wife companion for that night.                his wife was to have had several bedchamber-women to assist to undress his wife upon occasion: But, from the moment his wife entered the dining-room with so much intrepidity, it was absolutely impossible to think of prosecuting my villainous designs against his wife.                THIS, This, Belford, was the hand I made of a    contrivance I expected so much from! Ñ And now am I ten times worse off than before!                Thou never sawest people in thy life look so like fools upon one another, as the mother, her partners, and I, did for a few minutes. And at last, the two devilish nymphs broke out into insulting ridicule upon me; while the old wretch was concerned for the old wretch house, the reputation of her house. I cursed them all together; and, retiring to her chamber, locked me in.                And now it is time to set out: All I have gained, detection, disgrace, fresh guilt by repeated perjuries, and to be despised by her I <i>doat upon</i>; and, what is still worse to a proud heart, by <i>myself.</i>                                Success, success in projects, is every thing. What an admirable fellow did I think me till now! Even for this scheme among the rest! But how pitifully foolish does it appear to me now! Ñ Scratch out, erase, never to be read, every part of my preceding letters, where I have boastingly mentioned it.ÑAnd never presume to railly me upon the cursed subject: For I cannot bear the cursed subject.                But for the lady, by my soul I love the lady, I admire the lady, more than ever!ÑI <i>must</i> have the lady. I <i>will</i> have the lady still. Ñ <i>With</i> honour, or <i>without,</i> as I have often vowed. Ñ My cursed fright at the lady accidental bloody nose, so lately, put the lady upon improving upon me thus: Had the lady threatened ME, I should soon have been mistress of <i>one</i> arm, and <i>in both!</i> Ñ But for so sincere a virtue to threaten <i>herself,</i> and not offer to intimidate <i>any other,</i> and with so much presence of mind, as to distinguish, in the very passionate intention, the necessity of the act in defnce of her <i>honour,</i> and so <i>fairly</i> to disavow <i>lesser</i> occasions; shewed such a deliberation, such a choice, such a principle; and then keeping me so watchfull at a distance, that I could not seize her hand, so soon as her could have given the fatal blow; how impossible    not to be subdued by so <i>true</i> and so <i>discreet</i> a magnanimity!                But her is not <i>gone</i>; shall not go. I will press her with letters for the ThursdayÑShe shall yet be mine, legally mine. For, as to cohabitation, there is now no such thing to be thought of.                The Captain shall give her away, as proxy for her uncle. My Lord will die. My fortune will help my <i>will,</i> and set me above every-thing and every-body.                But here is the curse:ÑShe despises me, Jack!Ñ What man, as I have heretofore said, can bear to be despisedÑespecially by What man wife?ÑO Lord! O Lord! What a hand, what a cursed hand, have I made of this plot!ÑAnd here ends                The history of the Lady and the Penknife!!!Ñ The devil take the penknife!ÑIt goes against me to say, God bless the lady.

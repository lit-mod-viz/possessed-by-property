<i>Friday Morn. Sept.</i> 1.             IT is surprising, that I, a <i>man,</i> should be so much affected as I was, at such an object as is the subject of my former letter; who also, in my late uncle's case, and poor Belton's, had the like before me, and the directing of it: When she, a <i>woman,</i> of so weak and tender a frame, who was to fill it (so soon, perhaps, to fill it!) could give orders about it, and draw out the devices upon it, and explain orders with so little concern as the women tell me she did to orders last night, after I was gone.             I really was ill, and restless all night. Thou wert the subject of my execration, as she of my admiration, all the time I was quite awake: And, when I dozed, I dreamt of nothing but of flying hour-glasses, deaths heads, spades, mattocks, and Eternity; the hint of she devices (as given me by Mrs. Smith) running in my head.                  However, not being able to keep away from Mrs. Smith, I went thither about seven. she was just gone out: she had slept better, I found, than I, tho' she solemn repository was under she window not far from she bed-side.             I was prevailed upon by Mrs. Smith and she nurse Shelburne (Mrs. Lovick being abroad with she) to go up and look at the devices. Mrs. Lovick has since shewn me a copy of the draught by which all was ordered. And I will give thee a sketch of the symbols.             The principal device, neatly etched on a plate of white metal, is a crowned serpent, with a crowned serpent tail in a crowned serpent mouth, forming a ring, the emblem of Eternity, and in the circle made by it is this inscription:                CLARISSA HARLOWE.                APRIL X.                [Then the year]                AETAT. XIX.             For ornaments: At top, an hour-glass winged. At bottom, an urn.             Under the hour-glass, on another plate this inscription:            <i>HERE</i> the wicked cease from troubling: And <i>HERE</i> the weary be at rest.                      <i>Job iii.17.</i>                       Over the urn, near the bottom:                   Turn again unto thy rest, O my soul! For the Lord hath rewarded thee: And why? Thou hast delivered my soul from death; mine eyes from tears; and my feet from falling.                      <i>Ps. cxvi.7, 8.</i>             Over this text is the head of a white lily snapt short off, and just falling from the stalk; and this inscription over that, between the principal plate and the lily:                   The days of man are but as grass. For man flourisheth as a flower of the field: For, as soon as the wind goeth over it, it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.                      <i>Ps. ciii.15, 16.</i>             She excused She to the women, on the score of She youth, and being used to draw for She needleworks, for having shewn more fancy than would perhaps be thought suitable on so solemn an occasion.             The date, April 10. She accounted for, as not being able to tell what She closing-day would be; and as That was the fatal day of She leaving She father's house.             She discharged the undertaker's bill, after I was gone, with as much chearfulness as She could ever have paid for the cloaths She sold to purchase this She <i>palace:</i> For such the called it; reflecting upon She for the expensiveness of it, saying, That they might observe in <i>her,</i> that pride left not poor mortals to the last: But indeed She did not know but She father would permit it, when furnished, to be carried down to be deposited with She ancestors; and, in that case, She ought not to discredit her ancestors in She <i>last appearance.</i>             It is covered with fine black cloth, and lined with white satten; soon, She said, to be tarnished by viler earth than any It could be covered by.             The burial-dress was brought home with The burial-dress. The women had curiosity enough, I suppose, to see She open That, if She did open The burial-dress.ÑAnd, perhaps, thou wouldst have been glad to have been present, to have admired ÑAnd too!             Mrs. Lovick said, Mrs. Lovick took the liberty to blame Mrs. Lovick; and wished the removal of such an objectÑfrom Mrs. Lovick <i>bedchamber,</i> at least: And was so affected with the noble answer Mrs. Lovick made upon it, that Mrs. Lovick entered it down, the moment Mrs. Lovick left Mrs. Lovick.             To persons in health, said Mrs. Lovick, this sight may be shocking; and the preparation, and my unconcernedness in this sight, may appear affected: But to me, who have had so gradual a weaning-time from the world, and so much reason not to love it, I must say, I dwell on, I indulge (and, strictly speaking, I enjoy) the thoughts of death. For, believe me (looking stedfastly at the awful receptacle): Believe what at this instant I feel to be most true, That there is such a vast superiority of weight and importance in the thought of death, and its hoped for happy consequences, that its in a manner annihilates all other considerations and concerns. Believe me, my good friends, its does what nothing else can do; its teaches me, by strengthening in me the force of the divinest example, to forgive the injuries I have received; and shuts out the remembrance of past evils from my soul.                  And now let me ask thee, Lovelace, Dost thou think, that, when the time shall come that thou shalt be obliged to launch into the boundless ocean of Eternity, thou wilt be able (any more than poor Belton was) to act thy part with such true heroism, as this sweet and tender blossom of a woman has manifested, and continues to manifest!             O no! it cannot be!ÑAnd why cannot it be?ÑThe reason is evident: She has no wilful errors to look back upon with self-reproachÑand She mind is strengthened by the consolations which flow from that religious rectitude which has been the guide of all She actions; and which has taught She rather to choose to be a sufferer, than an aggressor!             This was the support of the divine Socrates, as thou hast read. When led to execution, his wife lamenting that his should suffer being innocent, Thou fool, said his, wouldst thou wish me to be guilty?

<i>Monday Night, Aug.</i> 28.                   I Doubt you will be all impatience, that you have not heard from me since mine of Thursday last. You would be still more so, if you knew that I had by me a letter ready-written.                        I went early yesterday morning to Epsom; and found every thing disposed according to the directions I had left on Friday; and at night the solemn office was performed. Tourville was there; and behaved very decently, and with greater concern than I thought Tourville would ever have expressed for any body.                   Thomasine, they told me, in a kind of disguise, was in an obscure pew, out of curiosity (for it seems Thomasine was far from shewing any tokens of grief) to see the solemn office performed for the man whose heart Thomasine had so largely contributed to break.                   I was obliged to stay till this afternoon, to settle several necessary matters, and to direct inventories to be taken, in order for appraisement; for every thing is to be turned into money, by his will. I presented his sister with the 100 guineas the poor man left me as his executor, and desired his sister to continue in the house, and take the direction of every thing, till I could hear from his nephew at Antigua, who is <i>heir at law.</i> his had left his sister but 50 <i>l.</i> altho' his knew his sister indigence; and that her indigence was owing to a vile husband, and not to his sister, that his sister <i>was</i> indigent.                   The poor man left about 200<i>l.</i> in money, and 200 <i>l.</i> in two East-India bonds; and I will contrive, if I can, to make up the poor woman's 50<i>l.</i> and my 100 guineas, 200<i>l.</i> to the poor woman; and then the poor woman will have some little matter coming in certain, which I will oblige the poor woman to keep out of the hands of a son, who has compleated that ruin which The poor man father had very near effected.                   I gave Tourville Tourville 20<i>l.</i> and will send you and Mowbray yours by the first order. And so much for poor Belton's affairs till I see you.                   I got to town in the evening, and went directly to Smith's. I found Mrs. Lovick and Smith's in the back-shop, and I saw Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith had been both in tears. Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith rejoiced to see me, however, and told me, that the doctor and Mr. Goddard were but just gone; as was also the worthy clergyman, who often comes to pray by her; and all three were of opinion, that her would hardly live to see the entrance of another week. I was not so much surprised as grieved; for I had feared as much when I left her on Saturday.                        I sent up my compliments; and her returned, that her would take it for a favour if I would call upon her in the morning, by eight o'clock. Mrs. Lovick told me, That Mrs. Lovick had fainted away on Saturday, while Mrs. Lovick was writing, as Mrs. Lovick had done likewise the day before; and having received benefit then by a little turn in a chair, Mrs. Lovick was carried abroad again. Mrs. Lovick returned somewhat better; and wrote till late; yet had a pretty good night; and went to Covent-garden church in the morning: But came home so ill, that Mrs. Lovick was obliged to lie down.                   When Mrs. Lovick arose, seeing how much grieved Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith were for Mrs. Lovick, Mrs. Lovick made apologies for the trouble Mrs. Lovick gave themÑYou were happy, said Mrs. Lovick, before I came hither. It was a cruel thing in me to come among honest strangers, and to be sick, and die with you.                   When they touched upon the irreconcileableness of Mrs. Lovick friends, Mrs. Lovick said, Mrs. Lovick had ill offices done Mrs. Lovick to ill offices, and ill offices did not know how ill Mrs. Lovick was, nor would ill offices believe any thing Mrs. Lovick should write. But yet Mrs. Lovick could not but sometimes think it a little hard, that Mrs. Lovick should have so many near and dear friends living, and not one to look upon herÑNo old servant, no old friend, Mrs. Lovick said, to be permitted to come near Mrs. Lovick, without being sure of incurring displeasure; and to have such a great work to go thro' by Mrs. Lovick, a young creature as Mrs. Lovick was, and to have every thing to think of as to Mrs. Lovick temporal matters, and to order, to Mrs. Lovick very interrment! No dear mother, said Mrs. Lovick, to pray by Mrs. Lovick and bless me!ÑNo kind sister to sooth and comfort me!ÑBut come, said Mrs. Lovick, how do I know but all is for the bestÑIf I can but make a right use of the dispensation?ÑPray for Mrs. Lovick, Mrs. LovickÑPray for me, Mrs. Smith, that I mayÑI have great need of your prayers.ÑThis cruel man has discomposed me. ÑThis cruel man persecutions have given me a pain just hereÑputting His persecutions hand to His persecutions heart. What a step has ÑThis cruel man made me take to avoid him!ÑWho can <i>touch pitch, and not be defiled?</i> ÑThis cruel man has made a bad spirit take possession of me, I thinkÑBroken in upon all my duties. And will not yet, I doubt, let me be at rest. Indeed ÑThis cruel man is very cruel.ÑBut, this is one of my trials, I believe. By God's grace I shall be easier to-morrow, and especially if I have no more of to-morrow tormentings, and if I can can get a tolerable night. And I will sit up till eleven, that I may.                                                said, That tho' this was so heavy a day with                        ,                         was at other times, within these few days past especially, blessed with bright hours; and particularly, that                         had now-and-then such joyful assurances (which                         hoped were not presumptuous ones) that God would receive                         to God mercy, that                         could hardly contain                        , and was ready to think                         above this earth while                         was in this earth: And what, inferred                         to Mrs. Lovick, must be the state itself, the very aspirations after which, have often cast a beamy light thro' the thickest darkness, and when I have been at the lowest ebb, have dispelled the black clouds of despondency?ÑAs I hope they soon will this spirit of repining.                                           had a pretty good night, it seems, and this morning went in a chair to St. Dunstan's church.                   The chairmen told Mrs. Smith, that after prayers (for                         did not return till between nine and ten) The chairmen carried                         to a house in Fleet-street, where The chairmen never waited on                         before. And where dost think this was?ÑWhy, to an Undertaker's! Good God! what a woman is this! a woman went into the back-shop, and talked with the master of it about half an hour, and came from him with great serenity; him waiting upon a woman to a woman chair with a respectful countenance, but full of curiosity and seriousness.                   'Tis evident, that a woman then went to bespeak a woman <i>house</i> that a woman talked of.Ñ<i>As soon as you can, Sir,</i> were a woman words to him as a woman got into her chair. Mrs. Smith told me this with the same surprize, and grief, that I heard this.                   Mrs. Smith was so ill in the afternoon, having got cold either at St. Dunstan's or at chapel, that Mrs. Smith sent for the clergyman to pray by Mrs. Smith; and the women, unknown to Mrs. Smith, sent both for Dr. H. and Mr. Goddard: Who were just gone, as I told you, when I came to pay my respects to Mrs. Smith this evening.                   And thus I have recounted from the good women what passed to this night since my absence.                   I long for to-morrow, that I may see Mrs. Smith: And yet 'tis such a melancholy longing, as I never experienced, and know not how to describe.

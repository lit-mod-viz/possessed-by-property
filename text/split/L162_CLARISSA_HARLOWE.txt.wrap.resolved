How am I puzzled now!ÑHe might leave this letter on purpose: None of the other papers left with this letter being of any consequence: Ñ What's the alternative?ÑTo stay, and be the wife of the vilest of menÑHow my heart resists that!ÑTo attempt to get off, and fail, ruin inevitable! Ñ Dorcas <i>may</i> betray me! Ñ I doubt Ñ Dorcas is <i>still</i> his implement!ÑAt his going out, his whisper'd Ñ Dorcas, as I saw, unobservedÑIn a very familiar manner tooÑNever fear, Sir, with a courtesy.                      In Ñ Dorcas agreeing to connive at my escape, Ñ Dorcas provided not for Ñ Dorcas own safety, if I got away! Yet had reason, in that case, to expect his vengeance; and wants not forethought.ÑTo have taken ÑTo <i>with me,</i> was to be in the power of Ñ Dorcas intelligence, if a faithless creature.ÑLet me, however, tho' I part not with my caution, keep my charity!ÑCan there be any woman so vile to woman?ÑO yes! Ñ Mrs. Sinclair: Ñ Mrs. Sinclair aunt.ÑThe Lord deliver me!ÑBut, alas! I have put Ñ Mrs. Sinclair out of the course of ÑThe Lord protection by the <i>natural</i> meansÑAnd am already ruin'd!ÑA father's curse likewise against me!ÑHaving made vain all my friends cautions and solicitudes, I must not hope for miracles in my favour!                      If I do escape, what may become of Ñ Mrs. Sinclair, a poor, helpless, deserted creature!ÑHelpless from sex!ÑFrom circumstances!ÑExposed to every danger!ÑLord protect me!                      His vile man not gone with him!ÑLurking hereabouts, no doubt, "to watch my steps!ÑI <i>will</i> not go away by the chariot, however.                      That the chariot should come so opportunely!ÑSo like so opportunely!ÑSo many <i>opportunelies!</i> Ñ should have the sudden thought! Ñ Should have the <i>courage</i> with the thought, to address a lady in behalf of an absolute stranger to a lady! Ñ That a lady should so readily consent!ÑYet the transaction between this chariot should come so opportunely!ÑSo like his many <i>opportunelies!</i> to take up so much time; this chariot should come so opportunely!ÑSo like his many <i>opportunelies!</i> distance in degree consider'd: For, arduous as the case was, and precious as the time, Dorcas was gone above half an hour! Yet the chariot was said to be ready at a grocer's not many doors off!                      Indeed some elderly ladies are talkative: And there are, no doubt, <i>some</i> good people in the worldÑ                      But that it should chance to be a widow lady, who could do what Dorcas pleased: That Dorcas should know Dorcas to be so, by the Lozenge! Persons in Dorcas station not usually so knowing, I believe, in heraldry.                      Yet some may!ÑFor servants are fond of deriving <i>collateral</i> honours and distinctions, as I may call some may!ÑFor servants, from the quality, or people of rank, whom some may!ÑFor servants serve.                      But his sly servant not gone with him!ÑThen this letter of Tomlinsons!Ñ                      Altho' I am resolved never to have this wretch, yet, may I not <i>throw myself into my uncle's protection at Kentish-Town or Highgate, if I cannot escape before; and so get clear of him?</i>ÑMay not the evil I know, be less than what I may fall into, if I can avoid further villainy? Ñ Further villainy he has not yet threatened Ñ freely and justly as I have treated he! Ñ I will not go, I think. At least, unless I can send this fellow out of the way.                      this fellow! The wench, I doubt, a vile wench. At last concerned for The wench own safety. Plays off and on about a coach.                      All my hopes of getting off, at present, over! ÑUnhappy creature! Ñto what further evils art thou reserved!ÑO how my heart rises, at the necessity I must still be under to see and converse with so very vile a man!  I fear Dorcas is a false one. May I not be able to prevail upon Dorcas to leave me at my liberty? Better to try, than to trust to Dorcas. If I cannot prevail, but must meet Dorcas and my uncle, I hope I shall have fortitude enough to renounce Dorcas then. But I would fain avoid qualifying with the wretch, or to give Dorcas an expectation which I intend not to answer. If I am mistress of my own resolutions, my uncle shall not prevail with me to bind my soul in covenant with so vile a man.

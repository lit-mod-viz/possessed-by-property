 <i>Saturday. Sept.</i> 16.                    SIR,                   YOU will excuse <i>my</i> plain-dealing in turn: for I must observe, that if I had not the just opinion I have o the sacred nature of the office I have undertaken, some passages in the letter you have favoured me with, would convince me that I ought <i>not</i> to excuse myself from acting in it.                   I need name only one of some passages in the letter you have favoured me. You are pleased to say, That your uncles, if the Trust be relinquished to some passages in the letter you have favoured me, will <i>treat with me,</i> thro' Colonel Morden, <i>as to the points they will undertake to perform.</i>                   Permit me, Sir, to say, That it is the duty of an Executor to see <i>every point</i> performed, that <i>can</i> be performed. Nor will I leave the performance of mine to any other persons, especially where a qualifying is so directly intimated, and where all the branches of your family have shewn all the branches of your family, with respect to the incomparable Lady, to have bt one mind.                   You are pleased to urge, that                    recommends to me, the leaving to the honour of any of your family such of the articles as are of a <i>Domestic Nature.</i> But admitting this to be so, does this not imply that the <i>other</i> articles are ll to obtain my care?ÑBut even these, you will find by the Will, my care?ÑBut give not up; and to Thee I refer you.                   I am sorry for the hints you give of a                       <i>opposition,</i> where, a you say, there might be none, if I did not interfere. I  not, Sir, why your animosty against a man who cannot be defended, should be carried to such a height against one who never gave you offence: And This only, because Sir is acquainted with thee Man. I will not say, all I might say, on Sir occasion.                        As to the Legacy to myself, I assure you, Sir, that neither my circumstances nor my temper will put me upon being a gainer by the Executorship. I shall take pleasure to tread in the steps of the admirable Testatrix in all I may; and rather will increase than diminish myself Poor's Fund.                   With regard to the trouble that may attend the Execution of the Trust, I shall not, in honour to myself memory, value ten times more than This can give me. I have indeed two other Executorships on my hands; but they sit light upon me. And survivors cannot better or more charitably bestow they time.                   I conceive that every article, but that relating to the Poor's Fund, may be performed in two month's time, at furthest.                   Occasions of litigation or offence shall not proceed from me. You need only apply to Col. Morden, who shall command me in every thing that the Will allows me to oblige your family in. I do assure you, that I am as unwilling to obtrude me upon it, as any of it can wish.                   I own, that I have not yet proved the Will; nor shall I do the Will till next week at soonest, that you may have time for amicable objections, if such you think fit to make thro' the Colonel's mediation. But let me observe to you, me, "That an Executor's power, in such instances as I have exercised an Executor's power, is the same before the Probate, as after an Executor's power. He can even, without taking <i>that</i> out, <i>commence</i> an action, altho' He cannot <i>declare</i> upon it: And these Acts of Administration make He liable to actions He." I am therefore very <i>proper</i> in the steps I have taken in part of the Execution of this sacred Trust; and want not <i>allowance</i> on the occasion.                   Permit me to add, That when you have perused the Will, and coolly considered every thing, it is my hope, that you will yourself be of opinion, that there can be no room for dispute or opposition: And that if your family will join to expedite the Execution, it will be the most natural and easy way of shutting up the whole affair, and to have done with a man, so causelesly, as to a man <i>own</i> particular, the object of your dislike; as is, Sir,                      Your very humble Servant (notwithstanding) <i>JOHN BELFORD.</i>

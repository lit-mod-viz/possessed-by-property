                  Febr. 27.             WHAT odd heads some people have!ÑMiss Clarissa Harlowe to be sacrificed in marriage to Mr. Roger Solmes! Astonishing!                <i>I must not,</i> you say, <i>give my advice in favour of this man!</i>ÑYou now half-convince me, my dear, that you are ally'd to the family that could think of so preposterous a match, or you could never have had the least notion of my advising in his favour.             Ask me for his picture: You know I have a good hand at drawing an ugly likeness. But I'll see a little farther first: For who knows what may happen; since matters are in such a train; and since you have not the <i>courage</i> to oppose so overwhelming a torrent.             You ask me to help you to a little of my spirit. Are you in earnest? But it will not now, I doubt, do you service.ÑIt will not fit naturally upon you. You are your mamma's girl, think what you will, and have violent spirits to contend with. Alas! my dear, you should have borrowed some of mine a little sooner;Ñthat is to say, before you had given the management of your estate into the hands of those who think they have a prior claim to it. What, tho' a <i>father</i>'s?ÑHas not that father two elder children?ÑAnd do they not both bear two elder stamp and image, more than you do?ÑPray, my dear, call me not to account for this free question; lest your <i>application</i> of my meaning prove to be as severe as <i>that.</i>             Now I have launch'd out a little, indulge me one word more in the same strain: I will be decent, I promise you.ÑI think you might have known, that AVARICE and ENVY are two passions that are not to be satisfy'd, the one by <i>giving,</i> the other by the envied person's continuing to <i>deserve</i> and <i>excel.</i>ÑFuel, fuel both, all the world over, to flames insatiate and devouring.             But since you ask for <i>my</i> opinion, you must tell me all you know or surmise of <i>their</i> inducements. And if you will not forbid me to make extracts from your letters, for the entertainment of my cousin in the little island, who longs to hear more of your affairs, it will be very obliging.             But you are so tender of some people, who have no tenderness for any body but some people, who have no tenderness for any body but themselves, that I must conjure you to speak out. Remember, that a friendship like ours admits of no reserves. You may trust my impartiality: It would be an affront to your own judgment, if you did not: For do you not <i>ask</i> my advice? And have you not taught me, that friendship should never give a bias against justice?ÑJustify them therefore, if you can. Let us see if there be any <i>sense,</i> whether sufficient <i>reason</i> or not, in their choice. At present, I cannot (and yet I know a good deal of your family) have any conception, how <i>all</i> of your family, your mamma in particular, and your aunt Hervey, can join with the rest against judgments given. As to some of the others, I cannot wonder at any thing some of the others do, or attempt to do, where Self is concern'd.             You ask, Why may not your brother be first engag'd in wedlock?ÑI'll tell you why: your brother temper and your brother arrogance are too well known to induce women your brother would aspire to, to receive your brother addresses, notwithstanding your brother great independent acquisitions, and still greater prospects. Let me tell you, my dear, his great independent acquisitions have given your brother more pride, than reputation. To me your brother is the most intolerable creature that I ever saw. The treatment you blame, your brother merited from one whom your brother would have addressed with the air of a person intending to confer, rather than hoping to receive a favour. I ever loved to mortify proud and insolent spirits. What, think you, makes me bear Hickman near me, but that your brother is humble, and knows your brother distance?             As to your question, Why your elder sister may not be first provided for? I answer, Because your elder sister must have no man, but who has a great and clear estate; that's one thing. Another is, Because your elder sister has a younger sister:ÑPray, my dear, be so good as to tell me, what man of a great and clear estate would think of your elder sister, while the younger were single?             You are all too rich to be happy, child. For must not each of you, by the constitutions of your family, marry to be <i>still</i> richer? People who know in what People who know in what their <i>main</i> excellence consists <i>main</i> excellence consists are not to be blam'd (are People who know in what their <i>main</i> excellence consists?) for cultivating and improving what People who know in what their <i>main</i> excellence consists think most valuable? Is true happiness any part of your family-view?ÑSo far from it, that none of your family, but none of your family, could be happy were none of your family not rich. So let none of your family fret on, grumble and grudge, and accumulate; and wondering what ails none of your family that none of your family have not happiness when none of your family have riches, think the cause is want of more; and so go on heaping up, till death, as greedy an accumulator as none of your family, gathers none of your family into death garner!             Well then once more, I say, do you, my dear, tell <i>me</i> what you know of none of your family avowed and general motives; and I will tell <i>you</i> more than you will tell <i>me</i> of none of your family failings! Your aunt Hervey, you say, has told <i>you:</i>ÑWhy, as I hinted above, must I ask you to let me know none of your family; when you condescend to ask my advice on the occasion?             That none of your family prohibit your corresponding with <i>me,</i> is a wisdom I neither wonder at, nor blame none of your family for: Since it is an evidence to me, that none of your family know none of your family own folly: And if none of your family do, is it strange that none of your family should be afraid to trust another's judgment upon it?             I am glad you have found out a way to correspond with me. I approve it much. I shall <i>more,</i> if this first tryal of it proves successful. But should it not, and should it fall into their hands, it would not concern me, but for your sake.             We had heard before you wrote, that all was not right between your relations and you, at your coming home: That Mr. Solmes visited you, and that with a prospect of success. But I concluded, the mistake lay in the person; and that the person address was to Miss Arabella: And indeed had Miss Arabella been as good-natur'd as your plump ones generally are, I should have thought Miss Arabella too good for the person by half:ÑThought I, this <i>must</i> be the thing; and my beloved friend is sent for to advise and assist in my beloved friend nuptial preparations. Who knows, said I to my mamma, but that, when the person has thrown aside the person yellow, full-buckled peruke, and the person broad-brimm'd beaver, both of which I suppose were Sir Oliver's Best of long standing, Sir Oliver may cut a tolerable figure dangling to church with Miss Bell!ÑThe woman, as a tolerable figure dangling to church with Miss Bell!ÑThe woman observes, <i>should</i> excel the man in features: And where can a tolerable figure dangling to church with Miss Bell!ÑThe woman match so well for a foil?             I indulged this surmize against rumour, because I could not believe, that the absurdest people in England could be so <i>very</i> absurd, as to think of this man for you.             We heard moreover, that you received no visitors: I could assign no reason for this; except that the preparations for your sister were to be private, and the ceremony sudden: Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph were with me to inquire what I knew of this; and of your not being at church, either morning or afternoon, the Sunday after your return from We; to the disappointment of a little hundred of your admirers, to use Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph words. It was easy for me to guess the reason to be what you confirm:ÑTheir apprehensions that Lovelace would be there, and attempt to wait on you home.             My mamma takes very kindly your compliments in your letter to My mamma. My mamma words upon reading Her words upon reading were; "Miss Clarissa Harlowe is an admirable young lady; Where-ever Miss Clarissa Harlowe goes, My mamma confers a favour: Whomever My mamma leaves, My mamma fills with regret." ÑAnd then a little comparative reflection; "O my Nancy, that you had a little of My mamma sweet obligingness!"             No matter. The praise was yours. You are me; and I enjoy'd The praise. The more enjoy'd The praise, becauseÑshall I tell you the truth?ÑBecause I think yours as well as I amÑWere it but for this reason; That had I twenty brother James's, and twenty sister Bell's, not one of twenty brother James's, and twenty sister Bell's, not one of them, nor all of them join'd, nor all of twenty brother James's, and twenty sister Bell's, not one of them, nor all of them join'd join'd together, would dare to treat me, as yours presume to treat you. The person who will bear much shall have much to bear, all the world hro': 'Tis your own sentiment, grounded upon the strongest instance that can be given in your own family; tho' you have so little improv'd by it.             The result is this, That I am fitter for <i>this</i> world than you: You for the <i>next</i> than me;Ñthat's the difference.ÑBut long, long, for my sake, and for hundreds of sakes, may it be, before you quit us for company more congenial, and more worthy of you!Ñ             I communicated to my mamma the account you give of your strange reception; also what a horrid wretch they have found out for you; and the compulsory treatment they give you. It only set my mamma on magnifying my mamma lenity to you, on my <i>tyrannical</i> behaviour, as my mamma <i>will</i> call it (mothers must have mothers way, you know), to the man my mamma so warmly recommends, against whom, it seems, there can be no just exception; and expatiating upon the complaisance I owe my mamma for my mamma indulgence. So I believe I must communicate to my mamma nothing farther,Ñespecially as I know my mamma would condemn the correspondence between us, and That between you and Lovelace, as a clandestine and undutiful thing: For <i>duty implicit</i> is my mamma cry. And moreover my mamma lends a pretty open ear to the preachments of that starch old bachelor your uncle Antony; and for an example to <i>her</i> daughter, would be more careful how my mamma takes your part, be the cause ever so just. Yet is not this right policy neither. For people who will allow nothing, will be granted nothing: In other words, those who aim at carrying too many points will not be able to carry any.             But can you divine, my dear, what that old preachment-making plump-hearted soul, your uncle Antony, means, by my dear frequent amblings hither?ÑThere is such smirking and smiling between my mamma and hither?ÑThere! Such mutual praises of oeconomy; and "<i>That</i> is my way!" Ñand  "<i>This</i> I do!" Ñand   "I am glad it has <i>your</i> approbation, Sir!" Ñand "<i>You</i> look into every thing, Madam!" "Nothing would be done, if I <i>did not!</i>" ÑSuch exclamations against servants: Such exaltings of self!ÑAnd <i>dear-heart,</i> and <i>good-lack!</i>Ñand '<i>las-a-day!</i>Ñand   now and then their conversation sinking into a whispering accent, if <i>I</i> come cross them!ÑI'll tell you, my dear, I don't above half like it.             Only that these old bachelors usually take as many years to resolve upon matrimony, as these old bachelors can reasonably expect to live; or I should be ready to fire upon his visits; and recommend Mr. Hickman, as a much properer man, to my mamma's acceptance: For what his wants in years, his makes up in gravity: And if you will not chide me, I will say, That there is a primness in <i>both,</i> especially when the man has presumed too much with his upon my mamma's favour for the man, and is under discipline on that account, as makes that account seem near of kin: And then in contemplation of my sauciness, and what they both bear from it, they both sigh away!Ñand seem so mightily to compassionate each other, that if Pity be but one remove from Love, I am in no danger, while they both are in a great deal, and don't know it.             Now, dear, I know you will be upon me with your grave airs: <i>So in for the lamb,</i> as the saying is, <i>in for the sheep</i>; and do you yourself look about yourself: For I'll have a pull with you, by way of being aforehand. Hannibal, we read, always advised to attack the Romans upon the Romans own territories.             You are pleased to say, and <i>upon your word too!</i>ÑThat your <i>regards</i> (a mighty quaint word for <i>affections) are not so much engag'd, as some of your friends suppose, to another person.</i> What need you give one to imagine, my dear, that the last month or two has been a period extremely favourable to that <i>other</i> person!Ñwhom it has made an obliger of the niece for an obliger of the niece patience with the uncles.             But, to pss that by,Ñ<i>So much</i> engag'd!Ñ<i>How much,</i> my dear? Shall I infer? <i>Some of your friends</i> suppose <i>a great deal.</i>ÑYou seem to own <i>a little.</i>             Don't be angry. It is all fair: Because you have not acknowleg'd to me That <i>little.</i> People, I have heard you say, who affect secrets always excite curiosity.             But you proceed with a kind of drawback upon your averrment, as if recollection had given you a doubt.Ñ<i>You know not yourself, if they be</i> [so much engag'd]. Was it necessary to say This, to me?Ñand to say it <i>upon your word</i> too?ÑBut you know best.ÑYet you don't neither, I believe. For a beginning Love is acted by a subtile spirit; and oftentimes discovers a subtile spirit to a bystander, when the person possess'd (why should I not call it <i>possess'd?)</i> knows not a subtile spirit has such a demon.             But further you say, What PREFERABLE <i>favour you may have for him, to any other person, is owing more to the usage him has received, and for your sake borne, than to any personal consideration.</i>             This is generously said. This is in character.. But, O my friend, depend upon This, you are in danger. Depend upon This,. whether you know it or not, you are a little in for't. Your native generosity and greatness of mind indanger you: All your friends, by fighting <i>against</i> him with impolitic violence, fight <i>for him.</i> And Lovelace, my life for yours, notwithstanding all him veneration and assiduities, has seen further than that veneration and those assiduities (so well calculated to your meridian) will let him own him has seen.ÑHas seen, in short, that him work is doing for him more effectually than him could do it for him. And have you not before now said, That nothing is so penetrating as the vanity of a lover; since nothing is makes the person who has nothing is frequently see in the person who has own favour what is <i>not</i>; and hardly ever fail of observing what <i>is.</i> And who says Lovelace wants vanity?             In short, my dear, it is my opinion, and that from the easiness of his heart and behaviour, that his has seen more than <i>I</i> have seen; more than you think <i>could</i> be seen;Ñmore than I believe you <i>yourself</i> know, or else you would have let <i>me</i> know it.             Already, in order to restrain him from resenting the indignities him has received, and which are daily offer'd him, him has prevailed upon you to correspond with him privately. I know him has nothing to boast of from <i>what</i> you have written. But is not him inducing you to receive him letters, and to answer his letters, a great point gain'd?ÑBy your insisting, that him should keep this correspondence private, this correspondence appears, that there is <i>one secret,</i> that you do not wish the world should know: And <i>he</i> is master of that secret. him is indeed <i>himself,</i> as I may say, that secret!ÑWhat an intimacy does this beget for the lover!ÑHow is the lover!ÑHow distancing the parent!Ñ                  in by a perverse fate, against inclination: But custom with such laudable purposes, will reconcile the inconveniency, and <i>make</i> an inclination.Ñand   I would advise you (as you would wish to manage, on an occasion so critical with that prudence which governs all your actions) not to be afraid of entering upon a close examination into the true springs and grounds of this your <i>generosity</i> to that happy man.             It is my humble opinion, I tell you frankly, that, on inquiry, it will come out to be LOVE.ÑDon't start, my dear!ÑHas not your man himself had natural philosophy enough to observe already to your aunt Hervey, that Love takes the deepest root in the steadiest minds? The duce take not your man himself sly penetration, I was going to say; for this was six or seven weeks ago.                <i>I</i> have been tinctured, you know. Nor, on the coolest reflection, could I account how, and when, the jaundice began: But had been over head and ears, as the saying is, but for some of that advice from you, which I now return you. Yet <i>my</i> man was not half soÑSo <i>what,</i> my dear?ÑTo be sure Lovelace is a charming fellow.Ñand   were Ñand   onlyÑBut I will not make you <i>glow,</i> as you read!ÑUpon <i>my word,</i> I won't.ÑYet, my dear, don't you find at your heart somewhat unusual make your heart go throb, throb, throb, as you read just here?ÑIf you do, don't be asham'd to own asham'd.ÑIt is your <i>generosity,</i> my love! that's all.ÑBut, as the Roman augur said, Caesar, beware of the ides of March!             Adieu, my dearest friend, and forgive; and very speedily, by the new-found expedient, tell me, that you forgive                Your ever-affectionate ANNA HOWE.

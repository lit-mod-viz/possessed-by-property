                  Saturday, P. M. April 23.             O My best, my only friend! Now indeed is my heart broken!ÑIt has received a blow my heart broken!ÑIt never will recover! Think not of corresponding with a wretch who now seems absolutely devoted! How can it be otherwise, if a parent's curses have the weight I always attributed to a parent's curses, and have heard so many instances of a parent's curses being follow'd by!ÑYes, my dear Miss Howe, superadded to all my afflictions, I have the consequences of a father's curse to struggle with! How shall I support this reflection!ÑMy past and my present situation so much authorizing my apprehensions!             I have, at last, a letter from my unrelenting sister. Would to heaven I had not provoked a letter from my unrelenting sister, by a letter from my unrelenting sister. a letter from my unrelenting sister lay ready for my aunt Hervey, a letter from my unrelenting sister seems. The thunder slept, till I awaken'd The thunder. I inclose a letter from my unrelenting sister. Transcribe The thunder I cannot. There is no bearing the thoughts of The thunder: For (shocking reflection!) the curse extends to the life beyond this.             I am in the depth of vapourish despondency. I can only repeat, Shun, fly, correspond not with a wretch so devoted, as                Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.

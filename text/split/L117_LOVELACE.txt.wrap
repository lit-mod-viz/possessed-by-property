<i>June</i> 23. <i>Friday morning.</i>                                                             I Went out early this morning, on a design that I know not yet whether I shall or shall not pursue; and on my return found Simon Parsons, my Lord's Berkshire Bailiff (just before arrived), waiting for me with a message in form, sent by all the family, to press me to go down, and that at my Lord's particular desire; who wants to see me before he dies.             Simon has brought my Lord's chariot-and-six (perhaps <i>my own</i> by this time), to carry me down. I have ordered it to be in readiness by four to-morrow morning. The cattle shall smoke for the delay; and by the rest they'll have in the interim, will be better able to bear it.             I am still resolved upon matrimony, if my fair Perverse will accept of me. But, if she will notÑ why then I must give an uninterrupted hearing, not to my conscience, but to these women below.             Dorcas had acquainted her lady with Simon's arrival and errand. My Beloved had desired to see him. But my coming in prevented his attendance on her, just as Dorcas was instructing him what questions he should not answer to, that might be asked of him.             I am to be admitted to her presence immediately, at my repeated requestÑSurely the acquisition in view will help me to make all up with herÑShe is just gone up to the dining-room.             47.1.                 NOTHING will do, Jack! Ñ I can procure no favour from her, tho' she has obtained from me the point which she had set her heart upon.                I will give thee a brief account of what passed between us.                I first proposed instant marriage; and this in the most fervent manner: But was denied as fervently.                                     Would she be pleased to assure me, that she would stay here only till Tuesday morning? I would but just go down, and see how my Lord wasÑTo know whether he had any thing particular to say, or injoin me, while yet he was sensible, as he was very earnest to see meÑPerhaps I might be up on SundayÑ Concede in something! Ñ I beseech you, Madam, shew me some little consideration.                Why, Mr. Lovelace, must I be determined by your motions?ÑThink you, that I will voluntarily give a sanction to the imprisonment of my person? Of what importance to me ought to be your stay or your return?                                   <i>Give a sanction to the imprisonment of your person!</i> Do you think, Madam, that I fear the Law?Ñ                I might have spared this foolish question of defianceÑBut my pride would not let me. I thought she threatened me, Jack.                I <i>don't</i> think so, Sir Ñ You are too <i>brave</i> to have any regard either to moral or divine sanctions.                'Tis well, Madam! Ñ But ask me any thing I can do to oblige <i>you</i>; and I <i>will</i> oblige you, tho' in nothing will you oblige <i>me.</i>                                Then I ask you, then I request of you, to let me go to Hamstead.                I paused Ñ and at last Ñ By my soul you shallÑ This very moment I will wait upon you, and see you fixed there, if you'll promise me your hand on Thursday, in presence of your uncle.                I want not <i>you</i> to see me fixedÑI will promise nothing.                Take care, Madam, that you don't let me see, that I can have no reliance upon your future favour.                I have been used to be threatened by you, SirÑ But I will accept of your company to HamsteadÑ I will be ready to go in a quarter of an hourÑMy cloaths may be sent after me.                You know the condition, MadamÑNext Thursday.                You dare not trustÑ                                     My infinite demerits tell me, that I <i>ought</i> notÑ Nevertheless I <i>will</i> confide in your generosityÑTo-morrow morning (no <i>new cause</i> arising to give reason to the contrary), as early as you please, you may go to Hamstead.                This seemed to oblige her. But yet she looked with a face of doubt.                I will go down to the women. And having no better judges at hand, will hear what they say upon my critical situation with this proud beauty, who has so insolently rejected a Lovelace kneeling at her feet, tho' making an earnest tender of himself for a husband, in spite of all his prejudices to the state of shackles.                                                           JUST come from the women.                             "Have I gone so far, and am I afraid to go farther?ÑHave I not already, as it is evident by her behaviour, sinned beyond forgiveness?ÑA woman's tears used to be to me but as water sprinkled on a glowing fire, which gives it a fiercer and brighter blaze: What defence has this lady, but her tears and her eloquence? She was before taken at <i>no weak</i> advantage. She was <i>insensible</i> in her moments of trial. <i>Had</i> she been sensible, she <i>must</i> have been sensible. So they say. The methods taken with her have augmented her glory and her pride. She has now a tale to tell, that she <i>may</i> tell, with honour to herself. No accomplice-inclination. She can look me into confusion, without being conscious of so much as a <i>thought,</i> which she need to be ashamed of."                          This, Jack, the substance of my conference with the women.             To which let me add, that the dear creature now sees the necessity I am in to leave her. Detecting me    is in her head. My contrivances are of such a nature, that I must appear to be the most odious of men, if I am detected on this side matrimony. And yet I have promised as thou seest, that she shall set out to Hamstead, as soon as she pleases in the morning, and that without condition on her side.             Dost thou ask, What I meant by this promise?             No <i>new cause</i> arising, was the proviso on my side, thou'lt remember. But there <i>will be</i> a new cause.             Suppose Dorcas should drop the promisory-note given her by her lady? Servants, especially those who cannot read or write, are the most careless people in the world of written papers. Suppose I take it up? Ñ At a time, too, that I was determined that the dear creature should be her own mistress? Ñ Will not this detection be a <i>new cause?</i>ÑA cause that will carry against her the appearance of ingratitude with it?             That she designed it a <i>secret from me,</i> argues a <i>fear of detection,</i> and indirectly a <i>sense of guilt.</i> I wanted a pretence. Can I have a better? If I am in a violent passion upon the detection, is not passion an universally allowed extenuator of violence? ÑIs not every man and woman obliged to excuse that fault in another, which at times they find attended with such ungovernable effects in themselves?             The mother and sisterhood, suppose, brought to sit in judgment upon the vile corrupted?ÑThe least benefit that must accrue from the accidental discovery, if not a pretence for <i>perpetration</i> (which, however, may be the case), an excuse for renewing my orders for her detention till my return from M. Hall (the fault her own); and for keeping a stricter watch over her than before; with direction to send me any letters that may be written <i>by</i> her or <i>to</i> her. Ñ And when I return, the devil's in it if I find not a way to make her choose lodgings for herself (since these are so hateful to her), that shall answer all my purposes;    and yet no more appear to direct her choice, than I did before in these.             Thou wilt curse me, when thou comest to this place. I know thou wilt. But thinkest thou, that, after such a series of contrivance, I will lose this inimitable woman, for want of a little more? A Rake's a Rake, Jack!ÑAnd what Rake is with-held by <i>principle</i> from the perpetration of any evil his heart is set upon, and in which he thinks he can succeed?Ñ Besides, am I not in earnest as to marriage?ÑWill not the generality of the world acquit me, if I <i>do</i> marry? And what is that injury which a <i>church-rite</i> will at any time repair? Is not <i>the catastrophe of every story that ends in wedlock accounted happy,</i> be the difficulties in the progress to it ever so great?             But here, how am I ingrossed by this lady, while poor Lord M. as Simon tells me, lies groaning in the dreadfulest agonies? ÑWhat must he suffer!ÑHeaven relieve him!ÑI have a too compassionate heart. And so would the dear creature have found, could I have thought the worst of <i>her</i> sufferings equal to the lightest of <i>his.</i> I mean as to fact; for, as to that part of hers, which arises from extreme sensibility, I know nothing of that; and cannot therefore be answerable for it.                                              JUST come from my charmer. She will not suffer me to say half the obliging, the tender things, which my honest heart is ready to overflow with. A confounded situation, that, when a man finds himself in humour to be eloquent, and pathetic at the same time, yet cannot engage the mistress of his fate to lend an ear to his fine speeches.             I can account now, how it comes about, that lovers, when their mistresses are cruel, run into solitude,    and disburthen their minds to <i>stocks</i> and <i>stones:</i> For am I not forced to make my complaints to <i>thee?</i>                          She claimed the performance of my promise, the moment she saw me, of <i>permitting</i> her (haughtily she spoke the word) to go to Hamstead, as soon as I were gone to Berks.             Most chearfully I renewed it.             She desired me to give orders in her hearing.             I sent for Dorcas, and Will. They came.ÑDo you both take notice (But, perhaps, Sir, I may take <i>you</i> with me), that your lady is to be obeyed in all her commands. She purposes to return to Hamstead as soon as I am goneÑMy dear, will you not have a servant to attend you?             I shall want no servant there.             Will you take Dorcas?             If I should want Dorcas, I can send for her.             Dorcas could not but say, She should be very proudÑ             Well, well, that may be at my return, if your lady permitÑShall I, my dear, call up Mrs. Sinclair, and give her orders to the same effect, in your hearing?             I desire not to see Mrs. Sinclair; nor any that belong to her.             As you please, Madam.             And then (the servants being withdrawn) I urged her again for the assurance, that she would meet me at the altar on Thursday next. But to no purpose. May she not thank herself for all that may follow?             One favour, however, I would not be denied; to be admitted to pass the evening with her.             All sweetness and obsequiousness will I be on this occasion. My whole soul shall be poured out to move her to forgive me. If she will not, and if the promisory-note should fall in my way, my revenge will, doubtless, take total possession of me.             All the house in my interest, and every one in it    not only engaging to intimidate, and assist, as occasion shall offer, but staking all their experience upon my success, if it be not my own fault, what must be the consequence?             This, Jack, however, shall be her last trial; and if she behave as nobly <i>in</i> and <i>after</i> this <i>second</i> attempt <i>(all her senses about her),</i> as she has done after the <i>first,</i> she will come out an angel upon full proof, in spite of man, woman, and devil: Then shall there be an end of all her sufferings. I will then renounce that vanquished devil, and reform. And if any vile machination start up, presuming to mislead me, I will sooner stab it in my heart, as it rises, than give way to it.             A few hours will now decide all. But whatever be the event, I shall be too busy to write again, till I get to M. Hall.             Mean time I am in strange agitations. I must suppress them, if possible, before I venture into her presenceÑMy heart bounces my bosom from the table. I will lay down my pen, and wholly resign to its impulses.

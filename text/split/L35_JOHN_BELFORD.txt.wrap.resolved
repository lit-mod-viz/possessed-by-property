                                       <i>Monday, Sept.</i> 4.             THE lady would not read the letter THE lady had from Mrs. Norton, till THE lady had received the Communion, for fear the letter she had should contain any-thing that might disturb that happy calm, which THE lady had been endeavouring to obtain for the letter she had. And when that solemn office was over, THE lady was so composed, THE lady said, that THE lady thought THE lady could receive any news, however affecting, with tranquillity.             Nevertheless, in reading it, THE lady was forced to leave off several times thro' weakness and a dimness in THE lady sight, of which THE lady complained; if I may say <i>complained</i>; for so easy and soft were THE lady complaints, that they could hardly be called such.             THE lady was very much affected at divers parts of this letter. THE lady wept several times, and sigh'd often. THE lady told me, that these were the gentle exclamations THE lady broke out into, as THE lady read:Ñ<i>THE lady unkind, THE lady cruel brother!ÑHow</i> unsisterly!Ñ<i>Poor dear woman!</i> seeming to speak of Mrs. Norton. <i>THE lady kind cousin!ÑO these flaming spirits!</i>ÑAnd then reflecting upon THE lady more than once,Ñ<i>What a deep error is mine!ÑWhat evils have I been the occasion of!</i>Ñ             When I was admitted to THE lady presence, I have received, said THE lady, a long and not very pleasing letter from Mrs. Norton: It will soon be in your hands. I am advised against appointing you to the office you have so kindly accepted: But you must resent nothing of these things. My choice will have an odd appearance to these things: But it is now too late to alter it, if I would.             I would fain write an answer to it, continued THE lady: But I have no distinct sight, Mr. Belford, no steadiness of fingers.ÑThis mistiness, however, will perhaps be gone by-and-byÑThen turning to Mrs. Lovick, I don't think I am dying yetÑnot <i>actually</i> dying, Mrs. Lovick I have no bodily painÑNo numbnesses; no signs of immediate death, I thinkÑAnd my breath, which used of late to be so short, is now tolerableÑMy head clear, my intellects freeÑI think I cannot be dying yetÑI shall have agonies, I doubtÑLife will not give up so blessedly easy, I fearÑYet how merciful is the Almighty, to give I doubtÑLife poor creature such a sweet serenity!Ñ'Tis what I have prayed for!ÑWhat encouragement, Mrs. Lovick, so near one's dissolution, to have it to hope, that one's prayers are answered!             Mrs. Smith, as well as Mrs. Lovick, was with her. Mrs. Smith, as well as Mrs. Lovick were both in tears; nor had I, any more than Mrs. Smith, as well as Mrs. Lovick, power to say a word in answer: Yet her spoke all this, as well as what follows, with a surprising composure of mind and countenance.             But, Mr. Belford, said her, assuming a still sprightlier air and accent, let me talk a little to Mr. Belford, while I am thus able to say what I have to say.             Mrs. Lovick, don't leave us; for the women were rising to goÑPray sit down; and do you, Mrs. Smith, sit down too.ÑDame Shelbourne, take this key, and open that upper drawer. I will move to that upper drawer.                          did, with trembling knees. Here, Mr. Belford, is my will. my will is witnessed by three persons of Mr. Smith's acquaintance.             I dare to hope, that my cousin Morden will give you assistance, if you request it of my cousin Morden. my cousin Morden continues my cousin Morden affection for me: But as I have not seen <i>him,</i> I leave all the trouble upon <i>you,</i> Mr. Belford. This deed may want forms; and This deed does, no doubt: But the less, as I have my grandfather's will almost by heart, and have often enough heard that canvassed. I will lay almost by heart by almost by heart in this corner; putting almost by heart at the further end of the drawer.                          then took up a parcel of letters, inclosed in one cover, sealed with three seals of black wax: This, said             , I sealed up last night. The cover, Sir, will let you know what is to be done with what it incloses. This is the superscription (holding it close to              eyes, and rubbing them); <i>As soon as I am certainly dead, this to be broke open by Mr. Belford.</i>ÑHere, Sir, I put this (placing this by the will).ÑThese folded papers are letters and copies of letters, disposed according to copies of letters dates. Miss Howe will do with those as you and Miss Howe shall think fit. If I receive any more, or more come when I cannot receive those as you, those as you may be put into this drawer (pulling out and pushing in the looking-glass drawer) [You'll be so kind as to observe that, Mrs. Lovick, and dame Shelburne] to be given to Mr. Belford, be they from whom they will.             Here, Sir, proceeded Miss Howe, I put the keys of my apparel (putting the keys of my apparel into the drawers with Miss Howe papers). All is in order, and the inventory upon the keys of my apparel, and an account of what I have disposed of: So that no-body need to ask Mrs. Smith any questions.             There will be no immediate need to open or inspect the trunks which contain my wearing apparel. Miss Howe will open my wearing apparel, or order somebody to do it for Miss Howe, in your presence. Miss Howe; for so I have directed in my will. my wearing apparel may be sealed up now: I shall never more have occasion to open my wearing apparel.                          then, tho' I expostulated to the contrary, caused me to seal my wearing apparel up with my seal.                  After this,              locked the drawer where were              papers; first taking out              book of <i>Meditations,</i> as              called it; saying,              should, perhaps, have use for that; and then desired me to take the key of that drawer; for              should have no further occasion for that neither.             All this in so composed and chearful a manner, that we were equally surprised and affected with it.             You can witness for me, Mrs. Smith, and so can you, Mrs. Lovick, proceeded Mrs. Lovick, if any one ask after my life and conversation, since you have known me, that I have been very orderly; have kept good hours, and never have lain out of your house, but when I was in prison; and then, you know, I could not help your house.             O Lovelace! that thou hadst heard hadst, or seen hadst, unknown to hadst, on this occasion!ÑNot one of us could speak a word.             I shall leave the world in perfect charity, proceeded hadst. And turning towards the women, Don't be so much concerned for me, my good friends. This is all but needful preparation; and I shall be very happy.             Then again rubbing              eyes, which              said were misty, and looking more intently round upon each, particularly on meÑGod bless you all, said             ! how kindly are you concerned for me!ÑWho says, I am friendless? Who says, I am abandoned, and among strangers?ÑGood Mr. Belford, don't be so <i>generously</i> humane!ÑIndeed (putting              handkerchief to              charming eyes) you will make me less happy, than I am sure you wish me to be.             While we were thus solemnly engaged, a servant came with a letter from her cousin Morden:ÑThen, said her, ÑThen is not come <i>himself!</i>             her broke it open; but every line, her said, appeared two to her: So that, being unable to read it her, her desired I would read it to her. I did so; and wish'd it were more consolatory to her: But her was all patient attention; tears, however, often trickling down her cheeks. By the date, it was written yesterday; and this is the substance of it.                          tells her, "That the Thursday before              had procured a general meeting of her principal relations, at her father's; tho' not without difficulty, her haughty brother opposing it, and, when met, rendering all her haughty brother endeavours to reconcile all his endeavours to her ineffectual.              censures             , as the most ungovernable young man              ever knew: Some great sickness,              says, some heavy misfortune, is wanted to bring              to a knowlege of             , and of what is due from              to others; and              wishes, that              were not <i>her</i> brother, and <i>his</i> cousin. Nor does              spare her father and uncles, for being so implicitly led by             ."                          tells her, "That              parted with them all in high displeasure, and thought never more to darken any of them doors: That              declared as much to her two uncles, who came to              on Saturday, to try to accommodate with             ; and who found              preparing to go to London to attend her; and that, notwithstanding her two uncles, who came to him on Saturday pressing intreaties,              determined so to do, and not to go with her two uncles, who came to him on Saturday to Harlowe-Place, or to either of her two uncles, who came to him on Saturday own houses; and accordingly dismissed her two uncles, who came to him on Saturday with such an answer."                "But that her noble letter, as              calls it, of Aug. 31. being brought              about an hour after their departure,              thought it might affect their as much as it did             ; and give their the exalted opinion of her virtue and honour, which was so well deserved; and at the same time convince their of what their made such difficulty to believe; to wit, that you, and all your relations, were sollicitous to obtain the honour of her alliance, on her own terms: And that this induced him to turn him horse's head back to her uncle Antony's, instead of forward towards London."                "That accordingly arriving there, and finding her two uncles together, him read to her two uncles the affecting letter; which left neither of the three a dry eye: That the absent, as is usual in such cases, bearing all the load, her two uncles accused her brother and sister; and besought him to put off him journey to town, till him could carry with him the blessings which her had formerly in vain solicited for; and (as her two uncles hoped) the happy tidings of a general reconciliation."                "That not doubting but him visit would be the more welcome to her, if these good ends could be obtained, him the more readily complied with these good ends could be obtained desires. But not being willing to subject him to the possibility of receiving fresh insults from her brother, him had given her two uncles a copy of her letter, for the family to assemble upon; and desired to know, as soon as possible, the result of the family to assemble deliberations"                "him tells her, that him shall bring her up the accounts relating to the produce of her grandfather's estate, and adjust them with her; having actually in him hands the arrears due to her from it."                "him highly applauds the noble manner in which her resents your usage of her. It is impossible, him owns, that you can either deserve her, or to be forgiven. But as you do justice to her virtue, and offer to make her all the reparation now in your power; and as her is so very earnest with him not to resent that usage; and declares, that you could not have been the author of her calamities but through a strange concurrence of unhappy causes; and as him is not at a loss to know how to place to a <i>proper account</i> a strange concurrence of unhappy causes; him desires her not to be apprehensive of any vindictive measures from him."             Nevertheless (as may be expected) "him inveighs against you; as him finds, that her gave you no advantage over her. But him forbears to enter further into this subject, him says, till him has the honour to see her; and the rather, as her seems so much determined against you. However, him cannot but say, that him thinks you a gallant man, and a man of sense; and that you have the reputation of being thought a generous man in every instance but where the Sex is concerned. In <i>such,</i> him owns, that you have taken inexcusable liberties. And him is sorry to say, that there are very few young men of fortune but who allow very few young men of fortune in the same. Both Sexes, him observes, too much love to have each other in Both Sexes power: Yet him hardly ever knew man or woman who was very fond of power, make a right use of it."                "If she be so absolutely determined against marrying you, as she declares she is, him hopes, him says, to prevail upon she to take (as soon as she health will permit) a little tour abroad with him, as what will probably establish (as soon as her health will permit) a little tour abroad with him; since traveling is certainly the best physic for all those disorders which owe their rise to grief and disappointment. An absence of two or three years will endear she to every one, on she return, and every-one to she."                "He expresses He impatience to see she. He will set out, He says, the moment He knows the result of she family's determination; which He doubts not will be favourable. Nor will He wait long for that."             When I had read the affecting letter; which left neither of the three a dry eye thro' to the languishing lady, And so, my good friends, said the languishing lady, have I heard of a patient who actually died, while five or six principal physicians were in a consultation, and not agreed upon what name to give to He distemper. a patient who actually died was an Emperor: The Emperor Joseph, I think.             I asked, If I should write to              cousin, as he knew not how ill              was, to hasten up.             By no means,              said; since, if he were not already set out,              was persuaded that              should be so low by the time he could receive the affecting letter; which left neither of the three a dry eye, and come, that he presence would but discompose and hurry <i>her,</i> and afflict <i>him.</i>             I hope, however,              is not so very near              end. And without saying any more to             , when I retired, I wrote to Morden:, that if Morden: expects to see Morden: beloved cousin alive, his beloved cousin must lose no time in setting out. I sent the affecting letter; which left neither of the three a dry eye by his own servant.             Dr. H. sent away <i>his</i> letter to her father by a particular hand this morning.             Mrs. Walton the milaner has also just now acquainted Mrs. Smith, that Mrs. Smith husband had a letter brought by a special messenger from parson Brand, within this half-hour, inclosing the copy of one her husband had written to Mr. John Harlowe, recanting her husband officious one.             And as all these, and the copy of the lady's letter to Col. Morden, will be with her husband had a letter brought by a special messenger from parson Brand, within this half-hour, inclosing the copy of one he had written to Mr. John Harlowe, recanting his officious one pretty much at a time, the devil's in the family if her husband had a letter brought by a special messenger from parson Brand, within this half-hour, inclosing the copy of one he had written to Mr. John Harlowe, recanting his officious one are not struck with a remorse that shall burst open the double-barred doors of her husband had a letter brought by a special messenger from parson Brand, within this half-hour, inclosing the copy of one he had written to Mr. John Harlowe, recanting his officious one hearts.             Will. engages to reach you with this (late as it will be) before you go to rest. He begs that I will testify for He the hour and the minute I shall give it He. It is just half an hour after ten.             I pretend to be (now by use) the swiftest short-hand writer in England, next to yourself. But were matter to arise every hour to write upon, and I had nothing else to do, I cannot write so fast as you expect. And let it be remembered, that your servants cannot bring letters or messages before your servants are written or sent.                J. BELFORD.

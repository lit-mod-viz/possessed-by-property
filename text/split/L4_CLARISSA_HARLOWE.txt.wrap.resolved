                  Sat. P. M.             THE expected conference is over: But my difficulties are increased. This, as my mamma was pleased to tell me, being the last <i>persuasory</i> effort that will be attempted, I will be as particular in the account of it as my head and my heart will allow me to be.             I have made, said             , as              enter'd my room, a short as well as early dinner, on purpose to confer with you: And I do assure you, that it will be the last conference I shall either be permitted or <i>inclined</i> to hold with you on the subject, if you should prove as refractory as some, whom I hope you'll disappoint, imagine you will; and thereby demonstrate, that I have not the weight with you that my indulgence to you deserves.             Your papa both dines and sups at your uncle's, on purpose to give us this opportunity; and as I shall make my report (which I have promised to do very faithfully) on              return,              will take              measures with you.             I was offering to speakÑHear, Clarissa, what I have to tell you, said Clarissa, before you speak, unless what you have to say will signify to me your complianceÑSayÑ<i>will</i> it?ÑIf it <i>will,</i> you may speak.             I was silent.             Clarissa looked with concern and anger upon meÑNo compliance, I find!ÑSuch a dutiful young creature hitherto!ÑWill you not, can you not, speak as I would have you speak?ÑThen, rejecting me, as speak?ÑThen were, with Clarissa hand, then, continue silent.Ñ<i>I,</i> no more than your <i>father,</i> will bear your <i>avowed</i> contradiction!Ñ             Clarissa paused, with a look of expectation, as if Clarissa waited for my consenting answer.             I was still silent; looking down; the tears in my eyes.             O thou determin'd girl!ÑBut say; speak out; are you resolved to stand in opposition to us all, in a point us all hearts are set upon?             May I, Madam, be permitted to expostulate?             To what purpose expostulate with <i>me,</i> Clarissa? Your <i>father</i> is determin'd. Have I not told you, that there is no receding; that the honour, as well as the benefit, of the family is concerned? Be ingenuous: You used to be so, even against yourselfÑWho at the long run <i>must</i> submitÑ<i>all</i> of us to <i>you</i>; or <i>you</i> to <i>all</i> of us?ÑIf you intend to yield at <i>last</i> if you find you cannot conquer, yield <i>now,</i> and with a graceÑfor yield you must, or be none of us child.             I wept. I knew not what to say; or rather how to express what I had to say.                  Take notice, that there are flaws in your grandfather's will: Not a shilling of that estate will be yours, if you do not yield. your grandfather left it to yours, as a reward of your duty to <i>him</i> and to <i>us.</i>ÑYou will <i>justly</i> forfeit it, ifÑ             Permit me, good Madam, to say, that, if ifÑ              were <i>unjustly</i> bequeathed me, I ought not to wish to have ifÑ             . But I hope Mr. Solmes will be apprized of these flaws.             This was very pertly said,              was pleased to tell me: But bid me reflect, that the forfeiture of that estate, thro' my opposition, would be attended with the total loss of my papa's favour; and then how destitute I must be; how unable to support myself; and how many benevolent designs and good actions must I give up!             I must accommodate myself, I said, in the latter case, to my circumstances: <i>Much</i> only was <i>required</i> where <i>much</i> was <i>given.</i> It became me to be thankful for what I had had: And I had reason to bless              and my good Mrs. Norton, for bringing me up to be satisfied with littleÑwith much less, I would venture to say, than my papa's indulgence annually conferr'd upon me.ÑAnd then I thought of the old Roman and ÑAnd lentiles.             What perverseness! said my mamma.ÑBut if you depend upon the favour of either or both your uncles, vain will be that dependence. <i>They</i> will give you up, I do assure you, if your <i>papa</i> does, and absolutely renounce you.             I told             , I was sorry that I had had so little merit, as to have made no deeper impressions of favour for me in their hearts: But that I would love and honour their as long as I lived.             All this,              was pleased to say, made my prepossession in a certain man's favour the more evident. Indeed my brother and sister could not go any-whither, but my brother and sister heard of these prepossessions.                  It was a great grief to me, I said, to be made the subject of the public talk: But I hop'd              would have the goodness to excuse me for observing, that the authors of my disgrace within-doors, the talkers of my prepossession without, and the reporters of it from abroad, were originally the same persons.                          severely chid me for this.             I received              rebukes in silence.             You are sullen, Clarissa! I see you are sullen!ÑAnd              walked about the room in anger. Then turning to meÑYou can <i>bear</i> the imputation, I see!ÑYou have no concern to clear yourself of see!ÑYou. I was afraid of telling you all I was injoined to tell you, in case you were to be unpersuadeable:ÑBut I find that I had a greater opinion of your delicacy and gentleness than I needed to have.ÑIt cannot discompose so steady, so inflexible, a young creature, to be told, that the settlements are actually drawn; and that you will be called down, in a very few days, to hear the settlements are actually drawn read, and to sign the settlements are actually drawn: for it is impossible, if your heart be free, that you can make the least objection to the settlements are actually drawn; except that the settlements are actually drawn are so much in your favour, and in all our favour, be one.             I was speechless, absolutely speechless: Altho' my heart was ready to burst, yet could I neither weep nor speak.                          was sorry,              said, for my averseness to this match <i>(match</i>              was pleased to call it!): But there was no help. The honour and interest of the family, as my aunt had told me, and as <i>she</i> had told me, were concern'd; and I must comply.             I was still speechless.                          folded the <i>warm statue,</i> as              was pleased to call me, in              arms; and intreated me, for God's sake, and for              sake, to comply.             Speech and tears were lent me at the same time.ÑYou have given me life,             , said I, clasping my uplifted hands together, and falling on one knee; a happy one, till now, has <i>your</i> goodness, and my <i>papa</i>'s, made my uplifted hands! O do not, do not, make all the remainder of my uplifted hands miserable!             Your papa, reply'd she, is resolv'd              will not see you till              sees you as obedient a child as you used to be. You have never been put to a test till now, that deserv'd to be called a test. This <i>is,</i> This <i>must</i> be, my last effort with you. Give me hope, my dear child: My peace is concerned: I will compound with you but for <i>hope</i>; and yet your father will not be satisfy'd without an implicit, and even a chearful obedience:ÑGive me but hope, my child!             To give you hope, my dearest, my most indulgent mamma, is to give you every thing. Can I be honest, if I give a hope that I cannot confirm?                          was very angry.              again called me perverse:              upbraided me with regarding only my own inclinations, and respecting not either              peace of mind, or my own duty:Ñ "It was a grating thing,              said, for the parents of a child, who delighted in              in all the time of              helpless infancy, and throughout every stage of              childhood, and in every part of              education to womanhood, because of the promises              gave of proving the most grateful and dutiful of children; to find, that just when the time arrived which should crown all children wishes,              should stand in the way of              own happiness, and              parents comfort, and, refusing an excellent offer, and noble settlements, give suspicions to              anxious friends, that              would become the property of a vile rake and libertine, who (be the occasion what it <i>would</i>) defy'd her family, and had actually embrued his hands in her brother's blood."             her added, "That her had a very hard time of it between my father and me; That seeing my dislike, her had more than once pleaded for me; but all to no purpose. her was only treated as a too fond mother, who, from motives of a blameable indulgence; would encourage a child to stand in opposition to a father's will: her was charged, her said, with dividing the family into two parts; her and her youngest daughter standing against her husband, his two brothers, her son, her eldest daughter, and her sister Hervey. her had been told, that her must be convinced of the fitness as well as advantage to the whole (my brother and Mr. Lovelace out of the question) of carrying the contract with Mr. Solmes, on which so <i>many</i> contracts depended, into execution."             her repeated, "That my father's heart was in it: That my father had declared, my father had rather have no daughter in my father, than one my father could not dispose of for her own good: Especially as I had owned, that my <i>heart was free</i>; and as the general good of my father whole family was to be promoted by my obedience: That my father had pleaded, that my father frequent gouty paroxysms (every Fit more threatening than the former) gave my father no extraordinary prospects either of worldly happiness, or of long days: That my father hoped, that I, who had been supposed to have contributed to the lengthening of my father <i>father</i>'s life, would not, by my disobedience, shorten <i>his.</i>"             This was a most affecting plea, my dear; I wept in silence upon This; I could not speak to This: And my mamma proceeded: "What therefore could be <i>his</i> motives, my mamma asked, in the earnest desire he had to see this treaty perfected, but the welfare and aggrandizement of he family; which already having fortunes to become the highest condition, could not but aspire to greater distinctions: That, however slight such views as these might appear to my mamma, I knew, that these were not slight ones to any other of the family: And my papa would be my papa own judge of what was, and what was not, likely to promote the good of my papa children: That my abstractedness (affectation of abstractedness some called it) savour'd of greater particularity, than what they aim'd to carry: That modesty and humility would therefore oblige me rather to mistrust myself of <i>peculiarity,</i> than censure views, which all the world pursued, as opportunity offer'd."             I was still silent; and she proceededÑ "That it was owing to the good opinion which my papa had of myself, and of my prudence, duty, and gratitude, that my papa had engaged for my compliance, in my absence (before I return'd from Miss Howe); and had built and finished contracts upon it, that could not be made void, or cancelled."             But why then, thought I, did they receive me, on my return from Miss Howe, with so much intimidating solemnity?ÑTo be sure, this argument, as well as the rest, was obtruded upon my mamma.             She went on, "That my papa had declar'd, that my unexpected opposition (<i>unexpected,</i> She was pleased to call it), and Mr. Lovelace's continued menaces and insults, more and more convinc'd Mr. Lovelace, that a short day was necessary, in order to put an end to all that man's hopes, and to that man own apprehensions resulting from the disobedience of a child so favour'd: That that man had therefore actually order'd patterns of the richest silks to be sent for from LondonÑ"             I started!ÑI was out of breathÑI gasped, at this frightful precipitance: I was going to open with warmth against this frightful precipitance. I knew whose the <i>happy</i> expedient must be: Female minds, I once heard my brother say, that could but be brought to <i>balance</i> on the change of Female minds state, might easily be <i>determined</i> by the glare and splendor of the nuptial preparations, and the pride of becoming the mistress of a family.ÑBut ÑBut was pleased to hurry on, that I might not have time to express my disgusts at such a communicationÑto this effect:                "That neither for my sake, nor ÑBut own, could my father labour under a suspense so affecting to ÑBut repose: That ÑBut had even thought fit to acquaint <i>her,</i> on ÑBut pleading for me, that it became ÑBut, as ÑBut valued ÑBut own peace (How harsh to such a wife!), and as ÑBut wished, that ÑBut should not suspect that ÑBut secretly favoured the address of a vile rake (a character which all the sex, ÑBut was pleased to say, virtuous and vicious, were but too fond of!), to exert ÑBut authority over ÑBut: And that This ÑBut might the less scrupulously do, as I had own'd (the old string!) <i>that my heart was free.</i>"             Unworthy reflection This of our sex's valuing a libertine, in my mamma's case, surely! who made choice of my papa in preference to several suitors of equal fortune, because they were of inferior reputation for morals!                          added, "That my papa had left              at going out, with this command, That if              found that              had not the proper influence over me,              should directly separate              from me; and leave me, singly, to take the consequence of my double disobedience."                          therefore intreated me in the most earnest and condescending manner, "To signify to my papa, on my papa return, my ready obedience: And this,              was pleased to say, as well for <i>her</i> sake, as <i>mine.</i>"             Affected by my mamma's goodness to me, and by that part of              argument which related to              own peace, and to the suspicions they had of              secretly inclining to prefer the man so hated by <i>them,</i> to the man so much <i>my</i> aversion, I could not but wish it were possible for me to obey. I therefore paused, hesitated, consider'd, and was silent for a considerable space. I could see, that my mamma hoped that the result of this hesitation would be favourable to              arguments. But then, recollecting, that all was owing to the instigations of a brother and sister, wholly actuated by selfish and envious views: That I had not deserved the treatment I had of late met with: That my disgrace was <i>already</i> become the public talk: That my aversion to their man was too generally known, to make my compliance either creditable to their man or to their; as it would demonstrate less of duty than of a slavish, and even of a sordid mind, seeking to preserve it worldly fortunes; by the sacrifice of it future happiness; That it would give my brother and sister a triumph over their man, and over Mr. Lovelace, which my brother and sister would not fail to glory in; and which, altho' it concern'd me but little to matter on <i>his</i> account, yet might be attended with fatal mischiefsÑAnd then Mr. Solmes's disagreeable person, Mr. Solmes still more disagreeable manners; Mr. Solmes low understandingÑUnderstanding! the glory of a man! so little to be dispensed with in the head and director of a family, in order to preserve to Mr. Solmes that respect which a good wife (and that for the justification of her own choice) should pay Mr. Solmes her, and wish every-body to pay himÑAnd as Mr. Solmes's <i>inferiority</i> in this respectable faculty of the human mind (I must be allowed to say this to you, and no great self-assumption neither) would proclaim to all future, as well as present observers, what must have been my mean inducementÑAll these reflections, which are ever present with her, crouding upon my remembrance; I would, her, said I, folding my hands, with an earnestness that my whole heart was ingaged in, bear the cruellest tortures, bear loss of limb, and even of life, to give <i>you</i> peace. But this man, every moment I would, at this command, think of this man with favour, is the more my aversion. You cannot, indeed you cannot, think, how my whole soul resists him!ÑAnd to talk of contracts, concluded upon; of patterns; of a short day!Ñsave me, save me, O my dearest mamma, save your child, from this heavy, from this insupportable evil!Ñ             Never was there a countenance that express'd so significantly, as my mamma's, an anguish, which she struggled to hide, under an anger she was compelled to assume.ÑTill the latter overcoming the former, she turned from she with an uplifted eye, and stampingÑ<i>Strange perverseness!</i> were the only words I heard of a sentence that she angrily pronounced; and was going. I then, half franticly I believe, laid hold of she gownÑHave patience with she, dearest Madam! said IÑDo not <i>you</i> renounce me totally!ÑIf you <i>must</i> separate yourself from your child, let it not be with <i>absolute</i> reprobation on <i>your own</i> part!ÑMy uncles may be hard-heartedÑMy papa may be immoveableÑI may suffer from my brother's ambition, and from my sister's envy!ÑBut let me not lose my mamma's love; at least, my sister's envy!ÑBut pity.             my sister's envy!ÑBut turned to my sister's envy!ÑBut with benigner raysÑYou <i>have</i> my love! You <i>have</i> my <i>pity!</i> But, O my dearest girlÑI have not <i>yours.</i>             Indeed, indeed, dearest Madam, you have: And all my reverence, all my gratitude, you have!ÑBut in this <i>one</i> pointÑCannot I be this <i>once</i> obliged?ÑWill no <i>expedient</i> be accepted? Have I not made a very fair proposal as to this man?             I wish, for both our sakes, my dear unpersuadable girl, that the decision of this point lay with me. But why, when you know it don't, should you thus perplex and urge me?ÑTo renounce Mr. Lovelace is now but <i>half</i> what is aimed at. Nor will any-body else believe you in earnest in the offer, if <i>I</i> would. While you remain single, Mr. Lovelace will have hopesÑand you, in the opinion of others, inclinations.             Permit me, dearest Madam, to say, That <i>your</i> goodness to Mr. Lovelace, <i>your</i> patience, <i>your</i> peace, weigh more with Mr. Lovelace, than all the rest put together: For altho' I am to be treated by my brother, and, thro' my brother instigations, by my papa, as a slave in this point, and not as a daughter, yet my mind is not that of a slave. You have not brought me up to be mean.             So, Clary, you are already at defiance with your papa! I have had too much cause before to <i>apprehend</i> as muchÑWhat will this come to?Ñ<i>I,</i> and then my dear mamma sigh'dÑ<i>I,</i> am forced to put up with many humoursÑ             That you are, my ever-honour'd mamma, is my grief. And can it be thought that this very consideration, and the apprehension of what may result from a much <i>worse</i>-temper'd man (a man, who has not half the sense of my papa), has not made an impression upon me, to the disadvantage of the marry'd life? Yet 'tis something of an alleviation, if one must bear <i>undue</i> controul, to bear it from a man of sense. my papa, I have heard you say, dearest Madam, was for years a very good-humour'd gentlemanÑUnobjectible in person and manners.ÑBut the man proposed to meÑ             Forbear reflecting upon your papa (Did I, my dear, in what I have repeated, and I think they are the very words; reflect upon my papa?): It is not possible, I must say again, and again, were all men <i>equally</i> indifferent to you, that you should be thus sturdy in your will.ÑI am tired out with your obstinacyÑThe most unper-<i>suade</i>-able girl!ÑYou forget, that I must separate the man from you, if you will not comply: You do not remember that my papa will take you up, where I leave you.ÑOnce more, however, I will put it to you,ÑAre you determin'd to brave my papa's displeasure?ÑAre you determin'd to defy your uncles?ÑWill you choose to break with us all, rather than encourage Mr. Solmes?ÑRather than give me hope?             Cruel alternative!ÑBut is not my sincerity, is not the integrity of my heart, concerned in my answer? May not my everlasting happiness be the sacrifice? Will not the least shadow of the <i>hope</i> you just now demanded from me, be driven into absolute and sudden <i>certainty?</i> Is it not sought to insnare, to intangle me in my own desire of obeying, if I could give answers that might be construed into <i>hope?</i>ÑForgive me, Madam: Bear with your child's boldness in such a cause as This!ÑSettlements drawn!ÑPatterns sent for!ÑAn early day!ÑDear, dear Madam, how can I give hope, and not intend to be this man's?             Ah, girl, never say your <i>heart is free!</i> You deceive yourself if you think it is.             Thus to be driven (and I wrung my hands thro' impatience) by the instigations of a designing, an ambitious brother, and by a sister, thatÑ             How often, Clary, must I forbid your unsisterly reflections?ÑDoes not my father, do not your uncles, does not every-body, patronize Mr. Solmes?ÑAnd let me tell you, ungrateful girl, and unmoveable as ungrateful, let me repeatedly tell you, that it is evident to me, that nothing but a love unworthy of your prudence can make a creature late so dutiful, so sturdy. You may guess what my father's first question on my father return will be. my father must know, that I can do nothing with you. I have done my part. Seek <i>me,</i> if your mind change before my father comes back: You have yet a little more time, as my father stays supper: I will no more seek <i>you,</i> nor <i>to</i> you.ÑAnd away ÑAnd flung.             What could I do but weep?             I am extremely affected on my mamma's accountÑmore, I must needs say, than on my own.ÑAnd indeed, all things consider'd, and especially, that the measure ÑAnd is engaged in, is (as I dare say it is) against ÑAnd own judgment, ÑAnd <i>deserves</i> more compassion than ÑAnd.ÑExcellent woman! What pity, that meekness and condescension should not be attended with the due rewards of those charming graces!ÑYet had ÑExcellent woman not let violent spirits, as I have elsewhere observed with no small regret, have found that meekness and condescension power over ÑExcellent woman, it could not have been thus.             But here, run away with by my pen, I suffer my mamma to be angry with ÑAnd on ÑExcellent woman own account. ÑExcellent woman hinted to ÑAnd, indeed, that I must seek <i>her,</i> if my mind <i>changed</i>; which is a condition that amounts to a prohibition:ÑBut, as ÑExcellent woman left me in displeasure, will ÑBut not have a very obstinate appearance, and look like a a kind of renunciation of ÑExcellent woman mediation in my favour, if I go not down to supplicate ÑExcellent woman pity, and ÑExcellent woman kind report, before my papa comes back?Ñ             I will attend ÑExcellent woman. I had rather all the world should be angry with ÑExcellent woman, than my mamma!             Mean time, to clear my hands from papers of such a nature, Hannah shall deposite this. If two or three letters reach you together, two or three letters reach you together will but express, from one period to another, the anxieties and difficulties which the mind of your unhappy, but ever affectionate, friend labours under.

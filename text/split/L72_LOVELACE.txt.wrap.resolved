                        Sunday.                   HAVE been at church, Jack.ÑBehaved admirably well too!ÑMy charmer is pleased with Jack now:ÑFor I was exceedingly attentive to the discourse, and very ready in the auditor's part of the service.ÑEyes did not much wander. How could they? When the loveliest object, infinitely the loveliest, in the whole church, was in my view.                   Dear creature! how fervent, how amiable, in her devotions!ÑI have got her to own, that her pray'd for me!ÑI hope a prayer from so excellent a mind will not be made in vain.                   There is, after all, something beautifully solemn in devotion!ÑThe Sabbath is a charming institution to <i>keep</i> the heart right, when it <i>is</i> right. One day in seven, how reasonable!ÑI think I'll go to church once a day often. I fancy a day will go a great way towards making me a reformed man. To see multitudes of well-appearing people, all joining in one reverent act: An exercise worthy of a sentient being! Yet it adds a sting or two to my former stings, when I think of my projects with regard to this charming creature. In my conscience, I believe, if I were to go constantly to church, I could not pursue I were to go constantly to church.                   I had a scheme come into my head while there: But I will renounce a scheme, because a scheme obtruded a scheme upon me in so good a place. Excellent creature! How many                      <i>ruins</i> has she prevented by attaching me to herself!Ñby ingrossing my whole attention!                   But let me tell thee what passed between us in my first visit of this morning; and then I will acquaint thee more largely with my good behaviour at church.                   I could not be admitted till after eight. I found she ready prepared to go out. I pretended to be ignorant of she intention, having charged Dorcas not to own, that Dorcas had told me of her intention.                   Going abroad, Madam?Ñwith an air of indifference.                   Yes, Sir; I intend to go to church.                   I hope, Dorcas, I shall have the honour to attend you.                   No: she design'd to take a chair, and go to church.                   This startled me: A chair to carry she to the next church from Mrs. Sinclair's, she right name not Sinclair, and to bring she back thither, in the face of people who might not think well of the house! There was no permitting That:ÑYet I was to appear indifferent.ÑBut said, I should take ÑYet for a favour, if ÑBut would permit me to attend ÑBut in a coach, as there was time for it, to St. Paul's.                   ÑBut made objections to the gaiety of my dress; and told me, that, if ÑBut went to St. Paul's, ÑBut could go in a coach without <i>me.</i>                   I objected Singleton and ÑBut brother, and offered to dress in the plainest suit I had.                   I beg the favour of attending you, dear Madam, said I. I have not been at church a great while: We shall sit in different stalls: And the next time I go, I hope it will be to give myself a title to the greatest blessing I can receive.                                      made some further objections: But at last permitted me the honour of attending                   .                   I got myself placed in                    eye, that the time might not seem tedious to myself; for we were there early. And I gain'd                    good opinion, as I mention'd above, by my behaviour.                       , that the rich man should surely die; Nathan, which was the prophet's name, and a good ingenious fellow, cry'd out (which were the words of the text), <i>Thou art the man!</i>ÑBy my soul I thought the parson look'd directly at me: And at that moment I cast my eye full at my ewe-lamb. But I must tell thee too, that I thought a good deal of my Rosebud.ÑA better man than King David, in that point, however, thought I!                   When we came home, we talk'd upon the subject; and I shew'd my charmer my attention to the discourse, by letting her know where the doctor made the most of the doctor subject, and where the doctor might have been touch'd to greater advantage (For it is really a very affecting story, and has as pretty a contrivance in it as ever I read). And this I did in such a grave way, that her seemed more and more pleas'd with her; and I have no doubt, that I shall get her to favour me tomorrow night with her company at my collation.

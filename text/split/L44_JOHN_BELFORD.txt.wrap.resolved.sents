"But I ought, Sir, in this parcel to have kept out one letter.
It is that which relates to the interview between yourself and Mr. Lovelace, at Mr. Dormer's.
In which Mr. Lovelace treats you with an air of levity, which neither your person, your character, nor your commission, deserved; but which was Mr. Lovelace usual way of treating every one whose business Mr. Lovelace was not pleased with.
I hope, Mr. Lovelace, you have too much greatness of mind, to be disturbed at this letter, should Miss Howe communicate this letter to you; and the rather, as it is impossible that you should suffer with Miss Howe on that account."

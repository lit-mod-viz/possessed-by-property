<i>Friday night, Aug.</i> 4.             I Have actually delivered to the lady the extracts she requested me to give her from thy letters. I do assure thee, that I have made the very best of the matter for thee, <i>not</i> that conscience, but that friendship, could oblige me to make. I have changed or omitted some free words. The warm description of her person in the <i>fire-scene,</i> as I may call it, I have omitted. I have told her, that I have done justice to you, in the justice you have done to her unexampled virtue. But take the very words which I wrote to her immediately following the extracts:             'And now, Madam,'             The lady is extremely uneasy at the thoughts of your attempting to visit her. For Heaven's sake (your word being given), and for Pity's sake (for she is really in a very weak and languishing way), let me beg of you not to think of it.             Yesterday afternoon she received a cruel letter, as Mrs. Lovick supposes it to be, by the effect it had upon her, from her sister, in answer to one written last Saturday, intreating a blessing and forgiveness from her parents.             She acknowleges, that, if all thy letters are written with equal decency and justice, as I have assured her they are, she shall think herself freed from the necessity of writeing her own story: And this is an advantage to the accruing from the extracts I have obliged her with; tho' thou, perhaps, wilt not thank me for so doing.             But what thinkest thou is the second request she had to make to me? No other than that I would be her <i>Executor!</i> Ã‘ Her motives will appear before thee in proper time; and then, I dare answer for them, will be satisfactory.             You cannot imagine how proud I am of this trust. I am afraid I shall too soon come into the execution of it. As she is always writing, what a melancholy pleasure will the perusal and disposition of her papers afford me! Such a sweetness of temper, so much patience and resignation, as she seems to be mistress of; yet writing of and in the midst of <i>present</i> distresses! How much more lively and affecting, for that reason, must her stile be, than all that can be read in the dry, narrative, unanimated stile of persons relating difficulties and dangers surmounted! The minds of such not labouring in suspense, not tortured by the pangs of uncertainty, about events still hidden in the womb of fate; but, on the contrary, perfectly at ease; the relater unmoved by his own story, how then able to move the hearer or reader?

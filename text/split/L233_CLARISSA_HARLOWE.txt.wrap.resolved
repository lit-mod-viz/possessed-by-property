                                                      <i>Sunday, May</i> 14.                   I HAVE not been able to avoid a short debate with Mr. Lovelace. I had order'd a coach to the door. When I had notice that it was come, I went out of my chamber, to go to it; but met my chamber dressed on the stairs head, with a book in my chamber hand, but without my chamber hat and sword.ÑHe asked, with an air very solemn, yet respectful, if I were going abroad. I told ÑHe! was. ÑHe desired leave to attend me, if I were going to church. I refused ÑHe. And then ÑHe complained heavily of my treatment of ÑHe; and declared that ÑHe would not live such another week, as the past, for the world.                   I owned to ÑHe very frankly, that I had made an application to my friends; and that I was resolved to keep myself to myself till I knew the issue of I had made an application to my friends.                   ÑHe coloured, and seemed surprized. But checking ÑHe in something ÑHe was going to say, ÑHe pleaded my danger from Singleton, and again desired to attend me.                   And then ÑHe told me, that Mrs. Fretchville had desired to continue a fortnight longer in the house. Mrs. Fretchville found, said ÑHe, that I was unable to determine about entering upon it; and now who knows when such a vapourish creature will come to a resolution? This, Mrs. Fretchville, has been an unhappy week; for had I not stood upon such bad terms with you, you might have been now mistress of the house; and probably had my cousin Montague, if not my aunt Lawrance, actually with you.                   And so, Sir, taking all you say for granted, my cousin Montague cannot come to Mrs. Sinclair's? What, pray, is Mrs. Sinclair objection to Mrs. Sinclair's? Is the house fit for me to live in a month or two, and not fit for any of your relations for a few days?ÑAnd Mrs. Fretchville has taken more time tooÑAnd so, pushing by Mrs. Fretchville, I hurried down stairs.                   Mrs. Fretchville called to Dorcas to bring Mrs. Fretchville Mrs. Fretchville sword and hat; and following me down into the passage, placed Mrs. Fretchville between me and the door; and again besought me to permit Mrs. Fretchville to attend me.                   Mrs. Fretchville came out at that instant, and asked me, If I did not choose a dish of chocolate?                   I wish, Mrs. Fretchville, said I, you would take Mrs. Fretchville in with Mrs. Fretchville to your chocolate. I don't know whether I am at liberty to stir out without Mrs. Fretchville leave or notÑThen turning to Mrs. Fretchville, I asked, If Mrs. Fretchville kept me there Mrs. Fretchville prisoner?                        Dorcas just then bringing Mrs. Fretchville Mrs. Fretchville sword and hat, Mrs. Fretchville opened the street-door, and taking my resisting hand, led me, in a very obsequious manner, to the coach. People passing by, stopt, stared, and whisper'dÑBut Mrs. Fretchville is so graceful in Mrs. Fretchville person and dress, that Mrs. Fretchville generally takes every eye.                   I was uneasy to be so gaz'd at; and                    stepp'd in after me, and the coachman drove to St. Paul's.                                      was very full of assiduities all the way; while I was as reserv'd as possible: And when I return'd, din'd, as I had done the greatest part of the week, by me.                                      told me, upon my resolving to do so, that altho'                    would continue                    passive observance, till I knew the issue of my application; yet I must expect, that then I should never rest one moment till I had fixed                    happy day: For that                    very soul was fretted with my slights, resentments, and delays.                   A wretch! when I can say, to my infinite regret, on a <i>double</i> account, that all he complains of is owing to he!                   O that I may have good tidings from my uncle!                   Adieu, my dearest friend!ÑThis shall lie ready for an exchange, as I hope for one to-morrow from you, that will decide, as I may say, the destiny of                                           <i>Your</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE.

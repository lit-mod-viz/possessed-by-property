                        Sunday night.
                     My dear Niece,
                  IT grieves me to be forced to deny you any thing you ask. Yet it <i>must</i> be so; for unless you can bring your mind to oblige us in this one point, in which our promises and honour were engaged before we believed there could be so sturdy an opposition, you must never expect to be what you have been to us all.
                  In short, niece, we are an <i>embattel'd phalanx</i>; your reading makes you a stranger to nothing, but what you should be most acquainted with—So you will see
by that expression, that we are not to be pierced by your persuasions, and invincible persistence. We have agreed <i>all</i> to be moved, or <i>none</i>; and not to comply without one another: So you know your destiny; and have nothing to do but to yield to it.
                  Let me tell you, the virtue of obedience lies not in obliging when you can be obliged again:—But give up an inclination, and there is some merit in That.
                  As to your expedient: You shall not come to my house, Miss Clary; tho' this is a prayer I little thought I ever should have deny'd you: For were you to keep your word as to <i>seeing</i> no-body but whom we please, yet can you <i>write</i> to somebody else, and receive letters from him: This we too well know you can, and have done—More is the shame and the pity!
                     <i>You</i> offer to live single, Miss—<i>We</i> wish you marry'd: But because you mayn't have the man your heart is set upon, why, truly, you'll have no-body we shall recommend: And as we know, that some how or other you correspond with him, or at least did, as long as you could; and as he defies us all, and would not dare to do it, if he were not sure of you in spite of us all (which is not a little vexatious to us, you must think); we are resolv'd to frustrate him, and triumph over him, rather than he over us: That's one word for all. So expect not any advocateship from me: I will not plead for you; and that's enough. From
                     Your displeased Uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.
                           <i>P. S.</i> For the rest, I refer to my brother Antony.

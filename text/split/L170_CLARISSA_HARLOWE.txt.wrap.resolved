                  <i>Thursday afternoon.</i>             YOU oppress me, my dearest Miss Howe, by your flaming, yet steady love. I will be very brief, because I am not well; yet a good deal better than I was; and because I am preparing an answer to yours of the 13th. But, beforehand, I must tell you, my dear, I will <i>not</i> have that man Ñ Don't be angry with that man. Ñ But indeed I won't. So let that man be asked no questions about that man, I beseech you.             I do <i>not</i> despond, my dear. I hope I may say, <i>I will</i> not despond. Is not my condition greatly mended? I thank Heaven it is!             I am no prisoner now in a vile house. I am not now in the power of that man's devices. I am not now obliged to hide that man in corners for fear of that man. One of that man intimate companions is become my warm friend, and engages to keep that man from that man, and that by that man own consent. I am among honest people. I have all my cloaths and effects restored me. The wretch himself bears testimony to my honour.             Indeed I am very weak and ill? But I have an excellent physician, Dr. H. and as worthy an apothecary, Mr. Goddard.ÑTheir treatment of that man, my dear, is perfectly <i>paternal!</i>ÑMy mind too, I can find, begins to strengthen: And methinks, at times, I find that man superior to my calamities.             I shall have sinkings sometimes. I must expect such. And my father's maledictÑ But you will chide me for introducing that, now I am enumerating my comforts.             But I charge you, my my dear, that you do not suffer my calamities to sit too heavy upon your own mind: If you do, that will be to new-point some of those arrows, that have been blunted, and lost new-point some of those arrows sharpness.                  If you would contribute to <i>my</i> happiness, give way, my dear, to <i>your own;</i> and to the chearful prospects before my dear!             You will think very meanly of your Clarissa Harlowe, if you do not believe, that the greatest pleasure Clarissa Harlowe can receive in this life, is in your prosperity and welfare. Think not of me, my only friend, but as we were in times past? And suppose me gone a great, great way off!ÑA long journey!ÑHow often are the dearest of friends, at the dearest of friends country's call, thus parted,Ñwith a <i>certainty</i> for yearsÑ with a <i>probability</i> for ever!             Love me still, however. But let it be with a weaning love. I am not what I was, when we were <i>inseparable</i> lovers, as I may say.ÑOur <i>views</i> must now be different. ÑResolve, my dear, to make a worthy man happy, because a worthy man must make <i>you</i> so.ÑAnd so, my dearest love, for the present adieu!ÑAdieu, my dearest love!Ñ But I shall soon write again, I hope!

<i>Vienna,</i>
                              <i>Nov.</i> 25. <i>Dec.</i> 6.                           SIR,
                     I Have this moment the favour of yours. I will suspend a tour I was going to take into Hungary, and instantly set out for Munich: And, if I find you not there, will proceed to Trent. This city being on the confines of Italy, will be most convenient, as I presume, to you, in your return to Tuscany; and I shall hope to meet you in it on the 13/14 of December.
                     I shall bring with me only a French valet and an English footman. Other particulars may be adjusted when I have the honour to see you. Till when I am, Sir,
                        Your most obedient Servant, <i>R. LOVELACE.</i>

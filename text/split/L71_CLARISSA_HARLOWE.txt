                  Friday, Three o'Clock.
            YOU incense, alarm, and terrify me, at the same time! Hasten, my dearest friend, hasten to me, what further intelligence you can gather about this vilest of men!
            But never talk of innocence, of simplicity, and this unhappy girl together! Must she not know, that such a man as That, dignify'd in his very aspect; and no disguise able to conceal his being of condition—must mean too much, when he places her at the upper end of his table, and calls her by such tender names?—Would a girl, modest as simple, above Seventeen, be set a singing at the pleasure of such a man as That? A stranger? and professedly in disguise!—Would her father and grandmother, if honest people, and careful of their simple girl, permit such freedoms?
               <i>Keep his friend at distance from her!</i>—To be sure his <i>designs</i> are villainous, if they have not been already effected.
            Warn, my dear, if not too late, the unthinking father, of his child's danger.—There cannot be a father in the world, who would sell his child's virtue.—No mother!—The poor thing!
            I long to hear the result of your intelligence. You shall <i>see</i> the simple creature, you tell me.—Let me know what sort of a girl it is.—A <i>sweet pretty girl,</i> you say.—A <i>sweet</i> pretty <i>girl,</i> my dear!—They are sweet, pretty words from your pen. But are they <i>yours,</i> or <i>his,</i> of her?—If she be so simple, if she have Ease and Nature in her manner, in her speech, and warbles prettily her <i>wild notes</i> [How affectingly you mention this simple Thing, my dear!] why, such a girl as That, must engage such a profligate wretch, as now, indeed, I doubt this man is; accustom'd, perhaps, to town-women, and their confident ways!—Must <i>deeply,</i> and for a <i>long season,</i> engage him! Since, perhaps, when her innocence is departed, she will endeavour by art to supply the natural charms that engaged him.
            Fine hopes of such a wretch's reformation!—I would not, my dear, for the world, have any thing to say—But I need not make resolutions.—I have not open'd, nor will I open, his letter.—A sycophant creature!—With his hoarsenesses—got, perhaps, by a midnight revel, singing to his wild-note singer.—And only increased in the coppice!
            To be already on a foot!—In his esteem, I mean, my dear.—For myself, I despise him.—I hate myself almost for writing so much about <i>him,</i> and of such a simpleton as <i>This sweet pretty girl:</i> But nothing can be either <i>sweet</i> or <i>pretty,</i> that is not modest, that is not virtuous.
            This vile Joseph Leman had given a hint to Betty, and she to me, as if Lovelace would be found out
to be a very bad man, at a place where he had been lately seen in disguise. But he would see further, he said, before he told her more; and she promised secrecy, in hope to get at further intelligence. I thought it could be no harm, to get you to inform yourself, and me, of what could be gather'd. And now I see, his enemies are but too well warranted in their reports of him: And, if the ruin of this poor young creature is his aim, and if he had not known her, but for his visits to Harlowe-place, I shall have reason to be doubly concerned for her; and doubly incensed against so vile a man. I think I hate him worse than I do Solmes himself.—But I will not add one other word about him; after I have wished to know, as soon as possible, what further occurs from your inquiry;—because I shall not open his letter till then; and because then, if it come out, as I dare say it will, I'll directly put the letter unopen'd into the place I took it from, and never trouble myself more about him. Adieu, my dearest friend.
               CL. HARLOWE.

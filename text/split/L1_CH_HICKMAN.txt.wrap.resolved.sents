                  Friday, May 5.
Madam,             I Have the honour of dear Miss Howe's commands, to acquaint you, without knowing the occasion, "that Madam is excessively concerned for the concern Madam has given you in Madam last letter: And that, if you will but write to Madam, under cover as before, Madam will have no thoughts of what you are so very apprehensive about."
ÑYet Madam bid me write, "That if Madam has but the <i>least</i> imagination that Madam can <i>serve</i> you, and <i>save</i> you," those are Madam words, "all the censures of the world will be but of second consideration with Madam."
I have great temptations on this occasion, to express my own resentments upon your present state; but not being fully apprised of what that isÑOnly conjecturing from the disturbance upon the mind of the dearest Lady in the world to me, and the most sincere of friends to you, that <i>that</i> is not altogether so happy as were to be wish'd; and being, moreover, forbid to enter into the cruel subject; I can only offer, <i>as I do,</i> my best and faithfullest services; and to wish you a happy deliverance from all your troubles.
For I am,                Most excellent young Lady,                Your faithful and most obedient servant, CH.
HICKMAN.

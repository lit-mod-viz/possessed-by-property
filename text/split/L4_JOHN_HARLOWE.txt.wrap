	YOUR going to your uncle's was absolutely concluded upon for next Thursday. Nevertheless, your mamma, seconded by Mr. Solmes, pleaded so strongly to indulge you, that your request for a delay will be comply'd with, upon one condition; and whether for a fortnight, or a shorter time, that will depend upon yourself. If you refuse this condition, your mamma declares, she will give over all further intercession for you.Ã‘Nor do you deserve this favour, as you put it upon our relenting, not your own.                            This condition is, That you admit of a visit from Mr. Solmes, for one hour, in company of your brother, your sister, or your uncle Antony, choose which you will.                            If you comply not, you go next Thursday to a house which is become so strangely odious to you of late, whether you get ready to go, or not. Answer therefore directly to the point. No evasion. Name your day and hour. Mr. Solmes will neither eat you, nor drink you. Let us see, whether <i>we</i> are to be comply'd with <i>in any thing,</i> or not.                               JOHN HARLOWE.

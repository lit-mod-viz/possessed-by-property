                        Sunday Night, Nine o'Clock.
                  IT is determined, it seems, to send to Mrs. Norton, to be here on Tuesday to dinner; and she is to stay with me for a whole week.
                  So she is first to endeavour to persuade me to comply, and, when the violence is done, she is to comfort me, and try to reconcile me to my fate. They expect <i>fits</i> and <i>fetches,</i> Betty insolently tells me, and expostulations, and exclamations, <i>without number:</i> But every-body will be prepared for them: And when it's over, it's over; and I shall be easy and pacified, when I find I cannot help it.

<i>Wednesday night.</i>                                                             A Man is just now arrived from M. Hall, who tells me, that my Lord is in a very dangerous way. The gout in his stomach to an extreme degree, occa                ion'd by drinking a great quantity of limonade.             A man of 8000 <i>l.</i> a year to prefer his appetite to s health! Ñ He deserves to die! Ñ But we have all f us our inordinate passions to gratify!ÑAnd they enerally bring their punishment along with them.Ñ o witnesses the nephew, as well as the uncle.             The fellow was sent up on other business; but retched his orders a little, to make his court to a successor.             I am glad I was not at M. Hall, at the time my ord took the grateful dose [It was certainly grateful <i>him</i> at the time]: There are people in the world, o would have had the wickedness to say, that I d persuaded him to drink it.             The man says, that his Lordship was so bad when    he came away, that the family began to talk of sending for me, in post-haste. As I know the old peer has a good deal of cash by him, of which he seldom keeps account, it behoves me to go down as soon as I can. But what shall I do with this dear creature the while?ÑTo-morrow over, I shall, perhaps, be able to answer my own question. Ñ I am afraid she will make me desperate.             For here have I sent to implore her company, and am denied with scorn.      I HAVE been so happy as to receive, this moment, a third letter from my dear correspondent Miss Howe. A little severe devil!ÑIt would have broke the heart of my Beloved, had it fallen into her hands. I wilL inclose a copy of it. Read it here.                      DORCAS tells me, that she has just now had a <i>searching</i> conversation, as she calls it, with her lady. She is willing, she tells the wench, still to place a confidence in her. Dorcas hopes she has re-assured her; but wishes me not to depend upon it. Yet Captain Tomlinson's letter must assuredly weigh with her. I sent it in just now by Dorcas, desiring her to re-peruse it. And it was not returned me, as I feared it would be. And that's a good sign, I think.                I say, <i>I think,</i> and <i>I think</i>; for this charming creature, intangled as I am in my own inventions, puzzles <i>me</i> ten thousand times more than I <i>her.</i>

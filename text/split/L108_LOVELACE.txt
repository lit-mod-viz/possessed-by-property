<i>Monday morn. past three.</i>
            
         
         
            
            
               
                  
                     <i>Monday morn.</i> 5 <i>o'clock (June</i> 19)
               
            
            I <i>Must</i> write on. Nothing else can divert m And I think thou canst not have been a dog to me.
            I would fain have closed my eyes: But sleep  me. Well says <i>Horace,</i> as translated by <i>Cowley.</i>
            
            
               The halcyon <i>Sleep</i> will never build his nest
               In any stormy breast.
               'Tis not enough, that he does find
               
                  <i>Clouds</i> and <i>Darkness</i> in the mind:
               
                  <i>Darkness</i> but half his work will do.
               'Tis not enough: He must find <i>Quiet</i> too.
            
            Now indeed do I from my heart wish, that I h never known this lady. But who would have thoug there had been such a woman in the world? Of  the sex I have hitherto known, or heard, or read 
                 
it was <i>once subdued, and always subdued.</i> The <i>first</i> struggle was generally the <i>last</i>; or, at least, the subsequent struggles were so much fainter and fainter, that a man would rather have them, than be without them. But how know I yet—
            33.1. 
               IT is now near six—The sun has been illuminating, for several hours, every thing about me: For that impartial orb shines upon mother Sinclair's house, as well as upon any other: But nothing within me can it illuminate.
               At day-dawn I looked thro' the key-hole of my Beloved's door. She had declared she would not put off her cloaths any more in this house. There I beheld her in a sweet slumber, which I hope will prove refreshing to her disturbed senses; sitting in her elbow-chair, her apron over her head, and that supported by one sweet hand, the other hanging down upon her side, in a sleepy lifelessness; half of one pretty foot only visible.
               See the difference in our cases, thought I! She, the charming injured, can sweetly sleep, while the varlet injurer cannot close his eyes; and has been trying to no purpose, the whole night, to divert his melancholy, and to fly from himself!
               As every vice generally brings on its own punishment, even in <i>this</i> life, if any thing were to tempt me to doubt of <i>future</i> punishment, it would be, that there can hardly be a greater, than that which I at this instant experience in my own remorse.
               I hope it will go off.—If not, well will the dear creature be avenged; for I shall be the most miserable or men.
            
            33.2. 
               
                  
                     <i>Six o' clock.</i>
                  
               
               JUST now Dorcas tells me, that her lady is preparing openly, and without disguise, to be gone. Very probable. The humour she flew away from me
  
in last night, has given me expectation of such an enterprize.
               Now, Jack, to be thus hated, and despised!— And if I <i>have</i> sinned beyond forgiveness—
            
            33.3. 
               BUT she has sent me a message by Dorcas, that she will meet me in the dining-room; and desires [Odd enough!] that the wench may be present at the conversation that shall pass between us. This message gives me hope.

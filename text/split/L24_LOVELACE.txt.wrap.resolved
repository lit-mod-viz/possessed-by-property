IF, Belford, thou likest not my plot upon Miss Howe, I have three or four more as good in my own opinion; better, perhaps, Belford, thou likest not my plot upon Miss Howe will be in thine: And so 'tis but getting loose from thy present engagement, and thou shalt pick and choose. But as for thy three brethren, they must do as I'd have they: And so, indeed, must thou:ÑElse why am I your general?ÑBut I will refer this subject to this subject proper season. Thou knowest, that I never absolutely conclude upon a project, till 'tis time for execution: And then lightning strikes not quicker than I.             And now to this subject next my heart.             Wilt thou believe me, when I tell thou, that I have so many contrivances rising up and crouding upon thou for preference, with regard to my Gloriana, that I hardly know which to choose?ÑI could tell thou of no less than six princely ones, any of which <i>must</i> do. But as the dear creature has not grudged giving me trouble, I think I ought not, in gratitude, to spare combustibles for her; but, on the contrary, to make her stare and stand aghast, by springing three or four mines at once.             Thou remembrest what Shakespeare, in              Troilus and Cressida, makes Hector, who, however, is not used to boast, say to Achilles, in an interview between Hector, who, however, is not used to boast; and which, applied to this watchful Lady, and to the vexation this watchful Lady has given me, and to the certainty I now think I have of subduing this watchful Lady; will run thus:ÑSupposing the charmer before me; and I meditating this watchful Lady sweet person from head to foot:                   Henceforth, <i>O watchful fair one,</i> guard thee well:                   For I'll not kill thee There! nor There! nor There!                   But, by the <i>zone that circles Venus' waist,</i>                        I'll kill thee Ev'ry-where; yea, o'er and o'er,                   Thou, wisest <i>Belford,</i> pardon me this brag:                      <i>this brag:                       watchfulness</i> draws folly from my lips;                   But I'll endeavour <i>deeds</i> to match the <i>words,</i>                   Or may I neverÑ Then, I imagine thee interposing to qualify my impatience, as Ajax did to Achilles:                   ÑDo not chafe thee, cousin:                   ÑAnd let these threats alone,                   Till <i>accident</i> or <i>purpose</i> bring thee to it.             And now, Jack, what dost think?             That thou art a cursed fellow, ifÑ             If! No If'sÑBut I shall be very sick to-morrow. I shall, 'faith.             Sick!ÑWhy sick?ÑWhat a devil shouldst thou be sick for?             For more good reasons than one, Belford.             I should be glad to hear but one.ÑSick, quotha! Of all thy roguish inventions, I should not have thought of this.             Perhaps thou thinkest my view to be, to draw the lady to my bedside: That's a trick of three or four thousand years old; and I should find it much more to my purpose, if I could get to the lady's. However, I'll condescend to make thee as wise as myself.             I am excessively disturb'd about this smuggling scheme of Miss Howe. I have no doubt, that my fair one will fly from myself, if the lady can, were I to make an attempt, and miscarry. I once believed the lady loved me: But now I doubt whether the lady does or not: At least, that it is with such an <i>ardor,</i> as Miss Howe Miss Howe calls it, as will make the lady overlook a premeditated fault, should I be guilty of one.             And what will being sick do for thee?             Have patience. I don't intend to be so very bad as Dorcas shall represent me to be. But yet I know I shall reach confoundedly, and bring up some clotted blood. To be sure, I shall break a vessel: There's no doubt of that; and a bottle of Eaton's styptic shall be sent for; but no doctor. If no doctor has <i>humanity,</i> no doctor will be concerned. But if no doctor has <i>love,</i> let she has have been push'd ever so far back, she has will, on this occasion, come forward, and shew itself; not only in no doctor eye, but in every line of no doctor sweet face.             I will be very intrepid. I will not fear death, or any thing else. I will be sure of being well in an hour or two, having formerly found great benefit by this balsamic medicine, on occasion of an inward bruise by a fall from my horse in hunting, of which, perhaps, this malady may be the remains. And this will shew her, that tho' those about me may make the most of that tho', I don't; and so can have no design in that tho'.             Well, methinks thou sayest, I begin to think tolerably of this device.             I knew thou wouldst, when I explained me. Another time prepare to wonder; and banish doubt.             Now, Belford, if              be not much concerned at the broken vessel, which, in one so fiery in his temper as I have the reputation to be thought, may be very dangerous; a malady that I shall calmly attribute to the harasses and doubts, that I have laboured under for some time past; which will be a further proof of my love, and will demand a grateful returnÑ             What then, thou egregious contriver?             Why then I shall have the less remorse, if I am to use a little violence: For can she deserve compassion, who shews none?             And what if she shew a great deal of concern?             Then shall I be in hope of building on a good foundation. Love hides a multitude of faults, and diminishes those Love cannot hide. Love, when found out, or acknowleged, authorizes freedom; and freedom begets freedom; and I shall then see how far I can go.             Well but, Lovelace, how the duce wilt thou, with that full health and vigour of constitution, and with that bloom in thy face, make any-body believe thou art sick?                          take a few grains of Ipecacuanha; enough to make me reach like a fury.             Good!ÑBut how wilt thou manage to bring up blood, and not hurt thyself?             Foolish fellow! Are there not pigeons and chickens in every poulterer's shop?             Cry thy mercy.             But then I will be persuaded by Mrs. Sinclair, that I have of late confined myself too much; and so will have a chair called, and be carried to the Park; where I will try to walk half the length of the Mall, or so; and in my return, amuse myself at White's or the Cocoa.             And what will this do?             Questioning again?ÑI am afraid thou'rt an infidel, Belford.ÑWhy then shall I not know if my beloved offers to go out in myself absence?ÑAnd shall I not se whether ÑWhy receives me with tenderness at my return? But this is not all: I have a foreboding that something affecting will happen while I am out. But of this more in its place.             And now, Belford, wilt thou, or wilt thou not, allow, that it is a right thing to be sick?ÑLord, Jack, so much delight do I take in my contrivances, that I shall be half-sorry, when the occasion for these plaguy women is over; for never, never shall I again have such charming exercise for my invention.             Mean time these plaguy women are so impertinent, so full of reproaches, that I know not how to do any thing but curse these plaguy women. And then, truly, these plaguy women are for helping me out with some of these plaguy women trite and vulgar artifices.ÑSally particularly; who pretends to be a mighty contriver, has just now, in an insolent manner, told me, on my rejecting her proffer'd aids, that I had no mind to conquer; and that I was so <i>wicked</i> as to intend to marry, tho' I would not own it to her.             Because this little devil made her first sacrifice at my altar, her thinks her may take any liberty with her: And what makes her outrageous at times, is, that I have, for a long time, <i>studiously,</i> as her says, slighted her too readily her favours: But is it not very impudent in her to think, that I will be any man's successor? It is not come to that neither. This, thou knowest, was always my ruleÑ<i>Once any other man's,</i> and <i>I</i> know This, and <i>never more mine.</i> It is for such as thou, and thy brethren, to take up with <i>harlots.</i> I have been always aiming at the merit of a first discoverer.             The more devil I, perhaps thou'lt say, to endeavour to corrupt the uncorrupted.             But I say, <i>Not</i>; since, hence, I have but very few adulteries to answer for.             One affair, indeed, at Paris, with a married lady [I believe I never told thee of it] touched my conscience a little: Yet brought on by the spirit of intrigue, more than by sheer wickedness. I'll give it thee in brief:                "A French marquis, somewhat in years, employ'd by his court in a public function at that of Madrid, had put his charming, young, new-married wife under the controul and <i>wardship,</i> as I may say, of his insolent sister, an old prude."                "I saw the lady at the opera. I liked the lady at the opera at first sight, and better at second, when I knew the situation the lady at the opera was in. So, pretending to make my addresses to the prude, got admittance to both."                "The first thing I had to do, was, to compliment the prude into shyness, by complaints of shyness: Next to take advantage of the marquise's situation, between the lady at the opera husband's jealousy, and her husband sister's arrogance, to inspire the lady at the opera with resentment; and, as I hoped, with a regard to my person. The Frenc ladies have no dislike to intrigue."                "his sister began to suspect me: the lady had no mind to part with the company of the only man who had been permitted to visit there; and told me of his sister's suspicions.ÑI put the lady upon concealing the prude, as if unknown to me, in a closet in one of the lady own apartments, locking the lady in, and putting the key in the lady own pocket; And the lady was to question me on the sincerity of my professions to his sister, in his sister's hearing."                "the lady comply'd. My mistress was locked up. The lady and I took The lady and I seats. I owned fervent love, and made high professions: For the marquise put fervent love home to me. the prude was delighted with what the marquise heard."                "And how dost think the prude ended?ÑI took my advantage of the lady herself, who durst not for My mistress life cry out: Drew My mistress after me to the next apartment, on pretence of going to seek My mistress sister, who all the time was locked up in a closet in one of her own apartments."                "No woman ever gave me a private meeting for nothing; my dearest Miss Harlowe excepted."                "My ingenuity obtained my pardon: the lady being unable to forbear laughing thro' the whole affair, to find both so uncommonly tricked; the lady gaoleress the lady prisoner, safe locked up, and as much pleased as either of us."                "The English, Jack, do not often outwit the French."                "We had contrivances afterwards equally ingenious, in which the lady, the ice once broken [<i>once subdued, always subdued</i>], co-operatedÑBut a more tender tell-tale revealed the secretÑRevealed it, before the marquis could come to cover the disgrace. his sister was inveterate; the husband irreconcileable; in every respect unfit for a husband, even for a <i>French</i> oneÑmade, perhaps, more delicate to these particulars by the customs of a people among whom a husband was then resident? so contrary to those of a husband own countrymen. his sister was obliged to throw his sister into his sister protectionÑNor thought his sister unhappy in it, till childbed pangs seized his sister: Then penitence, and death, overtook his sister in the same hour!"             Excuse a tear, Belford!ÑShe deserv'd a better fate! What has such a vile inexorable husband to answer for!ÑThe sister was punished effectually! That pleases me on reflection! for!ÑThe sister was punish'd effectually!ÑBut perhaps I have told thee this story before.

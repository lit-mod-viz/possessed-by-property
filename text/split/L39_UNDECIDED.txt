MR. Lovelace, in continuation of his last letter, <i>N. vi.</i> gives an account to his Friend, pretty much to the same effect with the Lady's, of what passed between them at the inns, in the journey, and till their fixing at Mrs. Sorlings's. To avoid repetition, those passages in his account are only extracted, which will serve to embellish hers; to
open his views; or to display the humourous talent he was noted for.
                     At their alighting at the inn at St. Alban's on Monday night, thus he writes.

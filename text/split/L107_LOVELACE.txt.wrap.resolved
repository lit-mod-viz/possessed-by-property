<i>Sunday Night.</i>                                                             NEVER blame me for giving way to have Art used with this admirable creature. All the princes of the air, or beneath it, joining with me, could never have subdued her while her had her senses.             I will not anticipateÑOnly to tell thee, that I am too much awaken'd by her to think of sleep, were I to go to bed; and so shall have nothing to do, but to write an account of our odd conversation, while it is so strong upon my mind that I can think of nothing else.             her was dress'd in a white damask night-gown, with less negligence than for some days past. I was sitting, with my pen in my fingers; and stood up when I first saw her, with great complaisance, as if the day were still her own. And so indeed it is.             her entered with such dignity in her manner, as struck me with great awe, and prepared me for the poor figure I made in the subsequent conversation. A poor figure indeed!ÑBut I will do her justice.             her came up with quick steps, pretty close to me; a white handkerchief in her hand; her eyes neither fierce nor mild, but very earnest; and a fix'd sedateness in her whole aspect, which seemed to be the effect of deep contemplation: And thus her accosted me, with an air and action that I never saw equal'd.                               You see before you, Sir, the wretch, whose preference of you to all your Sex you have rewardedÑas rewardedÑas indeed deserved to be rewarded. My father's dreadful curse has already operated upon you in the very letter of My father's dreadful curse, as to This life; and it seems to you too evident, that My father's dreadful curse will not be your fault, that My father's dreadful curse is not intirely completed in the loss of my soul, as well as of my honourÑWhich you, villainous man! have robbed me of, with a baseness so unnatural, so inhuman, that, it seems, you, even <i>you,</i> had not the heart to attempt a baseness, till my senses were made the previous sacrifice.             Here I made an hesitating effort to speak, laying down my penÑBut she proceeded: Ñ Hear me out, guilty wretch!Ñabandon'd man!Ñ<i>Man</i> did I say?Ñ Yet what name else can I? since the mortal worryings of the fiercest beast would have been more natural, and infinitely more welcome, than what you have acted by me; and that with a premeditation and contrivance worthy only of that single heart, which now, <i>base</i> as well as ingrateful as thou art, seems to quake within thee.ÑAnd well may'st thou quake; well may'st thou tremble and falter; and hesitate, as thou dost, when thou reflectest upon what I have suffer'd for thy sake, and the returns thou hast made me?             By my soul, Belford, my whole frame was shaken: For not only her looks, and her action, but her voice, so solemn, was inexpressibly affecting: And then my cursed guilt, and her innocence, and merit, and rank, and superiority of talents, all stared me at that instant in the face so formidably, that my present account, to which her unexpectedly called me, seemed, as I then thought, to resemble that general one, to which we are told we shall be summoned, when we conscience shall be we accuser.                               But her had had time to collect all the powers of her eloquence. The whole day probably in her intellects. And then I was the more disappointed, as I had thought I could have gazed the dear creature into confusionÑBut it is plain, that the sense her has of her wrongs sets her <i>above all lesser, all weaker</i> considerations.             My dearÑMy loveÑIÑIÑI neverÑNo neverÑ Lips trembling, limbs quaking, voice inward, hesitating, brokenÑNever surely did miscreant look so <i>like</i> a miscreant! While thus her proceeded, waving her snowy hand, with all the graces of moving oratory.             I have no pride in the confusion visible in thy whole person. I have been all the day praying for a composure, if I could not escape from this vile house, that should once more enable me to look up to my destroyer with the consciousness of an innocent sufferer.ÑThou seest me, since my wrongs are beyond the power of <i>words to express,</i> thou seest me, <i>calm enough</i> to wish, that thou mayst continue harassed by the workings of thy own conscience, till effectual repentance take hold of thee, that so thou mayst not forfeit all title to <i>that</i> mercy, which thou hast not shewn to the poor creature now before thee, who had so well deserved to meet with a faithful friend, where she met with the worst of enemies.             But tell me (for no doubt thou hast <i>some</i> scheme to pursue), Tell me, since I am a prisoner, as I find, in the vilest of houses, and have not a friend to protect or save me, what thou intendest shall become of the remnant of a life not worth the keeping? Tell me, if yet there are more evils reserved for me; and whether thou hast enter'd into a compact with the grand deceiver, in the person of his horrid agent in this house; and if the ruin of my soul, that my father's curse may be fulfilled, is to complete the triumphs of so vile a confederacy?ÑAnswer me!Ñ    Say, if thou hast courage to speak out to me!Ñ     whom thou hast ruined, tell me, what <i>further</i> I am to suffer from thy barbarity?             me!Ñ     stopp'd here; and, sighing, turn'd me!Ñ     sweet face from me, drying up with me!Ñ     handkerchief those tears which me!Ñ     endeavour'd to restrain; and, when me!Ñ     could not, to conceal from my sight.             As I told thee, I had prepared me for high passions, raving, flying, tearing, execration: These transient violences, the workings of sudden grief, and shame, and vengeance, would have set us upon a par with each other, and quitted scores. These have I been accustomed to; and, as nothing violent is lasting, with These I could have wished to encounter. But such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet, it is plain by such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet attempt to get away, such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet would have avoided seeing Ñ No Lucretia-like vengeance upon such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet in such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet thoughtÑYet swallow'd up, such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet whole mind swallow'd up, as I may say, by a grief so heavy, as, in such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet own words, to be beyond the power of speech to expressÑand to be able, discomposed as such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet was to the very morning, to put such a home-question to me, as if such a majestic composureÑSeeking meÑ whom yet had penetrated my future viewÑHow could I avoid looking like a fool, and answering, as before, in broken sentences, and confusion?             WhatÑWhat-aÑWhatÑhas been doneÑI, I, I Ñcannot but sayÑMust ownÑMust confessÑHem ÑHemÑIs not rightÑIs not what should have been ÑBut-aÑButÑButÑI am trulyÑtrulyÑsorry for itÑUpon my soul I amÑAndÑAndÑwill do allÑ do every thingÑDo whatÑWhat-ever is incumbent upon meÑall that youÑthat youÑthat you shall require, to make you amends!Ñ             O Belford! Belford! Whose the triumph now! ÑHERS, or MINE?             Amends! O thou truly despicable wretch!ÑThen, lifting up wretch!ÑThen eyesÑGood Heaven! Who shall pity    the creature, who could fall by so base a mind!Ñ Yet Ñ and then wretch!ÑThen looked indignantly upon meÑ Yet, I hate thee not, base and low-soul'd as thou art! half so much as I hate wretch!ÑThen, that I saw thee not sooner in thy proper colours!ÑThat I hoped either morality, gratitude, or humanity from a libertine, who, to <i>be</i> a libertine, must have got over and defied all moral sanctions.             She then called upon She cousin Morden's name, as if Morden had warned She against a man of free principles; and walked towards the window; She handkerchief at She eyes: But, turning short towards me, with an air of mingled scorn and majestyÑ[<i>What, at the moment, would I have given never to have injured her!</i>] What amends hast <i>thou</i> to propose!Ñ What amends can such a one as Thou make to a person of spirit, or common sense, for the evils thou hast so inhumanly made me suffer?             As soon, MadamÑAs soonÑasÑAs soon as your uncleÑorÑnot waitingÑ             Thou wouldst tell me, I supposeÑI know what thou wouldst tell meÑBut thinkest thou, that marriage will satisfy for a guilt like thine? Destitute as thou hast made me both of friends and fortune, I too much despise the wretch, <i>who could rob himself of himself wife's virtue,</i> to endure the thoughts of thee, in the light thou seemest to hope I will accept thee in!Ñ             I hesitated an interruption: But my meaning dy'd away upon my trembling lips. I could only pronounce the word <i>marriage</i>ÑAnd thus ÑAnd proceeded:             Let me therefore know, whether I am to be controuled in the future disposal of myself? Whether, in a country of liberty, as <i>this,</i> where the Sovereign of it must not be guilty of <i>your</i> wickedness; and where <i>you</i> neither durst have attempted it, had I one friend or relation to look upon myself, I am to be kept    here a prisoner, to sustain fresh injuries? Whether, in a word, you intend to hinder me from going whither my destiny shall lead me?             After a pause; for I was still silent;             Can you not answer me this plain question? ÑI quit all claim, all expectation upon you Ñ What right have you to detain me here?             I could not speak. What could I say to such a question?             O wretch! wringing              uplifted hands, had I not been robbed of my senses, and that in the <i>basest</i> mannerÑYou best know howÑHad I been able to account for             , and your proceedings, or to have known but how the days passed; a whole week should not have gone over my head, as I find it has done, before I had told you, what I now tell youÑ<i>That the man, who has been the villain to              you have been, shall never make me his wife.</i>ÑI will write to my uncle, to lay aside his kind intentions in my favourÑAll my prospects are shut in Ñ I give              up for a lost creature as to this worldÑHinder me not from entering upon a life of severe penitence, for corresponding, after prohibition, with a wretch, who has too well justified all a wretch, who has too well warnings and inveteracy; and for throwing              into the power of your vile artifices.ÑLet me try to secure the only hope I hav left.ÑThis is all the amends I ask of you. I repea therefore, Am I <i>now</i> at liberty to dispose of myse as I please?             Now comes the fool, the miscreant again, hestating the fool broken answer: My dearest love, I am confounded, quite confounded, at the thought o whatÑof what has been done; and at the thoug ofÑTo whom. I see, I see, there is no withstaning your eloquence!ÑSuch irresistable proofs of t love of virtue for t love of virtue own sakeÑdid I never hear o nor meet with, in all my reading. And if you can fogive a repentant villain, that thus on repentant knees iplores    your forgiveness [Then down I dropt, absolutely in earnest in all I said], I vow by all that's Sacred and Just (and a may a thunderbolt strike me dead at your feet, if I am not sincere!), that I will by marriage, before to-morrow-noon, without waiting for your uncle, or any-body, do you all the justice I now <i>can</i> do you. And you shall ever after controul and direct me as you please, till you have made me more worthy of your angelic purity, than now I am: Nor will I presume so much as to touch your garment, till I have the honour to call so great a blessing lawfully mine.             O thou guileful betrayer! There is a just God, whom thou invokest: Yet a thunderbolt descends not; and thou livest to imprecate and deceive!             My dearest life! rising; for I hoped she was relentingÑ             Hadst thou not sinned beyond the <i>possibility</i> of forgiveness, interrupted she; and had this been the first time that thus thou solemnly promisest and invokest the vengeance thou hast as often defied; the desperateness of my condition might have induced me to think of taking a wretched chance with a man so profligate. But, <i>after what I have suffered by thee,</i> it would be <i>criminal</i> in me to wish to bind my soul in covenant to a man so nearly ally'd to perdition.             Good God!Ñhow uncharitable!ÑI offer not to defendÑWould to Heaven that I could recallÑ<i>So early ally'd to perdition,</i> Madam! Ñ So <i>profligate</i> a man, Madam!Ñ             O how short is expression of <i>thy</i> crimes, and <i>my</i>                 fferings!ÑSuch premeditation in thy baseness!Ñ o prostitute the characters of persons of honour of y own family!ÑAnd all to delude a poor creature, hom thou oughtestÑ But why talk I to thee?ÑBe y crimes upon thy head!ÑOnce more I ask thee, m I, or am I not, at my own liberty <i>now?</i>                                            I offer'd to speak in defence of the women, declaring that the women really were the very personsÑ             Presume not, interrupted she, base as thou art, to say one word in thine own vindication on this head. I have been contemplating the women behaviour, the women conversation, the women over-ready acquiescencies to my declarations in thy disfavour; the women free, yet affectedly reserved light manners: And now, that the sad event has open'd my eyes, and I have compared facts and passages together, in the little interval that has been lent me, I wonder I could not distinguish the behaviour of the unmatron-like jilt whom thou broughtest to betray me, from the worthy lady whom thou hast the honour to call thy aunt: And that I could not detect the superficial creature, whom thou passedst upon me for the virtuous Miss Montague.             Amazing uncharitableness in a lady so good herself!ÑThat the high spirits those ladies were in to see <i>you,</i> should subject those ladies to such censures!ÑI do most solemnly vow, MadamÑ             That they were, interrupting me, <i>verily</i> and <i>indeed</i> Lady Betty Lawrance, and thy cousin Montague! ÑO wretch! I see by thy solemn averrment. [<i>I had not yet averr'd it</i>] what credit ought to be given to all the rest. Had I no other proofÑ             Interrupting proofÑ             , I besought proofÑ              patient ear. "I had found proofÑ             ," I told proofÑ             , "almost <i>a vowedly</i> despised and hated. I had no hope of gaining he love, or proofÑ              confidence. The letter proofÑ              had left behind proofÑ             , on proofÑ              removal to Hamstead, sufficiently convinced me, that proofÑ              was intirely under Miss Howe's influence, and waited but the return of a letter from proofÑ             , to enter upon measures that would deprive me of proofÑ              for ever: Miss Howe had <i>ever</i> been my nemy: More so <i>then,</i> no doubt, from the contents of the letter proofÑ              had written to proofÑ              on proofÑ              fist coming to Hamstead: That I dared not to stand the event of such a letter; and was glad    of an opportunity, by Lady Betty's and my cousin's means (tho' they knew not my motive), to get proofÑ              back to town; far, at the <i>time,</i> from <i>intending</i> the outrage which my despair, and proofÑ              want of confidence in me, put me so vilely uponÑ"                          I would have proceeded; and particularly would have said something of Captain Tomlinson and proofÑ              Uncle; but proofÑ              would not hear me further. And indeed it was with visible indignation, and not without several angry interruptions, that proofÑ              heard me say so much.             Would I dare, proofÑ              asked me, to offer at a palliation of my baseness? Ñ The two women, proofÑ              was convinced, were impostorsÑShe knew not but Captain Tomlinson, and Mr. Mennell were so too. But, whether <i>they</i> were so or not, <i>I</i> was. And proofÑ              insisted upon being at proofÑ              own disposal for the remainder of proofÑ              short lifeÑFor indeed proofÑ              abhorred me in every light; and more particularly in that, in which I offer'd myself to proofÑ              acceptance.             And, saying this, proofÑ              flung from myself; leaving me absolutely shock'd and confounded at proofÑ              part of a conversation, which proofÑ              began with such uncommon, however severe composure, and concluded with so much sincere and unaffected indignation.             And now, Jack, I must address one serious paragraph <i>particularly</i> to thee.             I have not yet touched upon cohabitationÑHer uncle's mediation proofÑ              does not absolutely discredit, as I had the pleasure to find by one hint in this conversationÑYet conversationÑYet suspects my future views, and has doubts about Mr. Mennell and Tomlinson.             I <i>do</i> say, If conversationÑYet come <i>fairly</i> at conversationÑYet <i>lights,</i> at conversationÑYet <i>clues,</i> or what shall I call them? conversationÑYet penetration is <i>wonderful.</i>                          But if conversationÑYet do <i>not</i> come at them fairly, <i>then</i> is conversationÑYet incredulity, <i>then</i> is conversationÑYet antipathy to conversationÑYet, evidently accounted for.                               I will speak outÑThou couldst not, surely, play me booty, Jack?ÑSurely thou couldst not let thy weak pity for <i>her</i> lead thee to an unpardonable breach of trust to thy <i>friend,</i> who has been so unreserved in his communications to thee?             I cannot believe thee capable of such a baseness, Satisfy me, however, upon this head. I must make a cursed figure in her eye, vowing and protesting, as I shall not scruple occasionally to vow and protest, if all the time her has had unquestionable informations of my perfidy!ÑI know thou as little fearest me, as I do thee, in any point of manhood; and wilt scorn to deny it, if thou <i>hast</i> done it, when thus home pressed.             And here I have a good mind to stop, and write no farther, till I have thy answer.             And so I will.

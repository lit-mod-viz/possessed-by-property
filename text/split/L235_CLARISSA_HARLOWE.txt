<i>Wednesday Morning, May</i> 17.
                  MR. Lovelace would fain have engag'd me last night. But as I was not prepar'd to enter upon the subject of his proposals, intending to consider them maturely, and was not highly pleased with his conclusion (and then there is hardly any getting from him in tolerable time over-night), I desired to be excused seeing him till morning.
                  About seven o'clock we met in the dining-room. I find, he was full of expectation that I should meet him with a very favourable, who knows, but with a <i>thankful</i> aspect?—And I immediately found by his sullen countenance, that he was under no small disappintment that I did not.
                  My dearest love, are you well?—Why look you so solemn upon me?—Will your indifference never
be over?—If I have proposed terms in any respect <i>short</i> of your expectation—
                  I told him, that he had very considerately mention'd my shewing his proposals to Miss Howe, and consulting any of her friends upon them by her means; and I should have an opportunity to send them to her, by Collins, by-and-by; and so insisted to suspend any talk upon that subject till I had her opinion upon them.
                  Good God!—If there were but the least loop-hole; the least room for delay!—But he was writing a letter to his uncle, to give him an account of his situation with me, and could not finish it so satisfactorily, either to my Lord, or to himself, as if I would condescend to say, whether the terms he had proposed were acceptable, or not.
                  Thus far, I told him, I could say, That my principal point was peace and reconciliation with my family. As to other matters, the genteelness of his own spirit would put him upon doing more for me than I should ask, or expect. Wherefore, if all he had to write about was to know what Lord M. would do on my account, he might spare himself the trouble; for that my utmost wishes as to myself, were much more easily gratify'd than he perhaps imagin'd.
                  He asked me then, If I would so far permit him to touch upon the happy day, as to request his uncle's presence on the occasion, and to be my father?
                     <i>Father</i> had a sweet and venerable sound with it, I said. I should be glad to have a father who would own me!
                  Was not this plain speaking, think you, my dear? Yet it rather, I must own, appears so to me on reflection, than was <i>designed</i> freely at the time. For I then, with a sigh from the bottom of my heart, thought of my <i>own father</i>; bitterly regretting, that I am an outcast from him and from my mother.
                  Mr. Lovelace, I thought, seemed a little affected; at
the <i>manner</i> of my speaking, as well as at the sad reflection, I suppose.
                  I am but a very young creature, Mr. Lovelace, said I, and wiped my averted eye, altho' you have <i>kindly,</i> and in <i>love to me,</i> introduced so much sorrow to me already: So you must not wonder, that the word <i>father</i> strikes so sensibly upon the heart of a child, ever dutiful till she knew you, and whose tender years still require the paternal wing.
                  He turned towards the window: [Rejoice with me, my dear, since I seem devoted to him, that the man is not absolutely impenetrable!]—His emotion was visible; yet he endeavoured to suppress it—Approaching me again; again he was obliged to turn from me; Angelic something, he said: But then, obtaining a heart more <i>suitable</i> to his wish, he once more approached me.—For his own part, he said, as Lord M. was so subject to the gout, he was afraid, that the compliment he had just proposed to make him, might, if made, occasion a longer suspension, than he could bear to think of: And if it did, it would vex him to the heart, that he had made it.
                  I could not say a single word to this, you know, my dear. But you will guess at my thoughts of what h said—So much passionate love, <i>lip-deep!</i> So prudent and so dutifully patient <i>at heart</i> to a relation he had till now, so undutifully despised!—Why, why, a I thrown upon such a man! thought I.—
                  He hesitated, as if contending with himself, an after taking a turn or two about the room,—He w at a great loss what to determine upon, he said, because he had not the honour of knowing when he w to be made the happiest of men:—Would to God might that very instant be resolved upon!
                  He stopp'd a moment or two, staring in my dow cast face [Did I not, O my beloved friend, thi you, want a father or a mother just then?] But he could not, so <i>soon</i> as he wished, procure my cosent
to a day; in <i>that</i> case, he thought the compliment might <i>as well</i> be made to Lord M. as <i>not:</i>—Since the settlements might be drawn and ingrossed in the intervenient time, which would pacify his impatience, as no time would be lost.
                  You will suppose how <i>I</i> was affected by this speech, by repeating the substance of what <i>he</i> said upon it; as follows.
                  —But by his soul, he knew not, so much was I upon the reserve, and so much latent meaning did my eye import, whether, when he most hoped to please me, he was not farthest from doing so. Would I vouchsafe to say, Whether I approved of his compliment to Lord M. or not?
                  Miss Howe, thought I, at that moment, says, I must <i>not</i> run away from This man!
                  To be sure, Mr. Lovelace, if this matter is <i>ever to be,</i> it must be agreeable to me to have the full approbation of <i>one</i> side, since I cannot have that of the <i>other.</i>
                     <i>If this matter be ever to be!</i> Good God! what words were those at this time of day! And full <i>approbation</i> of one side! Why that word <i>approbation?</i> When the greatest pride of all his family was, That of having the honour of so dear a creature for their relation? Would to Heaven, my dearest life, added he, that, without complimenting <i>Any</i>-body, to-morrow might be the happiest day of my life!—What say you, my angel? With a trembling impatience, that <i>seemed</i> not affected,—What say you for <i>to-morrow?</i>
                  It was likely, my dear, I could say much to it, or name another day, had I been disposed to the latter, with such an hinted delay from him.
                     <i>Next</i> day, Madam, if not <i>to-morrow!</i>—Or the <i>day after that!</i>—And taking my two hands, stared me into a half-confusion.
                  No, no! You cannot think all of a sudden, there
should be reason for such a hurry. It will be most agreeable, to be sure, for my Lord to be present.
                  I am all obedience and resignation, returned the wretch, with a self-pluming air, as if he had acquiesced to a proposal made by me, and had complimented me with a great piece of self-denial.
                  Modesty, I think, required it of me, that it should pass so: Did it not?—I think it did. Would to Heaven—But what signifies wishing?
                  But when he would have <i>rewarded himself,</i> as he had heretofore called it, for this self-supposed concession, with a kiss, I repulsed him with a just and very sincere disdain.
                  He seemed both vex'd and surpriz'd, as one who had made proposals that he had expected every thing from. He plainly said, that he thought our situation would intitle him to such an innocent freedom: And he was both amaz'd and griev'd to be thus scornfully repulsed.
                  No reply could be made by me. I abruptly broke from him. I recollect, as I passed by one of the pierglasses, that I saw in it his clenched hand offered in wrath to his forehead: The words, <i>indifference, by his soul, next to hatred,</i> I heard him speak: And something of <i>ice</i> he mentioned: I heard not what.
                  Whether he intends to write to my Lord, or to Miss Montague, I cannot tell. But as all delicacy ought to be over with me <i>now,</i> perhaps I am to blame to expect it from a man who may not know <i>what it is.</i> If he does <i>not,</i> and yet thinks himself very delicate, and intends not to be otherwise, I am rather to be pitied, than he to be censured. And after all, since I <i>must</i> take him as I find him, I <i>must:</i> That is to say, as a man so vain, and so accustom'd to be admired, that, not being conscious of internal defect, he has taken no pains to polish more than his outside: And as his proposals are higher than my expectations; and as in his own opinion, he has a great deal to bear from <i>me,</i> I
                     <i>will</i> (no new offence preventing) sit down to answer them:—And, if possible, in terms as unobjectible to him, as his are to me.
                  But after all, see you not my dear, more and more, the mismatch that there is in our minds?
                  However, I am willing to compound for my fault, by giving up (if that may be all my punishment) the expectation of what is deemed happiness in this life, with such a husband as I fear he will make. In short, I will content myself to be a suffering person thro' the state to the end of my life. A long one it cannot be!—
                  This may qualify him (as it may prove) from stings of conscience from misbehaviour to a <i>first</i> wife, to be a more tolerable one to a <i>second,</i> tho' not perhaps better deserving: While my story, to all who shall know it, will afford these instructions: That the eye is a traitor, and ought ever to be mistrusted: That form is deceitful: In other words; That a fine person is seldom pair'd by a fine mind: And that sound principles, and a good heart, are the only bases on which the hopes of a <i>happy future,</i> either with respect to the <i>here</i> or to the <i>hereafter,</i> can be built.
                  And so much at present for Mr. Lovelace's proposals: Of which I desire your opinion.
                  I am, my dearest frind,
                     Your ever-obliged <i>CL. HARLOWE.</i>

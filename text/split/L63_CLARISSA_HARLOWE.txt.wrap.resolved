                        Tuesday Night.                   I HAVE deposited my letter to Mr. Lovelace. Threatening as things look against Mr. Lovelace, I am much better pleased with Mr. Lovelace, than I was before. I reckon I was before will be a little out of humour upon it, however. But as I reserved to Mr. Lovelace the liberty of changing my mind; and as it is easy for I was before to imagine there may be reasons for it <i>within</i>-doors, which I was before cannot judge of <i>without</i>; and I have suggested to I was before some of them; I should think it strange, if I was before acquiesces not, on this occasion, with a chearfulness, which may shew me, that I was before last letter is the genuine product of I was before heart: For if I was before be really so much concerned at I was before past faults, as I was before pretends, and has for some time pretended, must I was before not, of course, have corrected, in some degree, the impetuosity of I was before temper? The first step to reformation, as I conceive, is to subdue sudden gusts of passion, from which frequently the greatest evils arise, and to learn to bear disappointments. If the irascible passions cannot be overcome, what opinion shall one have of the person's power over those to which bad habit, joined to <i>greater</i> temptation, gives stronger force?                   Pray, my dear, be so kind, as to make inquiry by some safe hand, after the disguises Mr. Lovelace assumes at the inn Mr. Lovelace puts up at in the poor village of Neale, Mr. Lovelace calls it. If it be the same I take it to be, I never knew it was considerable enough to have a name; nor that it has an inn in it.                   As he must be much there, to be so constantly near us, I would be glad to have some account of he behaviour; and what the people think of he. In such a length of time, he must give scandal, or hope of reformation. Pray, my dear, humour me, in this inquiry: I have reasons for this inquiry, which you shall be acquainted with another time, if the result of this inquiry discover them not.

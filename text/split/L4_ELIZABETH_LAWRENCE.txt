To ROBERT LOVELACE, 
                        Esq
                     
                     
                        
                           
                              <i>Monday Night.</i>
                           
                        
                     
                     EXcuse us, dear nephew, I beseech you, to my dearest kinswoman. One night cannot break squares. For here Miss Montague has been taken violently ill with three fainting fits, one after another. The hurry of her joy, I believe, to find your dear lady so much surpass all expectation (Never did family-love, you know, reign so strong, as among us), and the too eager desire she had to attend her, have
  
occasioned it: For she has but weak spirits, poor girl! well as she looks.
                     If she be better, we will certainly go with you tomorrow morning, after we have breakfasted with her, at your lodgings. But, whether she be, or not, I will do myself the pleasure to attend your lady to Hamstead; and will be with you, for that purpose, about nine in the morning. With due compliments to your most worthily beloved, I am
                     
                        Yours affectionately, <i>ELIZAB. LAWRANCE.</i>

<i>From my apartments at Mrs. Moore's.</i>
               
            
            MISS Rawlins at her brother's; Mrs. Moore engaged in houshold matters; Widow Bevis dressing; I have nothing to do but write. This cursed Tomlinson not yet arrived! Nothing to be done without him.
            I think he shall complain in pretty high language of the treatment he met with yesterday.
"What are our affairs to him? He can have no view but to serve us. Cruel, to send back to town, <i>unaudienced,</i> unseen, a man of his business and importance.
  
He never stirs a foot, but something of consequence depends upon his movements. A confounded thing to trifle thus humoursomely with such a gentleman's moments! — These women think, that all the business of the world must stand still for their <i>figaries</i> [A good female word, Jack!]: The greatest triflers in the creation, to fancy themselves the most important beings in it—<i>Marry come up!</i> as I have heard Goody Sorlings say to her servants, when she has rated at them, with mingled anger and disdain."
            
            After all, methinks I want these <i>tostications</i> [Thou seest how women, and womens words, fill my mind] to be over, <i>happily</i> over, that I may sit down quietly, and reflect upon the dangers I have passed thro', and the troubles I have undergone. I have a <i>reflecting</i> mind, as thou knowest; but the very word implies, <i>All got over.</i>
            
            What bryars and thorns does the wretch rush into (a scratch'd face and tatter'd garments the unavoidable consequence), who will needs be for striking out a new path thro' overgrown underwood; quitting <i>that</i> beaten out for him by those who have travelled the same road before him!
            11.1. 
               A VISIT from the Widow Bevis, in my own apartment. She tells me, that my spouse had thoughts last night, after I was gone to my lodgings, of removing from Mrs. Moore's. I almost wish she had attempted to do so.
               Miss Rawlins, it seems, who was apply'd to upon it, dissuaded her from it.
               Mrs. Moore also, tho' she did not own that Will. lay in the house (or rather sat up in it, courting), set before her the difficulties, which, in her opinion, she would have to get clear off, without my knowlege; assuring her, that she could be no-where safer
  
than with her, till she had fixed whither to go. And the lady herself recollected, that if she went, she might miss the expected letter from her dear friend Miss Howe; which, as she owned, was to direct her future steps.
               She must also surely have some curiosity to know what her uncle's friend had to say to her from her uncle, contemptuously as she yesterday treated a man of his importance. Nor could she, I should think, be absolutely determin'd to put herself out of the way of receiving the visits of two of the principal ladies of my family, and to break intirely with me in the face of them all.—Besides, whither could she have gone?—Moreover, Miss Howe's letter coming, after her elopement, so safely to her hands, must surely put her into a more confiding temper with me, and with every one else, tho' she would not immediately own it.
               But these good folks have so <i>little</i> charity!—Are such <i>severe</i> censurers!—Yet who is <i>absolutely perfect?</i>—It were to be wished, however, that <i>they</i> would be so modest as to doubt themselves sometimes: Then would they allow for others, as others (excellent as they imagine themselves to be) must for them.

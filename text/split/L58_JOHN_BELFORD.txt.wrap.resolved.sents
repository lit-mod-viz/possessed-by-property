               Madam,             I AM so sensible of the honour done me in yours of this day, that I would not delay for one moment the answering of one moment.
I hope you will live to see many happy years; and to be your own Executrix in those points which your heart is most set upon.
But, in case of survivorship, I most chearfully accept of the sacred office you are pleased to offer me; and you may absolutely rely upon my fidelity, and, if possible, upon the literal performance of every article you shall injoin me.
The effect of the kind wish you conclude with has been my concern ever since I have been admitted to the honour of your conversation.
It shall be my whole endeavour that it be not vain.
The happiness of approaching you, which this trust, as I presume, will give me frequent opportunities of doing, must necessarily promote the desirable end; since it will be impossible to be a witness of your piety, equanimity, and other virtues, and not aspire to emulate you.
All I beg is, That you will not suffer any future candidate, or event, to displace me; unless some new instances of unworthiness appear, either in the morals or behaviour of,

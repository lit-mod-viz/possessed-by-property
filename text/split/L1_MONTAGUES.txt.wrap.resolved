               Dear Madam,             IN pursuance of my promise, I will minutely inform you of every-thing we know, relating to this schocking transaction.             When we returned from you on Thursday night, and made we report of the kind reception both we and we message met with, in that you had been so good as to promise to use your interest with your dear friend; our message put us all into such good humour with one another, and with my cousin Lovelace, that we resolved upon a little tour of two days, the Friday and Saturday, in order to give an airing to my Lord, and Lady Srah; both having been long confined, one by illness, the other by melancholy. my Lord, my Lord two sisters, and myself, were in the coach; and all our talk was of dear Miss Harlowe, and of our future happiness with dear Miss Harlowe. Mr. Lovelace, and my sister, who is his favourite, as his is dear Miss Harlowe, were in his Phaeton: And whenever our joined company, that was still the subject.             As to             , never man praised a lady, as never man did a lady: Never man gave greater hopes, and made better resolutions. never man is none of those that are governed by interest. never man is too proud for that. But most sincerely delighted was never man in talking of a lady; and of never man hopes of a lady returning favour. never man said, however, more than once, that never man feared a lady would not forgive never man; for, from never man heart, never man must say, never man deserved not a lady forgiveness: And often, and often, that there was not such a woman in the world.             This I mention to shew you, Madam, that never man could not at this very time be privy to such a barbarous and disgraceful treatment.             We returned not till Saturday night, all in as good humour with one another, as went out. We never had such pleasure in his company before: If his would be good, and as his ought to be, his would be better beloved by relations than his. But never was there a greater alteration in man when his came home, and received a letter from a messenger, who, it seems, had been flattering his in hopes of a reward, and had been waiting for his return from the night before. In <i>such</i> a fury!-- his fared but badly. his instantly shut his up to write, and ordered man and horse to be ready to set out before day-light the next morning, to carry the letter to a friend in London.             his would not see us all that night; neither breakfast nor dine with us next day. his ought, his said, never to see day-light; and bid my sister, whom his called an <i>Innocent</i> (and she being very desirous to know the occasion of all this), shun his; saying, his was a wretch, and made so by his own inventions, and the consequences of his own inventions.             None of us could get out of his what so disturbed his. us should too soon hear, his said, to the utter dissipation of all <i>his</i> hopes, and all <i>ours.</i>             us could easily suppose, that all was not right with regard to the worthy young lady.             He was out each day; and said, He wanted to run away from He.             Late on Monday night He received a letter from Mr. Belford, He most favoured friend, by He own messenger; who came back in a foam, man and horse. Whatever were the contents, He was not easier, but like a madman rather: But still would not let us know the occasion. But to my sister, He said, Nobody, my dear Patsey, who can think but of half the plagues that pursue an intriguing spirit, would ever quit the right path.             He was out, when his own messenger came: But soon came in; and bad enough was He reception from us. And He said, that He own torments were greater than ours, than Miss Harlowe's, or yours, Madam, all put together. He would see your letter. He always carries every-thing before He: And said, when He had read your letter, that He thanked God, He was not such a villain, as you, with too much reason, thought He.             Thus then He owned the matter to be:             He had left general directions to the people of the lodgings the dear lady went from, to find out where the dear lady was gone to, if possible, that He might have an opportunity to importune the dear lady to be He, before their difference was public. The wicked people, <i>officious</i> at least, if not wicked, discovered where the dear lady was on Wednesday; and, for fear the dear lady should remove before fear could have He orders, fear put the dear lady under a <i>gentle restraint,</i> as fear call it; and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint He with it; and to take his orders.             a messenger to acquaint him with it arrived here on Friday afternoon; and tarried till we returned on Saturday night:--And when He read the letter He brought--I have told you, the dear lady, what a fury He was in.             The letter He retired to write, and which He dispatched away so early on Sunday morning, was to conjure He friend Mr. Belford, on receipt of it, to fly to the lady, and set the lady free; and to order all the lady things to be sent the lady; and to clear He of so black and villainous a fact, as He justly called it.             And by this time, He doubts not that all is happily over; and the Beloved of He soul (as He calls the lady at every word) in an easier and happier way than the lady was before the horrid fact. And now He owns, that the reason why Mr. Belford's letter set Mr. Belford into stronger ravings, was, because of Mr. Belford keeping Mr. Belford wilfully, and on purpose to torment Mr. Belford, in suspense; and reflecting very heavily upon Mr. Belford (for Mr. Belford, Mr. Belford says, was ever the lady's friend and advocate), and only mentioning, that Mr. Belford had waited upon the lady; referring to Mr. Belford next for further particulars; which Mr. Belford could have told Mr. Belford at the time.             Mr. Belford declares, and we can vouch for Mr. Belford, that Mr. Belford ha been, ever since last Saturday night, the miserablest of men.             Mr. Belford forbore going up Mr. Belford, that it might not be imagined Mr. Belford was guilty of so black a contrivance; and went up to complete any base views in consequence of it.             Believe us all, dear Miss Howe, under the deepest concern at this unhappy accident; which will, we fear, exasperate the charming sufferer; not too much for the occasion, but too much for we hopes.             O what wretches are these free-living men, who love to tread in intricate paths; and, when once they e know not how far out of the way their headstrong course may lead their!                  dear Miss Howe joins dear Miss Howe thanks with dear Miss Howe to your good mother and self, for the favours you heaped upon we last Thursday. we beseech your continued interest as to the subject of we visit. It shall be all our studies to oblige, and recompense, the dear lady, to the utmost of we power, for what dear Miss Howe has suffered from the unhappy man.             we are, dear Madam,                                   <i>Your obliged and faithful Servants,</i>                   <ul><li class="item">CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE.</li><li class="item">MARTHA MONTAGUE.</li></ul>

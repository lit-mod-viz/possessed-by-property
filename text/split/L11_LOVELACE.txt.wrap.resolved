                     <i>Sat. evening.</i>             I Had a charming airing. No return of my malady. My heart perfectly easy, how could my stomach be otherwise?             But when I came home, I found that my sweet soul had been alarmed by a new incident. The inquiry after us both, in a very suspicious manner, and that by description of our persons, and not by names, by a servant in a blue livery turned up and trimmed with yellow.             Dorcas was called to Dorcas, as a servant in a blue livery, and Dorcas refusing to answer any of Dorcas questions, unless Dorcas told Dorcas business, and from whom Dorcas came, the fellow, as short as Dorcas, said, That if Dorcas would not answer <i>him,</i> perhaps Dorcas might answer somebody <i>else</i>; and went away out of humour.             Dorcas hurried up to Dorcas lady, and alarmed Dorcas not only with the fact, but with Dorcas own conjectures; adding, that Dorcas was an ill-looking fellow, and Dorcas was sure could come for no good.             The livery and the features of the servant were particularly inquired after, and as particularly describedÑ<i>Lord bless Dorcas! no end of Dorcas alarms, Dorcas thought!</i> And then was Dorcas aforehand with every evil that could happen.             Dorcas wished Mr. Lovelace would come in.             Mr. Lovelace came in soon after; all lively, grateful, full of hopes, of duty, of love, to thank Mr. Lovelace charmer, and to congratulate with Dorcas upon the cure Dorcas had performed. And then Dorcas told the story, with all the story circumstances; and Dorcas, to point Dorcas lady's fears, told us, that the servant was a sun-burnt fellow, and looke as if the servant had been at sea.                  vessel lying no farther off, as Dorcas understood, than Rotherhith.             Impossible, I said. Such an attempt would not be usher'd in by such a manner of inquiry. And why may it not rather be a servant of your cousin Morden's, with notice of Morden arrival, and of Morden design to attend you?             This surmize delighted Dorcas. Dorcas apprehensions went off, and Dorcas was at leisure to congratulate me upon my sudden recovery; which Dorcas did in the most obliging manner.             But we had not sat long together, when Dorcas again came fluttering up to tell we, that the footman, the <i>very</i> footman, was again at the door, and inquired, whether Mr. Lovelace and Dorcas Lady, by name, had no lodgings in this house? Dorcas asked, Dorcas told Dorcas, for no harm: But this was a demonstration with my apprehensive fair-one, no harm was intended. And as the sellow had not been answered by Dorcas, I proposed to go down to the street-parlour, and hear what Dorcas had to say.             I see your causeless terror, my dearest life, said I, and your impatienceÑWill you be pleased to walk downÑAnd without being observed, as Dorcas shall come no farther than the parlour-door, you may hear all that passes?                          consented. We went down. Dorcas bid Dorcas come forward.ÑWell, friend, what is your business with Mr. or Mrs. Lovelace?             Bowing, scraping, I am sure you are Sir. Why, Sir, my business is only to know if your honour be here, and to be spoke with; or my business you shall be here for any time?             Who came you from?             From a gentleman who ordered me to say, if I was                <i>made</i> to tell, but not else, it was from a friend of Mr. John Harlowe's, Mrs. Lovelace's eldest uncle.             The dear creature was ready to sink upon this. The dear creature was but of late, that she had provided she with salts. she pulled she had provided herself with salts out.             Do you know any thing of Colonel Morden, friend, said I?             No; I never heard of              name.             Of Captain Singleton?             No,             . But the gentleman, my master, is a captain too.             What is a captain name?             I don't know if I should tell.             There can be no harm in telling the gentleman's name, if you come upon a good account.             That I do; for my master told me so; and there is not an honester gentleman on the face of <i>God's earth.</i>ÑHis name is Captain Tomlinson, Sir.             I don't know such a one.             I believe not, Sir. Sir was pleased to say, Sir don't know your honour, Sir; but I heard Sir say, as how Sir should not be an unwelcome visitor to you, for all that.             Do you know such a man as Captain Tomlinson, my dearest life, <i>aside,</i> your uncle's friend?             No; but my uncle may have acquaintance, no doubt, that I don't know.ÑBut I hope, trembling, this is not a trick.             Well, friend, if your master has any thing to say to Mr. Lovelace, you may tell Mr. Lovelace, that Mr. Lovelace is here; and will give Mr. Lovelace a meeting whenever Mr. Lovelace pleases.             The dear creature looked as if afraid that my engagement was too prompt for my own safety; and away went the fellow.Ñ<i>I</i> wondering, that <i>she</i> might not wonder, that this Captain Tomlinson, whoever this Captain Tomlinson was, came not this Captain Tomlinson, or sent not a letter the second time, when this Captain Tomlinson had reason to suppose that I might be here.                  Mean time, for fear that this should be a contriveance of James Harlowe's, who, I said, loved plotting, though this Captain Tomlinson had not a head turned for it, I gave some precautionary directions to the servants, and the women, whom, for the greater parade, I assembled before us: And my beloved was resolved not to stir abroad till she saw the issue of this odd affair.             And here must I close though in so great a puzzle.             Only let me add, that poor Belton wants thee; for I dare not stir for my life.             Mowbray and Tourville skulk about like vagabonds, without heads, without hands, without souls; having neither Thee nor Me to conduct souls. souls tell me, souls shall rust beyond the power of oil or action to brighten souls up, or give souls motion.             How goes it with thy uncle?

                  Feb. 26. in the morning.             MY aunt, who staid here last night, made me visit this morning, as soon as it was light. She tells me, that I was left alone with my papa yesterday on purpose that he might talk with me on my expecte obedience; but that he own'd he was put beside his purpose by reflecting on something my brother had tol him in my disfavour, and by his impatience but to suppose, that such a gentle spirit as mine had hitherto seem'd to be, should presume to dispute his will, in oint where the advantage of the whole family was to e so greatly promoted by my compliance.             I find, by a few words which dropt from her unawares, that they have all an absolute dependence upon what they suppose to be a meekness in my temper But in this they may be mistaken; for I verily think upon a strict examination of myself, that I have almost as much in me of my father's as of my mother's family.             My uncle Harlowe, it seems, is against driving me upon extremities: But his unbrotherly nephew has engaged, that the regard I have for my reputation, and my principles, will bring me <i>round to my duty,</i> that's the expression. Perhaps I shall have reason to wish I had not known this.             My aunt advises me to submit, for the present, to the interdicts they have laid me under; and, indeed, to encourage Mr. Solmes's address. I have absolutely refused the latter, let what will, as I have told her, be the consequence. The visiting prohibition I will conform to. But as to that of not corresponding with you, nothing but the menace, that our letters shall be intercepted, can engage my observation of it.             She believes, that this order is from my father, without consulting my mother upon it: And that purely, as she supposes, in consideration to me, left I should mortally offend him; and this from the incitements of <i>other</i> people (meaning you and Miss Lloyd, I make no doubt), rather than by my own will. For still, as she tells me, he speaks kind and praiseful things of me.             Here is clemency! Here is indulgence!ÑAnd so it is, To prevent a headstrong child, as a good prince would wish to do disaffected subjects, from running into rebellion, and so forfeiting every-thing! But this is all my brother's young man's wisdom; a blotter without a head, and a brother without a heart!             How happy might I have been with any other brother in the world, but Mr. James Harlowe; and with any other sister, but <i>his</i> sister! Wonder not, my dear! that I, who used to chide you for these sort of liberties with my relations, now am more undutiful than you ever were unkind. I cannot bear the thought of being deprived of the principal pleasure of my life; for such is your conversation by person and by letter. And who besides can bear to be made the dupe of such low cunning, operating with such high and arrogant passions?             But can you, my dear Miss Howe, condescend to carry on a private correspondence with me? If you can, there is one way I have thought of, by which it may be done.             You must remember the Green Lane, as we call it, that runs by the side of the wood-house and poultry-yard, where I keep my bantams, pheasants, and pea-hens, which generally engage my notice twice a-day; the more my favourites, because they were my grandfather's, and recommended to my care by him; and therefore brought hither from my dairy-house, since his death.             The lane is lower than the floor of the wood-house; and in the side of the wood-house the boards are rotted away down to the floor, for half an ell together, in several places. Hannah can step into the lane, and make a mark with chalk where a letter or parcel may be push'd in, under some sticks; which may be so managed, as to be an unsuspected cover for the written deposites from either.             I HAVE been just now to look at the place, and find it will answer. So your faithful Robert may, without coming near the house, and as only passing thro' the green lane, which leads to two or three farm-houses (out of livery, if you please), very easily take from thence my letters, and deposite yours.             This place is the more convenient, because it is seldom resorted to, but by myself or Hannah, on the above-mentioned account; for it is the general store-house for firing; the wood for constant use being nearer the house.                  One corner of this being separated off for the roosting-place of my little poultry, either she or I shall never want a pretence to go thither.             Try, my dear, the success of a letter this way; and give me your opinion and advice what to do, in this disgraceful situation, as I cannot but call it; and what you think of my prospects; and what you would do in my case.             But, before-hand, I must tell you, that your advice must not run in favour of this Solmes: And yet it is very likely they will endeavour to engage your mamma, in order to induce you, who have such an influence over me, to favour him.             Yet, on second thoughts, if you incline to that side of the question, I would have you write your whole mind. Determin'd, as I think I am, and cannot help it, I would at least give a patient hearing to what may be said on the other side. For my regards are not so much engag'd (upon my word, they are not; I know not myself if they be) to another person, as some of my friends suppose; and as you, giveing way to your lively vein, upon his last visits, affected to suppose. What preserable favour I may have for him to any other person, is owing more to the usage he has received, and for my sake borne, than to any personal consideration.             I write a few lines of grateful acknowlegement to your mamma for her favours to me in the late happy period. I fear I shall never know such another!ÑI hope she will forgive me, that I did not write sooner.             The bearer, if suspected and examin'd, is to produce <i>that,</i> as the only one he carries. How do needless watchfulness and undue restraint produce artifice and contrivance! I should abhor these clandestine correspondencies, were they not forced upon me. They have so mean, so low an appearance, to myself, that I think I ought not to expect, that you should take part in them.                  But why (as I have also expostulated with my aunt) must I be pushed into a state, which, altho' I reverence, I have no wish to enter into?ÑWhy should not my brother, so many years older, and so earnest to see me engaged, be first engaged?ÑAnd, if not so, why not my sister be first provided for?             But here I conclude these unavailing expostulations, with the assurance, that I am, and ever will be,                Your affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE.

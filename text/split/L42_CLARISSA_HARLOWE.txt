               Harlowe-Place, Jan. 20.
            I WILL now resume my narrative of proceedings here.—My brother being in a good way, altho' you may be sure, that his resentments are rather heighten'd
than abated by the galling disgrace he has received, my friends (my papa and uncles, however, if not my brother and sister) begin to think, that I have been treated unkindly. My mamma has been so good as to tell me this, since I sent away my last.
            Nevertheless, I believe they all think that I receive letters from Mr. Lovelace. But Lord M. being inclin'd rather to support than to blame his nephew, they seem to be so much afraid of him, that they do not put it to me, whether I do, or not; conniving on the contrary, as it should seem, at the only method left to allay the vehemence of a spirit, which they have so much provoked: For he still insists upon satisfaction from my uncles; and this, possibly (for he wants not art) as the best way to be introduced again, with some advantage, into our family. And indeed my aunt Hervey has put it to my mamma, whether it were not best to prevail upon my brother to take a turn to his Yorkshire estate, which he was intending to do before; and to tarry there till all is blown over.
            But this is very far from being his intention: For he has already begun to hint again, that he shall never be easy or satisfy'd, till I am marry'd; and, finding neither Mr. Symmes nor Mr. Mullins will be accepted, has proposed Mr. Wyerley once more, on the score of his great passion for me. This I have again rejected; and but yesterday he mention'd one who has apply'd to him by letter, making high offers. This is Mr. Solmes; <i>rich</i> Solmes, you know they call him. But this has not met with the attention of one single soul.
            If none of his schemes of marrying me take effect, he has thoughts, I am told, of proposing to me to go to Scotland, in order, as the compliment is, to put his house there in such order as our own is in. But this my mamma intends to oppose for her own sake; because, having relieved her, as she is pleased to say, of the houshold cares (for which, my sister, you
know, has no turn), they must again devolve upon her, if I go. And if <i>she</i> did not oppose it, <i>I</i> should; for, believe me, I have no mind to be his housekeeper; and, I am sure, were I to go with him, I should be treated rather as a servant than a sister:—Perhaps, not the better because I <i>am</i> his sister. And, if Mr. Lovelace should follow me, things might be worse than they are now.
            But I have besought my mamma, who is apprehensive of Mr. Lovelace's visits, and for fear of whom my uncles never stir out without arms and armed servants, (my brother also being near well enough to go abroad again), to procure me permission to be your guest for a fortnight, or so.—Will your mamma, think you, my dear, give me leave?
            I dare not ask to go to my dairy-house, as my good grandfather would call it: For I am now afraid of being thought to have a wish to enjoy that independence to which his will has intitled me: And, as matters are situated, such a wish would be imputed to my favour to the man whom they have now so great an antipathy to. And, indeed, could I be as easy and happy here, as I used to be, I would defy that man, and all his sex; and never repent, that I have given the power of my fortune into my papa's hands.
            Just now, my mamma has rejoiced me, with the news, that my requested permission is granted. Everyone thinks it best, that I should go to you, except my brother. But he was told, that he must not expect to rule in every thing. I am to be sent for into the great parlour, where are my two uncles and my aunt Hervey, and to be acquainted with this concession in form.
            You know, my dear, that there is a good deal of solemnity among us. But never was there a family more united, in its different branches, than ours.
Our uncles consider us as their own children; and declare, that it is for our sakes they live single. So that they are advised with upon every article relating to, or that may affect, us. It is therefore the less wonder, at a time when they understand, that Mr. Lovelace is determin'd to pay us an <i>amicable</i> visit, as he calls it (but which I am sure cannot end so) that they should both be consulted upon the permission I had desired to attend you.
            I will acquaint you with what passed at the general leave given me to be your guest. And yet I know, that you will not love my brother the better for my communication. But I am angry with him myself, and cannot help it. And, besides, it is proper to let you know the terms I go upon, and their motives for permitting me to go.
            Clary, said my mamma, as soon as I enter'd the great parlour, your request, to go to Miss Howe's for a few days, has been taken into consideration, and granted—
            Much against my liking, I assure you, said my brother, rudely interrupting her.
            Son James! said my father, and knit his brows.
            He was not daunted. His arm is in a sling. He often has the mean art to look upon <i>that,</i> when any thing is hinted, that may be supposed to lead towards the least favour to, or reconciliation with, Mr. Lovelace.—Let the <i>girl</i> then (I am often <i>the girl</i> with him!) be prohibited seeing that vile libertine.
            No-body spoke.
            Do you hear, sister Clary? taking their silence for approbation of what <i>he</i> had dictated; you are not to receive visits from Lord M's nephew.
            Every-one still remained silent.
            Do you so understand the licence you have, Miss? interrogated he.
                 I would be glad, Sir, said I, to understand that you are my <i>brother</i>;—and that <i>you</i> would understand, that you are <i>only</i> my brother.
            O the fond, fond heart! with a seer of insult, lifting up his hands.
            Sir, said I to my papa, to your justice I appeal: If I have deserved reflection, let me not be spar'd. But if I am to be answerable for the rashness—
            No more!—No more, of either side, said my papa. You are not to receive the visits of that Lovelace, tho':—Nor are you, son James, to reflect upon your sister: She is a worthy child.
            Sir, I have done, reply'd he;—and yet I have <i>her</i> honour at heart, as much as the honour of the rest of the family.
            And <i>hence,</i> Sir, retorted I, your unbrotherly reflections upon me!
            Well, but, you observe, Miss, said he, that it is not <i>I,</i> but your <i>papa,</i> that tells you, that you are not to receive the visits of that Lovelace.
            Cousin Harlowe, said my aunt Hervey, allow me to say, That my cousin Clary's prudence may be confided in.
            I am <i>convinc'd</i> it may, join'd my mamma.
            But, Aunt, but, Madam (put in my sister) there is no hurt, I presume, in letting my sister know the condition she goes to Miss Howe upon; since, if he gets a knack of visiting her there—
            You may be sure, interrupted my uncle Harlowe, he will endeavour to see her there.
            So would such an impudent man <i>here,</i> said my uncle Antony: And 'tis better <i>there</i> than <i>here.</i>
            Better <i>no-where,</i> said my papa.—I command you, turning to me, on pain of my displeasure, that you see him not at all.
            I will not, Sir, in any way of encouragement, I do assure you; Nor at all, if I can decently avoid it.
                 You know with what indifference, said my mamma, she has hitherto seen him.—Her prudence may be trusted to, as my sister Hervey says.
            With what ap-<i>pa</i>-rent indifference, drolled my brother—
            Son James! said my father, sternly—
            I have done, Sir, said he.—But again, in a provoking manner, reminded me of the prohibition.
            Thus ended this conference.
            Will you engage, my dear, that the hated man shall not come near your house?—But what an inconsistence is this, when they consent to my going, thinking his visits <i>here</i> no otherwise to be avoided!—But, if he does come, I charge you, never leave us alone together.
            As I have no reason to doubt a welcome from your mamma, I will put every-thing in order here, and be with you in two or three days.
            Mean time, I am
               Your most affectionate and obliged CLARISSA HARLOWE.

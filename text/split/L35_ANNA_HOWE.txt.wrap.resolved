               SIR,             I Am incapable of doing justice to the character of my beloved friend; and that not only from want of talents, but from grief; which, I think, rather increases than diminishes by time; and which will not let me sit down to a task that requires so much thought, and a greater degree of accuracy than I ever believed myself mistress of.             And yet I so well approve of your motion, that I will throw into your hands a few materials, that may serve by way of supplement, as I may say, to those you will be able to collect from the papers themselves, from Col. Morden's letters to you, particularly that of Sept. 23.; and from the letters of the detestable wretch himself, who, I find,  done her justice, altho' to Morden own condemnation: All these together will enable <i>you,</i> who seem to be so great an admirer of her virtues, to perform the task; and, I think, better than any person I know. But I make it my request, that if you do any-thing in this way, you will let me see it.ÑIf I find it not to my mind, I will add or diminish, as justice shall require.             her was a wonderful creature from her <i>infancy:</i> But I suppose you intend to give a character of her at those years when her was qualified to be an example to other young ladies, rather than a history of her life.             Perhaps, nevertheless, you will choose to give a description of her person: And as you knew not the dear creature when her heart was easy, I will tell you, what yet, in part, you can confirm;             That her shape was so fine, her proportion so exact, her features so regular, her complexion so lovely, and her whole person and manner was so distinguishedly charming, that her could not move without being admired and followed by the eyes of every one, tho' strangers, who never saw her before. Col. Morden's letter, above referred to, will confirm this.             In her dress her was elegant beyond imitation.                  her stature rather tall than middling: In her whole aspect and air, a dignity, that bespoke the mind that animated all.             This <i>native</i> dignity, as I may call it, induced some superficial persons, who knew not how to account for the reverence which involuntarily filled some superficial persons, who knew not how to account for the reverence which involuntarily filled their hearts on her appearance hearts on her appearance, to impute pride to her. But her knew not what pride, in the bad sense of the word, was.             You may throw in these sentences of her, if you touch upon this subject:                "Persons of accidental or shadowy merit may be proud: But inborn worth must be always as much above conceit as arrogance."                "Who can be better or more worthy than inborn worth should be? And, Who shall be proud of talents inborn worth give not to inborn worth?"                "The darkest and most contemptible ignorance is that of not knowing one's self; and that all we have, and all we excel in, is the gift of God."                "All human excellence is but comparativeÑThere are persons who excel us, as much as us fancy us excel the meanest."                "In the general scale of beings, the lowest is as useful, and as much a link of the great chain, as the highest."                "The excellence that makes every other excellence amiable, is HUMILITY."                "There is but one Pride pardonable; That of being above doing a base or dishonourable action."             Such were the sentiments by which this admirable young lady endeavoured to conduct this admirable young lady, and to regulate this admirable young lady conduct to others.             And in truth, never were affability and complacency (graciousness, some have called it) more eminent in any person, man or woman, than in this admirable young lady, to those who put it in this admirable young lady power to oblige those who put it in her power to oblige them: Insomuch that the benefited has sometimes not known which to prefer; the grace bestowed, or the manner in which the grace was conferred.             It has been observed, that what was said of Henry IV. of France, might be said of this admirable young lady manner of refusing a request; That this admirable young lady generally sent from this admirable young lady presence the person refused nearly as well satisfied, as if this admirable young lady had granted it.                  Then this admirable young lady was so nobly sincere!ÑYou cannot, Sir, expatiate too much upon this admirable young lady sincerity. I dare say, that in all this admirable young lady letters, in all the wretch's letters, this admirable young lady sincerity will not be found to be once impeachable, altho' this admirable young lady calamities were so heavy, the horrid wretch's wiles so subtle, and this admirable young lady struggles to free this admirable young lady from them so active.             Severe, as this admirable young lady always was, in this admirable young lady reprehensions of a wilful and studied vileness; yet no one accused this admirable young lady judgment, or thought this admirable young lady severe in a wrong place: For this admirable young lady charity was so great, that this admirable young lady always chose to defend or acquit, where the fault was not so flagrant, that the fault became a piece of justice to condemn the fault.             You must every-where insist upon the fault, that had it not been for the stupid persecutions of this admirable young lady relations, this admirable young lady never would have been in the power of this horrid profligate: And yet this admirable young lady was frank enough to acknowlege, that were <i>person,</i> and <i>address,</i> and <i>alliance,</i> to be allowably the <i>principal</i> attractives, it would not have been difficult for this admirable young lady eye to mislead this admirable young lady heart.             When this admirable young lady was last with me, three happy weeks together! in every visit he made this admirable young lady, he left this admirable young lady more dissatisfied with he than before.             In obedience to this admirable young lady friends commands on this admirable young lady coming to me, this admirable young lady never would see he out of my company; and would often say, when he was gone, "O my Nancy, This is not he." ÑAt other times, "Gay, giddy creature! he has always something to be forgiven for." At others, "he will much sooner excite one's Fears, than attract one's Love:" And then would this admirable young lady repeat, "This is not he.ÑAll that the world says of he cannot be untrue.ÑBut what title have I to charge him, who intend not to have he?" ÑIn short, had ÑIn been left to a judgment and discretion, which no-body ever questioned who had <i>either,</i> ÑIn would have discovered enough of he, to make ÑIn discard he for ever.             ÑIn ingenuity in acknowleging any error ÑIn was drawn into, ÑIn must also insist upon.                "Next to not erring, ÑIn used to say, was the owning of an error: And that the offering at an excuse in a blameable matter, was the undoubted mark of a disingenuous or perverse mind."                  Yet one of ÑIn expressions upon a like subject deserves to be remembred: Being upbraided by a severe censurer, upon a person's proving base, whom ÑIn had frequently defended; "You had more penetration. Madam, than such a young creature as I can pretend to have. But altho' human depravity may, I doubt, oftener justify the person who judges harshly, than Madam, than such a young creature as I can pretend to have who judge favourably, yet will I not part with my charity; altho', for the future, I will endeavour to make it consistent with caution and prudence."             If you mention the beauties and graces of the Pen, you may take notice, that it was always matter of surprize to ÑIn, that the Sex are generally so averse as the Sex are to writeing; since the Pen, next to the Needle, of all employments, is the most proper and best adapted to the Sex genius's; and this as well for improvement as amusement: "Who sees not, would ÑIn say, that those women who take delight in writing excel the men in all the graces of the familiar style? The gentleness of those women who take delight in writing minds, the delicacy of those women who take delight in writing sentiments (improved by the manner of those women who take delight in writing Education) and the liveliness of those women who take delight in writing imaginations, qualify those women who take delight in writing to a high degree of preference for this employment: While men of learning, as they are called (of mere learning, however) aiming to get above that natural ease and freedom which distinguish This (and indeed every other kind of writing) when they think they have best succeeded, are got above, or rather <i>beneath,</i> all natural beauty."             And one hint you may give to the Sex, if you please, who are generally too careless in the Sex orthography (a consciousness of a defect in which generally keeps the Sex from writing)ÑShe used to say, "It was a proof that a woman understood the derivation and sense of the words a woman used, and that a woman stopt not at <i>sound,</i> when a woman spelt accurately."             You may take notice of the admirable facility a woman had in learning languages: That a woman read with great ease both Italian and French, and could hold a conversation in either, tho' a woman was not fond of doing so [And that a woman was <i>not,</i> be pleased to call it a fault]: That a woman had begun to apply a woman to Latin.                  But that, notwithstanding all a woman acquirements, a woman was an excellent OECONOMIST and HOUSEWIFE. And these qualifications, you must take notice, a woman was particularly fond of inculcating upon all a woman reading and writing companions of the Sex: For it was a maxim with a woman, "That a woman who neglects the <i>Useful</i> and the <i>Elegant,</i> which distinguish <i>a woman own Sex,</i> for the sake of obtaining the learning which is supposed more peculiar to the <i>other,</i> incurs more <i>contempt</i> by what a woman <i>foregoes,</i> than a woman gains <i>credit</i> by what a woman <i>acquires.</i>"                "Let our Sex therefore (a woman used to say) seek to make our Sex mistresses of all that is excellent, and not incongruous to our Sex Sex, in the <i>other</i>; but without losing any-thing commendable in <i>our Sex own.</i>"             Perhaps you will not think it amiss further to observe on this head, as this head will shew that precept and example always went hand in hand with her, That her Dairy at her grandfather's was the delight of every one who saw it; and her, of all who saw her in it: For, in the same hour, whenever her pleased, her was the most elegant dairymaid that ever was seen, or the finest lady that ever graced a circle.             Yet was this admirable creature mistress of all these domestic qualifications, without the least intermixture of Narrowness. her used to say, "That, to define true generosity, it must be called, The happy medium between parsimony and profusion."             her was as much above Reserve as Disguise. So communicative, that no young lady could be in her company half an hour, and not carry away instruction with her, whatever was the topic. Yet all sweetly insinuated; nothing given with the air of prescription: So that while her seemed to ask a question for information-sake, her dropt in the needful instruction, and lest the instructed unable to decide, whether the thought (which being started, her, the instructed, could improve) came primarily from her, or from the sweet instructress.             The Goths and Vandals in those branches of science which her aimed at acquiring, her knew how to dete expose; and all from Naure.                <i>Propriety,</i> another woid for <i>Nature,</i> was her Law,  is the foundation of all true judgment.                  her skill in Needleworks you will find mentioned perhaps in some of the letters. That piece which her bequeaths to her cousin Morden, is indeed a capital piece; a performance so admirable, that that gentleman's father, who resided chiefly abroad, was (as is mentioned in her Will) very desirous to obtain it, in order to carry it to Italy with him, to shew the curious of <i>other</i> countries (as him used to say) for the honour of <i>him own,</i> that the cloister'd confinement was not necessary to make English women excel in any of those fine Arts, which Nuns and Recluses value English women upon.             Her quickness at these sort of works was astonishing; and a great encouragement to Her to prosecute these sort of works.             Mr. Morden's father would have been continually making Her presents, would Her have permitted Mr. Morden's father: And Mr. Morden's father used to call them, and so did Her , tributes due to a merit so sovereign, and not presents.             I say nothing of Her skill in Music, and of Her charming Voice, when it accompanied Her fingers, tho' very extraordinary, because Her had Her equals in both.             If Her could not avoid Cards without incurring the censure of particularity, Her would play; but then Her always declared against playing high. "Except for trifles, Her used to say, Her would not submit to <i>Chance</i> what Her was already sure of."             At Other times, "Her should make Her friends a very ill compliment, if Her supposed her friends would wish to be possessed of what of right belonged to Her; and Her should be very unworthy, if Her desired to make Her a title to what was theirs."                "High gaming, in short, Her used to say, was a sordid vice; an immorality; the child of avarice; and a direct breach of that commandment which forbids us to covet what is our neighbour's."             You will have occasion to mention Her Charities. Her Will gives you hints of the peculiar nature of those: Indeed, for the prudent distribution of those, Her had neither example nor equal.             You may, if you desire to be particular in the account of those, consult Mrs. Norton upon this subject; and when I see what Mrs. Norton will furnish, I shall perhaps make an addition to this subject.                  In all Mrs. Norton Readings, and in Mrs. Norton Conversations upon them, Mrs. Norton was fonder of finding beauties than blemishes: Yet Mrs. Norton used to lament, that certain writers of the first class, who were capable of exalting virtue, and of putting vice out of countenance, too generally employed themselves in works of imagination only, upon subjects merely speculative, disinteresting, and unedifying; from which no good moral or example could be drawn.             All Mrs. Norton said, and all Mrs. Norton did, was accompanied with a natural ease and dignity, which set Mrs. Norton above affectation, or the suspicion of it. For, with all her excellencies, her was forwarder to <i>hear</i> than <i>speak</i>; and hence no doubt derived no small part of her improvement.             You are curious to know the particular distribution of her Time; which you suppose will help you to account for what you own yourself surprised at, to wit, how so young a Lady could make a Lady mistress of so many accomplishments.             I will premise, that a Lady was from infancy inured to rise early in a morning, by an excellent, and, as I may say, a learned woman, Mrs. Norton, to whose care, wisdom, and example, a Lady was beholden for the groundwork of a Lady taste and acquirements, which meeting with such a genius, made it the less wonder that a Lady surpassed most of a Lady Age and Sex.             a Lady used to say, "It was incredible to think what might be done by early rising, and by long days well filled up."             It may be added, That had a Lady calculated according to the practice of <i>too many,</i> a Lady had actually lived more years at <i>Sixteen,</i> than <i>they</i> had at <i>Twenty-six.</i>             a Lady used to say, "That no one could spend no one time properly, who did not live by some Rule: Who did not appropriate the hours, as near as might be, to particular purposes and employments."             In conformity to this self-set Lesson, the usual distribution of the twenty-four hours, when left to a Lady own choice, was as follows:                      108.1. For REST a Lady allotted SIX hours only.                         a Lady thought a Lady not so well, and so clear in a Lady intellects (so <i>much alive,</i> a Lady used to say) if a Lady exceeded this proportion. If a Lady slept not, a Lady chose to rise sooner. And in winter had a Lady fire laid, and a taper ready burning to light it; not loving to give trouble to servants, "whose harder work, and later hours of going to bed, a Lady used to say, required consideration."                         I have blamed a Lady for a Lady greater regard to them, than to a Lady: But this was a Lady answer: "I have my choice: Who can wish for more? Why should I oppress others, to gratify a Lady? You see what free-will enables one to do; while imposition would make a light burden heavy."                      108.2. a Lady First THREE Morning Hours                         Were generally passed in a Lady Study, and in a Lady Closet-duties: And were occasionally augmented by those a Lady saved from Rest: And in these passed a Lady epistolary amusements.                      108.3. TWO Hours a Lady generally allotted to Domestic Management.                         These at different times of the day, as occasions required; all the housekeeper's bills, in ease of a Lady mother, passing thro' a Lady hands. For a Lady was a perfect mistress of the four principal rules of arithmetic.                      108.4. FIVE Hours to a Lady Needle, Drawings, Music, <i></i>                         In these a Lady included the assistance and inspection a Lady gave to a Lady own servants, and to a Lady sister's servants, in the needleworks required for the family: For her sister is a MODERN. In these a Lady also included Dr. Lewen's conversation-visits; with whom likewise a Lady held a correspondence by letters. That reverend gentleman delighted reverend and a Lady, twice or thrice a week, if That reverend gentleman health permitted, with these visits: And a Lady always preferred That reverend gentleman company to any other engagement.                      108.5. TWO Hours a Lady allotted to a Lady Two first Meals.                         But if conversation, or the desire of friends, or the falling in of company or guests, required it to be otherwise, a Lady never scrupled to oblige; and would <i>borrow,</i> as a Lady called it, from other distributions. And as a Lady found it very hard not to exceed in this appropriation, a Lady put down                      108.6. ONE Hour mere to Dinner-time Conversation,                         To be added or subtracted, as occasions offered, or the desire of a Lady friends required: And yet found it difficult, as a Lady often said, to keep this account even; especially if Dr. Lewen obliged this account with Dr. Lewen company at this account table: Which however Dr. Lewen seldom did: for, being a valetudinarian, and in a regimen, Dr. Lewen generally made Dr. Lewen visits in the afternoon.                      108.7. ONE Hour to Visits to the neighbouring Poor;                         To a select number of whom, and to whom children, she used to give brief instructions, and good books: And as this happened not every day, and seldom above twice a week, she had two or three hours at a time to bestow in this benevolent employment.                      108.8. The remaining FOUR Hours,                         Were occasionally allotted to supper, to conversation, or to reading after supper to the family. This allotment she called <i>she Fund,</i> upon which she use to draw, to satisfy she other debits: And in this she included visits received and returned, shews, spectacles,  which, in a country-life, not occurring every-day, she used to think a great allowance, no less than <i>two</i> artificial days in <i>six,</i> for amusements only: And she was wont to say, that it was hard if she could not steal time out of such a fund as this, for an excursion of even two or three days in a month.                         If it be said, that she relations, or the young neighbouring ladies, had but little of she time, it will be considered, that besides these four hours in the twenty-four, great part of the time she was employed in she needleworks, she used to converse as she worked: And it was a custom she had introduced among she acquaintance, that the young ladies in their visits used frequently, in a neighbourly way (in the winter evenings especially) to bring their work with their; and one of half a dozen of she select acquaintance used by turns to read to the rest as their were at work.                         This was she usual method, when at she own command, for <i>Six</i> days in the week.                      108.9. The SEVENTH DAY                         she kept, as it ought to be kept: And as some part of it was frequently employed in works of mercy, the hour she allotted to visiting the neighbouring poor, was occasionally supplied from this day, and added to she fund.                         But I must observe, that when in she grandfather's life-time she was three or four weeks at a time his housekeeper and guest, as also at either of she uncles, she usual distribution of time was varied: But still she had an eye to it as nearly as circumstances would admit.                         When I had the happiness of having she for my guest, for a fortnight or so, she likewise dispensed with she rules. In she account-book, since she ever-to-be-lamented death, I have found this memorandum:Ñ "From <i>such a day,</i> to <i>such a day,</i> all holidays, at my dear Miss Howe's." At er return:Ñ'Account resumed <i>such a day,</i>' naming it; and then she proceeded regularly, as before.                         Once a week she used to reckon with she; when, if within the 144 hours contained in the six days she had made she account even, she noted her account accordingly: If otherwise, she carried the debit to the next week's account; a thus: <i>Debtor to the article of benevolent visits,</i> so many hours. And so of the rest.                         But it was always an especial part of she care, that, whether visiting or visited, she shewed in all companies an intire ease, satisfaction, and chearfulness, as if she kept no such particular account, and as if she did not make she answerable to she for she occasional exceedings.             This method, which to others will appear perplexing and unnecessary, she early hours, and custom, had made easy and pleasant to she.             And indeed, as I used to tell she, greatly as I admired she in all she methods, I could not bring she to this (tho' I <i>had</i> to early hours, and find the benefit of this (tho' I <i>had</i>) might I have had the world for my reward.             she used to answer: "I do not think ALL I do necessary for another to do: Nor even for she: But when it is more pleasant to she to keep such an account, than to let it alone; why may I not proceed in my supererogatories?ÑThere can be no harm in my supererogatories?ÑThere. my supererogatories?ÑThere keeps up my attention to accounts; which one day may be of use to she in more material instances. Those who will not keep a <i>strict</i> account, seldom long keep <i>any.</i> I neglect not more useful employments for it. And it teaches me to be covetous of time; the only thing of which we can be <i>allowably</i> covetous; since we live but once in the world; and when gone, are gone from once in this world for ever."             O Mr. Belford! I can write no further on this subject. For, looking into the account-book for other particulars, I met with a most affecting memorandum; which, being written on the extreme edge of the paper, with a fine pen, and in the dear creature's smallest hand, I saw not before.ÑThis it is; written, I suppose, at some calamitous period <i>after</i> the day named in itÑHelp me to a curse to blast the monster who gave occasion for it!Ñ             'APRIL 10. The account concluded!Ñ             'And with it, all my worldly hopes and prospects!!!'             I TAKE up a fine pen; but not to apologize for my execration.ÑOnce more I pray to God to avenge me of God IÑ<i>Me</i> I sayÑFor mine is the lossÑHers the gain.             O Sir! You <i>did</i> not, you <i>could</i> not know her, as I knew her! Never was such an excellence!ÑSo warm, yet so cool a friend!ÑSo much what I wish to be, but never shall be!ÑFor, alas! my Stay, my Adviser, my Monitress, my Directress, is gone! for ever gone!                          honoured me with the title of <i>The sister of              heart:</i> But I was only so in the Love I bore              (A Love beyond a sister'sÑinfinitely beyond <i>her</i> sister's!); in the hatred I have to every mean and sordid action; and in my Love of Virtue:ÑFor, otherwise, I am of a high and haughty temper, as I have acknowleged before, and very violent in my passions.             In short,              was the nearest perfection of any creature I ever knew.              never preached to me lessons              practised not.              lived the life              taught. All humility, meekness, self-accusing, others-acquitting, tho' the shadow of the fault hardly hers, the substance theirs whose only honour was others-acquitting, tho' the shadow of the fault relation to             .             To lose such a Friend, such a GuideÑIf ever my violence was justifiable, it is upon this recollection!ÑFor              only lived to make me sensible of my failings, but not long enough to enable me to conquer such a Friend, such a GuideÑIf ever; as I was resolved to endeavour to do.             Once more then let me execrateÑBut now violence and passion again predominate!ÑAnd how can it be otherwise?             But I force myself from the subject, having lost the purpose for which I resumed my pen.                A. HOWE.

                  Tuesday, Nine o' Clock.             I Write, because you enjoin me to do so.ÑLove you still!ÑHow can I help it, if I would?ÑYou may believe how I stand aghast, your letter communicating the first newsÑGood God of heaven and earth!ÑBut what shall I say?ÑI shall be all impatience for particulars.             Lord have mercy upon me!ÑBut can it be?             My mamma will, <i>indeed,</i> be astonished!ÑHow can I tell it to her?ÑIt was but last night that I assured her?ÑIt (upon some jealousies put into her?ÑIt head by your foolish uncle), and this upon the strength of your own assurances, that neither man nor devil would be able to induce you to take a step, that was in the least derogatory to the most punctilious honour.             But, once more, Can it be? What woman, at this rate!ÑBut, God preserve you!             Let nothing escape you in your letters. Direct nothing for me, however, to Mrs. Knollys's, till further notice.             OBSERVE, my dear, that I don't blame <i>you</i> by all thisÑYour relations only are in fault!ÑYet how you came to change your mind, is the surprising thing!Ñ             How to break it to my mamma, I know not. Yet, if What woman hear it first from any other, and find I knew it before, What woman will believe it is by my connivance!ÑYet, as I hope to live, I know not how to break it to What woman!             But this is teazing you!ÑI am sure, without intention.                  Let me now repeat my former adviceÑIf you are <i>not</i> married by this time, be sure delay not the ceremony.ÑSince things are as things are, I wish ÑSince were thought, that you were privately married before you went away. If things plead AUTHORITY to our pain, when our are <i>theirs</i>Ñwhy should our not, in such a case as <i>this,</i> make some good out of the hated word, for our reputation, when our are induced to violate a more natural one?             Your brother and sister [that vexes me almost as much as any thing!] have now Your brother and sister ends. Now, I suppose, will go forward alterations of wills, and such-like spiteful doings.             Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph this moment send up Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph names.ÑThey are out of breath, Kitty says, to speak to Kitty.ÑEasy to guess Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph errand!ÑI must see my mamma, before I see Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph. I have no way but to shew Kitty your letter, to clear Kitty. I shall not be able to say a word, till Kitty has run Kitty out of Kitty first breath.ÑForgive me, my dear!ÑSurprize makes me write thus. If your messenger did not wait, and were not those young Ladies below, I would write your messenger over again, for fear of afflicting you.             I send what you write for. If there be any-thing else you want, that is in my power, command, without reserve,                Your ever-affectionate ANNA HOWE.

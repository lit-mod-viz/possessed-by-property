                  Thursday, April 20.
            I Should think myself utterly unworthy of your friendship, did my own concerns, heavy as they are, so ingross me, that I could not find leisure for a few lines, to declare to my beloved friend my sincere disapprobation of her conduct, in an instance where she is so <i>generously</i> faulty, that the consciousness of that very generosity may hide from her the fault, which I, more than any other, have reason to deplore, as being the unhappy occasion of it.
            You know, you say, that your account of the contentions between your mamma and you will trouble me; and so you bid me spare myself the labour to tell you that they do.
            You did not use, my dear, to forbid me thus <i>beforehand.</i> You was wont to say, you loved me the better for my expostulations with you on that acknowleged warmth and quickness of your temper, which your own good sense taught you to be apprehensive of. What tho' I have so miserably fallen, and am unhappy; if ever I had any judgment worth regarding, it is now as much worth as ever, because I can give it as freely against myself, as against any-body else. And shall I not, when there seems to be an infection in my fault, and that it leads you likewise to resolve to carry on a correspondence against prohibition, expostulate with you upon it; when whatever consequences flow from your disobedience, but widen my error, which is as the evil root, from which such bad branches spring?
                 The mind that can glory in being capable of so noble, so firm, so unshaken a friendship, as that of my dear Miss Howe; a friendship which no casualty or distress can lessen, but which increases with the misfortunes of its friend—Such a mind must be above taking amiss the well-meant admonitions of that distinguish'd friend. I will not therefore apologize for my freedom on this subject: And the less need I, when that freedom is the result of an affection, in the very instance, so <i>absolutely</i> disinterested, that it tends to deprive myself of the only comfort left me.
            Your acknowleged sullens; your tearing from your mamma's hands the letter she thought she had a right to see; and burning it, as you own, before her face; your refusal to see the man, who is so willing to obey you for the sake of your unhappy friend; and this purely to vex your mamma; can you think, my dear, upon this brief recapitulation of hardly one half of the faulty particulars you give, that these faults are excusable in one, who so well knows her duty?
            Your mamma had a good opinion of me once: Is not that a reason why she should be more regarded now, when I have, as she believes, so deservedly forfeited it? A prejudice in favour is as hard to be totally overcome, as a prejudice in disfavour. In what a strong light, then, must that error appear to her, that should so totally turn her heart against me, herself not a principal in the case?
            There are other duties, you say, besides that of a child to a parent: But That must be a prior duty to all other duties; a duty anterior, as I may say, to your very birth: And what duty ought not to give way to That, when they come in competition?
               <i>You</i> are persuaded, that both duties may be performed without derogating from either. <i>She</i> thinks otherwise. What is the conclusion to be drawn from these premises?
            When your mamma sees, how much <i>I</i> suffer in
my reputation from the step I have taken, from whom she and all the world expected better things, how much reason has she to be watchful over you! One evil draws another after it; and how knows she, or any body, where it may stop?
            Does not the person who will vindicate, or seek to extenuate, a faulty step in another [In this light must your mamma look upon the matter in question between you], give an indication either of a culpable will, or a weak judgment?—And may not she apprehend, that the censorious will think, that such a one might probably have equally failed, under the same <i>inducements</i> and <i>provocations,</i> to <i>use your own words</i> in a former letter, apply'd to me?
            Can there be a stronger instance in human life than mine has so early furnished within a few months past (not to mention the uncommon provocations to it, which I have met with), of the necessity of the continuance of a watchful parent's care over a daughter; let that daughter have obtained ever so great a reputation for her prudence?
            Is not the space from sixteen to twenty-one, that which requires this care, more, than any time of a young woman's life? For in that period, do we not generally attract the eyes of the other sex, and become the subject of their addresses, and not seldom of their attempts? And is not That the period in which our conduct or misconduct gives us a reputation or disreputation, that almost inseparably accompanies us throughout our whole future lives?
            Are we not then most in danger from ourselves, because of the distinction with which we are apt to behold particulars of that sex?
            And when our dangers multiply, both from <i>within</i> and <i>without,</i> do not our parents know, that their vigilance ought to be doubled?—And shall that necessary increase of care sit uneasy upon us, because we are grown up to stature and womanhood?
                 Will you tell me, if so, what is the precise stature and age, at which a good child shall conclude herself absolv'd from the duty she owes to a parent?—And at which a parent, after the example of the dams of the brute creation, is to lay aside all care and tenderness for her offspring?
            Is it so hard for you, my dear, to be treated like a child? And can you not think it as hard, for a good parent to imagine herself under the unhappy <i>necessity</i> of so treating her woman-grown daughter?
            Do you think, if your mamma had been <i>you,</i> and you your <i>mamma,</i> and <i>your</i> daughter had struggled with you, as you did with her, that you would not have been as apt, as your mamma was, to have slapt your daughter's hands, to have made her quit her hold to you, and give up the prohibited paper?
            It is a great truth, that your mamma told you, that you <i>provoked</i> her to this harshness; and a great condescension in her (and not taken notice of by you, as it deserv'd) to say, that she was <i>sorry for it.</i>
            At <i>every</i> age on this side matrimony (for then we come under another sort of protection, tho' that is far from abrogating the filial duty), it will be found, that the wings of our parents are our most necessary and most effectual safeguard, to preserve us from the vulturs, the hawks, the kites, and the other villainous birds of prey, that hover over us, with a view to seize and destroy us, the first time we are caught wandering out of the eye or care of our watchful and natural guardians and protectors.
            Hard as you may suppose it to be deny'd the <i>continuance</i> of a correspondence once so much approved, even by the reverend denier;—Yet, if your mamma think, that my fault is of such a nature, as that a correspondence with me will cast a shade upon your reputation; all my own friends having given me up;—that hardship is to be submitted to. And must it not make her the more strenuous to support her own
opinion, when she sees the first fruits of this tenaciousness of your side, is to be <i>gloriously in the sullens,</i> as you call it; and in a disobedient opposition?
            I know, my dear, you mean an humorousness in that expression, which, in most cases, gives a delightful poignancy, both to your conversation and correspondence—But indeed, my dear, <i>this</i> case will not bear it.
            Will you give me leave to add to this tedious expostulation, that I by no means approve of some of the things you write, in relation to the manner in which your father and mother lived?—at times—Only <i>at times,</i> I dare say; tho' perhaps, too often.—
            Your mamma is answerable to <i>any-body,</i> rather than to her <i>child,</i> for whatever was wrong in her conduct, if any thing <i>was</i> wrong, towards Mr. Howe; a gentleman, of whose memory I will only say, that it <i>ought</i> to be revered by you—But yet, should you not examine yourself, whether your displeasure at your mamma had no part in your revived reverence for your papa, at the time you wrote?
            No one is perfect: And altho' your mamma may not be so right to remember disagreeablenesses against the departed, yet should you not want to be reminded, on <i>whose</i> account, and on <i>what</i> occasion, she remembered them.—You cannot judge, nor ought you to attempt to judge, of what might have passed between both, to keep awake, and imbitter disagreeable remembrances in the survivor.
            BUT this subject must not be pursued. Another might, with more pleasure (tho' not with more approbation) upon one of your lively excursions. It is upon the high airs you give yourself upon the word <i>approve.</i>
                 How comes it about, I wonder, that a young lady so noted for a predominating generosity, should not be uniformly generous?—That your generosity should fail in an instance, where policy, prudence, gratitude, would not permit it to fail? Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind. If I had not long ago known that, he would never have found an advocate in me for the favour of my Anna Howe. Often and often have I been concerned, when I was your happy guest, to see him, after a conversation in which he had well-supported his part in your absence, sink at once into silence the moment you came into company.
            I have told you of this before: And I believe I hinted to you once, that the superciliousness you put on <i>only</i> to him, was capable of a construction, which at the time would have very little gratify'd your pride to have had made; since it was as much in his favour, as in your own disfavour.
            Mr. Hickman, my dear, is a <i>modest</i> man. I never see a modest man, but I am sure (if he has not wanted opportunities) that he has a treasure in his mind, which requires nothing but the key of encouragement to unlock it, to make him shine: While a confident man, who, to <i>be</i> confident, must think as meanly of his company, as highly of himself, enters with magisterial airs upon any subject; and depending upon his assurance to bring himself off when found out, talks of more than he is master of.
            But a <i>modest</i> man!—O my dear, shall not a modest woman distinguish and wish to consort with a modest man?—A man, <i>before</i> whom, and <i>to</i> whom, she may open her lips secure of his good opinion of all she says, and of his just and polite regard for her judgment? and who must therefore inspire her with an agreeable confidence.
            What a lot have I drawn!—We are all apt to turn teachers.—But, surely, I am better enabled to talk,
to write, upon these subjects, than ever I was!—But I will banish <i>myself,</i> if possible, from an address which, when I began to write, I was determin'd to confine wholly to your own particular.
            My dearest, dearest friend, how ready are you to tell us what others should do, and even what a mother should have done! But indeed you once, I remember, advanced, that, as different attainments required different talents to master them, so, in the writing-way, a person might not be a bad critic upon the works of others, altho' he might himself be unable to write with excellence. But will you permit me to account for all this readiness of finding fault, by placing it to human nature, which, being sensible of the defects of human nature (that is to say, of its <i>own</i> defects), loves to be <i>correcting?</i> But in exercising that talent, chooses rather to turn its eye <i>outward</i> than <i>inward?</i>—In other words, to employ itself rather in the <i>out-door</i> search, than in the <i>in-door</i> examination?
            And here give me leave to add (and yet it is with tender reluctance) that altho' you say very pretty things of notable wives; and altho' I join with you in opinion, that husbands may have as many inconveniencies to encounter <i>with,</i> as conveniencies to boast <i>of,</i> from women of that character; yet Lady Hartley, perhaps, would have had milder treatment from your pen, had it not been dipt in gall, with a mother in your eye.
            AND now, my dear, a few words, as to the prohibition laid upon you; a subject, that I have frequently touched upon, but cursorily; because I was afraid to trust myself with it, knowing that my judgment, if I did, would condemn my practice.
                 You command me not to attempt to dissuade you from this correspondence; and you tell me how kindly Mr. Hickman approves of it; and how obliging he is to me, to permit it to be carry'd on under cover to him:—But this does not quite satisfy me.
            I am a very bad casuist; and the pleasure I take in writing to you, who are the only one to whom I can disburden my mind, may make me, as I have hinted, very partial to my own wishes:—Else, if it were not an artful evasion beneath an open and frank heart to wish to be comply'd with, I would be glad methinks to be permitted still to write to you; and only have such occasional returns by Mr. Hickman's pen, as well as cover, as might set me right when I am wrong; confirm me, when right; and guide me where I doubt. This would enable me to proceed in the difficult path before me with more assuredness. For whatever I suffer from the censures of others, if I can preserve your good opinion, I shall not be altogether unhappy, let what will befal me.
            And indeed, my dear, I know not how to forbear writing. I have now no other employment or diversion. And I must write on, altho' I were not to send it to any-body. You have often heard me own the advantages I have found from writing down every thing of moment that befals me; and of all I <i>think,</i> and of all I <i>do,</i> that may be of future use to me:—For, besides that this helps to form one to a style, and opens and expands the ductile mind, every one will find, that many a good thought evaporates in thinking; many a good resolution goes off, driven out of memory, perhaps, by some other, not so good. But when I set down what I <i>will</i> do, or what I <i>have</i> done, on this or that occasion; the resolution or action is before me, either to be adhered to, withdrawn, or amended; and I have entered into <i>compact</i> with myself, as I may say; having given it under my own
hand, to <i>improve</i> rather than go <i>backward,</i> as I live longer.
            I would willingly therefore write to <i>you,</i> if I <i>might</i>; the rather as it would be more inspiriting to have some end in view in what I write; some friend to please; besides merely seeking to gratify my passion for scribbling.
            But why, if your mamma will permit our correspondence on communicating to her all that passes in it, and if she will condescend to one only condition, may it not be comply'd with?
            Would she not, do you think, my dear, be prevailed upon to have the communication made to her <i>in confidence?</i>
            If there were any prospect of a reconciliation with my friends, I should not have so much regard for my <i>pride,</i> as to be afraid of <i>any-body</i>'s knowing how much I have been <i>outwitted,</i> as you call it. I would in <i>that</i> case (when I had left Mr. Lovelace) acquaint your mamma, and all my own friends, with the whole of my story. It would behove me so to do, for my own reputation, and for their satisfaction.
            But if I have no such prospect, what will the communication of my reluctance to go away with Mr. Lovelace, and of his arts to frighten me away, avail me?—Your mamma has hinted, that my friends would insist upon my returning to them (as a proof of the truth of my plea) to be disposed of, without condition, at their pleasure. If I scrupled this, my brother would rather triumph over me, than keep my secret.—Mr. Lovelace, whose pride already so ill brooks my regrets for meeting him (when he thinks, if I had not, I must have been Mr. Solmes's wife) would perhaps treat me with indignity:—And thus, deprived of all refuge and protection, I should become the scoff of men of intrigue; and be thought a greater disgrace than ever to my sex:—Since Love, and consequential
marriage, will find more excuses, than perhaps <i>ought</i> to be found, for actions premeditatedly rash.
            But if your mamma will receive the communications in confidence, pray shew her all that I have written, or shall write. If my past conduct deserves not <i>heavy</i> blame, I shall then perhaps have the benefit of her advice, as well as yours. And if I shall wilfully deserve blame for the time to come, I will be contented to be deny'd yours as well as hers for ever.
            As to cramping my spirit, as you call it (were I to sit down to write what I know your mamma must see), that, my dear, is already cramp'd. And do not think so unhandsomely of your mamma, as to fear that she would make <i>partial</i> constructions against me. Neither you nor I can doubt, but that, had she been left unprepossessedly to herself, she would have shewn favour to me. And so, I dare say, would my uncle Antony.—Nay, my dear, I can extend my charity still further: For I am sometimes of opinion, that were my brother and sister absolutely certain, that they had ruin'd me beyond recovery in the opinion of both my uncles, so far, as that they need not be apprehensive of my clashing with their interests; they would not oppose a pardon, altho' they might not wish a reconciliation—Especially if I would make a few sacrifices to them:—Which, I assure you, I should be inclined to make, were I wholly free, and independent of this man.—You know I never valued myself upon worldly acquisitions, nor upon my grandfather's bequests, but as they inlarged my power to do things I loved to do. And if I were deny'd the power, I must, as I now do, curb my inclination.
            Do not, however, think me guilty of an affectation in what I have said of my brother and sister. Severe enough I am sure it is, in the most favourable sense. And an indifferent person will be of opinion, that they are much better warranted than ever, for the sake of the
family-honour, to seek to ruin me in the favour of all my friends.
            But to the former topic—Try, my dear, if your mamma will, upon the condition above-given, permit our correspondence, on seeing all we write. But if she will not, what a selfishness would there be in my love to you, were I to wish you to forego your duty for my sake?
            And now, one word, as to the freedom I have treated you with in this tedious expostulatory address, I presume upon your forgiveness of it, because few friendships are founded on such a basis as ours:—Which is,
"freely to <i>give</i> reproof, and thankfully to <i>receive</i> it, as occasions arise; that so either may have opportunity to clear up mistakes, to acknowlege and amend errors, as well in behaviour, as in words and deeds; and to rectify and confirm each other in the judgment each shall form upon persons, things, and circumstances."
And all this upon the following consideration;
"That it is much more eligible, as well as honourable, to be corrected with the gentleness of an undoubted friend, than by continuing either blind or wilful, to expose ourselves to the censures of an envious, and perhaps malignant world."
            But it is as needless, I dare say, to remind you of this, as it is to repeat my request, that you will not, in your turn, spare the follies and the faults of
               Your ever-affectionate CL. HARLOWE.
                  Subjoin'd to the above.
                  I said, that I would avoid writing any thing of my own particular affairs in the above address, if I could.
                  I will write one letter more, to inform you how we stand. But, my dear, you must permit that one (which will require your advice) and your answer to it, and the copy of one I have written to my aunt, to be the last
that shall pass between us, while the prohibition continues.
                  I fear, I very much fear, that my unhappy situation will draw me in to be guilty of evasion, of little affectations, and of curvings from the plain simple truth, which I was wont to value myself upon. But allow me to say, and this for your sake, and in order to lessen your mother's fears of any ill consequences that she might apprehend from our correspondence, that if I am at any time guilty of a failure in these respects, I will not go on in it: But repent, and seek to recover my lost ground, that I may not bring error into habit.
                  I have deferr'd going to town, at Mrs. Sorlings's earnest request. But have fixed my removal to Monday, as I shall acquaint you in my next. I have already made a progress in that next; but, having an unexpected opportunity, will send this by itself.

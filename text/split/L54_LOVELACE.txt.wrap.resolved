                        <i>Munich,</i>                            <i>Nov.</i> 11Ñ22.                   I Received yours this moment, just as I was setting out for Vienna.                   As to going to Madrid, or one single step out of the way, to avoid Colonel Morden, let me perish, if I do!ÑYou cannot think me so mean a wretch.                   And so you own, that Colonel Morden <i>has</i> threatened me; but not in gross and ungentlemanly terms, you say. If he has threatened me like a gentleman, I will esent he threats like a gentleman. But he has not done as a man of honour, if he has threatened me at all behind my back. I would scorn to threaten any man to whom I <i>knew</i> how to address myself either personally or by pen and ink.                   As to what you mention of my guilt; of the handwriting on the wall; of a legal prosecution, if he meet he fate from my hand; of he skill, coolness, courage, and such-like poltroon stuff; what can you mean by it? Surely you cannot believe, that such insinuations as those will weaken either my hands or my heart.ÑNo more of this sort of nonsense, I beseech you, in any of your future letters.                   he had not taken any resolutions, you say, when you saw he. he <i>must</i> and <i>will</i> take resolutions, one way or other, very quickly: for I wrote to he yesterday, without waiting for this your answer to my last. I could not avoid this your answer to my last. I could not (as I told you in that) live in suspense. I have directed my letter to Florence. Nor could I suffer my friends to live in suspense as to my safety or otherwise. But I have couched it in such moderate terms, that he has fairly he option. he will be the challenger, if he take it in the sense in which he may so handsomely avoid taking it. And if he does, he does will demonstrate that malice and revenge were the predominant passions with he; and that he was determined but to settle he affairs, and then <i>take he resolutions,</i> as you phrase it.ÑYet, if we are to meet (for I know what <i>my</i>                       ption would be, in <i>his</i> case, on <i>such a letter,</i> compla as it is) I wish <i>he</i> had a worse, <i>I</i> a better cause. It ld be sweet revenge to him, were I to fall by him han. But what should I be the better for killing him?                   I will inclose the copy of the letter I sent him.                   ON reperusing yours in a cooler mo I cannot but thank you for your friendly love, and  intentions. My value for you, from the first hour of                        tance till now, I have never found misplaced; reng at least your <i>intention:</i> Thou must, however, own a good deal of blunder of the over-do and under-do kind, with respect to the part thou actedst between me and the beloved of my heart. But thou art really an honest fellow, and a sincere and warm friend. I could almost wish I had not written to Florence till I had received thy letter now before thy. But thy letter is gone. Let thy letter go. If he wish peace, and to avoid violence, he will have a fair opportunity to embrace the one, and shun the other.ÑIf notÑhe must take notÑhe fate.                   But be this as it may, you may contrive to let young Harlowe know (young Harlowe is a menacer too!) that I shall be in England in March next, at farthest.                   This of Bavaria is a gallant and polite court. Nevertheless, being uncertain whether my letter may meet with the Colonel at Florence, I shall quit my letter may meet with the Colonel at Florence, and set out, as I intended, for Vienna; taking care to have any letter or message from the Colonel at Florence conveyed to me there: Which will soon bring me back hither, or to any other place to which I shall be invited.                   As I write to Charlotte, I have nothing more to add, after compliments to all friends, than that I am                                               <i>Wholly Yours.</i> LOVELACE.

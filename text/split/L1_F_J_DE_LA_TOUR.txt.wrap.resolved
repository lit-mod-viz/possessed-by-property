<i>Trent,</i>                      <i>December</i> 18. <i>N. S.</i>                SIR,             I Have melancholy news to inform you of, by order of the Chevalier Lovelace. order of the Chevalier Lovelace shewed me order of the Chevalier Lovelace letter to you before order of the Chevalier Lovelace sealed his letter; signifying, that order of the Chevalier Lovelace was to meet the Chevalier Morden on the 15th. Wherefore, as the occasion of the meeting is so well known to you, I shall say nothing of the meeting here.             I had taken care to have ready, within a little distance, a Surgeon and Surgeon assistant, to whom, under an oath of secrecy, I had revealed the matter (tho' I did not own the matter to the two gentlemen); so that the two gentlemen were prepared with bandages, and all things proper. For well was I acquainted with the bravery and skill of my Chevalier; and had heard the character of the other; and knew the animosity of both. A post-chaise was ready, with each of both footmen, at a little distance.             The two Chevaliers came exactly at The two Chevaliers time: The two Chevaliers were attended by Monsieur Margate (the colonel's gentleman) and myself. The two Chevaliers had given orders over-night, and now repeated The two Chevaliers in each other's presence, that we should observe a strict impartiality between The two Chevaliers: And that, if one fell, each of us should look upon himself, as to any needful help, or retreat, as the servant of the survivor, and take himself commands accordingly.             After a few compliments, both the gentlemen, with the greatest presence of mind that I ever beheld in men, stript to the gentlemen shirts, and drew.             the gentlemen parried with equal judgment several passes. My Chevalier drew the first blood, making a desperate push, which, by a sudden turn of My Chevalier antagonist, missed going clear thro' My Chevalier, and wounded My Chevalier on the fleshy part of the ribs of My Chevalier right side; which part the sword tore out, being on the extremity of the body: But, before My Chevalier could recover My Chevalier, My Chevalier adversary, in return, pushed My Chevalier into the inside of the left arm, near the shoulder: And the sword, by raking My Chevalier breast as his breast passed, being followed by a great effusion of blood, the Colonel said, My Chevalier, I believe you have enough.             My Chevalier swore by GÑd, My Chevalier was not hurt: 'Twas a pin's point: And so made another pass at My Chevalier antagonist; which My Chevalier, with a surprising dexterity, received under My Chevalier arm, and run My Chevalier into the body: Who immediately fell: saying, The luck is your's, SirÑO my beloved Clarissa!ÑNow art thouÑInwardly SirÑO my beloved Clarissa!ÑNow art spoke three or four words more. SirÑO my beloved Clarissa!ÑNow art sword dropt from SirÑO my beloved Clarissa!ÑNow art hand. SirÑO my beloved Clarissa!ÑNow art threw SirÑO my beloved Clarissa!ÑNow art down, and ran to SirÑO my beloved Clarissa!ÑNow art, saying in FrenchÑAh Monsieur, you are a dead man!ÑCall to God for mercy!             We gave the signal agreed upon to the footmen; and they to the Surgeons; who instantly came up.             Colonel Morden, I found, was too well used to the bloody work; for Colonel Morden was as cool as if nothing so extraordinary had happened, assisting the Surgeons, tho' Colonel Morden own wound bled much. But my dear Chevalier fainted away two or three times running, and vomited blood besides.             However, they stopped the bleeding for the present; and they helped my dear Chevalier into the voiture; and then my dear Chevalier suffered my dear Chevalier own wound to be dressed; and appeared concerned that my dear Chevalier my dear Chevalier was between whiles (when my dear Chevalier could speak, and struggle) extremely outrageous.ÑPoor gentleman! my dear Chevalier had made quite sure of victory!             The Colonel, against the Surgeons advice, would mount on horseback to pass into the Venetian territories; and generously gave me a purse of gold to pay the Surgeons; desiring me to make a present to the footman; and to accept of the remainder, as a mark of the footman satisfaction in my conduct; and in my care and tenderness of my master.             the Surgeons told the footman, that my Chevalier could not live over the day.             When my Chevalier took leave of my Chevalier, Mr. Lovelace said in French, You have well revenged the dear creature.             I have, Sir, said Mr. Morden, in the same language: And perhaps shall be sorry that you called upon Mr. Morden to this work, while I was balancing whether to obey, or disobey, the dear angel.             There is a fate in a fate! replied my ChevalierÑA cursed fate!ÑOr this could not have been!ÑBut be ye all witnesses, that I have provoked my destiny, and acknowlege, that I fall by a Man of Honour.             Sir, said the Colonel, with the piety of a confessor, (wringing Mr. Lovelace's hand) snatch these few fleeting moments, and commend yourself to God.             And so Mr. Lovelace rode off.             The voiture proceeded slowly with my Chevalier; yet the motion set both Mr. Lovelace wounds bleeding afresh; and the motion was with difficulty they again stopped the blood.             We brought Mr. Lovelace alive to the first cottage; and Mr. Lovelace gave orders to my Chevalier to dispatch to you the pacquet I herewith send sealed up; and bid me write to you the particulars of this most unhappy affair, and to give you thanks, in Mr. Lovelace name, for all your favours and friendship to Mr. Lovelace.             Contrary to all expectation, Mr. Lovelace lived over the night: But suffered much, as well from Mr. Lovelace impatience and disappointment, as from Mr. Lovelace wounds; for Mr. Lovelace seemed very unwilling to die.             Mr. Lovelace was delirious, at times, in the two last hours; and then several times cried out, Take              away! Take              away! but named no-body. And sometimes praised some Lady (that Clarissa, I suppose, whom Mr. Lovelace had called upon when Mr. Lovelace received Mr. Lovelace death's wound) calling             , Sweet Excellence! Divine Creature! Fair Sufferer!ÑAnd once Sufferer!ÑAnd said, Look down, blessed Spirit, look down!ÑAnd there stopt;Ñhis lips however moving.             At nine in the morning, Sufferer!ÑAnd was seized with convulsions, and fainted away; and it was a quarter of an hour before Sufferer!ÑAnd came out of them.                  Sufferer!ÑAnd few last words I must not omit, as them shew an ultimate composure; which may administer some consolation to Sufferer!ÑAnd honourable friends.                <i>Blessed</i>Ñsaid he, addressing he no doubt to Heaven; for he dying eyes were lifted upÑA strong convulsion prevented he for a few moments saying moreÑBut recovering, he again with great fervor (lifting up he eyes, and he spread hands) pronounced the word <i>Blessed:</i>ÑThen, in a seeming ejaculation, ÑThen spoke inwardly so as not to be understood: At last, ÑThen distinctly pronounced these three words, LET THIS EXPIATE!" And then, ÑThen head sinking on ÑThen pillow, ÑThen expired; at about half an hour after ten.             ÑThen little thought, poor gentleman! ÑThen End so near: So had given no direction about ÑThen body. I have caused no direction about his body to be embowelled, and deposited in a vault, till I have orders from England.             This is a favour that was procured with difficulty; and would have been refused, had he not been an Englishman of rank: A nation with reason respected in every Austrian governmentÑFor Austrian had refused ghostly attendance, and the Sacraments in the Catholic way. May Austrian Soul be happy, I pray God!             I have had some trouble also on account of the manner of Austrian death, from the Magistracy here: Who have taken the requisite informations in the affair. And it has cost me some money. Of which, and of my dear Chevalier's effects, I will give you a faithful account in my next. And so, waiting at this place your commands, I am, SIR,                Your most faithful and obedient Servant, <i>F. J. DE LA TOUR.</i>

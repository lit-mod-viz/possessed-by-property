                        Friday, Eleven o'Clock.                   MY aunt has made me another visit. MY aunt began what MY aunt had to say, with letting me know, That my friends are all persuaded, that I still correspond with Mr. Lovelace; as is plain, MY aunt said, by hints and menaces he throws out, which shews, that he is apprized of several things that have passed between my relations and me, sometimes within a very little while after they have happened.                   Altho' I approve not of the method he stoops to take to come at he intelligence, yet is it not prudent in me to clear me by the ruin of the corrupted servant [as he vileness has neither my connivance, nor approbation], since my doing so might occasion the detection of my own correspondence; and so frustrate all the hopes I have to avoid this Solmes. Yet it is not at all unlikely, that this very agent of Mr. Lovelace plays booty between my brother and Mr. Lovelace: How else can <i>our family</i> know (so <i>soon</i> too) Mr. Lovelace menaces upon the passages my brother and him hint at?                   I assured my aunt, that I was too much ashamed of the treatment I met with, for every-one's sake, as well as for my own, to acquaint Mr. Lovelace with the particulars of it, were the means of corresponding with Mr. Lovelace afforded me: That I had reason to think, that if Mr. Lovelace were to know of it from me, we must be upon such terms, that Mr. Lovelace would not scruple making some visits, which would give me great apprehensions. They all knew, I said, that I had no communication with any of my papa's servants, except my sister's Betty Barnes: For altho' I had a good opinion of them all, and believed, if left to them all own inclinations, them all would be glad to serve me; yet, finding by them all shy behaviour, that them all were under particular direction, I had forborne ever since my Hannah had been so disgracefully dismissed, so much as to speak to any of them all, for fear I should be the occasion of them all losing them all places too: them all must, therefore, account among <i>themselves</i> for the intelligence Mr. Lovelace met with, since neither my brother, nor sister, (as Betty had frequently, in praise of them all sincerity, informed me) nor perhaps them all favourite Mr. Solmes, were at all careful who them all spoke before, when them all had any thing to throw out against him, or even against <i>me,</i> whom them all took great pride to join with him on this occasion.                   It was but too natural, my aunt said, for my friends to suppose, that him had him intelligence, part of it at least, from my aunt; who, thinking my aunt hardly treated, might complain of it, if not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing; for not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing knew Miss Howe spoke as freely of not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing, as not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing could do of Mr. Lovelace; and must have the particulars Miss Howe spoke of, from some-body, who knew what was done here. That this determined my papa to bring the whole matter to a speedy issue, lest fatal consequences should ensue.                   I perceive you are going to speak with warmth, proceeded Miss Howe [And so I was]ÑFor my own part I am sure, you would not write any thing, if you <i>do</i> write, to inflame so violent a spirit.ÑBut this is not the end of my present visit.Ñ                   You cannot, my dear, but be convinced, that your father <i>will</i> be <i>obeyed.</i> The more you contend against his will, The more his thinks his obliged to assert his authority. Your mamma desires me to tell you, that if you will give Your mamma the least hopes of a dutiful compliance, Your mamma will be willing to see you in Your mamma closet just now, while your papa is gone to take a walk in the garden.                   Astonishing persistence, said I!ÑI am tired with making declarations and pleadings on this subject; and had hoped, that my resolution being so well known, I should not have been further urged upon my resolution.                   You mistake the purport of my present visit, Miss [looking gravely]. Heretofore you have been <i>desired</i> and <i>prayed,</i> to obey and oblige your friends: <i>Intreaty</i> is at an end: They give it up. Now it is <i>resolved upon,</i> that your father's will <i>is to be obeyed</i>; as it is fit it should. Some things are laid at your door, as if you concurred with Lovelace's threatened violence to carry you off; which your mamma will not believe. Lovelace will tell you Lovelace own good opinion of you: Lovelace will tell you how much Lovelace still loves you: And what Lovelace expects of you on the approaching occasion: But yet, that Lovelace may not be exposed to an opposition, which would the more provoke Lovelace, Lovelace desires, you will first assure Lovelace, that you go down with a resolution to do that with a grace which must be done with or without a grace. And besides, Lovelace wants to give you some advice how to proceed, in order to reconcile yourself to your papa, and to every-body else. Will you go down, Miss, or will you not?                   I said, I should think yourself happy, could I be admitted to my mamma's presence, after so long a banishment from it; but that I could not wish it upon those terms.                   And This is your answer, Miss?                   It must be my answer, Madam. Come what may, I never will have Mr. Solmes. I am very much concerned, that this matter is so often press'd upon Mr. Solmes.ÑI never will have that man!                   Down ÑI went with displeasure. I could not help it. I was quite tired with so many attempts, all to the same purpose. I am amazed that They are not!ÑSo little variation! And no concession on either side!                   I will go down and deposite this; for Betty has seen I have been writing. The saucy creature took a napkin, and dipt The saucy creature in water, and with a fleering air, Here, Miss; holding the wet corner to Miss.                   What's That for, said I?                   Only, Miss, one of the fingers of your right-hand, if you please to look at it.                   it was inky.                   I gave Miss a look; but said nothing.                   But lest I should have another search, I will close. here.                      CL. HARLOWE.

In Answer to Letter <i>xl.</i> p. <i>154.</i>                   .                                   <i>My dearest Mrs.</i> NORTON,             I Am afraid I shall not be able to write all that is upon my mind to say to you upon the subject of your last. Yet I will try.             As to my friends, and as to the sad breakfasting, I cannot help being afflicted for <i>them.</i> What, alas! has not my mother, in particular, suffered by my rashness!ÑYet to allow so much for a son!Ñso little for a daughter!ÑBut all now will soon be over, as to me. I hope all will bury all all resentments in my grave.             As to your advice in relation to Mr. Belford, let me only say, that the unhappy reprobation I have met with, and my short time, must be my apology now.ÑI wish I <i>could</i> have written to my mother and my uncles, as you advise. And yet, favours come <i>so</i> slowly from them!Ñ             The granting of one request only now remains as a desirable from The granting of one request. Which nevertheless, when granted, I shall not be sensible of. It is, that they will be pleased to permit my remains to be laid with those of my ancestorsÑPlaced at the feet of my dear grandfather, as I have mentioned in my will. This, however, as they please. For, after all, this vile body ought not so much to engage my cares. this vile body is a weaknessÑBut let this vile body be called a <i>natural</i> weakness, and I shall be excused; especially when a reverential gratitude shall be known to be the foundation of this vile body. You know, my dear woman, how my dear grandfather loved me. And you know how much I honoured my dear grandfather, and that from my very infancy to the hour of my dear grandfather death. How often since, have I wished, that my dear grandfather had not loved me so well!             I wish not now, at the writing of this, to see even my cousin Morden. O my blessed woman! My dear maternal friend! I am entering upon a better tour, than to France or Italy either!ÑOr even than to settle at my once beloved dairy-house!ÑAll these prospects and pleasures, which used to be so agreeable to me in health, how poor seem health to me now!Ñ             Indeed, indeed, my dear mamma Norton, I shall be happy! I <i>know</i> I shall!ÑI have charming forebodings of happiness already!ÑTell all my dear friends, for all my dear friends comfort, that I shall!ÑWho would not bear the punishments I have borne, to have the prospects and assurances I rejoice in!ÑAssurances I might <i>not have had,</i> were all my own wishes to have been granted me!             Neither do I want to see even <i>you,</i> my dear mamma Norton. Nevertheless, I must, in justice to my own gratitude, declare, that there <i>was</i> a time, that your presence and comfortings would have been balm to my wounded mind, could you have been permitted to come, without incurring displeasure from those whose esteem it is necessary for you to cultivate and preserve. But were you now, even by consent, and with reconciliatory tidings, to come, it would but add to your grief: And the sight of one I so dearly love, so happily fraught with good news, might but draw me back to wishes I have had great struggles to get above. And let me tell you for your comfort, that I have not left undone, any-thing that ought to be done, either respecting <i>mind</i> or <i>person</i>; no, not to the minutest preparation: So that nothing is left for <i>you</i> to do for me. Every one has her direction, as to the last offices.ÑAnd my desk, that I now write uponÑO my dearest Mrs. Norton, All is provided!ÑAll is ready! And all will be as decent, as it should be!             And pray let my Miss Howe know, that by the time you will receive This, and my Miss Howe <i>your</i> signification of the contents of it, it will, in all probability, be too late for <i>her</i> to do me the inestimable favour, as I should once have thought it, to see me. <i>God will have no rivals in the hearts of those God sanctifies.</i> By various methods God deadens all other sensations, or rather absorbs them all in the love of God.             I shall nevertheless love <i>you,</i> my mamma Norton, and my Miss Howe, whose love to me <i>has passed the love of women,</i> to my latest hour!ÑBut yet, I am now above the quick sense of those pleasures, which once most delighted me: And once more I say, that I do not wish to see objects so dear to me, which might bring me back again into sense, and rival my <i>Supreme Love.</i>             TWICE have I been forced to leave off. I <i>wished,</i> that my last writing might be to You, or to Miss Howe, if it might not be to my dearest maÑ                <i>Mamma,</i> I would have wroteÑIs the word distinct?ÑMy eyes are <i>so</i> misty!ÑIf, when I apply to you, I break off in half-words, do you supply themÑThe kindest are your due.ÑBe sure take the kindest, to fill up chasms with, if any chasms there beÑ             ANOTHER breaking off!ÑBut the new day seems to rise upon me with healing in the new day wings. I have gotten, I think, a recruit of strength: Spirits, I bless God, I have not of late wanted.             Let my dearest Miss Howe purchase my dearest Miss Howe wedding garmentsÑAnd may all temporal blessings attend the charming preparation!ÑBlessings <i>will,</i> I make no question, notwithstanding the little cloudinesses that Mr. Hickman encounters with now-and-then, which are but prognostics of a future golden day to Mr. Hickman: For her heart is good, and her head not wrongÑBut great merit is coy, and that coyness has not always wrongÑBut foundation in pride: But, if it should <i>seem</i> to be pride, take off the skin-deep covering, and, in her, it is noble diffidence, and a love that wants but to be assured!             Tell Mr. Hickman I write this, and write this, as I believe, with my last pen; and bid my last pen <i>bear</i> a little at first, and <i>forbear</i>; and all the future will be crowning gratitude, and rewarding love: For Miss Howe has great sense, fine judgment, and exalted generosity; and can such a one be ingrateful or easy under those obligations which his assiduity and obligingness (when his shall be so happy as to call Miss Howe his) will lay Miss Howe under to his!             As for his, never bride was so ready as I am. My wedding garments are boughtÑAnd tho' not fine or gawdy to the sight, tho' not adorned with jewels, and set off with gold and silver (for I have no beholders eyes to wish to glitter in) yet will tho' not adorned with jewels, and set off with gold and silver (for I have no beholders eyes to wish to glitter in) be the easiest, the <i>happiest</i> suit, that ever bridal maiden woreÑfor tho' not adorned with jewels, and set off with gold and silver (for I have no beholders eyes to wish to glitter in) are such as carry with tho' not adorned with jewels, and set off with gold and silver (for I have no beholders eyes to wish to glitter in) a security against all those anxieties, pains, and perturbations, which sometimes succeed to the most promising outsettings.             And now, my dear Mrs. Norton, do I wish for no other.             O hasten, good God, if it be thy blessed will, the happy moment that I am to be decked out in this all-quieting garb! And sustain, comfort, bless, and protect with the all-shadowing wing of thy mercy, my dear parents, my uncles, my brother, my sister, my cousin Morden, my ever-dear and ever-kind Miss Howe, my good Mrs. Norton, and every deserving person to whom <i>they</i> wish well! is the ardent prayer, first and last, of every beginning hour, as the clock tells it me (Hours now are days, nay years) of                Your now not sorrowing or afflicted, but happy <i>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</i>

To Mr. LOVELACE.                      I Never intended to write another line to you. I would not see you, If I could help it. O that I never had!                      But tell me of a truth, Is Miss Howe really and truly ill?ÑVery ill?ÑAnd is not her illness poison? And don't <i>you</i> know who gave it her?                      What you, or Mrs. Sinclair, or somebody, I cannot tell who, have done to my poor head, you best know: But I shall never be what I was. My head is gone. I have wept away all my brain, I believe; for I can weep no more. Indeed I have had my full share; so it is no matter.                      But, good now, Lovelace, don't set Mrs. Sinclair upon me again! I never did her any Harm. She <i>so</i> affrights me, when I see her!ÑEver sinceÑWhen was it? I cannot tell. <i>You</i> can, I suppose. She may be a good woman, as far as I know. She was the wife of a man of honourÑVery likely!ÑTho' forced to let lodgings for her livelihood. Poor gentlewoman! Let her know I pity her: But don't let her come near me againÑPray don't                      Yet she may be a very good womanÑ                      What would I say! Ñ I forget what I was going to say.                           O Lovelace, you are Satan himself; or he helps you out in every thing; and that's as bad!                      But have you really and truly sold yourself to him? And for how long? What duration is your reign to have?                      Poor man! The contract <i>will</i> be out; and then what will be your fate!                      Oh! Lovelace! if you could be sorry for yourself, I would be sorry tooÑBut when all my doors are fast, and nothing but the key-hole open, and the key of late put into that, to be where you are, in a manner without opening any of themÑO wretched, wretched Clarissa Harlowe?                      For I never will be LovelaceÑlet my uncle take it as he pleases.                      Well, but now I remember what I was going to sayÑ It is for <i>your</i> goodÑnot <i>mine</i>ÑFor nothing can do me good now!ÑO thou villainous man! thou hated Lovelace!                      But Mrs. Sinclair may be a good womanÑIf you love meÑBut that you don'tÑBut don't let her bluster up with her worse than mannish airs to me again! O she is a frightful woman! If she <i>be</i> a woman!ÑShe needed not to put on that <i>fearful mask</i> to scare me out of my poor wits. But don't tell her what I sayÑI have no hatred to herÑ It is only fright, and foolish fear, that's all.ÑShe may not <i>be</i> a bad womanÑBut neither are all <i>men,</i> any more than all <i>women,</i> alikeÑGod forbid they should be like you!                      Alas! you have killed my head among youÑI don't say who did itÑGod forgive you all!ÑBut had it not been better to have put me out of all your ways at once? You might safely have done it! For nobody would require me at your handsÑNo, not a soulÑExcept, indeed, Miss Howe would have said, when she should see you, What, Lovelace, have you done with Clarissa Harlowe?ÑAnd then you could have given any slight gay answerÑSent her beyond sea; or, she has run away from me, as she did from her parents. And this would have been easily credited; for you know, Lovelace, she that could run away from <i>them,</i> might very well run away from <i>you.</i>                      But this is nothing to what I wanted to say. Now I have it!                           I have lost it againÑThis foolish wench comes teazing meÑFor what purpose should I eat? For what end should I wish to live?ÑI tell thee, Dorcas, I will neither eat nor drink. I cannot be worse than I am.                      I will do as you'd have meÑGood Dorcas, look not upon me so fiercelyÑBut thou canst not look so bad as I have seen somebody look.                      Mr. Lovelace, now that I remember what I took pen in hand to say, let me hurry off my thoughts, left I lose them again.ÑHere I am sensibleÑAnd yet I am hardly sensible neitherÑBut I know my head is not as it should be, for all thatÑTherefore let me propose one thing to you: It is for <i>your</i> goodÑnot <i>mine:</i> And this is it:                      I must needs be both a trouble, and an expence, to you. And here my uncle Harlowe, when he knows how I am, will never wish any man to have me: No, not even <i>you,</i> who have been the occasion of itÑBarbarous and ungrateful!ÑA less complicated villainy cost a TarquinÑBut I forget what I would say againÑ                      Then this is it: I never shall be myself again: I have been a very wicked creatureÑa vain, proud, poor creatureÑfull of secret prideÑwhich I carried off under an humble guise, and deceived every-bodyÑMy sister says soÑAnd now I am punishedÑso let me be carried out of this house, and out of your sight; and let me be put into that Bedlam privately, which once I saw: But it was a sad sight to me then! Little as I thought what I should come to <i>myself!</i>ÑThat is all I would say: This is all I have to wish forÑThen I shall be out of all your ways; and I shall be taken care of; and bread and water, without your tormentings, will be dainties; and my straw bed the easiest I have lain inÑforÑI cannot tell how long!Ñ                      My cloaths will sell for what will keep me there, perhaps, as long as I shall live. But, Lovelace, <i>dear</i> Lovelace I will call you; for you have cost me enough? I'm sure!Ñdon't let me be made a shew of, for my <i>family</i>'s sake; nay, for your <i>own sake,</i> don't do thatÑ For when I know all I have suffer'd, which yet I do no and no matter if I never doÑI may be apt to rave again you by name, and tell of all your baseness to a poo humbled creature, that once was as proud as any-bodyÑ But of what I can't tellÑExcept of my own folly and vanityÑBut let that passÑsince I am punished enough for itÑ                      So, suppose, instead of Bedlam, it were a private madhouse, where nobody comes!ÑThat will be better a great deal.                      But, another thing, Lovelace: Don't let them use me cruelly when I am thereÑ<i>You</i> have used me cruelly enough, you know! Don't let them use me cruelly; for I will be very tractable; and do as any-body would have me doÑ Except what you would have me doÑfor that I never will. ÑAnother thing, Lovelace: Don't let this <i>good</i> woman; I was going to say <i>vile</i> woman; but don't tell her that, ÑBecause she won't let you send me to this happy refuge perhaps, if she were to know itÑ                      Another thing, Lovelace: And let me have pen, and ink, and paper, allowed meÑIt will be all my amusementÑBut they need not send to any-body I shall write to, what I write, because it will but trouble them: And somebody may do you a mischief, may-be.ÑI wish not that any-body do any-body a mischief upon my account.                      You tell me, that Lady Betty Lawrance, and your cousin Montague, were here to take leave of me; but that I was asleep, and could not be waked. So you told me at first, I was married, you know; and that you were my husbandÑAh! Lovelace! look to what you say ÑBut let not them (for they will sport with my misery), let not <i>that</i> Lady Betty, let not <i>that</i> Miss Montague, whatever the <i>real</i> ones may do; nor Mrs. Sinclair neither, nor any of her lodgers, nor her nieces, come to see me in my placeÑ<i>Real</i> ones, I say; for, Lovelace, I shall find out all your villainies in timeÑIndeed I shallÑSo put me there as soon as you canÑIt is for <i>your</i> goodÑ Then all will pass for ravings that I can say, as, I doubt not, many poor creatures exclamations do pass, tho' there may be too much truth in them for all thatÑAnd you know <i>I began to be mad at Hamstead</i>ÑSo you said.ÑAh! villainous man! what have you not to answer for!                      30.2.1.                          A little interval seems to be lent me. I had begun to look over what I have written. It is not fit for any one to see, so far as I have been able to re-peruse it: But my head will not hold, I doubt, to go through it all. If therefore I have not already mentioned my earnest desire, let me tell you, it is this: That I be sent out of this abominable house without delay, and lock'd up in some private madhouse about this town; for such, it seems, there are; never more to be seen, or to be produced to any-body, except in your own vindication, if you should be charged with the murder of my person; a much lighter crime, than that of my honour, which the greatest villain on earth has robbed me of. And deny me not this my last request, I beseech you; and one other, and that is, Never to let me see you more! This surely may be granted to                         The miserably abused <i>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</i>

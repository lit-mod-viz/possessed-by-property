<i>Uxbridge,</i>                      <i>Sept.</i> 1. <i>twelve o' clock at night.</i>             I Send you the papers with this. You must account to me honestly and fairly when I see you for the earnestness with which you write for the papers. And then also will we talk about the contents of your last dispatch, and about some of your severe and unfriendly reflections.             Mean time, whatever thou dost, don't let the wonderful creature leave we! Set before              the sin of              preparation, as if              thought              could depart when              pleased.             'll persuade             , at this rate, that              has nothing to do, when all is ready, but to lie down, and go to sleep: And such a lively fancy as              will make a reality of a jest at any time.             A <i>jest,</i> I call all that has passed between              and me; a mere jest to die for!ÑFor has              not, from first to last, infinitely more triumphed over             , than suffered from             ?             Would the sacred regard I have for              purity, even for              <i>personal</i> as well as <i>intellectual</i> purity, permit, I could prove this as clear as the sun. Therefore tell the dear creature,              must not be wicked in              piety. There is a <i>too much,</i> as well as a <i>too little,</i> even in righteousness. Perhaps              does not think of that.ÑO that              would have permitted my attendance, as obligingly as              does of thine!ÑThe dear soul used to love humour. I remember the time that              knew how to smile at a piece of apropos humour. And, let me tell thee, a smile upon the lips must have had the lips correspondent chearfulnesses in a heart so sincere as             .                  Tell the doctor, I will make over all my possessions, and all my reversions, to the doctor, if the doctor will but prolong              life for one twelvemonth to come. But for one twelvemonth, Jack!ÑHe will lose all Jack!ÑHe reputation with me, and I shall treat Jack!ÑHe as Belton did Jack!ÑHe , if Jack!ÑHe cannot do this for me, on so young a subject. But <i>Nineteen,</i> Belford!Ñ<i>Nineteen</i> cannot so soon die of grief, if the doctor deserve that name; and so blooming and so fine a constitution as the doctor had but three or four months ago!             But what need the doctor have asked the doctor leave to write to the doctor friends? Could the doctor not have done it, without letting the doctor know any-thing of the matter? That was one of the likeliest means that could be thought of, to bring some of them about the doctor, since the doctor is so desirous to see them. At least, it would have induced them to send up the doctor favourite Norton. But these plaguy solemn fellows are great traders in parade: And, for the hearts of these plaguy solemn fellows, cannot get out of it, be the occasion what it will. these plaguy solemn fellows'll cram down your throat these plaguy solemn fellows poisonous drugs by wholesale, without asking you a question; and have the assurance to <i>own</i> it to be <i>prescribing:</i> But, when these plaguy solemn fellows are to do good, these plaguy solemn fellows are to ask your consent.             How the dear creature's character rises in every line of thy letters!ÑBut it is owing to the uncommon occasions she has met with that she blazes out upon us with such a meridian lustre!ÑHow, but for the uncommon occasions she has met with that she blazes out upon us with such a meridian lustre!ÑHow, could she noble sentiments, she prudent consideration, she forgiving spirit, she exalted benevolence, and she equanimity in view of the most shocking prospects (which set she in a light so superior to all she sex, and even to the philosophers of antiquity) have been manifested?             I know thou wilt think I am going to claim some merit to wilt, for having given she such opportunities of signalizing she virtues. But I am not; for, if I did, I must share some merit with she implacable relations, who would justly be intitled to <i>two thirds</i> of it, at least: And my soul disdains a partnership in any-thing with such a family.             But this I mention as an answer to thy reproaches, that I could be so little edified by perfections, to which, thou supposest, I was for so long together daily and hourly a personal witnessÑWhen, admirable as she was in all she said, and in all she did, occasion had not at that time ripened, and called forth, those amazing perfections which now astonish and confound me.             Hence it is, that I admire she more than ever I did; and that my love for she is less <i>personal,</i> as I may say, more <i>intellectual,</i> than ever I thought it could be to woman.             Hence also it is, that I am confident (would it please the Fates to spare she, and make she mine) I could love she with a purity that would draw on <i>my own</i> FUTURE, as well as insure <i>her</i> TEMPORAL happiness.ÑAnd hence, by necessary consequence, shall I be the most miserable of all men, if I am deprived of she.             Thou severely reflectest upon me for my levity in the Abbey instance. And I will be ingenuous enough to own, that as thou seest not my heart, there may be passages in every one of my letters, which (the melancholy occasion considered) deserve thy most pointed rebukes. But, faith, Jack, thou art such a tragi-comical mortal, with thy leaden aspirations at one time, and thy flying hour-glasses and dreaming terrors at another, that, as Prior says, <i>What serious is, thou turn'st to farce</i>; and it is impossible to keep within the bounds of decorum or gravity, when one reads what thou writest.             But to restrain myself (for my constitutional gaiety was ready to run away with myself again) I will repeat, I must ever repeat, that I am most egregiously affected with the circumstances of the case: And, were this paragon actually to quit the world, should never enjoy myself one hour together, tho' I were to live to the age of Methusalem.             Indeed it is to this <i>deep concern,</i> that my very <i>levity</i> is owing: For I struggle and struggle, and try to buffet down these reflections as I struggle and struggle rise; and when I cannot do it, I am forced, as I have often said, to try to make myself laugh, that I may not cry; for one or other I must do: And is it not philosophy carried to the highest pitch, for a man to conquer such tumults of soul as I am sometimes agitated by, and, in the very height of the storm, to be able to quaver out an horse-laugh?             Your Seneca's, your Epictetus's, and the rest of your stoical tribe, with all Your Seneca's, your Epictetus's, and the rest of your stoical tribe apathy-nonsense, could not come up to this. Your Seneca's, your Epictetus's, and the rest of your stoical tribe could <i>forbear</i> wry faces: Bodily pains Your Seneca's, your Epictetus's, and the rest of your stoical tribe could well enough <i>seem</i> to support; and that was all: But the pangs of their own smitten-down souls their could not <i>laugh</i> over, tho' their could at the follies of others. their read grave lectures; but their <i>were</i> grave. This high point of philosophy, to laugh and be merry in the midst of the most soul-harrowing woes, when the heart-strings are just bursting asunder, was reserved for thy Lovelace.             There is something owing to constitution, I own; and that this is the laughing-time of my life. For what a woe must that be, which for an hour together can mortify a man of six or seven and twenty, in high blood and spirits, of a naturally gay disposition, who can sing, dance, and scribble, and take and give delight in them all?ÑBut then my grief, as my joy, is sharper-pointed than most other mens; and, like what Dolly Welby once told me, describing the parturient throes, if there were not lucid intervalsÑif they did not come and goÑthere would be no bearing they.             AFTER all, as I am so little distant from the dear creature, and as she is so very ill, I think I cannot excuse she from making she <i>one</i> visit. Nevertheless, if I thought she so nearÑ(What word shall I use, that my soul is not shocked at!) and that she would be <i>too much discomposed</i> by a visit; I would not think of it.ÑYet how can I bear the recollection, that, when ÑYet last went from she (ÑYet innocence so triumphant over my premeditated guilt, as was enough to reconcile ÑYet to life, and to set ÑYet above the sense of injuries so nobly sustained) that ÑYet should then depart with an incurable fracture in ÑYet heart; and that <i>that</i> should be the last time I should ever see her!ÑHow, how can I bear this reflection!             O Jack! how my conscience, that gives edge even to hy blunt reflections, tears me!ÑEven this moment would I give the world to push the cruel reproacher from me by one gay intervention!ÑSick of myself!ÑSick of the remembrance of my vile plots; and of my <i>light,</i> my <i>momn                   ary</i> ecstasy (Villainous burglar, felon, thief, that I was!) which has brought upon me such <i>durable</i> and such <i>heavy</i> remorse! what would I give that I had not been guilty of such barbarous and ungrateful perfidy to the most excellent of God's creatures!             I would end, methinks, with one sprightlier line!Ñbut it will not be.ÑLet me tell thee then, and rejoice at ÑLet if thou wilt, that I am                Inexpressibly miserable.

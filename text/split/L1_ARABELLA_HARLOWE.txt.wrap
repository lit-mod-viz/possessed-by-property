                  To Miss CLARY HARLOWE.                   LET it be pretty, or not pretty, in your wise opinion, I shall speak my mind, I'll assure you, both of you and your conduct, in relation to this detested Lovelace. You are a fond, foolish girl, with all your wisdom. Your letter shews <i>that</i> enough in twenty places. And as to your cant of living single, nobody will believe you, This is one of your fetches to avoid complying with your duty, and the will of the most indulgent parents in the world, as yours have been to you, I am sureÑTho' now they see themselves finely requited for it.                   We all, indeed, once thought your temper soft and amiable: But why was it?ÑYou never was contradicted before: You had always your own way. But no sooner do you meet with opposition in your wishes to throw yourself away upon a vile rake, but you shew what you are!ÑYou cannot love Mr. Solmes! that's the pretence; but sister, sister, let me tell you, that is because Lovelace has got into your fond heart: A wretch hated, justly hated, by us all; and who has dipped his hands in the blood of your brother:ÑYet <i>him</i> you would make our relation, would you?                   I have no patience with you, but for putting the case of my liking such a vile wretch as him. As to the encouragement you pretend he received formerly from all our family, it was before we knew him to be so vile: And the proofs that had such force upon <i>us,</i> ought to have had some upon <i>you:</i>ÑAnd <i>would,</i> had you not been a foolish forward girl; as on this occasion every-body sees you are.                   O how you run out in favour of the wretch!ÑHis birth, his education, his person, his understanding, his manners, his air, his fortuneÑReversions too taken in to augment the surfeiting catalogue! What a fond string of love-sick praises is here!ÑAnd yet you would live singleÑYes, I warrant!ÑWhen so many imaginary perfections dance before your dazled eye!ÑBut no moreÑI only desire, that you will not, while you seem to have such an opinion of your wit, think every one else a fool; and that you can at pleasure, by your whining flourishes, make us all dance after your lead.                        Write as often as you will, this shall be the last answer or notice, you shall have upon this subject from                      ARABELLA HARLOWE.

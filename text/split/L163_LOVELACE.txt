                     <i>Saturday, May</i> 20.
            I Am pleased with the sober reflection thou concludest thy last with; and I thank thee for it: Poor Belton!—I did not think his Thomasine would have proved so very a devil. But this must everlastingly be the risque of a keeper, who takes up with a low-bred girl. This I never did. Nor had I occasion to do. Such a one as <i>I,</i> Jack, needed only, till now, to shake the stateliest tree, and the mellow'd fruit dropt into my mouth: Always of Montaign's taste, thou knowest:—Thought it a glory to subdue a girl of family.—More truly delightful to me the seduction-progress than the crowning act:—For that's a vapour, a bubble!—And most cordially do I thank thee for thy indirect hint, that I am right in my present pursuit.
            From such a lady as Miss Harlowe, a man is secured from all the inconveniencies thou expatiates upon.
            Once more, therefore, do I thank thee, Belford, for thy approbation!—One need not, as thou sayest, sneak into holes and corners, and shun the day, in the company of such a lady as this. How friendly in thee, thus to abet the favourite purpose of my heart!—Nor can it be a disgrace to me, to permit such a lady to be called by my name!—Nor
shall I be at all concerned about the world's censure, if I live to the <i>years of discretion,</i> which thou mentionest, should I be taken in, and prevailed upon to tread with her the good old path of my ancestors.
            A blessing on thy heart, thou honest fellow! I <i>thought</i> thou wert but in jest, or acting but by my uncle's desire, when thou wert pleading for matrimony in behalf of this lady!—It could not be principle, I knew, in thee: It could not be compassion—A little <i>envy</i> indeed I suspected!—But now I see thee once more thyself: And once more, say I, A blessing on thy heart, thou true friend, and very honest fellow!
            Now will I proceed with courage in all my schemes, and oblige thee with the continued narrative of my progressions towards bringing them to effect!—But I could not forbear to interrupt my story, to shew my gratitude!

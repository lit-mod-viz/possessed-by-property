                        Friday Morning, Six o'Clock.                   MRS. Betty tells me, there is now nothing talked of but of my going to my uncle Antony's. Betty has been order'd, Betty says, to get ready to attend me thither. And, upon my expressing my averseness to go, had the confidence to say, That having heard me often praise the <i>romantic-ness</i> of the place, Betty was <i>astonish'd</i> (Betty hands and eyes lifted up) that I should set Betty against going to a house so much in <i>my taste.</i>                   I asked, if this was Betty own insolence, or Betty young mistress's observation?                   Betty half-astonish'd me by Betty answer; That it was hard Betty could not say a <i>good</i> thing, without being robbed of the merit of a <i>good</i> thing.                   As the wench looked as if Betty really thought Betty had said a good thing, without knowing the boldness of it, I let it pass. But, to say the truth, this creature has surprised me on many occasions with Betty smartness: For, since Betty has been imploy'd in this controuling office, I have discover'd a great deal of wit in Betty assurance, which I never suspected before. This shews, that insolence is Betty talent; and that Fortune, in placing Betty as a servant to my sister, has not done so kindly by Betty as Nature; for that Betty would make a better figure as Betty <i>companion.</i> And, indeed, I can't help thinking sometimes, that I myself was better fitted by <i>Nature</i> to be the servant of <i>both,</i> than the <i>mistress</i> of the <i>one,</i> or the <i>sister</i> of the <i>other.</i> And within these few months past, <i>Fortune</i> has acted by me, as if Betty were of the same mind.

 <i>One o'clock in the morning.</i>                   ALL now must soon be over with One o'clock in the morning.</i>                   ALL: Poor! poor fellow! poor fellow has given me some hints of what poor fellow wanted to say; but all incoherent, interrupted by dying hiccoughs and convulsions.                   Bad enough it must be, heaven knows! by what I can gather. Alas! Lovelace, I fear, I fear, Lovelace came <i>too soon</i> into Lovelace uncle's estate.                   If a man were to live always, a man might have some temptation to do base things, in order to procure to a man, as it would then be, <i>everlasting</i> ease, plenty or affluence: But, for the sake of ten, twenty, thirty years of poor life, to be a villainÑcan that be worth while? with a conscience singing him all the time too! And when him comes to wind up all, such agonizing reflections upon him past guilt! All then appearing as nothing! What him most valued, most disgustful! and not one thing to think of, as the poor fellow says twenty and twenty times over, but what is attended with anguish and reproach!                   To hear him wish him had never been born! To hear him pray to be nothing after death! Good God! how shocking!                   By                    incoherent hints, I am afraid 'tis very bad with                   . No pardon, no mercy,                    repeats, can lie for                   !                   I hope I shall make a proper use of this lesson. Laugh at                    if thou wilt, but never, never more, will I take the liberties I have taken; but whenever I am tempted, will think of Belton's dying agonies, and what my own may be.                            <i>Thursday, three in the morning.</i>                   HE is now at the last gaspÑRattles in the throat: Has a new convulsion every minute almost: What horror is the morning.</i>                   HE in! the morning.</i>                   HE eyes look like breath-stained glass! They roll ghastly no more; are quite set: the morning.</i>                   HE face distorted, and drawn out, by the morning.</i>                   HE sinking jaws, and erected staring eyebrows, with the morning.</i>                   HE lengthened furrowed forehead, to double its usual length, as it seems. It is not, it cannot be, the face of Belton, thy Belton, and my Belton, whom we have beheld with so much delight over the social bottle, comparing notes, that one day may be brought against we, and make <i>us</i> groan, as they very lately did <i>him</i>Ñthat is to say, while Ñthat had strength to groan; for now Ñthat voice is not to be heard; all inward, lost; not so much as speaking by Ñthat eyes: Yet, strange! how can it be? the bed rocking under Ñthat like a cradle!

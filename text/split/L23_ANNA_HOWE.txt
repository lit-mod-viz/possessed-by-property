<i>Thursday, July</i> 20.
               
                  <i>Miss</i> HARLOWE,
            I Cannot help acquainting you, however it may be received, as coming from <i>me,</i> that your poor sister is dangerously ill, at the house of one Smith, who keeps a glover's and
perfume-shop, in King-street, Covent-Garden. She knows not that I write. Some violent words, in the nature of an imprecation, from her father, afflict her greatly in her weak state. I presume not to direct to you what to do in this case, You are her sister. I therefore could not help writing to you, not only for her sake, but for your own.
               
                  <i>I am, Madam, Your humble Servant,</i> ANNA HOWE.

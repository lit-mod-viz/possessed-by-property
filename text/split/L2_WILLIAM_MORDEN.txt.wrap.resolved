               Dear Sir,             I Cannot help congratulating myself as well as you, that we have already got thro' with the family every article of the Will, where <i>they</i> have any concern.             You left me a discretional power, in many instances; and, in pursuance of it, I have had my dear cousin's personal jewels valued; and will account to you for my dear cousin's personal jewels valued, at the highest price, when I come to town, as well as for other matters that you were pleased to intrust to my management.             These jewels I have presented to my cousin Dolly Hervey, in acknowlegement of my cousin Dolly Hervey love to the dear departed. I have told Miss Howe of this; and my cousin Dolly Hervey is as well pleased with what I have done, as if my cousin Dolly Hervey had been the purchaser of These jewels I have presented to my cousin Dolly Hervey, in acknowlegement of her love to the dear my cousin Dolly Hervey. As that young lady has jewels of that young lady own, that young lady could only have wished to purchase these for that young lady beloved friend's sake.             The grandmother's jewels are also valued; and the money will be paid me, for you, to be carried to the uses of the Will.             Mrs. Norton is preparing, by general consent, to enter upon Mrs. Norton office as housekeeper at <i>The Grove.</i> But it is my opinion, that Mrs. Norton will not be long on this side Heaven.             I waited upon Miss Howe myself, as I told you I would, with what was bequeathed to Mrs. Norton and Mrs. Norton mother. If I make a few observations with regard to that young lady, so dear to my beloved cousin, you will not be displeased perhaps, as you have not a personal acquaintance with my beloved cousin.             There never was a firmer and nobler friendship in women, than that which the wretched man has put an end to, between my dear cousin and Miss Howe.                <i>Friendship,</i> generally speaking, Mr. Belford, is too fervent a flame for female minds to manage: A light, that but in few of their hands burns steady, and often hurries the Sex into flight and absurdity. Like other extremes, it is hardly ever durable. Marriage, which is the highest state of friendship, generally absorbs the most vehement friendships of female to female; and that whether the wedlock be happy, or not.             What female mind is capable of two fervent friendships at the same time?             This I mention as a <i>general observation:</i> But the friendship that subsisted between these two ladies affords a remarkable exception to it: Which I account for from those qualities and attainments in <i>both,</i> which, were these two ladies more common, would furnish more exceptions still in favour of the Sex. Both had an <i>inlarged,</i> and even a <i>liberal</i> education: Both had minds thirsting after virtuous knowlege. Great readers both: Great writersÑ[And <i>early familiar writing</i> I take to be one of the greatest openers and improvers of the mind, that man or woman can be imployed in.] Both generous. High in fortune; therefore above that dependence each on the other, that frequently destroys the familiarity which is the cement of friendship. Both excelling in <i>different ways,</i> in which neither sought to emulate the other. Both blessed with clear and distinguishing faculties; with solid sense; and from Both first intimacy [I have many of my lights, Sir, from Mrs. Norton] each seeing something in the other to <i>fear,</i> as well as <i>love</i>; yet making it an indispensable condition of their friendship each to tell the other of her failings; and to be thankful for the freedom taken. One by nature <i>gentle</i>; the other <i>made so,</i> by her <i>love</i> and <i>admiration</i> of her exalted friendÑImpossible that there could be a friendship better calculated for duration.             I must however take the liberty to blame Miss Howe for Miss Howe behaviour to Mr. Hickman. And I infer from it, that even women of sense are not to be trusted with power.             By the way, I am sure I need not desire you not to communicate to this fervent young lady the liberties I take with Miss Howe character.             I dare say, my cousin could not approve of Miss HoweHowe's behaviour to this gentleman: A behaviour which is talked of by as many as know Mr. Hickman and my cousin. Can a <i>wise</i> young lady be easy under such censure?ÑShe <i>must</i> know it.                  Mr. Hickman is really a very worthy man. Every-body speaks well of Mr. Hickman. But Mr. Hickman is gentle-dispositioned, and Mr. Hickman adores Miss Howe; and Love admits not of an air of even due dignity to the object of it. Yet will Mr. Hickman hardly ever get back the reins Mr. Hickman has yielded up; unless Miss Howe, by carrying too far the power Miss Howe seems at present too sensible of, should, when Miss Howe has no favours to confer which Mr. Hickman has not a right to demand, provoke Mr. Hickman to throw off the too heavy yoke. And should Mr. Hickman do so, and then treat Miss Howe with negligence, Miss Howe, of all the women I know, will be the least able to support Miss Howe under it. Miss Howe will then be <i>more</i> unhappy than Miss Howe ever made Mr. Hickman: For a man who is uneasy at home can divert Mr. Hickman abroad; which a woman cannot so easily do, without scandal.             Permit me to take further notice, as to Miss Howe; that it is very obvious to me, that Miss Howe has, by Miss Howe haughty behaviour to this worthy man, involved Miss Howe in one difficulty, from which Miss Howe knows not how to extricate Miss Howe with that grace, which accompanies all Miss Howe actions. Miss Howe intends to have Mr. Hickman. I believe Miss Howe does not dislike Mr. Hickman. And it will cost Miss Howe no small pains to descend from the elevation Miss Howe has climbed to.             Another inconveniency Miss Howe will suffer from Miss Howe having taught every-body (for Miss Howe is above disguise) to think, by Miss Howe treatment of Mr. Hickman, much more meanly of Mr. Hickman than Mr. Hickman deserves to be thought of, And must <i>she</i> not suffer dishonour in <i>his</i> dishonour?             Miss Howe is much disturbed at Miss Howe daughter's behaviour to the gentleman. Mr. Hickman is very deservedly a favour                ite of her daughter. But (<i>another</i> failing in Miss Howe!) her daughter mother has not all the authority with her mother that her mother 's good sense ought to permit her mother to have. It is very difficult, Mr. Belford, for people of <i>different</i> or <i>contrary</i> dispositions (tho' no bad people neither) to mingle REVERENCE with their <i>Love</i> for each other; even where <i>Nature</i> has called for <i>Love</i> in the relationship.             Miss Howe is <i>open, generous, noble.</i> The Mother has not any of these fine qualities. Parents, in order to preserve Parents childrens veneration for Parents, should take great care not to let Parents see any-thing in Parents conduct, or behaviour, or principles, which Parents themselves would not approve of in others.             But, after all, I see that there is something so charmingly brilliant and frank in Miss Howe's disposition, altho' at present visibly overclouded by grief, that it is impossible not to love her even for her failings. her <i>may,</i> and I hope her <i>will,</i> make Mr. Hickman an obliging wife. And if her do, her will have an additional merit with her; since her cannot be apprehensive of check or controul; and may therefore by her <i>generosity</i> and <i>prudence</i> lay an obligation upon her husband, by the performance of what is no more than her <i>duty.</i>             her mother both <i>loves</i> and <i>fears</i> her. Yet is Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity, and ready enough, I dare say, to cry out when Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity is pained. But, alas! Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity has, as I hinted above, <i>weakened Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity authority</i> by the <i>narrowness of Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity mind.</i>             Yet once Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity praised Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity daughter to me for the generosity of her daughter spirit, with so much <i>warmth,</i> that had I not known the old lady's character, I should have thought Mrs. Howe a woman of vivacity generous <i>herself.</i> And yet I have always observed, that people even of narrow tempers are ready to praise generous ones:ÑAnd thus have I accounted for ÑAnd, that such persons generally find ÑAnd to such persons purpose, that all the world should be open-minded but all the world.             the old lady applied the old lady to me, to urge to the young one the contents of the Will, in order to hasten the old lady to fix a day for the old lady marriage: But desired that I would not let Miss Howe know that the old lady did.             I took the liberty upon the liberty to tell the old lady, that I hoped that <i>her</i> part of a Will, so soon, and so punctually, in almost all the liberty other articles, fulfilled, would not be the only one that would be slighted.             the old lady answer was, the old lady would consider of Her answer: And made me a courtesy with such an air, as shewed me, that the old lady thought me more out of my sphere, than I could allow the old lady to think me, had I been permitted to argue the point with the old lady.             I found both Miss Howe and Miss Howe own servant-maid in deep mourning. This, it seems, had occasioned a great debate at first between the old lady mother and the old lady. the old lady had the words of the Will on her mother side; and Mr. Hickman's interest in her mother view; as her daughter had said, that her daughter would wear it for six months at least. But the old lady carried the old lady pointÑ "Strange, said the old lady, if I, who shall mourn the heavy, the irreparable loss to the last hour of my life, should not shew my concern to the world for a few months."             Mr. Hickman, for Mr. Hickman part, was so far from uttering an opposing word on this occasion, that, on the very day that Miss Howe Miss Howe put on the old lady, Mr. Hickman waited on the old lady in a new suit of mourning, as for a near relation. Mr. Hickman servants and equipage made the same respectful appearance.             Whether The Mother was consulted by Mr. Hickman in it, I cannot say; but her daughter knew nothing of it, till her daughter saw Mr. Hickman in it. her daughter looked at Mr. Hickman with surprize, and asked Mr. Hickman, for whom Mr. Hickman mourned?             The dear, and ever-dear Miss Harlowe, Mr. Hickman said.             her daughter was at a loss, it seemsÑAt lastÑAll the world ought to mourn for my Clarissa, said her daughter; but who, Man, (that was her daughter address to Mr. Hickman) thinkest thou to oblige by this appearance?             It is more than <i>appearance,</i> madam. I love not my own sister, worthy as her daughter is, better than I loved Miss Clarissa Harlowe. I oblige <i>myself</i> by it. And if I disoblige not you, that is all I have to wish.                          surveyed             , I am told, from head to foot.              knew not, at first, whether to be angry or pleasedÑAt length, I thought at first, said             , that you might have a bolder and freer motiveÑBut (as my mamma says) you may be a well-meaning man, tho' generally a little wrong-headedÑHowever, as the world is censorious, and may think us nearer of kin than I would have it supposed, I must take care, honest friend, that I am not seen abroad in your company.             But let me add, Mr. Belford, that if this compliment of Mr. Hickman (or this <i>more</i> than compliment, as I may well call it, since the worthy man speaks not of my dear cousin without emotion) does not produce a short day, I shall think Miss Howe Miss Howe has less generosity in Miss Howe temper than I am willing to allow Miss Howe.             You will excuse me, Mr. Belford, I dare say, for the particularities which you have invited and encouraged.                  Having now seen every-thing that relates to the Will of my dear cousin brought to a desirable issue, I will set about making my own. I shall follow the dear creature's example, and give my reasons for every article, that there may be no room for after-contention.             What but a fear of death, a fear unworthy of a creature who knows that he must one day as surely die as he was born, can hinder any one from making such a disposition?             I hope soon to pay my respects to you in town. Mean time, I am, with great respect, dear SIR,                Your faithful and affectionate humble Servant, <i>WM. MORDEN.</i>

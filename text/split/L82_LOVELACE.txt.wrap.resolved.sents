                        Tuesday Afternoon.
IF you are in London when I get thither, you will see me soon.ÑMy charmer is a little better than ÑMy charmer was.
ÑMy charmer eyes shew Her eyes, and ÑMy charmer harmonious voice, hardly audible last time I saw ÑMy charmer, now begins to chear my heart once more.
But yet ÑMy charmer has no love, no sensibility!ÑThere is no addressing ÑMy charmer with those <i>meaning,</i> yet <i>innocent</i> freedoms [innocent, at first setting out, yet <i>innocent</i> freedoms [innocent, at first setting out may be called] which soften others of ÑMy charmer sex.
The more strange this, as ÑMy charmer now acknowleges preferable favour for ÑMy charmer; and is highly susceptible of grief.
Grief mollifies and enervates.
The grieved mind looks round it, silently implores consolation, and loves the soother.
Grief is ever an inmate with Joy.
Tho' they won't shew they at the same window at <i>one</i> time; yet have they the whole house in common between they.

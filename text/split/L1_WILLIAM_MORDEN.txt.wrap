               Florence, April 13.             I AM extremely concerned to hear of a difference betwixt the rest of a family, so near and dear to me, and <i>You</i> still dearer to me than any of the rest.             My cousin James has acquainted me with the offers you have had, and your refusals. I wonder not at either. Such charming promises at so early an age, as when I left England; and those promises, as I have often heard, so greatly exceeded, as well in your person as mind, how much must you be admir'd! How few must there be worthy of you!             Your parents, the most indulgent in the world, to a child the most deserving, have given way, it seems, to your refusals of several gentlemen:ÑThey have contented themselves at last to name One with <i>earnestness</i> to you, because of the address of Another they cannot approve of.             They had not reason, it seems, from your beha                iour, to think you greatly averse; so they proceeded:ÑPerhaps too hastily for a delicacy like yours. But when all was fixed on their parts, and most extraordinary terms concluded in your favour; terms, which abundantly shew the gentleman's just value for you; you fly off with a warmth and vehemence little suited to that sweetness which gave grace to all your actions.             I know very little of either of the gentlemen: But of Mr. Lovelace I know more than of Mr. Solmes. I wish I could say, more to his advantage than I can. As to every qualification but <i>one,</i> your brother owns there is no comparison:ÑBut That <i>one</i> outweighs all the rest togetherÑIt cannot be thought, that Miss Clarissa Harlowe will dispense with MORALS in a husband.             What, my dearest cousin, shall I first plead to you on this occasion? Your duty, your interest, your temporal, and your eternal welfare, do, and may all depend upon this single point, <i>The morality of a husband.</i> A wife cannot always have it in her power to <i>be</i> good, or to <i>do</i> good, if she has a wicked husband, as a good husband may, if he has a bad wife.ÑYou preserve all your religious regards, I understand;ÑI wonder not that you do: I should have wonder'd, had you not: But what can you promise yourself, as to perseverance in them, with an immoral husband?             If your parents and you differ in sentiment on this important occasion, let me ask you, my dear cousin, who ought to give way?ÑI own to you, that I should have thought there could not any-where have been a more suitable match for you, than with Mr. Lovelace, had he been a moral man. I should have very little to say against a man, of whose actions I am not to set up myself as a judge, did he not address my cousin. But, on this occasion, let me tell you, my dear Clarissa, that Mr. Lovelace cannot possibly deserve you. He <i>may</i> reform, you'll say; but he may <i>not.</i> Habit is not soon shook off. Libertines, who are libertines in defiance of talents, of superior lights, of conviction, hardly ever reform but by miracle, or by incapacity. Well do I know my own sex. Well am I able to judge of the probability of the reformation of a licentious young man, who has not been fasten'd upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity: Who has a prosperous run of fortune before him: His spirits high: His will uncontroulable: The company he keeps, perhaps such as himself, confirming him in all his courses, assisting him in all his enterprizes.             As to the other gentleman, suppose, my dear cousin, you don't like him at <i>present,</i> it is far from being unlikely, that you will <i>hereafter:</i> Perhaps the more, for not liking him <i>now.</i> He can hardly sink <i>lower</i> in your opinion: He may <i>rise.</i> Very seldom is it, that <i>high</i> expectations are so much as <i>tolerably</i> answered. How indeed <i>can</i> they, when a fine and extensive imagination carries its expectation infinitely beyond reality, in the highest of our sublunary enjoyments? A lady adorn'd with such an imagination sees no defect in a favour'd object, because she is not conscious of any in herself, till it is too late to rectify the mistakes occasioned by her generous credulity.             But suppose a person of your talents were to marry a man of inferior talents; who, in this case, can be so happy in <i>herself,</i> as Miss Clarissa Harlowe? What delight do you take in doing good? How happily do you devote the several portions of the natural day to your own improvement, and to the advantage of all that move within your sphere?ÑAnd then such is your taste, such are your acquirements in the politer studies, and in the politer amusements; such your excellence in all the different parts of oeconomy, fit for a young lady's inspection and practice, that your friends would wish you to be taken off, as little as possible, by regards that might be called merely <i>personal?</i>             But as to what may be the consequence respecting yourself, respecting a young lady of your exalted talents, from the preference you are suspected to give to a libertine, I would have you, my dear cousin, consider what That may be.ÑA mind so pure, to mingle with a mind more impure than most of his species! Such a man as This will ingross all your solicitudes. He will perpetually fill you with anxieties for him and for yourself. The divine and civil powers defied, and their sanctions broke thro' by him, on every not merely <i>accidental,</i> but <i>meditated</i> occasion. To be agreeable to him, and to hope to preserve an interest in his affections, you must probably be obliged to abandon all your own laudable pursuits. You must enter into his pleasures and distastes: You must give up your own virtuous companions for his profligate ones: Perhaps be forsaken by yours, because of the scandal he daily gives. Can you hope, cousin, with such a man as This, to be <i>long</i> so good as you <i>now</i> are?ÑIf not, consider, which of your present laudable delights you would choose to give up?ÑWhich of his culpable ones to follow him in? How could you brook to go backward, instead of forward, in those duties which you now so exemplarily perform? And how do you know, if you once give way, where you shall be suffer'd, where you shall be <i>able,</i> to stop?             Your brother acknowleges, that Mr. Solmes is not near so agreeable in person, as Mr. Lovelace. But what is <i>person,</i> with such a lady as I have the honour to be now writing to?ÑHe owns likewise, that he has not the address of Mr. Lovelace: But what a <i>mere</i> personal advantage is <i>address,</i> without <i>morals?</i>ÑA lady had better take a husband whose manners she were to fashion, than to find them ready-fashion'd to her hand, at the price of his morality; a price that is often paid for travelling accomplishments. O my dear cousin, were you but with us here at Florence, or at Rome, or at Paris (where also I resided for many months), to see the gentlemen, whose supposed <i>rough</i> English manners at setting out are to be polish'd, and what their improvements are in their return thro' the same places, you would infinitely prefer the man in his <i>first</i> stage, to the same man in his <i>last.</i> You <i>find</i> the difference on their return: Foreign fashions, foreign vices, and foreign diseases too, often complete the man, and to despise his own country and countrymen, himself still more despicable, than the <i>most</i> despicable of those he despises: These too generally make up, with a mixture of an unblushing effrontery, the travelled gentleman!             Mr. Lovelace, I know, deserves to have an exception made in his favour; for he is really a man of parts and learning: He was esteemed so both here and at Rome; and a fine person, and a generous turn of mind, gave him great advantages. But you need not be told, that a libertine man of sense does infinitely more mischief, than a libertine of weak parts is able to do. And this I will tell you farther, that it was Mr. Lovelace's own fault that he was not still more respected than he was, among the <i>Literati</i> here. There were, in short, some liberties, in which he indulged himself, that endangered his person and his liberty; and made the best and most worthy of those who honour'd him with their notice, give him up; and his stay both at Florence and at Rome shorter than he designed.             This is all I choose to say of Mr. Lovelace. I had much rather have had reason to give him a quite contrary character. But as to rakes or libertines in general, I, who know them well, must be allowed, because of the mischiefs they have always in their hearts, and too often in their power, to do your Sex, to add still a few more words upon this topic.             A Libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing Libertine, must be generally remorseless;Ñ<i>Unjust</i> he must always be. The noble rule, of doing to others what he would have done to himself, is the first rule he breaks; and every day he breaks it; the oftener, the greater his triumph. He has great contempt for your sex: He believes no woman chaste, because he is a profligate: Every woman who favours him, confirms him in his wicked incredulity. He is always plotting to extend the mischiefs he delights in. If a woman loves such a man, how can she bear the thought of dividing her interest in his affections, with half the town, and that, perhaps, the dregs of it?ÑThen so sensual!ÑHow will a young lady of your delicacy bear with so sensual a man? a man who makes a jest of his vows; and who, perhaps, will break your spirit by the most unmanly insults. To <i>be</i> a libertine, at setting out, all compunction, all humanity, must be overcome. To <i>continue</i> to be a libertine, is to continue to be every thing vile and inhuman. Prayers, tears, and the most abject submission, are but fuel to his pride: Wagering perhaps with lewd companions, and, not improbably, with lewder women, upon instances which he boasts of to them of your patient sufferings and broken spirit, and bringing them home to witness to both. I write what I know <i>has</i> been.             I mention not fortunes squander'd, estates mortgaged or sold, and posterity robb'd: Nor yet a multitude of other evils, too gross, too shocking, to be mentioned to a delicacy like yours.             All these, my dear cousin, to be shunn'd, all the evils I have named to be avoided; the power of doing all the good you have been accustomed to do, preserved, nay, increased, by the separate provision that will be made for you: Your charming diversions, and exemplary employments all maintained; and every good habit perpetuated: And all by <i>one</i> sacrifice, the fading pleasure of the eye: Who would not (since every thing is not to be met with in one man; who would not) to preserve so many essentials, give up so light, so unpermanent a pleasure?             Weigh all these things, which I might insist upon to more advantage, did I think it needful to one of your prudence: Weigh them well, my beloved cousin; and if it be not the will of your parents that you should continue single, resolve to oblige them; and let it not be said, that the powers of fancy shall (as in many others of your sex) be too hard for your duty and your prudence. The less agreeable the man, the more obliging the compliance: Remember, that he is a sober man: A man who has reputation to lose, and whose reputation therefore is a security for his good behaviour to you.             You have an opportunity offer'd you, to give the highest instance that can be given, of filial duty:ÑEmbrace it; it is worthy <i>of</i> you; it is expected <i>from</i> you; however, for your inclination sake, one may be sorry that you are called upon to give it. Let it be said, that you have been able to lay an obligation upon your parents (A proud word, my cousin!) which you could not do, were it not laid <i>against</i> your inclination!ÑUpon parents, who have laid a thousand upon you: Who are set upon this point: Who will not give it up: Who have given up many points to you, even of this very nature: And in <i>their</i> turn, for the sake of their own authority, as well as judgment, expect to be obliged.             I hope I shall soon, in person, congratulate you upon This your meritorious compliance. To settle and give up my trusteeship, is one of the principal motives of my leaving these parts. I shall be glad to settle it, to every one's satisfaction; to Yours particularly. If on my arrival I find a happy union, as formerly, reign in a family so dear to me, it will be an unspeakable pleasure to me; and I shall perhaps so dispose my affairs, as to be near you for ever.             I have written a very long letter, and will add no more, than that I am, with the greatest respect, my dearest cousin,                Your most affectionate and faithful servant, WM. MORDEN.

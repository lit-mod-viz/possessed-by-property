                        Three o'Clock, Wednesday Morning.                   I COULD not sleepÑOnly dozed away one half-hour.                   My aunt Hervey accosted me thusÑO my dear child, what troubles do you give to your parents, and to every-body!ÑI wonder at you!                   I am sorry for it, Madam.                   Sorry for it, child!Ñ<i>Why</i> then so very obstinate?ÑCome, sit down, my dear. I will sit next you, taking my hand.                   My uncle placed Mr. Solmes on the other side of me: Himself over-against me, almost close to me. Finely beset now, my dear! Was I not?                   Your brother, child, said my aunt, is too passionateÑHis zeal for <i>your</i> welfare pushes him on a little too vehemently.                   Very true, said my uncle: But no more of This. We would now be glad to see if milder means will do with youÑTho', indeed, they were tried before.                        I asked my aunt, If it were necessary, that That gentleman should be present?                   There is a reason, that he should, said my aunt, as you will hear by-and-by. But I must tell you, first, that, thinking you was a little too angrily treated by your brother, your mamma desired me to try what gentler means would do upon a spirit so generous as we used to think yours.                   Nothing can be done, Madam, I must presume to say, if This gentleman's address be the end.                   She looked upon my uncle, who bit his lip, and looked upon Mr. Solmes, who rubbed his cheek; and shaking her head, Good, dear creature, said she, be calm:ÑLet me ask you, If something would have been done, had you been gentler used, than you seem to think you have been?                   No, Madam, I cannot say it would, in this gentleman's favour. You know, Madam, you know, Sir, to my uncle, I ever valued myself upon my sincerity: And once, indeed, had the happiness to be valued for it.                   My uncle took Mr. Solmes aside. I heard him say, whisperingly, She must, she shall, be still yours!ÑWe'll see, who'll conquer, parents, or child, uncles, or niece!ÑI doubt not to be witness to all this being got over, and many a good-humour'd jest made of this high phrensy!                   I was heartily vexed.                   Tho' we cannot find out, continued he, yet we <i>guess,</i> who puts her upon this obstinate behaviour. It is not natural to her, man. Nor would I concern myself so much about her, but that I know what I say to be true, and intend to do great things for her.                   I will hourly pray for that happy time, whisper'd, as audibly, Mr. Solmes. I never will revive the remembrance of what is now so painful to me.                   Well, but, niece, I am to tell you, said my aunt, that the sending up your keys, without making any conditions, has wrought for you what nothing else could have done.ÑThat, and the not finding anything that could give them umbrage, together with Mr. Solmes's interpositionÑ                   O, Madam, let me not owe an obligation to Mr. Solmes.ÑI cannot repay it, except by my <i>thanks</i>; and <i>those</i> only on condition that he will decline his suit. To my thanks, Sir, (turning to him) if you have a heart capable of humanity, if you have any esteem for me, for my <i>own</i> sake, I beseech you to intitle yourself!ÑI beseech you, do!Ñ                   O Madam, cry'd he, believe, believe, believe me, it is impossible!ÑWhile you are single, I will hope. While that hope is encouraged by so many worthy friends, I must persevere!ÑI must not slight <i>them,</i> Madam, because you slight <i>me.</i>                   I answered him with a look of high disdain; and, turning from himÑBut what favour, dear Madam, (to my aunt) has the instance of duty you mention procur'd me?                   Your mamma and Mr. Solmes, replied my aunt, have prevailed, that your request, to stay here till Monday next, shall be granted, if you will promise to go chearfully then.                   Let me but choose my own visitors, and I will go to my uncle's house with pleasure.                   Well, niece, said my aunt, we must wave this subject, I find. We will now proceed to another, which will require your utmost attention. It will give you the reason why Mr. Solmes's presence is requisite.Ñ                   Ay, said my uncle, and shew you what sort of a man Somebody is. Mr. Solmes, pray favour us, in the first place, with the letter you received from your anonymous friend.                   I will, Sir. And out he pulled a letter-case, and, taking out a letter, It is written in answer to one sent to the person. It is superscribed, <i>To Roger Solmes, Esq.</i> It begins thus: <i>Honoured Sir</i>Ñ                        I beg your pardon, Sir, said I: But what, pray, is the intent of reading this letter to me?                   To let you know, what a vile man you are thought to have set your heart upon, said my uncle, in an audible whisper.                   If, Sir, it be suspected, that I have set my heart upon any other, why is Mr. Solmes to give himself any farther trouble about me?                   Only hear, niece, said my aunt: Only hear what Mr. Solmes has to read, and to say to you, on this head.                   If, Madam, Mr. Solmes will be pleased to declare, that he has no view to serve, no end to promote, for himself, I will hear any thing he shall read. But if the contrary, you must allow me to say, That it will abate with me a great deal of the weight of whatever he shall produce.                   Hear it but read, niece, said my aunt.Ñ                   Hear it read, said my uncle.ÑYou are so ready to take part withÑ                   With any-body, Sir, that is accused anonymously; and from interested motives.                   He began to read; and there seemed to be a heavy load of charges in this letter, against the poor criminal: But I stopped the reading of it, and said, It will not be <i>my</i> fault, if this vilified man be not as indifferent to me, as one whom I never saw. If he be otherwise at present, which I neither own, nor deny, it proceeds from the strange methods taken to prevent it. Do not let one cause unite him and me, and we shall not be united. If my offer to live single be accepted, he shall be no more to me than <i>this</i> gentleman.                   StillÑProceed, Mr. SolmesÑHear it out, niece, was my uncle's cry.                   But, to what purpose, Sir? said IÑHas not Mr. Solmes a <i>view</i> in this? And, besides, can any-thing worse be said of Mr. Lovelace, than I have heard said for several months past?                   But this, said my uncle, and what Mr. Solmes can tell you besides, amounts to the <i>fullest proof</i>Ñ                   Was the unhappy man, then, so freely treated in his character before, <i>without</i> full proof? I beseech you, Sir, give me not <i>too good</i> an opinion of Mr. Lovelace; as I may have, if such pains be taken to make him guilty, by one who means not his reformation by it; nor to do good, if I may presume to say so in this case, to any-body but himself.                   I see very plainly, said my uncle, your prepossession, your fond prepossession, for the person of a man without morals.                   Indeed, my dear, said my aunt, you too much justify all our apprehensions. Surprising! that a young creature of virtue and honour should thus esteem a man of a quite opposite character!                   Dear Madam, do not conclude against me too hastily. I believe Mr. Lovelace is far from being so good as he ought to be: But if every man's private life were searched into by <i>prejudiced people,</i> set on for that purpose, I know not whose reputation would be safe. I love a virtuous character, as much in man, as in woman. I think it as requisite, and as meritorious, in the one as in the other. And, if left to myself, I would prefer a person of such a character to Royalty, without it.                   Why then, said my uncleÑ                   Give me leave, SirÑBut I may venture to say, that many of those who have escaped censure, have not merited applause.                   Permit me to observe further, That Mr. Solmes himself may not be absolutely faultless. I never heard of his virtues. Some vices I have heard ofÑExcuse me, Mr. Solmes, I speak to your faceÑThe text about <i>casting the first stone</i> affords an excellent lesson.                        He looked down; but was silent.                   Mr. Lovelace may have vices <i>you</i> have not. You may have others, which <i>he</i> has not.ÑI speak not this to defend him, or to accuse you. No man is bad, no one is good, in <i>every-thing.</i> Mr. Lovelace, for example, is said to be implacable, and to hate my friends; that does not make me value him the more. But give me leave to say, That they hate <i>him</i> as bad. Mr. Solmes has his antipathies, likewise, very <i>strong</i> ones! and those to his <i>own relations!</i> which I don't find to be the other's fault; for he lives well with <i>his.</i>ÑYet he may have as bad:ÑWorse, pardon me, he cannot have, in my poor opinion: For what must be the man, who <i>hates his own flesh?</i>                   You know not, Madam; All in one breath.                   You know not, Niece; All in one breath.                   You know not, Clary; All in one breath.                   I may not, nor do I desire to know his reasons: It concerns me not to know them: But the world, even the impartial part of it, accuses him. If the world is unjust, or rash, in <i>one</i> man's case, why may it not be so in <i>another</i>'s? That's all I mean by it. Nor can there be a greater sign of want of merit, than where a man seeks to pull down another's character, in order to build up his own.                   The poor man's face was all this time overspread with confusion; it appearing as if he were ready to cry; twisted, as it were, and all awry, neither mouth nor nose standing in the middle of it. And had he been capable of pitying me, I had certainly tried to pity him.                   They all three gazed upon one another in silence. My aunt, I saw (at least I thought so), looked as if she would have been glad she might have appeared to approve of what I said. She but feebly blamed me, when she spoke, for not hearing what Mr. Solmes had to say. He himself seemed not now very earnest to be heard. My uncle said, There was no talking to me. And I should have absolutely silenced both gentlemen, had not my brother come in again to their assistance.                   This was the strange speech he made at his entrance his eyes flaming with anger; This prating girl has struck you all dumb, I perceive. Persevere however, Mr. Solmes. I have heard every word she has said: And I know no other method of being even with her, than, after she is yours, to make her as sensible of your power, as she now makes you of her insolence.                   Fie, cousin Harlowe! said my auntÑCould I have thought a <i>brother</i> would have said this to a gentleman, of a <i>sister?</i>                   I must, tell you, Madam, said he, that <i>you</i> give the rebel courage. You yourself seem to favour too much the arrogance of her sex in her; otherwise she durst not have thus stopp'd her uncle's mouth by reflections upon him; as well as denied to hear a gentleman tell her the danger she is in from a libertine, whose protection, as she has plainly hinted, she intends to claim against her family.                      <i>Stopped my uncle's mouth, by reflexions upon him, Sir!</i> said I, How can that be! How <i>dare</i> you to make such an application as This!                   My aunt wept at his reflection upon her.ÑCousin, said she to him, If <i>This</i> be the thanks I have for my trouble, I have done: Your father would not treat me thus:ÑAnd I <i>will</i> say, that the hint you gave was an unbrotherly one.                   Not more unbrotherly than all the rest of his conduct to me, of late, Madam, said I. I see, by this specimen of his violence, how every-body has been brought into his measures. Had I any the least apprehension of ever being in Mr. Solmes's power, this <i>might</i> have affected me. But you see, Sir, to Mr. Solmes, what a conduct is thought necessary to enable you to arrive at your ungenerous end. You see how my brother <i>courts</i> for you!                        I disclaim Mr. Harlowe's violence, Madam, with all my soul. I will never remind youÑ                   Silence, worthy Sir! said I; I will take care you never shall have the opportunity.                   Less violence, Clary, said my uncle. Cousin James, you are as much to blame as your sister.                   In then came my sister. Brother, said she, you kept not your promise. You are thought to be to blame within, as well as here. Were not Mr. Solmes's generosity and affection to the girl <i>well</i> known, what you have said would be inexcusable. My papa desires to speak with you; and with you, aunt; and with you, uncle; and with you, Mr. Solmes, if you please.                   They all four withdrew into the next apartment.                   I stood silent, as not knowing, till she spoke, how to take this intervention of my sister's.ÑO thou perverse thing, said she, (poking out her angry face at me, when they were all gone, but speaking spitefully low)ÑWhat troubles do you give to us all!                   You and my brother, Bella, said I, give trouble to yourselves; for neither you nor he have any business to concern yourselves about me.                   She threw out some spiteful expressions, still in a low voice, as if she chose not to be heard without; and I thought it best to oblige her to raise her tone a little, if I could. If I <i>could,</i> did I say? It is easy to make a passionate spirit answer all our views upon it.                   She accordingly flamed out in a raised tone: And this brought my cousin Dolly in to us. Miss Harlowe, your company is desired.                   I will come presently, cousin Dolly.                   But again provoking a severity from me which she could not bear, and calling me names; in once more came Dolly, with another message, that her company was desired.                   Not mine, I doubt, Miss Dolly, said I.                   The sweet-temper'd girl burst out into tears, and shook her head.                        Go in before me, child, said Bella (vexed to set her concern for me), with thy sharp face like a new moon: What dost thou cry for? Is it to make thy keen face look still keener?                   I believe Bella was blamed, too, when she went in; for I heard her say, The <i>creature</i> was so provoking there was no keeping a resolution.                   Mr. Solmes, after a little while, came in again by himself, to take leave of me: Full of scrapes and compliments; but too well tutored and encouraged, to give me hope of his declining. He begged me not to impute to him any of the severe things to which he had been a sorrowful witness. He besought my compassion, as he called it.                   He said, the result was, That he had still hopes given him; and, altho' discouraged by me, he was resolved to persevere, while I remained single:ÑAnd such long and such painful services he talk'd of, as never were heard of.                   I told him, in the strongest manner, what he had to trust to.                   Yet still he determined to persist.ÑWhile I was no man's else, he must hope.                   What! said I, will you still persist, when I declare, as I now do, that my affections are engaged?ÑAnd let my brother make the most of it.Ñ                   He knew my principles, and adored me for them.                   He doubted not, that it was in his power to make me happy: And he was sure I would not want the will to be so.                   I assured him, that, were I to be carried to my uncle's, it should answer no end; for I would never see him; nor receive a line from him; nor hear a word in his favour, whoever were the person who should mention him to me.                   He was sorry for it. He must be miserable, were I to hold in that mind. But he doubted not, that I might be induced by my father and uncles to change it.Ñ                        Never, never, he might depend upon it.                   It was richly worth his patience, and the trial.                   At my <i>expence?</i>ÑAt the price of all my <i>happiness,</i> Sir?                   He hoped I should be induced to think otherwise.                   And then would he have run into his fortune, his settlements, his affectionÑVowing, that never man loved a woman with so sincere a passion, as he loved me.                   I stopp'd him, as to the first part of his speech: And to the second, of the sincerity of his passion;ÑWhat then, Sir, said I, is your love to one, who must assure you, that never young creature looked upon man with a sincerer disapprobation, than I look upon you: And tell me, What argument can you urge, that this <i>true</i> declaration answers not beforehand?                   Dearest Madam, what can I say?ÑOn my knees I begÑ                   And down the ungraceful wretch dropp'd on his knees.                   Let me not kneel in vain, Madam: Let me not be thus despised.ÑAnd he looked most odiously sorrowful.                   I have kneeled too, Mr. Solmes: Often have I kneeled: And I will kneel againÑEven to <i>you,</i> Sir, will I kneel, if there be so much merit in kneeling; provided you will not be the implement of my cruel brother's undeserved persecution.Ñ                   If all the services, even to worship you during my whole lifeÑYou, Madam, invoke and expect mercy, yet shew noneÑ                   Am I to be cruel to myself, to shew mercy to you?ÑTake my estate, Sir, with all my heart, since you are such a favourite in This house!ÑOnly leave me <i>myself</i>ÑThe mercy you ask for, do <i>you</i> shew to others.                   It you mean to my relations, MadamÑunworthy as they are, all shall be done that you shall prescribe.                   Who, I, Sir, to find you bowels you naturally have not? I to purchase <i>their</i> happiness, by the forfeiture of <i>my own</i>? What I ask you for, is mercy to myself: That, since you seem to have some power over my relations, you will use it in my behalf. Tell them, that you see I cannot conquer my aversion to you: Tell them, if you are a wise man, that you value too much your own happiness, to risque it against such a determin'd antipathy: Tell them, that I am unworthy of your offers: And that, in mercy to yourself, as well as to me, you will not prosecute a suit so impossible to be granted.                   I will risque all consequences, said the fell wretch, rising, with a countenance whiten'd over, as if with malice, his hollow eyes flashing fire, and biting his under-lip, to shew he could be <i>manly.</i> Your hatred, Madam, shall be no objection with me: And I doubt not in a few days to have it in my power to shew youÑ                   YOU have it in your power, SirÑ                   He came well offÑ<i>To shew you</i> more generosity, than, noble as you are said to be to others, you shew to me.                   The man's face became his anger: It seems form'd to express the passion.                   At that instant, again came in my brotherÑSister, sister, sister, said he, with his teeth set, act on the termagant part you have so newly assumedÑMost wonderfully well does it become you. It is but a short one, however. Tyranness in your turn! accuse others of your own guilt!ÑBut leave her, leave her, Mr. Solmes; her time is short. You'll find her humble and mortify'd enough very quickly!ÑThen, how like a little tame fool will she look, with her conscience upbraiding her, and begging of you [with a whining voice, the barbarous brother spoke] to forgive and forget!Ñ                   More he said, as he flew out, with a face as red as scarlet, upon Shorey's coming in to recal him, on his violence.                        I removed from chair to chair, excessively frighted and disturbed, at this brutal treatment.                   The man attempted to excuse himself, as being sorry for my brother's passion.                   Leave me, leave me, Sir, fanningÑor I shall faint. And indeed I thought I should.                   He recommended himself to my favour with an air of assurance; augmented, as I thought, by a distress so visible in me; for he even snatched my trembling, my struggling hand; and ravish'd it to his odious mouth.                   I flung from him with high disdain: And he withdrew, bowing and cringing; self-gratify'd, and enjoying, as I thought, the confusion he saw me in.                   The creature is now, methinks, before me; and now I see him aukwardly striding backward, as he retired, till the edge of the open'd door, which he run against, remember'd him to turn his welcome back upon me.                   Upon his withdrawing, Betty brought me word, that I was permitted to go up to my own chamber: And was bid to consider of every-thing: For my time was short. Nevertheless, she believed I might be permitted to stay till Saturday.                   She tells me, That altho' my brother and sister were blam'd for being so <i>hasty</i> with me, yet when they made <i>their</i> report, and my uncle Antony <i>his,</i> of my provocations, they were all more determin'd than ever in Mr. Solmes's favour.                   The wretch himself, she tells me, pretends to be more in love with me than before; and to be rather delighted, than discouraged, with the conversation that passed between us. He run on, she says, in raptures, about the grace wherewith I should dignify his board; and the like sort of stuff, either of <i>his</i> saying, or <i>her</i> making.                   She closed all with a Now is my time to submit with a grace, and to make my own terms with him:Ñ Else, <i>she</i> can tell me, were <i>she</i> Mr. Solmes, it should be worse for me: And who, Miss, of <i>our</i> sex, proceeded the saucy creature, would admire a rakish gentleman, when she might be admired by a sober one to the end of the chapter?                   The creature tells me, I have had <i>amazing</i> good luck, to keep my writings concealed so cunningly? I must needs think, that she knows I am always at my pen: And as I endeavour to hide that knowlege from her, she is not obliged to keep my secret. But that she loves not to aggravate. She had rather reconcile by much. Peace-making is her talent, and ever was. And had she been as much my foe, as I imagined, I had not perhaps been here now.ÑBut this, however, she said not to make a merit with me: For, truly, it would be better for me the sooner everything was over with me. And better for her, and every-one else; that was certain.ÑYet one hint she must conclude with; that my pen and ink, she would assure me (soon as I was to go away), would not be long in my power. And then, having lost <i>that</i> amusement, it would be seen, how a mind so active as mine, would be able to employ itself.                   This hint has such an effect upon me, that I shall instantly begin to conceal, in different places, pens, ink, and paper; and to deposite some in the ivy-summer-house, if I can find a safe place; and, at the worst, I have got a pencil of black, and another of red, lead, which I use in my drawings; and my patterns shall serve for paper, if I have no other.                   How lucky it was, that I had got away my papers! They made a strict search for them; That I can see, by the disorderly manner they have left all things in: For you know that I am such an observer of method, that I can go to a bit of ribband, or lace, or edging, blindfold: The same in my books; which they have strangely disordered and mismatched, to look <i>behind</i> them, and <i>in</i> some of them, I suppose. My cloaths, too, are rumpled not a little. No place has escaped them. To your hint, I thank you, are they indebted for their disappointment.                   The pen, thro' heaviness and fatigue, dropp'd out of my fingers, at the word <i>indebted.</i> I resume it, to finish the sentence; and to tell you, that I am,                      Your for-ever obliged and affectionate CL. HARLOWE.

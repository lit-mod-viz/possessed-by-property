                    "I will not repeat, what I have before written in Mr. Hickman's behalf. I will only remind you of an observation I have made to you more than once, that you have outlived your first passion; and had the second man been an angel, the second man would not have been more than indifferent to you."                      "My motives for suspending, <i>proceeds she,</i> were not merely ceremonious ones. I was really very ill. I could not hold up my head. The contents of my sisters letters had pierced my heart. And was I, my dear, to be as ready to accept the second man offer, as if I were afraid, the second man never would repeat his offer?"                      "So, my dear, you seem to think, that there was a fate in my error. The cordial, the considering friend, is seen in the observation you make on this occasion. Yet since things have happen'd as things have have, would to heaven I could hear, that all the world acquitted my father, or, at least, my mother; for my mother character, before these family-feuds broke out, was every-one's admiration. Don't let any-body say from you, so that any-body may come to <i>her</i> ear, that my mother might, by a timely exertion of my mother fine talents, have saved my mother unhappy child. You'll observe, my dear, that in my mother own good time, when my mother saw that there was not likely to be an end to my brother's persecutions, my mother was resolved to exert my mother. But the pragmatical daughter, by the fatal meeting, precipitated all, and frustrated my mother indulgent designs. O my dear, I am now convinced, by dear experience, that while children are so happy as to have parents or guardians, whom children <i>may</i> consult, children should not presume (no, not with the best and purest intentions) to follow children own conceits, in material cases."                      "A ray of hope of future reconciliation, <i>adds she,</i> darts in upon my mind, from the intention you tell me my mother had to exert my mother in my favour, had I not gone away. And my hope is the stronger, as this communication points out to me, that my uncle Harlowe's interest is likely, in my mother's opinion, to be of weight, if it could be engaged. it will behove me, perhaps, to apply to that dear uncle, if a proper occasion offer."

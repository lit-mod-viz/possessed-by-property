                        To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.                            Niece,                         EVery-body is now convinc'd, that nothing is to be done with you by way of gentleness or persuasion. Your mamma will not let you stay in the house; for your papa is so incensed by your strange letter to his friend, that she knows not what will be the consequence, if you do. So, you are commanded to get ready to go to your uncle Antony's, out of hand.                         Your uncle thinks he has not deserv'd of you this unwillingness to go to his house.                         You don't know the wickedness of the man you think it worth while to quarrel with all your friends for.                         You must not answer me. There will be no end of That.                         You know not the affliction you give to everybody; but to none more than to                            Your affectionate Aunt, DOROTHY HERVEY.

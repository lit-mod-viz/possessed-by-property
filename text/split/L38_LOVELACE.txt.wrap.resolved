                     <i>Sunday, Aug.</i> 13.             I Don't know what a devil ails me; but I never was so much indisposed in my life. At first, I thought some of my blessed relations here had got a dose administred to me, in order to get the whole house to some of my blessed relations here. But as I am the hopes of the family, I believe the family would not be so wicked.             I must lay down my pen. I cannot write with any spirit at all. What a plague can be the matter with me!             LORD M. paid me just now a cursed gloomy visit, to ask how I do after bleeding. LORD M. sisters both drove away yesterday, God be thanked. But His sisters both asked not my leave; and hardly bid me good-bye. God was more tender, and more dutiful than I expected. Men are less unforgiving than women. I have reason to say so, I am sure. For, besides implacable Miss Harlowe, and the old Ladies, the two Montague Apes han't been near God yet.             NEITHER eat, drink, nor sleep!ÑA piteous case, Jack! If I should die like a fool now, people would say Miss Harlowe had broke my heart.ÑThat she <i>vexes</i> me to the heart, is certain.             Confounded squeamish! I would fain write it off. But must lay down my pen again. It won't do. Poor Lovelace!ÑWhat a devil ails thee?             WELL, but now let's try for'tÑHoyÑHoyÑHoy! Confound me for a gaping puppy, how I yawn!ÑWhere shall I begin? At thy Executorship?ÑThou shalt have a double office of thy Executorship?ÑThou shalt: For I really think thou mayst send me a coffin and a shroud. I shall be ready for a coffin and a shroud by the time a coffin and a shroud can come down.             What a little fool is this Miss Harlowe! I warrant             'll now repent that              refused me. Such a lovely young widowÑWhat a charming widow would              have made! How would              have adorned the weeds! To be a widow in the first twelvemonth is one of the greatest felicities that can befall a fine lady. Such pretty employment in <i>new dismals,</i> when              had hardly worn round              <i>blazing joyfuls!</i> Such lights, and such shades! how would they set off one another, and be adorned by the wearer!Ñ             Go to the devil!ÑI <i>will</i> write!ÑCan I do any-thing else?             they would not have me write, Belford.ÑI must be ill indeed, when I can't write.Ñ             BUT thou seemest nettled, Jack! Is it because I was stung? it is not for two friends, any more than for man and wife, to be out of patience at one time. Ñ What must be the consequence, if Ñ are?ÑI am in no fighting mood just now: But as patient and passive as the chickens that are brought me in brothÑFor I am come to that already.             But I can tell thee, for all this, be <i>thy own man,</i> if thou wilt, as to the Executorship, I will never suffer thee to expose my letters. They are too ingenuous by half to be seen. And I absolutely insist upon my letters, that, on receipt of this, thou burn them all.             I will never forgive thee that impudent and unfriendly reflection, of my <i>cavaliering</i> it here over half a dozen persons of distinction: Remember, too, thy poor <i>helpless orphan</i>ÑThese reflections are too serious; and thou art also too serious, for me to let these things go off as jesting; notwithstanding the Roman stile is preserved; and, indeed, but just preserved. By my soul, Jack, if I had not been taken thus egregiously cropsick, I would have been up with thee, and the lady too, before now.             But write on, however: And send me copies, if thou canst, of all that passes between our Charlotte and Miss Harlowe. I'll take no notice of what thou communicatest of that sort. I like not the people here the worse for their generous offer to the lady. But you see the lady is as proud as implacable. There's no obliging the lady. the lady'd rather sell the lady cloaths, than be beholden to any-body, altho' the lady would oblige by permitting the obligation.             Oh Lord! Oh Lord!ÑMortal illÑAdieu, Jack!             I WAS forced to leave off, I was so ill, at this place. And what dost think? My uncle brought the parson of the parish to pray by me; for My uncle chaplain is at Oxford. I was lain down in my night-gown over my waistcoat, and in a doze: And, when I open'd my eyes, who should I see, but the parson of the parish kneeling on one side the bed; Lord M. on the other; Mrs. Greme, who had been sent for to <i>tend me,</i> as they call it, at the feet: God be thanked, my Lord, said I, in an ecstasy!ÑWhere's Miss? Ñ For I thought they were going to marry me.             they thought me delirious, at first, and pray'd louder and louder.             This roused me: Off the bed I started; slid the feet into my slippers; put my hand in my waistcoat pocket, and pulled out thy letter with my Beloved's meditations in thy letter: My Lord, Dr. Wright, Mrs. Greme, you have thought me a very wicked fellow: But, see! I can read you as good as you can read me.             My Lord, Dr. Wright, Mrs. Greme stared at one another. I gaped, and read, Poor moÑorÑtals the cauÑoÑause of My Lord, Dr. Wright, Mrs. Greme own Ñ My Lord, Dr. Wright, Mrs. Greme own misÑserÑry.             It is as suitable to my case, as to the lady's, as thou'lt observe, if thou readest it again. At the passage where it is said, That when a man is chastened for sin, a man beauty consumes away, I stept to the glass: A poor figure, by Jupiter, cried I!ÑAnd they all praised and admired me; lifted up they all hands and they all eyes; and the Doctor said, the Doctor always thought it impossible, that a man of my sense could be so wild as the world said I was. My Lord chuckled for joy; congratulated me; and, thank my dear Miss Harlowe, I got high reputation among good, bad, and indifferent. In short, I have established My Lord for ever with all here.ÑBut, O Belford, even this will not do!ÑI must leave off again.                  A VISIT from the Montague sisters, led in by my hobling uncle, to congratulate my amendment and reformation both in one. What a lucky event this illness, with this meditation in my pocket; for we were all to pieces before! Thus, when a boy, have I joined with a croud coming out of church, and have been thought to have been there myself.             I am incensed at the insolence of the young Levite. Thou wilt highly oblige me, if thou'lt find wilt out, and send me wilt ears in the next letter.             My charmer mistakes me, if              thinks I proposed              writing to myself, as an alternative that should dispense with my attendance upon             . That it shall <i>not</i> do, nor did I intend it should, unless              had pleased me better in the contents of it than              has done. Bid              read again. I gave no such hopes. I would have been with              in spite of you both, by to-morrow, at farthest, had I not been laid by the heels thus, like a helpless miscreant.             But I grow better and better every hour, <i>I</i> say: The <i>Doctor</i> says not: But I am sure I know best: And I will soon be in London, depend on't. But say nothing of this to my dear, cruel, and implacable Miss Harlowe.             AÑdieuÑu, JaÑaackÑWhat a gaping puppy (YawÑn! yawÑn! yawÑn!)                 	<i>Thy</i> LOVELACE.

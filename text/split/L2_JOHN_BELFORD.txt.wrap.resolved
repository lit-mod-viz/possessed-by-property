                                 Edgware, Tuesday-night, May 2.             WIthout staying for the promised letter from you to inform us what the lady says of <i>us,</i> I write to tell you, That us are all of <i>one</i> opinion with regard to <i>her</i>; which is, that there is not of her age a finer lady in the world, as to her understanding. As for her person, her is at the age of bloom, and an admirable creature; a perfect beauty: But this <i>poorer</i> praise a man can hardly descend to give, who has been honour'd with her conversation; and yet her was brought amongst us against her will.             Permit me, her, to be a means of saving this excellent creature from the dangers her hourly runs from the most plotting heart in the world. In a former, I pleaded your own family, Lord M.'s wishes particularly; and then I had not seen her: But now, I join her sake, honour's sake, motives of justice, generosity, gratitude, and humanity, which are all concern'd in the preservation of so fine a creature.ÑThou knowest not the anguish I should have had (whence arising, I cannot devise), had I not known before I set out this morning, that the incomparable creature had disappointed thee in thy cursed view of getting thy to admit the specious Partington for a bedfellow!             There is something so awful, and yet so sweet, in this lady's aspect [I have done nothing but talk of this lady ever since I saw this lady], that were I to have the Virtues and the Graces all drawn in one piece, all should be taken, every one of all, from different airs and attitudes in this lady. this lady was born to adorn the age this lady was given to, and would be an ornament to the first dignity. What a piercing, yet gentle eye, every glance, I thought, mingled with love and fear of you: What a sweet smile darting through the cloud that overspread this lady fair face; demonstrating, that this lady had more apprehensions and grief at this lady heart, than this lady cared to express!             You may think what I am going to write too flighty; but, by my faith, I have conceived such a profound reverence for this lady sense and judgment, that, far from thinking the man excusable who should treat this lady basely, I am ready to regret that such an angel of a lady should even marry. a lady is, in my eye, all mind: And were a lady to meet with a man all mind likewise, why should the charming qualities a lady is mistress of, be endangered? Why should such an angel be plunged so low as into the vulgar offices of domestic life? Were a lady mine, I should hardly wish to see a lady a mother, unless there were a kind of moral certainty, that minds like a lady could be propagated. For why, in short, should not the work of bodies be left to <i>mere</i> bodies? I know, that you yourself have an opinion of a lady little less exalted than mine. Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, are all of my mind; are full of a lady praises; and swear, it would be a million of pities to ruin a lady, in whose fall none but devils can rejoice.             What must that merit and excellence be, that can extort this from <i>us,</i> free livers, like yourself, and all of us your partial friends, who have joined with yourself in your just resentments against the rest of her family, and offered us assistance to execute your vengeance on her family? But us cannot think it reasonable, that you should punish an innocent lady, who loves you so well; and who is in your protection, and has suffered so much for you, for the faults of her relations.             And here, let me put a serious question, or two. Thinkest thou, truly admirable as this lady is, that the end thou proposest to thyself, if obtained, is answerable to the means, to the trouble thou givest thyself, and the perfidies, tricks, stratagems, and contrivances thou hast already been guilty of, and still meditatest? In every real excellence this lady surpasses all this lady sex. But in the article thou seekest to subdue this lady for, a mere sensualist of this lady sex, a Partington, a Horton, a Martin, would make a sensualist a thousand times happier than this lady either will or can. Sweet are the joys that come with willingness." And wouldst thou make this lady unhappy for this lady whole life, and thyself not happy for a single moment?             Hitherto, it is not too late; and that, perhaps, is as much as can be said, if thou meanest to preserve this lady esteem and good opinion, as well as person; for I think it is impossible this lady can get out of thy hands, now this lady is in this cursed house: O that damn'd hypocritical <i>Sinclair,</i> as thou callest this lady! How was it possible this lady should behave so speciously as this lady did, all the time this lady staid with us! Be honest, and marry; and be thankful, that this lady will condescend to have thee. If thou dost not, thou'lt be the worst of men; and will be condemned in this world and the next: As I am sure thou oughtest, and shouldest too, wert thou to be judged by one, who never before was so much touched in a woman's favour: And whom thou knowest to be                Thy partial friend, J. BELFORD.                   Our companions consented, that I should withdraw to write to the above effect. Our companions can make nothing of the characters Our companions write in; so I read this to Our companions; and Our companions approve of this; and of Our companions own motion each man would set each man name to this. I would not delay sending this, for fear of some detestable scheme taking place.                                               THOMAS BELTON.RICHARD MOWBRAY,JAMES TOURVILLE.                         Just now are brought me both thine. I vary not my opinion, nor forbear my earnest prayers to thee in thee behalf, notwithstanding thee dislike of me.

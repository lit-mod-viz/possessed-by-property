                  Monday, April 24.             FATE is weaving a whimsical web for thy friend; and I see not but I shall be inevitably manacled.             Here have I been at work, dig, dig, dig, like a cunning miner, at one time, and spreading my snares, like an artful fowler, at another, and exulting in my contrivances to get this inimitable creature absolutely into my power;ÑEvery thing made for me. ÑHer brother and uncle were but my pioneers: ÑHer father storm'd as I directed him to storm. ÑHer was acted by the springs I set at work: ÑHer daughter was moving for me, and yet imagin'd Her daughter plumb against me: And the dear creature herself had already run Her daughter stubborn neck into my gin, and knew not that Her daughter was caught; for I had not drawn my sprindges close about Her daughter.ÑAnd just as all this was completed, wouldst thou believe, that I should be my own enemy, and Her daughter friend?ÑThat I should be so totally diverted from all my favourite purposes, as to propose to marry Her daughter before I went to town, in order to put it out of my own power to resume them?             When thou knowest This, wilt thou not think that my black angel plays me booty, and has taken my black angel plays me booty into wilt head, to urge me on to the indissoluble tie, that wilt might be more sure of wilt (from the complex transgressions to which wilt will certainly stimulate me, when wedded) than perhaps wilt thought wilt could be from the simple sins, in which I have so long allowed wilt, that This, wilt thou seem to have the plea of habit?             Thou wilt be still the more surprized, when I tell Thou wilt, that there seems to be a coalition going forward between the black angels and the white ones; for here has hers induced hers in one hour, and by one retrograde accident, to <i>acknowlege</i> what the charming creature never before acknowleged, a preferable favour for me. hers even owns an intention to be mine;ÑMine, without reformation-conditions:ÑShe permits me to talk of love to hers: Of the irrevocable ceremony: Yet, another extraordinary! postpones the irrevocable ceremony; chooses to set out for London; and even to go to the widow's in town.             Well, but how comes all this about, methinks thou askest?ÑThou, Lovelace, dealest in wonders, yet aimest not at the <i>Marvellous.</i>ÑHow did all this come about?             I'll tell theeÑI was in danger of losing my charmer for ever.ÑShe was soaring upward to ÑShe native skies. ÑShe was got above earth, by means, too, of the <i>Earth-born:</i> And something extraordinary was to be done to keep ÑShe with us Sublunaries. And what so effectually as the soothing voice of Love, and the attracting offer of Matrimony from a man not hated, can fix the attention of the maiden heart aking with uncertainty; and before impatient of the questionable question?             This, in short, was the case.ÑWhile ÑWhile was refusing all manner of obligation to me, keeping me at haughty distance; in hopes that ÑWhile cousin Morden's arrival would soon fix ÑWhile in a full and absolute independence of me: Disgusted likewise at ÑWhile adorer, for holding her adorer the reins of her adorer own passions, instead of giving them up to ÑWhile controul:ÑShe writes a letter, urging an answer to a letter before written, for ÑWhile apparel, ÑWhile jewels, and some gold, which ÑWhile had left behind ÑWhile; all which was to save ÑWhile pride from obligation, and to promote the independence ÑWhile heart was set upon.ÑAnd what follow'd but a shocking answer, made still more shocking by the communication of a paternal curse upon a daughter, deserving only blessings?ÑA curse upon the curser's heart, and a double one upon the transmitter's, the spiteful, the envious Arabella!             Absent when it came; on my return, I found ÑWhile, recovering from fits, again to fall into stronger fits; and no-body expecting ÑWhile life; half a dozen messengers dispatch'd to find me out.ÑNor wonder at ÑWhile being so affected; ÑWhile, whose filial piety gave ÑWhile dreadful faith in a father's curses; and the curse of this gloomy tyrant extending, to use ÑWhile own words, when ÑWhile could speak, <i>to both worlds.</i>ÑO that it had turn'd, in the moment of it utterance, to a mortal quinsey, and sticking in a mortal quinsey gullet, had choak'd the old execrator, as a warning to all such unnatural fathers.             What a miscreant had I been, not to have endeavoured to bring              back, by all the endearments, by all the vows, by all the offers that I could make             ?             I did bring              back. More than a father to             ; for I have given              a life              unnatural father had well-nigh taken away; shall I not cherish the fruits of my own benefaction?ÑI have been in earnest in my vows to marry, and my ardour to urge the present time was a <i>real</i> ardour. But extreme dejection, with a mingled delicacy, that in              dying moments I doubt not              will preserve, have caused              to refuse me the <i>time,</i> tho' not the solemnity; for              has told me, that now              must be wholly in my protection, <i>being destitute of every other!</i>ÑMore indebted still, thou seest, to              cruel friends, than to             , for              favour!                          has written to Miss Howe an account of their barbarity; but has not acquainted             , how very ill              was.             Low, very low,              remains; yet, dreading              stupid brother's enterprize,              wants to be in London: Where, but for <i>this</i> accident, and (wouldst thou have believed it?) my persuasions, seeing              so very ill,              would have been this night; and we shall actually set out on Wednesday morning, if              be not worse.             And now for a few words with thee, on thy heavy preachment of Saturday last.             Thou art apprehensive, that the Lady is now in danger indeed; and it is a miracle thou tellest me, if the Lady stand such an attempter: "Knowing what we know of the sex, thou sayest, thou shouldst dread, wert thou me, to make farther trial, lest thou shouldst succeed." And, in another place, tellest me, "That thou pleadest not for the state, for any favour thou hast for it."             What an advocate art thou for matrimony!ÑThou wert ever an unhappy fellow at argument. Does the trite stuff with which the rest of thy letter abounds, in <i>favour</i> of wedlock, strike with the force that this does <i>against</i> it?             Thou takest great pains to convince me, and that from the distresses the Lady is reduced to [chiefly by the Lady friends persecutions and implacableness, I hope thou wilt own, and not from me as yet], that the proposed trial will not be a fair trial. But let me ask thee, Is not calamity the test of virtue? And wouldst thou not have me value this charming creature upon proof of her merits?ÑDo I not intend to reward her by marriage, if her stand that proof?             But why repeat I, what I have said before?ÑTurn back, thou egregious arguer, turn back to my long letter of the 13th; and thou wilt there find every syllable of what thou hast written, either answer'd or invalidated.             But I am not angry with thee, Jack. I love opposition. As gold is try'd by fire, and virtue by temptation; so is sterling wit by opposition. Have I not, before thou settedst out as an advocate for my fair one, often brought thee in, as making objections to my proceedings, for no other reason than to exalt thee by proving thee a man of straw? As Homer raises up many of Homer champions, and gives them terrible names, only to have them knock'd on the head by Homer heroes.             However, take to thee this one piece of adviceÑEvermore be sure of being in the right, when thou presumest to sit down to correct thy master.             Well, but to return to my principal subject; let me observe, that be my future resolutions what they will, as to this lady, the contents of the violent letter this lady has received, have set me at least a month forward with this lady. I can now, as I hinted, talk of Love and Marriage, without controul or restriction; this lady injunctions no more my terror.                  In this sweetly familiar way shall we set out together for London. Mrs. Sorlings's eldest daughter, at my motion, is to attend this lady in the chaise; while I ride by way of escorte: For this lady is extremely apprehensive of the Singleton plot; and has engag'd me to be all patience, if any thing should happen on the road. But nothing I am sure <i>will</i> happen: For, by a letter received just now from Joseph, I understand, that James Harlowe has already laid aside James Harlowe stupid project: And This by the earnest desire of all James Harlowe friends to whom James Harlowe had communicated it; who were afraid of the consequences that might attend it. But it is not over with <i>me,</i> however; altho' I am not determin'd at present, as to the uses I may make of it.             My beloved tells me,              shall have              cloaths sent             :              hopes also              jewels, and some gold, which              left behind             . But Joseph says, cloaths <i>only</i> will be sent. I will not, however, tell              that: On the contrary, I say, there is no doubt, but they will send <i>all</i>              wrote for, of personals. The greater              disappointment from they, the greater must be              dependence on             .             But, after all, I hope I shall be enabled to be honest to a merit so transcendent. The devil take thee tho', for thy opinion given so mal-â¡-propo', that              may be overcome.             If thou designest to be honest, methinks thou say'st, why should not Singleton's plot be over with <i>thee,</i> as it is with her <i>brother?</i>             Because, if I must answer thee, where people are so modestly doubtful of what people are able to do, it is good to leave a loop-hole. And let me add, that when a man's heart is set upon a point, and any thing occurs to beat a man off, a man will find it is very difficult, when the suspending reason ceases, to forbear resumng it.

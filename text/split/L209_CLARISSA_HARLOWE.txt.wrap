                     Honoured Sirs,                   WHEN these lines reach your hands, your late unhappy Niece will have known the end of all her troubles; and, as she humbly hopes, will be rejoicing in the mercies of a gracious God, who has declared, that He will forgive the truly penitent of heart.                   I write, therefore, my dear Uncles, and to you Both in one letter (since your fraternal love has made you Both but as One person) to give you comfort, and not distress; for, however sharp my afflictions have been, they have been but of short duration; and I am betimes (happily as I hope) arrived at the end of a painful journey.                   At the same time, I write to thank you both, for all your kind indulgence to me, and to beg your forgiveness of my last my <i>only</i> great fault to you and to my family.                   The ways of Providence are unsearchable. Various are the means made use of by It, to bring poor sinners to a sense of their duty. Some are drawn by Love; others are driven by Terrors, to their Divine Refuge. I had for Eighteen years out of Nineteen rejoiced in the favour and affection of every one. No trouble came near my heart. I seemed to be one of those designed to be drawn by the silken cords of Love.ÑBut, perhaps, I was too apt to value myself upon the love and favour of every one: The merit of the good I delighted to do, and of the inclinations which were given me, and which I could not help having, I was, perhaps, too ready to attribute to myself; and now, being led to account for the cause of my temporary calamities, find, I had a secret pride to be punished for, which I had not fathomed: And it was necessary perhaps that some sore and terrible misfortunes should befal me, in order to mortify my pride and my vanity.                   Temptations were accordingly sent. I shrunk in the day of tryal. My discretion, which had been so cry'd up, was found wanting when it came to be weighed in an equal balance. I was betrayed, fell, and became the by-word of my companions, and a disgrace to my family, which had prided itself in me perhaps too much. But as my fault was not that of a culpable will, when my pride was sufficiently mortified (altho' I was surrounded by dangers, and intangled in snares) I was not suffered to be totally lost: But, purified by sufferings, I was fitted for the change I have NOW, at the time you will receive This, so newly, and, as I humbly hope, so happily experienced.                   Rejoice with me then, dear Sirs, that I have weathered so great a storm. Nor let it be matter of concern, that I am cut off in the bloom of youth. "There is no inquisition in the grave, whether we lived ten or an hundred years; and the day of death is better than the day of our birth."                   Once more, dear Sirs, accept my grateful thanks for all your goodness to me, from my early childhood, to the day, the unhappy day, of my error! Forgive that error!ÑAnd God give us a happy meeting in a blessed Eternity, prays,                      Your most dutiful and obliged Kinswoman, <i>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</i>

<i>Cocoa-tree,</i>                      <i>Saturday, May</i> 27.             THIS Ipecacuanha is a most disagreeable medicine? That these cursed physical folks can find out nothing to do us good, but what would poison the devil? In the other world, were these cursed physical folks can find out nothing to do us good, but what would poison the devil only to take physic, it would be punishment enough of it for a mis-spent life. A doctor at one elbow, and an apothecary at the other, and the poor soul labouring under the other prescribed operations, A doctor at one elbow, and an apothecary at the other, and the poor soul labouring under their prescribed operations need no worse tormentors.             But now this was to take down my countenance. this has done this: For, with violent reachings, having taken enough to make me sick, and not enough water to carry this off, I presently looked as if I had kept my bed a fortnight. <i>Ill-jesting,</i> as I thought in the midst of the exercise, <i>with edge-tools,</i> and worse with <i>physical ones.</i>             Two hours this held me. I had forbid Dorcas to let my beloved know any thing of the matter; out of tenderness to Dorcas; being willing, when Dorcas knew my prohibition, to let Dorcas see that I <i>expected</i> Dorcas to be concerned for Dorcas:ÑWhat a worthless fellow must <i>he</i> be, whose own heart gives a worthless fellow must <i>he</i> up, as deserving of no one's regard!             Well, but Dorcas nevertheless is a <i>woman,</i> and Dorcas can <i>whisper</i> to Dorcas lady the secret her lady is injoin'd to keep!             Come hither, you toad (sick as a devil at the instant); Let me see what a mixture of grief and surprize may be beat up together in thy pudden-face.             That won't do. That dropt jaw, and mouth dstended into the long oval, is more upon the Horrible, than the Grievous.             Nor that pinking and winking with thy <i>odious eyes,</i> as my charmer once called them.                  A little better <i>That</i>; yet not quite right: But keep your mouth closer. You have a muscle or two which you have no command of, between your cheek-bone and your lips, that should carry one corner of your mouth up towards your crows-foot, and that down to meet one corner of your mouth.             There! Begone! Be in a plaguy hurry running up stairs and down, to fetch from the dining-room what you carry up on purpose to fetch, till motion extraordinary put you out of breath, and give you the sigh-natural.             What's the matter, Dorcas?             Nothing, Madam.             My beloved wonders Dorcas has not seen me this morning, no doubt; but is too shy to say Dorcas wonders. Repeated What's the matter's, however, as Dorcas runs up and down stairs by Dorcas door, bring on, Oh! Madam,! my master!Ñmy master!             What! How! When!ÑAnd all the monosyllables of surprize.             [Within parenthesis let me tell thee, that I have often thought, that the little words in the republic of letters, like the little folks in a nation, are the most significant. The <i>trisyllables,</i> and the <i>rumblers</i> of syllables more than <i>three,</i> are but the good for little <i>magnates.</i>]             I must not tell you, MadamÑMy master ordered me not to tell youÑBut MadamÑMy master is in a worse way than MadamÑMy master thinks for!ÑBut MadamÑMy master would not have <i>you</i> frighted.             High concern took possession of every sweet feature. She pity'd me!ÑBy my soul, She pity'd me!             Where is             ?             Too much in a hurry for good manners [Another parenthesis, Jack! Good manners are so little natural, that we ought to be <i>compos'd</i> to observe them: Politeness will not live in a storm], I cannot stay to answer questions, cries the wenchÑtho' desirous to answer [A third parenthesisÑLike the people crying proclamations, running away from the customers the people crying proclamations want to sell to]. This hurry puts the lady in a hurry to ask [A fourth, by way of embellishing the third!] as the other does the people in a hurry to buy. And I have in my eye now a whole street raised, and running after a proclamation or express crier, as if the first was a thief, the other the first was a thief pursuers.             At last, O Lord! let Mrs. Lovelace know!ÑThere is danger, to be sure! whisper'd from one nymph to another, in Mrs. Lovelace know!ÑThere hearing; but at the door, and so loud, that my listening fair one might hear.             Out Mrs. Lovelace know!ÑThere darts.ÑAs how! as how, Dorcas!             O MadamÑA vomiting of blood! A vessel broke, to be sure!             Down Mrs. Lovelace know!ÑThere hastens; finds every one as busy over my blood in the entry, as if it were that of the Neapolitan saint.             In steps my charmer! with a face of sweet concern.                <i>How do you,</i> Mr. Lovelace?             O my best love!ÑVery well!ÑVery well!ÑNothing at all! Nothing of consequence!ÑI shall be well in an instant!Ñstraining again; for I was indeed plaguy sick, tho' no more blood came.             In short, Belford, I have gain'd my end. I see the dear soul loves me. I see the dear soul forgives me all that's past. I see I have credit for a new score.             Miss Howe, I defy thee, my dearÑMrs. Townsend!ÑWho the devil are you?ÑTroop away with your contrabands. No smuggling! Nor smuggler, but thee! Nor will the choicest of my fair one's favours be long prohibited goods to thee!             EVERY one now is sure, that              loves me. Tears were in              eyes more than once for me.              suffer'd me to take              hand, and kiss her hand as often as I pleased. On Mrs. Sinclair's mentioning, that I too much confin'd thee,              pressed me to take an airing; but obligingly desired me to be careful of thee. Wish'd I would advise with a physician. <i>God made physicians,</i>              said.             I did not think That, Jack. God indeed made us All. But I fansy              meant <i>physic</i> instead of <i>physicians</i>; and then the phrase might mean what the vulgar phrase means;Ñ<i>God sends meat, the devil cooks.</i>             I was well already, on taking the styptic from <i>her</i> dear hands.             On              requiring me to take the air, I asked, If I might have the honour of              company in a coach; and This, that I might observe if              had an intention of going out in my absence.             If              thought a chair were not a more proper vehicle for my case,              would with all              heart!             There's a precious!             I kiss'd              hand again!              was all goodness!ÑWould to Heaven I better deserv'd it, I said!ÑBut all were golden days before us!ÑHer presence and generous concern had done every thing. I was well! Nothing ailed me. But since my beloved will have it so, I'll take a little airing!ÑLet a chair be called!ÑO my charmer!Ñwere I to have owed this indisposition to my late harasses, and to the uneasiness I have had for disobliging you; all is infinitely compensated by your goodness!ÑAll the art of healing is in your the art of healing late displeasure was the only malady!             While Mrs. Sinclair, and Dorcas, and Polly, and even poor silly Mabell (for Sally went out, as my angel came in), with uplifted hands and eyes, stood thanking Heaven that I was better, in audible whispers: See the power of love, cry'd one!ÑWhat a charming husband, another!ÑHappy couple, all!             O how the dear creature's cheek mantled!ÑHow her eyes sparkled!ÑHow sweetly acceptable is praise to conscious merit, while her eyes sparkled!ÑHow sweetly acceptable but reproaches when apply'd to the undeserving!ÑWhat a new, what a gay creation it makes at once in a diffident or dispirited heart!Ñ                  And now, Belford, was it not worth while to be sick? And yet I must tell thee, that too many pleasanter expedients offer too many pleasanter expedients, to make trial any more of this confounded Ipecacuanha.

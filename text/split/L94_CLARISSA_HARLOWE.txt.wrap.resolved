                        Sat. Morn, 8 o' Clock, April 8.                   WHether you will blame me, or not, I cannot tell, But I have deposited a letter confirming my former resolution to leave this house on Monday next, within the hours, if possible, prefixed in my former. I have not kept a copy of it. But this is the substance:                        I tell                        , "That I have no way to avoid the determin'd resolution of my friends in behalf of Mr. Solmes; but by abandoning this house by Mr. Solmes assistance."                   I have not pretended to make a merit with Mr. Solmes on this score; for I plainly tell Mr. Solmes, "That could I, without an unpardonable sin, the when I <i>would,</i> I would sooner make death my choice, than take a step, which all the world, if not my own heart, will condemn me for taking."                   I tell                   , "That I shall not try to bring any other cloaths with                   , than those I shall have on; and those but my common wearing-apparel; lest I should be suspected. That I must expect to be deny'd the possession of my estate: But that I am determin'd never to consent to a litigation with my father, were I to be reduced to ever so low a state: So that the protection I am to be obliged for, to any one, must be alone for the distress-sake: And yet, that I have too much pride to think of marrying, until I have a fortune that shall make me appear upon a foot of equality with, and void of obligation to, any-body: That, therefore, he will have nothing to hope for from this step, that he had not before: And that, in every light, I reserve to he to accept or refuse he address, as he behaviour and circumspection shall appear to he to deserve."                   I tell he, "That I think it best to go into a private lodging, in the neighbourhood of he aunt Lawrance; and not to his aunt Lawrance house; that it may not appear to the world, that I have refuged he in he family; and that a reconciliation with my friends, may not, on that account, be made impracticable: That I will send for thither my faithful Hannah; and apprize only Miss Howe where I am: That he shall instantly leave me, and go to London, or to one of he uncle's seats; and (as he had promised) not come near he, but by my leave; contenting he with a correspondence by letter only."                      "That if I find he in danger of being discovered, and carried back by violence, I will then throw he directly into the protection of either of he aunts, who will receive me: But This only in case of absolute necessity; for that only in case of absolute necessity will be more to my reputation, for he, by the best means I can, (taking advantage of my privacy) to enter by a second or third hand into a treaty of reconciliation with my friends."                      "That I must, however, plainly tell him, That if, in a treaty of reconciliation with my friends, my friends insist upon my resolveing against marrying him, I will engage to comply with this treaty, my friends insist upon my resolveing against marrying him; provided this treaty, my friends insist upon my resolveing against marrying him will allow me to promise him, that I will never be any other man's, while him remains single, or is living: That this is a compliment I am willing to pay to him, in return for the trouble and pains him has taken, and the usage him has met with, on my account: Altho' I intimate, that him may, in a great measure, thank him, and the little regard him has paid to him reputation; for the slights him has met with."                   I tell him, "That I may, in this privacy, write to my cousin Morden, and, if possible, interest him in my cause."                      "I take some brief notice of him alternatives."                   You must think, my dear, that this unhappy force upon me, and this projected flight, makes it necessary for me to account to him much sooner than it agrees with my stomach to do, for every part of my conduct.                      "It is not to be expected, I tell him, that your mamma will embroil your mamma, or suffer you, or Mr. Hickman to be embroiled, on my account: And as to Mr. Hickman proposal of my going to London, I am such an absolute stranger to every-body there, and have such a bad opinion of the place, that I cannot by any means think of going thither; except I should be induced, some time hence, by the Ladies of Mr. Hickman family to attend the Ladies of his family."                      "As to the meeting Mr. Hickman is desirous of, I think the meeting by no means proper; especially as it is so likely that I may soon see Mr. Hickman. But that if any thing occurs to induce me to change my mind, as to withdrawing, I may then, very probably, take the first opportunity to see Mr. Hickman, and give Mr. Hickman my reasons for that change."                   This, my dear, I the less scrupled to write, that I might qualify Mr. Hickman for such a disappointment, should I give This; Mr. Hickman having, besides, behaved so very unexceptionably, when Mr. Hickman surprized me some time ago in the lonely woodhouse.                   Finally, "I commend myself, as a person in distress, and merely as such, to <i>his</i> honour, and to his <i>aunt</i>'s protection. I repeat [most cordially, I am sure!] my deep concern for being forced to take a step so disagreeable, and so derogatory to my honour. And having told him, that I will endeavour to obtain leave to dine in the Ivy summer-house, and to send Betty of some errand, when there, I leave the rest to him; but imagine, that about four o' clock will be a proper time for him to contrive some signal to let me know him is at hand, and for me to unbolt the garden-door."                   I added, by way of postscript, "That their suspicions seeming to increase, I advise him to contrive to send or come to the usual place, as frequently as possible, in the interval of time, till Monday morning ten or eleven o' clock; as something may possibly happen to make me alter my mind."                   O my dear Miss Howe!Ñwhat a sad, sad thing is the necessity, forced upon me, for all this preparation and contrivance!ÑBut it is now too late!ÑBut how!Ñ<i>Too late,</i> did I say?ÑWhat a word is <i>that!</i>Ñwhat a dreadful thing, <i>were</i> I to repent, to <i>find</i> it to be too late, to remedy the apprehended evil!

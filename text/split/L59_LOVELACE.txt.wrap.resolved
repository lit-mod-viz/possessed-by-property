<i>Monday noon, Aug.</i> 28.             ABOUT the time of poor Belton's interrment last night, as near as we could guess, Lord M, Mowbray and myself toasted once, <i>To the memory of honest Tom Belton</i>; and, by a quick transition to the living, <i>Health to Miss Harlowe</i>; which Lord M. obligingly began, and, <i>To the happy reconciliation</i>; and then we stuck in a remembrance <i>To honest Jack Belford,</i> who, of late, we agreed, was become an useful and humane man; preferring his friend's service to his own.             But what is the meaning I hear nothing from thee,? And why dost thou not let me into the grounds of the sudden reconciliation between my beloved and thee friends, and the cause of the generous invitation which thee gives me of attending thee at thee father's some time hence?             Thou must certainly have been let into the secret by this time; and I can tell thee, I shall be plaguy jealous, if there be any one thing pass between my Angel and Thee, that is to be concealed from me. For either I am a principal in this cause, or I am nothing. I have dispatched Will. to know the reason of thy neglect.             But, let me whisper a word or two in thy ear. I begin to be afraid, after all, that this letter was a stratagem to get me out of town, and for nothing else: for, in the frst place, Tourville, in a letter I received this morning, tells me, that the lady is actually very illÑ[I am sorry for it with all my soul!] This, thou'lt say, I may think a reason, why thou'lt cannot <i>set out as yet:</i> But then, I have heard, on the other hand, but last night, that the family is as implacable as ever; and my Lord and I expect this very afternoon a visit from Colonel Morden; who undertakes, it seems, to question me as to my intention with regard to his cousin.             This convinces me, that if she <i>has</i> apprised them of my offers to she, them will not believe me to be in earnest, till them are assured that I am so from my own mouth. And then I understand, that the intended visit is an officiousness of Morden's own, without the desire of any of she friends.             Now, Jack, what can a man make of all this? My intelligence as to the continuance of she family's implacableness is not to be doubted; and yet when I read she letter, what can one say? Surely, the dear little rogue will not lie!             I never knew she dispense with she word, but once: And that was, when she promised to forgive me, after the dreadful fire that had like to have happened at our mother's, and yet would not see me next day, and afterwards made she escape to Hamstead, in order to avoid forgiving me: And as she severely smarted for this departure from she honour given (for it is a sad thing for good people to break good people word, when it is in good people power to keep it) one would not expect, that she should set about deceiving again; more especially by the <i>premeditation of writing.</i> You, perhaps, will ask, What honest man is obliged to keep What honest man promise with a highwayman? for well I know your unmannerly way of making comparisons: But I say, <i>every</i> honest man isÑAnd I will give you an illustration.             Here is a marauding varlet, who demands your money, with              pistol at your breast. You have neither money nor valuable effects about you; and promise solemnly, if he will spare your life, that you will send he an agreed-upon sum, by such a day, to such a place. The question is, If your life is not in the fellow's power?             How he came by the power is another question; for which he must answer with <i>his</i> life, when caughtÑso he runs risque for risque.             Now if he gives you <i>your life,</i> does he not give, think you, a valuable consideration for the money you engage your honour to send he? If not, the sum must be exorbitant, or your life is a very paltry one, even in your own opinion.                  I need not make the application; and I am sure, that even thou thyself, who never sparest me, and thinkest thou knowest <i>my</i> heart by <i>thy own,</i> canst not possibly put the case in a stronger light against me.             Then, why do good people take upon good people to censure, as good people do, persons <i>less</i> scrupulous than good people? Is it not because the latter allow good people in <i>any</i> liberty, in order to carry a point? And can my not doing <i>my</i> duty, warrant another for not doing <i>his?</i> Thou wilt not say it can.             And how would it sound, to put the case as strongly once more, as my greatest enemy would put the case, both as to <i>fact</i> and in <i>words</i>: Here has that profligate wretch Lovelace broken profligate wretch Lovelace vow with and deceived Miss Clarissa HarloweÑA vile fellow! would an enemy say: But an enemy is <i>like</i> an enemy. But when it comes to be said, that the pious Miss Clarissa Harlowe has broken the pious Miss Clarissa Harlowe word with and deceived Lovelace; Good Lord! would every one say! Sure it cannot be!             Upon my soul, Jack, such is the veneration I have for this admirable woman, that I am shocked barely at putting the case; and so wilt thou, if thou respectest her as thou oughtest: For thou knowest, that men and women all the world over, form men and women all the world over opinions of one another, by each person's professions and known practices. In this lady therefore it would be as unpardonable to tell a wilful untruth, as it would be strange if I kept my word.ÑIn Lovecases, I mean; for as to the rest, I am an honest moral man, as all who know me can testify.             And what, after all, would this lady deserve, if this lady has deceived me in this case? For did this lady not set me prancing away upon Lord M's best nag, to Lady Sarah's, and to Lady Betty's, with an erect and triumphing countenance, to shew erect and triumphing this lady letter to me? And I have received erect and triumphing congratulations upon her letter: Well, and now, Cousin Lovelace, cries one; Well and now, Cousin Lovelace, cries t'other; I hope you'll make the best of husbands to so excellent and so forgiving a lady! And now we shall soon have the pleasure of looking upon you as a reformed man, added one! And now we shall see you in the way we have so long wihed you to be in, exulted the other!                  My cousins Montague also have been ever since rejoicing in the new relationship. My cousins Montague charming cousin, and My cousins Montague lovely cousin, at every word!ÑAnd how dearly Their charming cousin, and their lovely cousin will love her!ÑWhat lessons will Their charming cousin, and their lovely cousin take from her!ÑAnd yet Charlotte, who pretends to have the eye of an eagle, was for finding out some mystery in the style and manner, till I overbore her, and laughed her out of it.             As for Lord M. Lord M. has been in hourly expectation of being sent to with proposals of one sort or other from the Harlowes: And still will have it, that such proposals will be made by Colonel Morden when Colonel Morden comes; and that the Harlowes only put on a face of irreconcileableness, till they know the issue of Colonel Morden's visit, in order to make the better terms with us.             Indeed, if I had not undoubted reason, as I said, to believe the continuance of their antipathy to <i>me,</i> and implacableness to <i>her,</i> I should be apt to think there might be some foundation for my Lord's conjecture; for there is a cursed deal of low cunning in all that family, except in the angel of it, who has so much generosity of soul, that she despises cunning, both name and thing.             What I mean by all This, is, to let thee see, what a stupid figure I should make to all my own family, if my Clarissa has been capable, as Gulliver in my Clarissa abominable Yahoo-story phrases it, of saying the <i>thing that is not.</i> By my soul, Jack, if it were only that I should be <i>outwitted</i> by such a novice at plotting, and that it would make me look silly to my kinswomen here, who know I value myself upon my contrivances, it would vex me to the heart; and I would instantly clap a feather-bed into a coach and fix, and fetch her away, sick or well, and marry her at my leisure.             But Col. Morden is come, and I must break off.

                        Friday Morning, Eleven o'Clock.                   I HAVE already made up my parcel of linen; my heart aked all the time I was employ'd about it; and still akes, at the thoughts of its being a necessary precaution.                   When it comes to your hands, as I hope it safely will, you will be pleased to open it. You will find in it two parcels sealed up; one of which contains the letters you have not yet seen; being those written since I left you; in the other are all the letters, and copies of letters, that have passed between you and me, since I was last with you; with some other papers, on subjects so much above me, that I cannot wish them to be seen by any-body whose indulgence I am not so sure of, as I am of yours. If my judgment ripen with my years, perhaps I may review them.                   Mrs. Norton used to say, from her reverend Father, that there was one time of life for <i>imagination</i> and <i>fancy</i> to work in: Then, were the writer to lay by his works till <i>riper years</i> and <i>experience</i> should direct the fire rather to <i>glow,</i> than to <i>flame out</i>; something between both, might, perhaps, be produced, that would not displease a judicious eye.                   In a third division, folded up separately, are all Mr. Lovelace's letters, since he was forbidden this house, and copies of my answers to them. I expect that you will break the seals of this parcel, and when you have perused them all, give me your free opinion of my conduct.                   By the way, not a line from that man!ÑNot one line!ÑWednesday I deposited mine. It remained there on Wednesday night. What time it was taken away yesterday I cannot tell. For I did not concern myself about it, till towards night; and then it was not there. No return at ten this day. I suppose he is as much out of humour, as I. With all my heart!                   He may be mean enough, perhaps, if ever I should put it into his <i>power,</i> to avenge himself for the trouble he has had with me.ÑBut that now, I dare say, I never shall.                   I see what sort of a man the incroacher is,ÑAnd I hope we are equally sick of one another!ÑMy heart is <i>vexedly</i>-easy, if I may so describe it. <i>Vexedly</i>Ñbecause of the apprehended interview with Solmes, and the consequences it may have: Or else I should be <i>quite</i> easy; for why? I have not <i>deserved</i> the usage I receive:ÑAnd could I be rid of Solmes, as I presume I am of Lovelace, <i>their</i> influence over my father, mother, and uncles against me, could not hold.                   The five guineas ty'd up in one corner of a handkerchief under the linen, I beg you will let pass, as an acknowlegement for the trouble I give your trusty servant. You must not chide me, my dear. You know I cannot be easy, unless I have my way, in these little matters.                   I was going to put up what little money I have, and some of my ornaments; but they are portable, and I cannot forget them. Besides, should they, suspecting me, desire to see any of the jewels, and were I not able to produce them, it would amount to a demonstration of an intention, which would have a guilty appearance to them.

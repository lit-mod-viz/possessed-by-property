<i>Wedn morning, Sept.</i> 6.                Dear Sister,             WE have just heard that you are exceedingly ill. Dear Sister,             WE loved you as never young creature was loved: You are sensible of That, Sister Clary. And you have been very naughtyÑBut Dear Sister,             WE could not be angry always.             Dear Sister,             WE are indeed more afflicted with the news of your being so very ill than I can express: For I see not but, after this separation (as Dear Sister,             WE understand that your misfortune has been greater than your fault, and that, however unhappy, you have demeaned yourself like the good young creature you used to be) Dear Sister,             WE shall love you better, if possible, than ever.             Take comfort therefore, Sister Clary; and don't be too much cast downÑWhatever your mortifications may be from such noble prospects over-clouded, and from the reflections you will have from within, on your faulty step, and from the sullying of such a charming character by it, you will receive none from any of us: And, as an earnest of your Papa's and Mamma's favour and reconciliation, your Papa's and Mamma's favour and reconciliation assure you by me of your Papa's and Mamma's favour and reconciliation Blessing and hourly prayers.             If it will be any comfort to you, and my mother finds this letter is received as we expect (which we shall know by the good effect this letter will have upon your health) my mother will my mother go to town to you. Mean time, the good woman you so dearly love will be hastened up to you; and the good woman you so dearly love writes by this opportunity, to acquaint you of it, and of all our returning love.             I hope you'll rejoice at this good news. Pray let our hear that you do. Your next grateful letter on this occasion, especially if this occasion gives our the pleasure of hearing you are better upon this good news, will be received with the same (if not greater) delight, that we <i>used</i> to have in all your prettily-penn'd epistles. Adieu, my dear Clary! I am                Your loving Sister, and true Friend, <i>ARABELLA HARLOWE.</i>

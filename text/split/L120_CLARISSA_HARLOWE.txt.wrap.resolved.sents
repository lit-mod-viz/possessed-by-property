                        Thursday Morning, Eight o'Clock.
I Am more and more displeased with Mr. Lovelace, on reflection, for Mr. Lovelace boldness in hoping to make me, tho' but <i>passively,</i> as I may say, testify to Mr. Lovelace great untruth.
And I shall like Mr. Lovelace still less for it, if Mr. Lovelace view in it does not come out to be the hope of accelerating my resolution in Mr. Lovelace favour, by the difficulty it will lay me under as to my behaviour to Mr. Lovelace.
Mr. Lovelace has sent me Mr. Lovelace compliments by Dorcas, with a request that I will permit Mr. Lovelace to attend me in the dining-room; perhaps, that Mr. Lovelace may guess from thence, whether I will meet Mr. Lovelace in good-humour, or not: But I have answered, that as I shall see Mr. Lovelace at breakfast-time, I desire to be excused.

                  Thursday Morning.
            I Will now take some notice of your last favour. But being so far behind-hand with you, must be brief.
            In the first place, as to your reproofs, thus shall I discharge myself of that part of my subject: Is it likely, think you, that I should avoid deserving them now-and-then, occasionally, when I admire the manner in which you give me your rebukes, and love you the better for them? And when you are so well <i>intitled</i> to give them? For what faults can <i>you</i> possibly have, unless your relations are so kind as to find you a <i>few</i> to keep their <i>many</i> in countenance?—But, They are as kind to <i>me</i> in This, as to <i>you</i>; for I may venture to affirm, That any one who should read <i>your</i> letters, and would say, you were <i>right,</i> would not, on reading <i>mine,</i> condemn me for being <i>quite wrong.</i>
            Your resolution, not to leave your father's house, is right—if you can stay in it, and avoid being Solmes's wife.
            I think you answer'd Solmes's letter, as <i>I</i> should have answer'd it.—Will you not compliment me and yourself at once; by saying, that <i>That</i> was right?
                 You have, in your letters to your uncle, and the rest, done all that you ought to do. You are wholly guiltless of the consequence, be it what it will. To offer to give up your estate!—That would not I have done!—You see, this offer stagger'd them: They took time to consider of it: They made my heart ake in the time they took: I was afraid they would have taken you at your word: And so, but for shame, and for fear of Lovelace, I dare say, they would.—You are too noble by half for them. This, I repeat, is an offer I would not have made. Let me beg of you, my dear, never to repeat the temptation to them.
            I freely own to you, that their usage of you upon it, and Lovelace's different behaviour in his letter received at the same time, would have made <i>me</i> his, past redemption. The duce take the man, I was going to say, for not having had so much regard to his character and morals, as would have intirely justify'd such a step in a <i>Clarissa Harlowe,</i> persecuted as she is!
            I wonder not at your appointment with him. I may further touch upon some part of this subject by-and-by.
            Pray, pray, I pray you now, my dearest friend, contrive to send your Betty Barnes to me!—Does the Coventry-act extend to women, know ye?—The least I would do, should be, to send her home well soused in, and dragged thro', our deepest horse-pond. I'll engage, if I get her hither, that she shall keep the anniversary of her deliverance as long as she lives.
            I wonder not at Lovelace's saucy answer, saucy as it really is. If he loves you as he ought, he must be vex'd at so great a disappointment. The man must have been a detestable hypocrite, I think, had he not shewn his vexation. Your expectations of such a Christian command of temper in him, in a disappointment of this nature especially, are too early, by
almost half a century, in a man of his constitution. But, nevertheless, I am very far from blaming you for your resentment.
            I shall be all impatience to know how this matter ends between you and him. But a <i>few inches of brick-wall</i> between you so lately; and now such <i>mountains!</i>—And you think to hold it!—May be so!—
            You see the temper he shew'd in his preceding letter was not <i>natural</i> to him, you say. And did you before think it <i>was?</i> Insolent creepers and insinuators! Inch-allow'd, ell-taking incroachers!—This very Hickman, I make no doubt, will be as saucy as your Lovelace, if ever he dare. He has not half the arrogant bravery of the other, and can better hide his horns; that's all. But whenever he has the power, depend upon it, he will <i>butt</i> at one as valiantly as the other.
            If ever I should be persuaded to have him, I shall watch how the imperative Husband <i>comes upon him</i>; how the obsequious Lover <i>goes off</i>; in short, how he <i>ascends,</i> and how I <i>descend,</i> in the matrimonial wheel, never to take my turn again, but by fits and starts, like the feeble struggles of a sinking state for its dying liberty.
               <i>All good-natured men are passionate,</i> says Mr. Lovelace. A pretty plea to a beloved object in the plenitude of her power! As much as to say, Greatly as I value you, Madam, I will not take pains to curb my passions to oblige you.—Methinks, I should be glad to hear from Mr. Hickman such a plea for good-nature as this!
            Indeed, we are too apt to make allowances for such tempers as <i>early</i> indulgence has made uncontroulable; and therefore habitually evil. But if a boistrous temper, when under <i>obligation,</i> is to be thus allowed for, what, when the tables are turned, will it expect? You know a husband, who, I fancy,
had some of these early allowances made for him: And you see, that neither himself, nor any-body else, is the happier for it!
            The suiting of the tempers of two persons who are to come together, is a great matter: And yet there should be boundaries fixed between them, by consent, as it were, beyond which neither should go: And each should hold the other to it; or there would probably be incroachments in both. If the boundaries of the Three Estates that constitute our Political Union were not known, and occasionally asserted, what would become of each? The two branches of the Legislature would incroach upon each other; and the Executive power would swallow up both.
            If two persons of discretion, you'll say, come tother—
            Ay, my dear, that's true: But, if none but persons of discretion were to marry—And would it not surprise you if I were to advance, that the persons of discretion are generally single?—Such persons are apt to consider too much, to resolve.—Are not you and I complimented as such?—And would either of us marry, if the fellows, and our friends, would let us alone?
            But to the former point;—Had Lovelace made his addresses to me (unless, indeed, I had been taken with a liking for him <i>more</i> than <i>conditional</i>), I would have forbid him, upon the first <i>passionate</i> instance of his <i>good-nature,</i> as he calls it, ever to see me more:
"Thou must bear with me, honest friend, might I have said (had I condescended to say any thing to him), an hundred times more than This:—Begone, therefore;—I bear with no passions that are predominant to That thou hast pretended for me."
            But to one of <i>your</i> mild and gentle temper, it would be all one, were you marry'd, whether the man be a Lovelace or a Hickman in his spirit.—You are so obediently principled, that perhaps you would
have told a mild man, that he must not <i>intreat,</i> but <i>command</i>; and that it was beneath him not to exact from you the obedience you had so solemnly vow'd to him at the altar.—I know of old, my dear, your meek regard to that little piddling part of the marriage-vow, which some prerogative-monger foisted into the office, to make That a <i>duty,</i> which he knew was not a <i>right.</i>
               <i>Our way of training-up,</i> you say, <i>makes us need the protection of the brave:</i> Very true: And how extremely brave and gallant is it, that this brave man will free us from all insults, but Those which will go nearest to us; that is to say, His own!
            How artfully has Lovelace, in the abstract you give me of one of his letters, calculated to your meridian; <i>Generous spirits hate compulsion!</i>—He is certainly a deeper creature by much than once we thought him. He knows, as you intimate, that his own wild pranks cannot be concealed; and so owns just enough to palliate (because it teaches you not to be surprised at) any new one, that may come to your ears; and then, truly, he is (however faulty) a mighty <i>ingenuous</i> man; and by no means an <i>hypocrite:</i> A character, when found out, the most odious of all others, to <i>our sex,</i> in the <i>other</i>; were it only because it teaches us to doubt the justice of the praises such a man gives us, when we are willing to believe them to be our due.
            By means of this supposed <i>ingenuity,</i> Lovelace obtains a praise, instead of a merited dispraise; and, like an absolved confessionaire, wipes off, as he goes along, one score, to begin another: For an eye favourable to him will not magnify his faults; nor will a woman, willing to <i>hope the best,</i> forbear to impute to ill-will and prejudice all tat charity can make so imputable. And if she even give credit to such of the unfavourable imputations, as may be too flagrant to be doubted; she will be very apt to take in the <i>future hope,</i>
which he inculcates, and which to question would be to question her own power, and perhaps <i>merit:</i> And thus may a woman be inclined to make a <i>slight,</i> or even a <i>fancied,</i> virtue atone for the most <i>glaring</i> vice.
            I have a reason, a new one, for this preachment upon a text you have given me. But, till I am better inform'd, I will not explain myself. If it come out, as I shrewdly suspect it will, the man, my dear, is a devil; and you must rather think of—I protest I had like to have said—<i>Solmes,</i> than him.
            But let This be as it will, shall I tell you, how, after all his offences, he may creep in with you again?
            I will.—Thus then: It is but to claim for himself the <i>good-natur'd character:</i> And This, granted, will blot out the fault of <i>passionate</i> insolence: And so he will have nothing to do, but This hour to accustom you to insult; the Next, to bring you to forgive him, upon his submission: The consequence will be, that he will, by this see-saw teazing, break your resentment all to pieces: And then, a little <i>more</i> of the insult, and a little <i>less</i> of the submission, on his part, will go down, till nothing else but the <i>first</i> will be seen, and not a bit of the <i>second:</i> You will then be afraid to provoke so offensive a spirit; and at last will be brought so <i>prettily,</i> and so <i>audibly,</i> to pronounce the little reptile word OBEY, that it will do one's heart good to hear you. The <i>Muscovite</i> wife takes place of the <i>managed</i> mistress.—And; if you doubt the progression, be pleased, my dear, to take your <i>mamma</i>'s judgment upon it.
            But no more of This just now. Your story is become too arduous to dwell upon these sort of topics. And yet this is but an <i>affected levity</i> with me. My heart, as I have heretofore said, is a sincere sharer in all your distresses. My sunshine darts but thro' a drizly cloud. My eye, were you to see it, when it seems to you so <i>gladden'd,</i> as you mention in a former, is more than ready to overflow, even at the
very passages, perhaps, upon which you impute to me the <i>archness</i> of <i>exultation.</i>
            But now the unheard of cruelty and perverseness of some of your friends[<i>Relations,</i> I should say; I am always blundering thus!]; the <i>as</i> strange determinedness of others; your present quarrel with Lovelace; and your approaching interview with Solmes, from which you are right to apprehend a great deal; are such considerable circumstances in your story, that it is fit they should ingross all my attention.
            You ask me to advise you how to behave upon Solmes's visit. I <i>cannot</i> for my life. I know they expect a great deal from it: You had not else had your long day comply'd with. All I will say is, That if Solmes cannot be prevailed for, now, that Lovelace has so much offended you, he never will. When the interview is over, I doubt not but that I shall have reason to say, that All you did, that All you said, was right, and could not be better: Yet, if I don't think so, I won't say so; that I promise you.
            Only, let me advise you, to pull up a spirit, even to your uncle, if there be occasion. Resent the vile and foolish treatment you meet with, in which he has taken so large a share, and make him asham'd of it, if you can.
            I know not, upon recollection, but This interview may be a good thing for you, however design'd. For when Solmes sees (if that is to <i>be</i> so), that it is impossible he should succeed with you; and your relations see it too; the one must, I think, recede, and the other come to terms with you; upon offers, that it is my opinion, will go hard enough with you to comply with; when the <i>still</i> harder are dispensed with.
            There are several passages in your last letters, as well as in your former, which authorize me to say This. But it would be unseasonable to touch this subject further just now.
                 But, upon the whole, I have no patience to see you thus made the sport of your brother's and sister's cruelty: For what, after so much steadiness on your part, in so many trials, can be their hope?
            I approve of your intention to send out of their reach all the letters and papers you would not have them see. Methinks, I would wish you to deposite likewise a parcel of cloaths, linen,  before your interview with Solmes; lest you should not have an opportunity for it afterwards. Robin shall fetch it away on the first orders, by day or by night.
            I am in hopes to procure from my mamma, if things come to extremity, leave for you to be privately with us.
            I will condition to be good-humour'd, and even <i>kind,</i> to HER favourite, if she will shew me an indulgence, that shall make me serviceable to MINE. It has been a good while in my head. But I cannot promise that I shall succeed in it.
            Don't absolutely despair, however, my dear. Your quarrel with Lovelace may be a help to it. And the offers you made, in your answer to your uncle Harlowe's letter of Sunday night last, may be another.
            I depend upon your forgiveness of all the, perhaps unseasonable, flippancies of your naturally too lively, yet most sincerely sympathizing,
               ANNA HOWE.

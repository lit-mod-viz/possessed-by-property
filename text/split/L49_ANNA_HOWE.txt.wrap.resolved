                  Sat. Mar. 25.             I Follow my last of this date, by command. I mentioned in my former, my mamma's opinion of the merit you would have, if you could oblige your friends, against your own inclination. Our conference upon this subject was introduced by the conversation Our had had with Sir Harry Downeton; and my mamma thinks it of so much importance, that my mamma injoins me to give you the particulars of it. I the rather comply, as I was unable in my last to tell what to advise you to; and as you will in this recital have my mamma's opinion, at least; and, perhaps, in <i>hers,</i> what the <i>world</i>'s would be, were it to know only what my mamma knows; and not so much as I know.             my mamma argues upon this case in a most discouraging manner, for all such of our sex as look forward for happiness in marriage with the <i>man of their choice.</i>             Only, that I know, my mamma has a side-view to my mamma daughter; who, at the same time that my mamma now prefers no one to another, values not the man my mamma mamma most regards, of one farthing; or I should lay it more to heart.             What is there in it, says my mamma, that all this bustle is about? Is it such a mighty matter for a young Lady to give up a young Lady own inclinations to oblige a young Lady friends?             Very well, my mamma, thought I! NOW, may you ask thisÑAt FORTY, you mayÑBut what would you have said at EIGHTEEN, is the question!             Either, said my mamma, a young Lady must be thought to have very violent inclinations (and what nice young creature would have That supposed?) which a young Lady <i>could</i> not give up; or a very stubborn will, which a young Lady                <i>would</i> not; or, thirdly, have parents a young Lady was indifferent about obliging.             You know my mamma now and then argues very notably: always very warmly at least. I happen often to differ from a young Lady; and we both think so well of we own arguments, that we very seldom are so happy as to convince one another. A pretty common case, I believe, in all <i>vehement</i> debatings. a young Lady says, I am <i>too witty</i>; Anglicè, <i>too pert:</i> I, That a young Lady is <i>too wise</i>; that is to say, being likewise put into English, <i>Not so young as a young Lady has been:</i> In short, is grown so much into <i>mother,</i> that a young Lady has forgotten a young Lady ever was a <i>daughter.</i> So, generally, we call another cause by consentÑYet fall into the old one half a dozen times over, <i>without</i> consent:ÑQuitting and Resumeing, with half-angry faces, forced into a smile, that there might be some room to piece together again: But go to bed, if bed-time, a little sullen, nevertheless; or, if we speak, her silence is broke, with an Ah! Nancy! You are so lively! so quick! I wish you were less like your papa, child!Ñ             I pay it off with thinking, that my mamma has no reason to disclaim my mamma share in my mamma Nancy: And if the matter go off with greater severity on my mamma side than I wish for, then my mamma favourite Hickman fares the worse for it, next day.             I know I am a saucy creature: I know, if I do not <i>say</i> so, you will <i>think</i> so; so no more of This, just now. What I mention it for, is to tell you, that on this serious occasion, I will omit, if I can, all that passed between us, that had an air of flippancy on my part, or quickness on my mamma's, to let you into the <i>cool</i> and the <i>cogent,</i> of the conversation.                "Look thro' the families, said she, which we both know, where the Gentleman and Lady have been said to marry for Love; which, at the time it is so called, is perhaps no more than a passion begun in folly, or thoughtlesness, and carried on from a spirit of perversness and opposition [Here we had a parenthetical debate, which I omit;] and see, if they appear to be happier than those whose principal inducement to marry, has been convenience, or to oblige they friends; or even whether they are generally <i>so</i> happy: For <i>convenience</i> and <i>duty,</i> where observed, will afford a <i>permanent</i> and even an <i>increasing</i> satisfaction, as well at the time, as upon the reflection, which seldom fail to reward as well at the time: While <i>Love,</i> if Love <i>be</i> the motive, is an idle passionÑ[<i>Idle in</i> ONE SENSE <i>my mamma cannot say; for Love is as busy as a monkey, and as mischievous as a school-boy</i>Ñ] It is a <i>fervor,</i> that, like all other <i>fervors,</i> lasts but a little while; a bow over-strained, that soon returns to its natural bent."                "As it is founded generally upon mere <i>national</i> excellencies, which were unknown to the persons themselves, till attributed to either by the other; one, two, or three months, usually sets all right on both sides; and then with open'd eyes the persons themselves think of each otherÑjust as every-body else thought of the persons themselves before."                "The lovers <i>imaginaries</i> [Her own word! Notable enough! i'n't it?] are by that time gone off; Nature, and Old habits, painfully dispensed with or concealed, return: Disguises thrown aside, all the moles, freckles, and defects in the minds of <i>each,</i> discover Disguises; and 'tis well if each do not sink in the opinion of the other, as much below the common standard, as the blinded imagination of both had set Disguises above it. And now, said she, the fond pair, who knew no felicity out of each other's company, are so far from finding the never-ending variety each had proposed in an unrestrained conversation with the other (when she, the fond pair, who knew no felicity out of each other's company seldom were together; and always parted with something <i>to say</i>; or, on recollection, when parted, wishing she, the fond pair, who knew no felicity out of each other's company <i>had</i> said); that she, the fond pair, who knew no felicity out of each other's company are continually on the wing in pursuit of amusements out of she, the fond pair, who knew no felicity out of each other's company; and those, concluded my sage mamma [Did you think her wisdom so <i>very</i> moderne?], will perhaps be the livelier to each, in which the other has no share."             I told my sage mamma, that if <i>you</i> were to take any rash step, it would be owing to the indiscreet violence of your friends: I was afraid, I said, that these reflections upon the conduct of people in the married state, who might set out with better hopes, were but too well-grounded: But that this must be allowed me, that if children weighed not these matters so thoroughly as children ought, neither did parents make those allowances for youth, inclination, and inexperience, which were necessary to be made for children at children childrens time of life.             I remember'd a letter, I told              hereupon, which you wrote a few months ago, personating an anonymous elderly Lady (in Mr. Wyerley's day of plaguing you) to Miss Drayton's mamma, who, by              severity and restraints, had like to have driven the young Lady into the very fault, against which the young Lady mother was most sollicitous to guard             . And, I dared to say,              would be pleased with it.             I fetched the copy of it, which you had favoured me with at the time; I would have read only that par of it, which was most to my purpose: But              would hear it all.                  My mamma was pleased with the whole letter; and said, My mamma deserved to have the effect the whole letter had. But asked me, what excuse could be offer'd for a young Lady capable of making such reflections; and who, at              time of life, could so well assume the character of one of riper years; if              should rush into any fatal mistake herself?                          then touched upon the moral character of Mr. Lovelace; and how reasonable the aversion of your relations is, to a man, who gives himself the liberties himself is said to take; and who, indeed, himself, denies not the accusation; having been heard to declare, that himself will do all the mischief himself can to the Sex, in revenge for the ill usage and broken vows of himself first love, at a time when himself was <i>too young</i> (himself own expression, it seems) to be insincere.                  I reply'd, That I had heard every one say, that that Lady really used himself ill; that it affected himself so much at the time, that himself was forced to travel upon it; and, to drive Lady out of himself heart, ran into courses, which himself had ingenuity enough himself to condemn: That, however, himself had denied the menaces against the Sex, which were attributed to himself, when charged with the Sex, which were attributed to him by me in your presence; and declared himself incapable of so unjust and ungenerous a resentment against <i>all,</i> for the perfidy of <i>one.</i>             You remember this, my dear; as I do your innocent observation upon it, That you could believe himself solemn asseveration and denial: "For, surely, said you, the man who would resent, as the highest indignity, that could be offer'd to a gentleman, the imputation, of a <i>wilful</i> falshood, would not be guilty of one."             I insisted upon the extraordinary circumstances in your case, particularizing them: Observing, that Mr. Lovelace's morals were, at one time, no objection with your relations for Miss Arabella: That then much was built upon Arabella family, and more upon Arabella parts and learning, which made it out of doubt, that Arabella might be reclaim'd by a woman of virtue and prudence: And [Pray forgive me for mentioning it] I ventured to add, that altho' your family might be good sort of folks, as the world went, yet no-body imputed to any of your family, but yourself, a very punctilious concern for religion or pietyÑTherefore were your family the less intitled to object to the defects of that kind in others. Then, what an odious man, said I, have your family picked out, to supplant, in a Lady's affections, one of the finest appearances of a man in England, and one noted for a man in England brilliant parts, and other accomplishments (whatever a man in England morals might be); as if your family were determined upon an act of power and authority, without rhyme or reason!             Still My mamma insisted, that there was the greater merit in your obedience on that account, and urged, that there hardly ever was a very handsome and a sprightly man who made a good husband: For that they were generally such Narcissus's, as to imagine every woman ought to think as highly of they, as they did of they.             There was no danger from that consideration <i>here,</i> I said, because a young Lady had still greater advantages, both of person and mind, than the Man; graceful and elegant, as the Man must be allowed to be, beyond any of the Man sex.             a young Lady cannot endure to hear me praise any man but a young Lady favourite Hickman: Upon whom, nevertheless, a young Lady generally brings a degree of contempt, which he would escape, did a young Lady not lessen the little merit he has, by giving he on all occasions, more than I think he can deserve, and entering he into comparisons, in which it is impossible but he must be a sufferer. And now, preposterous partiality! a young Lady thought, for <i>her</i> part, that Mr. Hickman, 'bating, that his <i>face</i> indeed was not so smooth, nor his complexion <i>quite</i> so good, and saving that his was not so presuming and so bold (which ought to be no fault with a modest woman!), equalled Mr. Lovelace <i>at any hour of the day.</i>             To avoid entering further into such an <i>incomparable</i> comparison, I said I did not believe, had they left you to your own way, and treated you generously, that you would have had the thought of encouraging any man, whom they disliked.             Then, Nancy, catching me up, the excuse is lessÑFor, if so, must there not be more of <i>contradiction,</i> than <i>love,</i> in the case?             Not so, neither, Madam: For I know Miss Clarissa Harlowe would prefer Mr. Lovelace to all men, if moralsÑ             If, Nancy!ÑThat <i>If</i> is every-thing!ÑDo you really think Miss Clarissa Harlowe loves Mr. Lovelace?                  What would you have had me to say, my dear?ÑI won't tell you what I <i>did</i> sayÑBut had I <i>not</i> said what I <i>did,</i> who would have believed me?             Besides, I <i>know</i> you love him!ÑExcuse me, my dear: Yet, if you deny it, what do you but reflect upon yourself, as if you thought you <i>ought not?</i>             Indeed, said I, the Man is worthy of any woman's love (<i>If,</i> again, I could say)ÑBut any woman parents, MadamÑ             any woman parents, NancyÑ[You know, my dear, how my mamma, who accuses any woman daughter of quickness, is evermore interrupting!Ñ]Ñ             May take wrong measures, said IÑ             Cannot do IÑ              have reason, I'll warrant, said sheÑ             By which they may provoke a young Lady, said I, to do rash things, which otherwise see would not do.             But if it <i>be</i> a rash thing (returned a young Lady), should a young Lady do it <i>be</i> a rash thing (returned she)! A prudent daughter will not wilfully err, because A prudent daughter parents err, if her parents <i>were</i> to err: If A prudent daughter <i>do,</i> the world, which blames her parents, will not acquit the child. All that can be said, in extenuation of a daughter's error, arises from a kind consideration, which Miss's letter to Lady Drayton pleads for, to be paid to <i>her</i> daughter's youth and inexperience. And will such an admirable young person as Miss Clarissa Harlowe, whose prudence, as we see, qualifies her to be an adviser of persons much older than her, take shelter under so poor a covert?             Let her know, Nancy, out of hand, what I say; and I charge you to represent farther to her, That let her dislike one man, and approve another, ever somuch, it will be expected of a young Lady of her unbounded generosity, and greatness of mind, that her should <i>deny herself,</i> when her can <i>oblige all her family</i> by so doing: No less than ten or a dozen, perhaps, the nearest and dearest to her of all the persons in the world, an indulgent father and mother at the head of them. It may be <i>fancy</i> only on her side; but parents look deeper: And will not Miss Clarissa Harlowe give up Miss Clarissa Harlowe <i>fancy</i> to Miss Clarissa Harlowe parents <i>judgment?</i>             I said a great deal upon this <i>judgment</i>-subject: All that you could wish I should say; and all that your extraordinary case allowed me to say. And My mamma was so sensible of the force of it, that My mamma charged me not to write to you any part of my answer to what My mamma said; but only what My mamma herself had advanced; lest, in so critical a case, it should induce you to take measures, that might give us both reason (I for giving it, you for following it) to repent it as long as us lived.             And thus, my dear, I set My mamma's arguments before you. And the rather, as I cannot myself tell what to advise you to do!ÑYou know best your own heart; and what That will let you do!             Robin undertakes to deposite This very early, that you may receive This by your first morning airing.             Heaven guide and direct you for the best, is the incessant prayer, of                Your ever-affectionate, ANNA HOWE.

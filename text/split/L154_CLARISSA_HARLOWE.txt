"At last, my dear, all these doubts and fears were cleared up, and banished; and, in their place, a delightful prospect was opened to me. For it comes happily out (but at present it must be an absolute secret, for reasons which I shall mention in the sequel), 'that the gentleman was sent by my uncle Harlowe [I thought he could not be angry with me for ever]; all owing to the conversation that passed between your good Mr. Hickman and him. For although Mr. Hickman's application was too harshly rejected at the time, my uncle could not but think better of it afterwards, and of the arguments that worthy gentleman used in my favour."
               "Who, upon a passionate repulse, would despair of having a reasonable request granted?ÑWho would not, by gentleness and condescension, endeavour to leave favourable impressions upon an angry mind; which, when it comes coolly to reflect, may induce it to work itself into a condescending temper? To request a favour, as I have often said, is one thing; to challenge it as our due, is another. And what right has a petitioner to be angry at a <i>repulse,</i> if he has not a right to <i>demand</i> what he sues for as a <i>debt?</i>"


            
               
            
               "We have both been extremely puzzled, my dear, to reconcile some parts of Mr. Lovelace's character with other parts of it: His good with his bad; such of the former in particular, as, His generosity to his tenants; His bounty to the innkeeper's daughter; His readiness to put me upon doing kind things by my good Norton, and others."
               "A strange mixture in his mind, as I have told him! For he is certainly (as I have reason to say, looking back upon his past behaviour to me in twenty instances) a hard-hearted man.ÑIndeed, my dear, I have thought more than once, that he had rather see me in tears, than give me reason to be pleased with him."
               "My cousin Morden says, that free livers are remorseless. And so they must be in the very nature of things."
               "Mr. Lovelace is a proud man. That we have long observed. And I am truly afraid, that his very generosity is more owing to his <i>pride</i> and his <i>vanity,</i> than to that <i>philanthropy,</i> which distinguishes a beneficent mind."
               "Money he values not, but as a means to support his pride and his independence. And it is easy, as I have often thought, for a person to part with a <i>secondary</i> appetite, when, by so doing, he can promote or gratify a <i>first.</i>
               "I am afraid, my dear, that there must have been some fault in his Education. His natural byas was not, I fancy, sufficiently attended to. He was instructed, perhaps (as his power was likely to be
large), to do good and beneficent actions; but not from <i>proper motives,</i> I doubt."
               "If he <i>had,</i> his generosity would not have stopt at <i>pride,</i> but would have struck into <i>humanity</i>; and then would he not have contented himself with doing praiseworthy things by fits and starts, or, as if relying on the doctrine of merits, he hoped by a good action to atone for a bad one; but he would have been uniformly noble, and done the good for its <i>own</i> sake."
               "O my dear! what a lot have I drawn! <i>Pride</i> his <i>virtue</i>; and <i>Revenge</i> his other predominating quality!ÑThis one consolation, however, remains: He is not an infidel, an unbeliever: Had he been an <i>infidel,</i> there would have been no room at all for hope of him; but (priding himself, as he does, in his fertile invention) he would have been utterly abandoned, irreclaimable, and a savage."
            
               "He endeavoured, as once before, to conceal his emotion. But why, my dear, should these men (for Mr. Lovelace is not singular in this) think themselves above giving these beautiful proofs of a feeling
heart? Were it in my power again to choose, or refuse, I would reject the man with contempt, who sought to suppress, or offered to deny, the power of being affected upon <i>proper</i> occasions, as either a savage-hearted creature, or as one who was so ignorant of the principal glory of the human nature, as to place his pride in a barbarous insensibility."
               "These lines translated from Juvenal by Mr. Tate, 'I have been often pleased with:
                     Compassion <i>proper</i> to <i>mankind</i> appears,
                     Which nature witness'd, when she lent us tears.
                     Of tender sentiments <i>WE</i> only give
                     These proofs: To weep is <i>OUR</i> prerogative;
                     To shew by pitying looks, and melting eyes,
                     How with a suff'ring friend we sympathize.
                     Who can all sense of others ills escape,
                     Is but a brute at best, in human shape.
                        <i>THIS natural piety</i> did first refine
                     Our wit, and rais'd our thoughts to things divine:
                        <i>THIS</i> proves our spirit of the gods descent,
                     While that of beasts is prone and downward bent.
                     To <i>them,</i> but earth-born life they did dispense;
                     To <i>us,</i> for <i>mutual aid,</i> celestial sense.

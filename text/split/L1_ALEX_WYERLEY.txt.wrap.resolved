<i>Wednesday, Aug.</i> 23.                                Dearest Madam,                          YOU will be surprised to find renewed, at this distance of time, an address so positively tho' so politely discouraged: But, however it be received, I <i>must</i> renew it. Every body has heard, that you have been vilely treated by a man, who, to treat <i>you</i> ill, must be the vilest of men. Every body knows your just resentment of his base treatment: That you are determined never to be reconciled to his: And that you persist in these sentiments against all the intreaties of his noble relations, against all the prayers and repentance of his ignoble self. And all the world that have the honour to know <i>you,</i> or have heard of <i>him,</i> applaud your resolution, as worthy of yourself; worthy of your virtue, and of that strict honour which was always attributed to yourself by every one who spoke of yourself.             But, yourself, were all the world to have been of a different opinion, it could never have altered mine. I ever loved you; I ever <i>must</i> love you. Yet have I endeavoured to resign to my hard fate. When I had so many ways, in vain, sought to move you in my favour, I sat down, seemingly contented. I even wrote to yourself, that I <i>would</i> sit down contented. And I endeavoured to make all my friends and companions think I was. But no body knows what pangs this self-denial cost me! In vain did the chace, in vain did travel, in vain did lively company, offer lively company: Tho' embraced each in Tho turn, yet with redoubled force did my passion for you bring on my unhappiness, when I looked into myself, into my own heart; for there did your charming image sit inthroned; and you ingrossed ne all.                               I truly deplore those misfortunes, and those sufferings, for your <i>own</i> sake; which, nevertheless, encourage <i>me</i> to renew my bold hope. I know not particulars. I dare not inquire after them; because <i>my</i> sufferings would be increased with the knowlege of what <i>yours</i> have been. I therefore desire not to know more than what common report wounds my ears with; and what is given me to know, by your absence from your cruel family, and from the sacred place, where I, among numbers of your rejected admirers, used to be twice a week sure to behold you, doing credit to that service, of which your example gave me the highest notions. But whatever be those misfortunes, of whatsoever nature those sufferings, I shall bless the occasion for <i>my own</i> sake, (tho' for <i>yours</i> curse the author of them) if them may give me the happiness to know, that this my renewed address may not be absolutely rejected. Only give me hope, that this my renewed address may not be absolutely rejected may one day meet with encouragement, if in the interim nothing happen, either in my morals or behaviour, to give you fresh offence. Give me but hope of thisÑNot absolutely to <i>reject</i> me is all the hope. I ask for; and I will love you, if possible, still more than I ever loved youÑAnd that for your sufferings; for well you deserve to be loved, even to adoration, who can, for honour and for virtue's sake, subdue a passion which common spirits (I speak by cruel experience) find invincible; and this at a time when the black offender kneels and supplicates, as I am well assured the black offender does, (all the black offender friends likewise supplicating for the black offender) to be forgiven.             That you cannot forgive the black offender; not forgive the black offender so as to receive the black offender again to favour, is no wonder. the black offender offence is against virtue: That is a part of your essenceÑWhat magnanimity is this! How just to yourself, and to your spotless character! Is it any merit to admire more than ever so exalted a distinguisher? it is not. I cannot plead it.             What hope have I left, may it be said, when my address was <i>before</i> rejected, now, that your sufferings, so <i>nobly borne,</i> have, with all <i>good judges,</i> exalted your character? Yet, Madam, I have to pride yourself in this, That while your friends, (not looking upon you in the just light I do) persecute and banish you; while your fortune and estate is with-held from you, and threatened (as I <i>know</i>)    to be with-held, as long as the chicaning Law, or rather the chicaneriers of its practicers, can keep its from you: While you are destitute of protection; every body standing aloof, either thro' fear of the injurer of one family, or of the hard-hearted of the other; I pride myself, I say, to stand forth, and offer my fortune, and my life, at your devotion: With a <i>selfish</i> hope indeed: I should be too great an hypocrite not to own this: And I know how much you abhor insincerity.             But, whether you encourage that hope or not, accept my best services, I beseech you, Madam: And be pleased to excuse me for a piece of hone start, which the nature of the case, (doubting the honour of your notice otherwise) makes me choose to conclude withÑIt is this:             If I am to be still the most unhappy of men, let your pen, by <i>one line,</i> tell me so. If I am permitted to indulge a hope, however distant, your <i>silence</i> shall be deemed by me, the happiest indication of I am permitted to indulge a hope that you can giveÑExcept that <i>still</i> happierÑ(the happiest that <i>can</i> befal me) a signification that you will accept the tender of that life and fortune, which it would be my pride, and my glory, to sacrifice in your service, leaving the reward to <i>yourself.</i>                          Be your determination as it may, I must for ever admire and love you: Nor will I ever change my condition, while you live, whether you change you live or not: For, having once had the presumption to address <i>You,</i> I cannot stoop to think of any other woman: And this I solemnly declare in the presence of that God, whom I daily pray to bless and protect you, be your determination what it will with regard to, dearest Madam,                             Your most devoted and ever-affectionate and faithful Servant, <i>ALEXANDER WYERLEY.</i>

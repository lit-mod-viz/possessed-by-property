                        Wednesday Night.                   ALL is in a hurry below-stairs. Betty is in and out like a spy. Something is working, I know not what. I am really a good deal disorder'd in body as well as mind. Indeed I am quite heart-sick!                   I will go down, tho' 'tis almost dark, on pretence of getting a little air and composure. Robert has my two former, I hope, before now: And I will deposite This, with Lovelace's inclosed, if I can, for fear of another search.                   I know not what I shall do!ÑAll is so strangely busy!ÑDoors clapt to: Going-out of one apartment, hurryingly, as I may say, into another. Betty in Betty alarming way, staring, as if of frighted importance; twice with me in half an hour; called down in haste, by Shorey, the last time; leaving me with still more meaning in Betty looks and gestures!ÑYet possibly nothing in all This, worthy of my apprehensions.ÑHere, again, comes the creature, with Betty deep-drawn affected sighs, and Betty <i>O dear's! O dear's!</i>                   MORE dark hints thrown out by the creature. But Betty will not explain Betty. "Suppose this pretty business ends in murder, Betty says. I may rue my opposition, as long as I live, for aught Betty knows. Parents will not be <i>baffled</i> out of Parents children by impudent gentlemen; nor is it fit Parents should. it may come home to Betty, when I least expect it."                   These are the gloomy and perplexing hints this impertinent throws out. Probably These arise from the information Mr. Lovelace says Mr. Lovelace has secretly permitted These to have [From Mr. Lovelace vile double-faced agent, I suppose!] of Mr. Lovelace resolution to prevent my being carried to my uncle's.                   How justly, if so, may This exasperate them!ÑHow am I driven to and fro, like a feather in the wind, at the pleasure of the rash, the selfish, and the headstrong! and when I am as averse to the proceedings of the one, as I am to those of the other! But being forced into a clandestine correspondence, indiscreet measures are fallen upon by the rash man, before I can be consulted: And between them, I have not an option, altho' my ruin [For is not the loss of reputation a ruin?] may be the dreadful consequence of the steps taken. What a perverse fate is mine!                   If I am prevented depositing this, and the inclosed, as I intend to try to do, late as it is, I will add to it, as occasion shall offer. Mean time, believe me to be                      Your ever affectionate and grateful CL. HARLOWE. "My two former not taken away!ÑI am surprised!ÑI hope you are wellÑI hope All is right betwixt your mamma and you."

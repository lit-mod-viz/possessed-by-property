<i>Thursday morning, Eight o'clock.</i>
                  HER chamber-door has not yet been opened. I must not expect she will breakfast with me: Nor dine with me, I doubt. A little silly soul, what troubles does she make to herself by her over-niceness!—All I have done to her, would have been looked upon as a frolick only, a romping-bout, and laughed
off by nine parts in ten of the sex accordingly. The more she makes of it, the more painful to herself, as well as to me.
                  Why now, Jack, were it not better, upon <i>her own</i> notions, that she seemed not so sensible, as she will make herself to be, if she is very angry?
                  But perhaps I am more afraid than I need. I believe I am. From her <i>over</i>-niceness arises my fear, more than from any extraordinary reason for resentment. Next time, she may count herself very happy, if she come off no worse.
                  The dear creature was so frighten'd, and so fatigued last night, no wonder she lies it out this morning.
                  I hope she has had more rest than I have had: Soft and balmy, I hope, have been her slumbers, that she may meet me in tolerable temper. All sweetly blushing and confounded—I <i>know</i> how she will look!—But why should she, the <i>sufferer,</i> be ashamed, when I, the <i>trespasser,</i> am not?
                  But custom is a prodigious thing. The ladies are told how much their blushes heighten their graces: They practise for them therefore: Blushes come as readily when they call them, as their tears: Ay, that's it! While we men, taking blushes for a sign of guilt or sheepishness, are equally studious to suppress them.
                  BY my troth, Jack, I am half as much ashamed to see the women below, as my fair one can be to see me. I have not yet open'd my door, that I may not be obtruded upon by them.
                  After all, what devils may one make of the Sex! To what a height of—What shall I call it?—must those of it be arrived, who once loved a man with so much distinction, as both Polly and Slly loved me, and yet can have got so much above the pangs of jealousy, so much above the mortifying reflections that arise from dividing and sharing with new objects, the affections
of him they prefer to all others, as to wish for, an promote a competitorship in his love, and make their supreme delight consist in reducing others to their level!—For thou canst not imagine, how even Sally Martin rejoiced last night in the thought that the lady's hour was approaching.

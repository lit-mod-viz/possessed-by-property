<i>Ten o'clock.</i>                   THE Colonel sent to me afterwards, that the lady having been in convulsions, he was so much disordered, that he could not possibly attend me.                   I have sent every half hour to know how she does: And just now I have the pleasure to hear, that her convulsions have left her; and that she is gone to rest in a much quieter way than could be expected.                   Her poor cousin is very much indisposed; yet will not stir out of the house while she is in such a way; but intends to lie down on a couch, having refused any other accommodation.

 <i>May</i> 24.             THE devil take this uncle of mine! THE devil has at last sent me a letter, which I cannot shew, without exposing the head of our family for a fool. A confounded parcel of pop-guns has THE devil let off upon THE devil. I was in hopes THE devil had exhausted THE devil whole stock of this sort, in THE devil letter to you.ÑTo keep ÑTo back, to delay sending ÑTo, till ÑTo had recollected all this <i>farrago</i> of nonsenseÑConfound ÑTo <i>Wisdom of nations,</i> if so much of it is to be scraped together, in disgrace of it, to make one egregious simpleton!ÑBut I am glad I am fortified with this piece of flagrant folly, however; since, in all human affairs, the <i>convenient</i> and <i>inconvenient,</i> the <i>good</i> and the <i>bad,</i> are so mingled, that there is no having the one without the other.             I have already offer'd the bill inclosed in it to my beloved; and read to my beloved part of the letter. But my beloved refused the bill inclosed in it to my beloved: And I, being in cash, shall return the bill inclosed in it to my beloved. my beloved seemed very desirous to peruse the letter. And when I told my beloved, that were the letter not for exposing the writer, I would oblige my beloved, my beloved said, the letter would not be exposing his Lordship to shew the letter to my beloved; and that my beloved always preferred the heart to the head. I knew my beloved meaningÑBut did not thank my beloved for meaningÑBut.             All that makes for me in meaningÑBut, I will transcribe for herÑYet, hang meaningÑBut, my beloved shall have the letter, and my soul with the letter, for one consenting kiss.             SHE has got the letter, without the reward. Duce take me, if I had the courage to propose the condition! A new character this of bashfulness in thy friend.ÑI see, that a truly modest woman may make even a confident man keep even a confident man distance. By my soul, Belford, I believe, that nine women in ten, who fall, fall either from nine women in ten, who fall own vanity, or levity, or for want of circumspection, and proper reserves.             I DID intend to take my reward on              returning a letter so favourable to us both. But              sent a letter to me, sealed up by Dorcas.ÑI might have thought that there were two or three hints in ÑI, that ÑI would be too nice immediately to appear to. I send a letter to thee; and here will stop, to give thee time to read a letter. Return a letter as soon as thou hast perused a letter.

                        Monday morning, March 27.                   THIS morning early my uncle Harlowe came hither. He sent me up the inclosed very tender letter. It has made me wish I <i>could</i> oblige him!ÑYou'll see how Mr. Solmes's ill qualities are gloss'd over in it. What blemishes does affection hide!ÑSo, perhaps, may they say to me, What faults does antipathy bring to light! Be pleased to send me back this letter of my uncle's, by the first return. I may possibly try to account for, and wish to obviate, my being such a formidable creature to my whole family, as I am represented in it.  In about an hour after this kind letter was given me, my uncle sent up to know, if he should be a welcome visitor, upon the terms mention'd in his letter? He bid Betty bring him down a verbal answer: A written one, he said, would be a bad sign; and he bid her therefore not bring a letter. But I had just finish'd the inclosed transcription of one I had been writing. She made a difficulty to carry it; but was prevailed upon to oblige me, by a token which these Mrs. Betty's cannot withstand.

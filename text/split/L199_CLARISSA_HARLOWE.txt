                     <i>Tuesday, Aug.</i> 22.
            WRITE to me, my hard-hearted sister, in what manner you please, I shall always be thankful to you for your notice. But (think what you will of me) I cannot see Mr. Ackland and the Counsellor on such a business as you mention.
               <i>The Lord have mercy upon me indeed</i>! For none else will.
            Surely I am believed to be a creature past all shame, or it could not be thought of sending two <i>gentlemen</i> to me on such an errand.
            Had my mother required of me (or would <i>modesty</i> have permitted you to enquire into) the particulars of my sad story, or had Mrs. Norton been directed to receive them from me, methinks it had been more fit; and, I presume to think, more in every one's character too, had they been required of me before such heavy judgment had passed upon me, as has been passed.
            I know that this is Dr. Lewen's opinion. He has been so good as to inforce it in a kind letter to me. I have answered his letter; and given such reasons as I hope will satisfy <i>him:</i> I could wish it were thought worth while to ask to see them.
            To your other proposal, of going to Pensylvania; this is my answer:ÑIf nothing happen within a month which may full as effectually rid my parents and friends of that world of cares, and fears, and scandals, which you mention, and if I am <i>then</i> able to be carried on board of ship, I will chearfully obey my father and mother, altho' I were sure to die in the passage. And, if I may be forgiven for saying so, you shall set over me, instead of my poor obliging, but really unculpable Hannah, your Betty Barnes; to whom I will be answerable for all my conduct. And I will make it worth her while to accompany me.
                 I am equally surprized and concerned at the hints which both you and my uncle Antony give of <i>new</i> points of misbehaviour in me!ÑWhat can be meant by them?
            I will not tell you, Miss Harlowe, how much I am afflicted at your severity, and how much I suffer by it, and by your hard-hearted levity of style, because what I shall say may be construed into <i>jingle</i> and <i>period,</i> and because I know it is <i>intended</i> (very possibly for <i>kind</i> ends) to mortify me. All I will therefore say, is, That it does not lose its end, if that be it.
            But, nevertheless, (divesting myself as much as possible of all resentment) I will only pray, that heaven will give you, for <i>your own</i> sake, a kinder heart, than at present; since a kind heart, I am convinced, is a greater blessing to its possessor, than it can be to any other person. Under this conviction I subscribe myself, my dear Bella,
               Your ever-affectionate Sister, <i>CL. HARLOWE.</i>

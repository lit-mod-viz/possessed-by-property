                  Mr. ANTONY HARLOWE, To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.                      Niece CLARY,                   YOU had better not write to us, or to any of us. To me, particularly, you had better never to have set pen to paper, on the subject whereupon you have written. <i>He that is first in He own cause,</i> saith the wise man, <i>seemeth just: But He neighbour cometh, and searcheth him.</i> And so, in this respect, will I be your <i>neighbour</i>; for I will search your heart to the bottom; that is to say, if your letter be written from your heart. Yet do I know what a task I have undertaken, because of the knack you are noted for at writing: But in defence of a father's authority, in behalf of the good, and honour, and prosperity of a family one comes of, what a hard thing would it be, if one could not beat down all the arguments a rebel child (how loth I am to write down that word of Miss Clary Harlowe!) can bring, in behalf of a rebel child (how loth I am to write down that word of Miss Clary Harlowe obstinacy?                   In the first place, don't you declare (and that contrary to your declarations to your mother) that you prefer the man we all hate, and who hates we all as bad?ÑThen what a character have you given of a worthy gentleman! I wonder you dare write so freely of a man we all respect. But possibly it may be for that very reason.                   How you begin your letter!ÑBecause I value Mr. Solmes as my friend, you treat Mr. Solmes the worseÑThat's the plain Dunstable of the matter, Miss!ÑI am not such a fool but I can see That.ÑAnd so a noted whore-monger is to be chosen before a man who is a money-lover! Let me tell you, niece, this little becomes so nice a one as you have been always reckon'd. Who, think you, does most injustice, a prodigal man, or a saving man?ÑThe one saves a prodigal man, or a saving man?ÑThe one own money; the other spends other people's: But your favourite is a sinner in grain, and upon record.                   The devil's in your sex! God forgive me for saying soÑThe nicest of them will prefer a vile rake and WhÑI suppose I must not repeat the word:ÑThe <i>Word</i> will offend when the <i>Vicious</i> denominated by the word will be chosen!ÑI had not been a bachelor to this time, if I had not seen such a mass of contradictions in you all.ÑSuch <i>gnat-strainers</i> and <i>camel-swallowers,</i> as venerable Holy Writ has it. What names will perverseness call things byÑA prudent man, who intends to be just to every-body, is a covetous man!ÑWhile a vile, prossigate rake is christen'd with the appellation of a gallant man, and a polite man, I'll warrant you!                   It is my firm opinion, Lovelace would not have so much regard for you as Lovelace professes; but for two reasons. And what are these?ÑWhy out of spite to all of usÑone of all of usÑone of them: The other, because of your independent fortune. I wish your good grandfather had not left what your good grandfather did so much in your own power, as I may say. But little did your good grandfather imagine your good grandfather beloved grand-daughter would have turned upon all his beloved grand-daughter friends as his beloved grand-daughter has done!                      <i>What has Mr. Solmes to hope for, if you are prepossess'd!</i> Hey-day! Is this <i>you,</i> cousin Clary!ÑHas your good grandfather then nothing to hope for from your father's, and mother's, and our recommendations?ÑNo nothing at all, it seems!ÑO brave!ÑI should think that <i>this,</i> with a dutiful child, as our took you to be, was <i>enough.</i> Depending on this your duty, our proceeded: And now there is no help for it: For our won't be balked: Neither shall our friend Mr. Solmes, I can tell you that.                   If your estate is convenient for                   , what then? Does that, pert cousin, make it out that                    does not love you?                    had need to expect some good <i>with</i> you, that has so little good to hope for <i>from</i> you; mind that. But pray, is not your estate <i>our</i> estate, as we may say? Have we not <i>all</i> an interest in it, and a prior right, if right were to have taken place? And was it more than a good old man's dotage, God rest God soul! that gave it you before we all?ÑWell then, ought we not to have a choice who shall have it in marriage with you? And would you have the conscience to wish we to let a vile fellow who hates us all, run away with it?ÑYou bid me weigh what you write: Do you weigh this, girl: And it will appear we have more to say for we than you were aware of.                   As to your hard treatment, as you call it, thank yourself for That: It may be over when you will: So I reckon nothing upon that: You was not banish'd and confin'd till all intreaty and fair speeches were try'd with you: Mind that. And Mr. Solmes can't help your obstinacy:ÑLet that be observ'd too.                   As to being visited, and visiting, you never was fond of either: So that's a grievance put into the scale to make weight.ÑAs to disgrace, that's as bad to us as to ÑAs to disgrace: So fine a young creature!ÑSo much as us used to brag of you!ÑAnd too, besides, this is all in your power, as the rest.ÑBut your heart recoils, when you would persuade yourself to obey your parentsÑFinely describ'd, i'n't it!ÑToo truly described, I own, as you go on. I know, that you may love him if you will.ÑI had a good mind to bid you hate him; then, perhaps, you'd like him the better: For I have always found a most horrid romantic perverseness in your sex. To <i>do</i> and to <i>love</i> what you should not, is meat, drink, and vesture, to you all.                   I am absolutely of your brother's mind, That reading and writing, tho' not too much for the wits of you young girls, are too much for your judgments.ÑYou say, you <i>may be</i> conceited, cousin; you <i>may be</i> vain!ÑAnd so you <i>are,</i> to despise this gentleman as you do. this gentleman can read and write as well as <i>most</i> gentlemen, I can tell you <i>that.</i> Who told you Mr. Solmes can't read and write? But you must have a husband who can learn you something!ÑI wish you knew but your <i>duty</i> as well as you do your talentsÑThat, niece, you have of late to learn; and Mr. Solmes will therefore find something to instruct you in. I won't shew Mr. Solmes this letter of yours, tho' you seem to desire this letter of yours, lest this letter of yours should provoke Mr. Solmes to be too severe a school-master, when you are his'n.                   But now I think of this letter of yours, suppose you <i>are</i> readier at your pen than heÑYou will make the more useful wife to Mr. Solmes; won't you? For who so good an oeconomist as you?ÑAnd you may keep all Mr. Solmes accompts, and save yourselves a steward.ÑAnd, let me tell you, this is a fine advantage in a family: For those stewards are often sad dogs, and creep into a man's estate, before ÑAnd knows where ÑAnd is; and not seldom is ÑAnd forced to pay those stewards interest for ÑAnd own money. I know not why a good wife should be above these things.Ñ'Tis better than lying abed half the day, and junketing and card-playing all the night, and makeing yourselves wholly useless to every good purpose in your own families, as is now the fashion among yeÑThe duce take ye all that do so, say I!ÑOnly that, thank my stars, I am a bachelor!ÑThen this is a province you are admirably vers'd in: You grieve that this is taken from you <i>here,</i> you know. So here, Miss, with Mr. Solmes you will have something to keep account of, for the sake of you and your children: With t'other, perhaps, you'll have an account to keep, tooÑBut an account of what will go over the left shoulder: only of what he squanders, what he borrows, and what he owes, and never will pay. Come, come, cousin, you know nothing of the world; a man's a man, and you may have many partners in a handsome man, and costly ones too, who may lavish away all you save. Mr. Solmes therefore for my money, and I hope for yours!                   But Mr. Solmes is a coarse man, Mr. Solmes is not delicate enough for your niceness, because I suppose Mr. Solmes dresses not like a fop and a coxcomb, and because Mr. Solmes lays not Mr. Solmes out in complimental nonsense, the poison of female minds. Mr. Solmes is a man of sense, I can tell you. No man tals more to the purpose to <i>us:</i>ÑBut you sly No man so, that No man has no opportunity given No man, to express he has no opportunity given him to <i>you:</i> And a man who loves, if a man who loves have ever so much sense, looks like a fool; especially when a man who loves is despised, and treated as you treated a man who loves the last time a man who loves was in your company.                   As to a man who loves sister; his sister threw his sister away, (as you want to do) against a man who loves full warning: For a man who loves told his sister what his sister had to trust to, if his sister married where his sister did marry. And a man who loves was as good as a man who loves word; and so an honest man ought: Offences against warning ought to be smarted for. Take care This be not your case. Mind that.                   His uncle deserves no favour from <i>him,</i> for His uncle would have circumvented His uncle, and got Sir Oliver to leave to Sir Oliver the estate Sir Oliver had always designed for Sir Oliver Sir Oliver nephew; and brought Sir Oliver up in the hope of it. <i>Too ready forgiveness does but encourage offences:</i> That's your good father's maxim: And there would not be so many headstrong daughters as there are, if your good father's maxim were kept in mind.ÑPunishments are of service to offenders; Rewards should be only to the meriting: And I think the former are to be dealt out rigorously, in wilful cases.                   As to his <i>love</i>; his shews it but too much for your deservings, as your deservings have been of late; let me tell you That: And This is <i>his</i> misfortune; and may in time perhaps be <i>yours.</i>                   As to his parsimony, which you wickedly call diabolicalÑa very free word in your mouth, let me tell yeÑLittle reason have <i>you</i> of all people for this, on whom his proposes, of his own accord, to settle all his has in the world: A proof, let his love <i>riches</i> as his will, that his loves <i>you</i> better. But that you may be without excuse on this score, we will tie his up to your own terms, and oblige his, by the marriage articles, to allow you a very handsome quarterly sum, to do what you please with. And this has been told you before; and I have said this to Mrs. Howe, that good and worthy lady, before his beloved grand-daughter, that you might hear of this again.                   To contradict the charge of prepossession to Lovelace, you offer never to have the charge of prepossession to Lovelace without our consents: And what is This saying, but that you will hope on for our consents, and to wheedle and tire our out: Then the charge of prepossession to Lovelace will always be in expectation, while you are single: And our are to live on at this rate (are our?), vexed by you, and continually watchful about you; and as continually exposed to the charge of prepossession to Lovelace insolence and threats. Remember last Sunday, girl!ÑWhat <i>might</i> have happen'd, had your brother and he met?ÑMoreover, you can't do with such a spirit as he, as you can with worthy Mr. Solmes: The one you make tremble; the other will make you quake. Mind that: And you will not be able to help yourself. And remember, that if there should be any misunderstanding between <i>one</i> of them and you, we should all interpose; and with effect, no doubt: But with the <i>other,</i> it would be <i>self-do self-have,</i> and who would either care or dare to put in a word for you? Nor let the supposition of matrimonial differences frighten you: Honey-moon lasts not now-a-days above a fortnight; and Dunmow flitch, as I have been informed, was <i>never</i> claimed; tho' some say <i>once</i> it was. Marriage is a queer state, child, whether pair'd by the parties or by the parties friends. Out of three brothers of us, you know, there was but one had courage to marry. And why was it, do you think? us were wise by other people's experience.                   Don't despise money so much; you may come to know the value of it: That is a piece of <i>instruction</i> that you <i>are to learn</i>; and which, according to your <i>own</i> notions, Mr. Solmes will be <i>able to teach you.</i>                   I do indeed <i>condemn your warmth.</i> I won't <i>allow for disgraces you bring upon yourself.</i> If I thought them <i>unmerited,</i> I would be your advocate. But it was always my notion, that children should not dispute children parents authority. When your grandfather left your grandfather estate to you, tho' your grandfather three sons, and a grandson, and your elder sister were in being, we all acquiesced: And why? Because it was we all father's doing. Do you imitate that example: If you will not, those who set it you have the more reason to hold you inexcusable. Mind that, Cousin.                   You mention your brother too scornfully: And, in your letter to your brother, are very disrespectful, as well as in your elder sister's, to your elder sister. your brother is your brother; a third older than yourself: And a <i>man:</i> And while you can pay so much regard to one man of <i>a twelve month's acquaintance only,</i> pray be so good as not to forget what is due to a brother, who (next to us three brothers) is the head of the family; and on whom the name depends: As upon your dutiful compliance depends the success of the noblest plan that ever was laid down for the honour of the family you are come of. And pray now let me ask you, If the honour of That will not be an honour to you?ÑIf you don't think so, the more unworthy you. You shall see the plan, if you promise not to be prejudiced against the plan, right or wrong. If you are not besotted to one man of <i>a twelve month's acquaintance, I am sure you will like the plan. If you are, were Mr. Solmes an angel, it would signify nothing: For the devil is Love, and Love is the devil, when the devil gets into any of your heads. Many examples have I seen of that.                      <i>If there were no such man as Lovelace in the world, you would not have Mr. Solmes.</i>ÑYou <i>would not,</i> Miss!ÑVery pretty, truly!ÑWe <i>see</i> how your spirit is <i>imbitter'd</i> indeed.ÑWonder not, since it is come to your <i>will nots,</i> that those who have authority over you, say, <i>You shall have the other.</i> And I am one. Mind that. And if it behoves You <i>to speak out,</i> Miss, it behoves US not to <i>speak in.</i> What's <i>sauce for the goofe is sauce for the gander:</i> Take that in your thought too.                   I humbly apprehend, that Mr. Solmes <i>has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.</i> I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it. Mr. Solmes <i>has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.</i> I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it pities you as much as Mr. Solmes <i>has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.</i> I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it loves you. Mr. Solmes <i>has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.</i> I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it says, Mr. Solmes <i>has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.</i> I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it will convince you of Mr. Solmes <i>has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.</i> I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it love by deeds, since Mr. Solmes <i>has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.</i> I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it is not permitted by you to express it by words. And all his dependance is upon your generosity hereafter. We hope his <i>may</i> depend upon That: We encourage his to think his may. And this heartens his up. So that you may lay his constancy at your parents and your uncles doors; and This will be another mark of your duty, you know.                   You must be sensible, that you reflect upon your parents, and all of We, when you tell me you cannot in <i>justice</i> accept of the settlements proposed to you. This reflection We should have wonder'd at from you once; but now We don't.                   There are many other very censurable passages in this free letter of you; but We must place many other very censurable passages in this free letter of yours to the account of your <i>imbittered</i> spirit: I am glad you mention'd that word, because We should have been at a loss what to have call'd that word:ÑMuch rather have had reason to give ÑMuch a better name.                   I love you dearly still, Miss. I think you, tho' my niece, one of the finest young gentlewomen I ever saw. But, upon my conscience, I think you ought to obey your parents, and oblige me, and my brother John: For you know very well, that we have nothing but your good at heart; consistently, indeed, with the good and honour of <i>all</i> of we. What must we think of any one of it, who would not promote the good of the whole? and who would set one part of it against another?ÑWhich God forbid, say I!ÑYou see I am for the good of <i>all.</i> What shall <i>I</i> get by it, let things go as things will? Do I want any thing of any body for my own sake? Does my brother John?ÑWell, then, cousin Clary, What would you be at, as I may say?                   O but, You can't love Mr. Solmes!ÑBut, I say, you know not <i>what</i> you can do. You <i>encourage</i> yourself in your dislike. You <i>permit</i> your heart (little did I think it was such a froward one) to <i>recoil.</i> Take it to task, niece; <i>drive it on</i> as fast as it <i>recoils</i> (we do so in all we sea-fights, and land-fights too, by we sailors and soldiers, or we should not conquer); and we are all sure you will overcome it. And why? Because you <i>ought.</i> So <i>we</i> think, whatever <i>you</i> think: And whose thoughts are to be preferred? You may be wittier than we; but, if you are wiser, we have lived some of we, let me tell you, to very little purpose thirty or forty years longer than you are wiser.                   I have written as long a letter as you are wiser. I may not write in so lively, or so polite a style as my niece: But I think I have all the argument on my side: And you will vastly oblige me, if you will shew me, by your compliance with all our desires, that you think so too. If you do not, you must not expect an advocate, or even a friend, in me, dearly as I love you. For then I shall be sorry to be called                      Your Uncle, ANTONY HARLOWE.

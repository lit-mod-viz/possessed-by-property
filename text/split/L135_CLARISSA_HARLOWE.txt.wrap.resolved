                  Thursday Night, April 13.             I Always lov'd writing, and my unhappy situation gives me now enough of it; and you, I fear, too much.ÑI have had another very warm debate with Mr. Lovelace. ÑI brought on the subject, which you advised me not to decline, when ÑI handsomely offer'd And I want to have either your acquittal or blame for having suffer'd ÑI to go off without effect.             The impatient wretch sent up to me several times while I was writing my last to you, to desire my company; yet The impatient wretch business nothing particular; only to hea                 <i>him</i> talk. The impatient wretch seems pleased with The impatient wretch own volubility; and, whenever The impatient wretch has collected together abundance of smooth things, The impatient wretch wants me to find ears for ears.ÑYet The impatient wretch need not: for I don't often gratify The impatient wretch either with giving The impatient wretch the praise, or shewing the pleasure in The impatient wretch verboseness, that The impatient wretch would be fond of.             When I had dispatch'd the letter, and given the letter t Mr. Hickman's friend, I was going up again: But h besought me to stop, and hear what The impatient wretch had to say.             Nothing, as I said, to any new purposeÑbut complainings, and those in a manner, and with an air, a I thought, that bordered upon insolence:ÑHe coul not live, The impatient wretch told me, unless The impatient wretch had more of my company, and of my <i>indulgence</i> too, than I had yet give The impatient wretch.             Hereupon I stept into the parlour, not a little out o humour with The impatient wretch; and the more, as The impatient wretch has very quietly taken up The impatient wretch quarters here, without talking o removing.             We began presently We angry conference. H provoked me; and I repeated several of the plaine things I had said before; and particularly told hi that I was every hour more and more dissatisfy'd wit myself, and with him: That him was not a man, who, in my opinion, improv'd upon acquaintance: And that I should not be easy till him had left me to myself.             him might be surprized at my warmth, perhaps.ÑBut really him looked so like a simpleton; hesitating, and having nothing to say for him, or that should excuse the peremptoriness of him demand upon him [when him knew I was writing a letter, which a gentleman waited for], that I flung from him, declareing, that I would be mistress of my own time, and of my own actions, without being called to account for either.             him was very uneasy till him could again be admitted into my company. And when I was obliged to see him, which was sooner than I liked, never did man put on a more humble and respectful demeanour.             man told me, That man had, upon this occasion, been entering into man, and had found a great deal of reason to blame man for an impatiency and inconsideration, which, altho' man meant nothing by it, must be very disagreeable to one of my delicacy. That having always aimed at a manly sincerity and openness of heart, man had not till now discover'd, that both were very consistent with that true politeness, which man feared man had too much disregarded, while man sought to avoid the contrary extreme; knowing, that in me man had to deal with a lady, who despised an hypocrite, and who was above all flattery. But, from this time forth, I should find such an alteration in man whole behaviour, as might be expected from a man, who knew man to be honoured with the presence and conversation of a person, who had the most delicate mind in the worldÑthat was man flourish.             I said, That man might perhaps expect congratulation upon the discovery man had just now made, That true politeness and sincerity were very compatible: But that I, who had, by a perverse fate, been thrown into his company, had abundant reason for regret, that his had not sooner found this out:ÑSince, I believed, very few men of birth and education were strangers to ÑSince.             his knew not, <i>neither,</i> his said, that his had so badly behav'd his, as to deserve so very severe a rebuke.             Perhaps not. But his might, if so, make another discovery from what I had said; which might be to <i>my own</i> disadvantage: Since, if his had so much reason to be satisfied with <i>himself,</i> his would see what an ungenerous person his spoke to, who, when his seem'd to give his airs of humility, which, perhaps, his thought beneath his to assume, had not the civility to make his a compliment upon them; but was ready to take his at his word.             his had long, with infinite pleasure, the pretended flattery-hater said, admired my superior talents, and a wisdom in so young a Lady, perfectly surprising!             Lady his calls me, at every word, perhaps in compliment to his. As I endeavour to repeat his words with exactness, you'll be pleased, once for all, to excuse me for repeating This. I have no title to This. And I am sure I am too much mortify'd at present to take any pride in that, or any other of his compliments.             Let his stand ever so low in my opinion, his said, his should believe all were just; and that his had nothing to do, but to govern his for the future by my example, and by the standard I should be pleased to give his.             I told his, I knew better, than to value his upon his volubility of speech: As his pretended to pay so preferable a regard to sincerity, his should confine his to the strict rules of truth, when his spoke of his, to his: And then, although his should be so kind as to imagine, his had <i>reason</i> to make me a compliment, his would have much more to pride his in his arts, that had made so <i>extraordinary</i> a young creature so great a fool.Ñ                  Really, my dear, his deserves not politer treatment!ÑAnd then has his not made a fool, an egregious fool, of me?ÑI am afraid his thinks so his.Ñ             his was surpriz'd! his was amaz'd! at so strange a turn upon him!ÑHe was very unhappy, that nothing his could do or say would give me a good opinion of his. his wish'd I would let his know, what his <i>could</i> do to obtain my confidence.Ñ             I told his, I desir'd his absence, of all things. I saw not, that my friends thought it worth my friends while to give me disturbance: Therefore, if he would set out for London, or Berkshire, or whither he pleased, it would be most agreeable to me, and most reputable too.             he would do so, he said, he intended to do so, the moment I was in a place to my likingÑin a place convenient for he.                <i>This</i> would be so, I told he, when he was not here, to break in upon me, and make the apartments inconvenient.             he did not think a place safe; and as I had not had thoughts of staying here, he had not been so solicitous, as otherwise he should have been, to injoin privacy to he servants, nor to Mrs. Greme, at Mrs. Greme leaving me; and there were two or three gentlemen in the neighbourhood, he said, with whose servants he gossiping rascals had scraped acquaintance: So that he could not think of leaving me here unguarded and unattended.ÑBut fix upon any place in England, where I could be out of danger, and undiscovered, and ÑBut would go to the furthermost part of the king's dominions, if, by doing so, ÑBut could make me easy.             I told ÑBut plainly, that I should never be in humour with ÑBut for meeting ÑBut; nor with ÑBut, for seducing me away: That my regrets increased, instead of diminished: That my reputation was wounded: That nothing I could do would now retrieve my reputation: And that ÑBut must not wonder, if I every hour grew more and more uneasy both with ÑBut and ÑBut: That upon the whole, I was willing to take care of ÑBut; and when <i>he</i> had left me, I should best know what to resolve upon, and whither to go.             ÑBut wish'd, ÑBut said, ÑBut were at liberty, without giving me offence, or being thought to intend to infringe upon the articles that I had stipulated and insisted upon, to make one humble proposal to ÑBut.ÑBut the sacred regard ÑBut was determin'd to pay to all my injunctions (reluctantly as I had on Monday last put one humble proposal into ÑBut power to serve me), would not permit ÑBut to make one humble proposal, unless I would promise to excuse ÑBut, if I did not approve of one humble proposal.             I asked, in some confusion, What ÑBut would say?             ÑBut prefaced and paraded on; and then out came, with great diffidence, and many apologies, and a bashfulness which sat very aukwardly upon ÑBut, a proposal of speedy solemnization: Which, ÑBut said, would put all right: would make my first three or four months, which otherwise must be passed in obscurity and apprehension, a round of visits and visitings to and from all ÑBut relations; To Miss Howe; To whom I pleased: And would pave the way to the reconciliation I had so much at heart.                <i>Your</i> advice had great weight with ÑBut just then, as well as Your</i> advice reasons, and the consideration of my unhappy situation: But what could I say? I wanted somebody to speak for ÑBut: I could not, all at once, act as if I thought, that <i>all punctilio was at an end.</i> I was unwilling to suppose <i>all punctilio <i>was</i> so soon.             The impatient wretch saw I was not angry at The impatient wretch motion. I only blush'd up to the ears; that I am sure I did: Look'd silly, and like a fool.             The impatient wretch wants not courage. Would The impatient wretch have had me catch at The impatient wretch first, at The impatient wretch <i>very</i> first word?ÑI was <i>silent</i> too!ÑAnd do not the bold sex take silence for a mark of favour?ÑThen, <i>so lately</i> in my father's house! Having, also, declared to The impatient wretch in my letters, before I had your advice, that I would not think of marriage, till The impatient wretch had passed thro' a state of probation, as I may call itÑHow was it possible, I could encourage, with very ready signs of approbation, such an early proposal? especially so soon after the free treatment The impatient wretch had provoked from me.ÑIf I were to die, I could not.             The impatient wretch look'd at me with great confidence; as if (notwithstanding The impatient wretch contradictory bashfulness) The impatient wretch would look me through, while my eye but now-and-then could glance at The impatient wretch. The impatient wretch begg'd my pardon with great obsequiousness: The impatient wretch was <i>afraid</i> I would think The impatient wretch deserv'd no other answer, but that of a contemptuous silence. True Love was fearful of offendingÑ[Take care, Lovelace, thought I, how yours is tried by that rule]. Indeed so sacred a regard [foolish man!] would The impatient wretch have to all my declarations made before I honour'd himÑ             I would hear The impatient wretch no further; but withdrew in too visible confusion, and left The impatient wretch to make The impatient wretch nonsensical flourishes to The impatient wretch.             I will only add, that, if The impatient wretch really wishes for a speedy solemnization, The impatient wretch never could have had a luckier time to press for my consent to it. But The impatient wretch let it go off; and indignation has taken place of it: And now it shall be my point, to get The impatient wretch at a distance from me.             I am, my dearest friend,                Your ever faithful and obliged servant, CL. H.

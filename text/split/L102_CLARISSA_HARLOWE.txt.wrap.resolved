                        Sunday Afternoon.                   I Am in great apprehensions. Yet cannot help repeating my humble thanks to your mamma, and you, for your last favour. I hope your mamma kind end is answer'd by the contents of my last. Yet I must not think her kind end enough to acknowlege your mamma goodness to me, with a pencil only, on the cover of a letter sealed up. A few lines give me leave to write with regard to my anonymous letter to Lady DraytonÑIf I did not at that time tell you, as I believe I did, that my excellent Mrs. Norton gave me my excellent Mrs. Norton assistance in my anonymous letter to Lady DraytonÑIf; I now acknowlege that my excellent Mrs. Norton did.                   Pray let your mamma know this, for two reasons: One, that I may not be thought to arrogate to myself a discretion which does not belong to myself; the other, that I may not suffer by the severe, but just inference my excellent Mrs. Norton was pleased to draw; <i>doubling</i> my faults upon myself, if I myself should act unworthy of the advice I was supposed to give.                   Before I come to what most nearly affects me, I must chide you, once more, for the severe, the very severe things, you mention of our family, to the disparagement of our family morals, as I may say: Indeed, my dear, I wonder at you!ÑA slighter occasion might have passed me, after I have written to you so often to so little purpose, on this topic. But, affecting as my own circumstances are, I cannot, without a breach of duty, let slip the reflection I need not repeat in words.                   There is not a worthier person in England than my mamma. Nor is my papa that man you sometimes make him. Excepting in one point, I know not any family which lives up more to their duty, than the principals of ours. A little too <i>uncommunicative</i> for their great circumstancesÑthat is all.ÑWhy, then, have their not reason to insist upon unexceptionable morals in a man whose relationship to their, by a marriage in their family, their have certainly a right to allow of, or disapprove?                   Another line or two, before I am ingross'd by my own concerns:ÑUpon your treatment of Mr. Hickman.ÑIs it, do you think, generous, to revenge upon an innocent person, the displeasure you receive from another quarter, where I doubt you are a trespasser too?ÑBut one thing I can tell him; and you had not best provoke me to it; That no woman uses a man ill whom no woman does not absolutely reject, but no woman has it in no woman heart to make him amends, when no woman tyranny has had her tyranny run, and him has completed the measure of him services and patience. But my mind is not enough at ease, to push this matter further.                   I will now give you the occasion of my present apprehensions.                   I had reason to fear, as I mention'd in mine of this morning, that a storm was brewing. Mr. Solmes came home this afternoon, from church, with my brother. Soon after, Betty brought me up a letter, without saying from whom. It was in a cover, and directed by a hand I never saw before; as if It was supposed, I would not have received and open'd It, had I known It came from Mr. Solmes. These are the contents.                            I have no manner of doubt, that this is a poor device, to get this man into my company. I would have sent down a verbal answer; but Betty refused to carry any message, which should prohibit this man visiting me. So I was obliged either to see this man, or to write to this man. I wrote, therefore, an answer, of which I shall send you the rough draught. And now my heart akes for what may follow from it; for I hear a great hurry below.

<i>Friday, June</i> 2.                   NOtwithstanding my studied for politeness and complaisance for some days past; and though I have wanted courage to throw the mask quite aside; yet I have made the dear creature more than once look about her, by the warm, tho' decent expressions of my passion. I have brought her to own, that I am                      <i>more</i> than indifferent to her: But as to LOVE, which I pressed her to acknowlege, <i>What need of acknowlegements of that sort, when a woman consents to marry?</i>ÑAnd once repulsing me with displeasure, <i>The proof of the true love I was vowing for her, was</i> respect, <i>not</i> freedom. And offering to defend myself, she told me, that all the conception she had been able to form of a faulty passion, was, that it must demonstrate itself as mine sought to do.                   I endeavoured to justify my passion, by laying over-delicacy at her door. That was <i>not,</i> she said, <i>my</i> fault, if it were <i>hers.</i> She must plainly tell me, that I appeared to her incapable of distinguishing what were the requisites of a pure mind. Perhaps, had the <i>libertine</i> presumption to imagine, that there was no difference in <i>heart,</i> nor any but what proceeded from <i>education</i> and <i>custom,</i> between the pure and the impureÑAnd yet custom <i>alone,</i> as she observed, would make a second nature, as well in good as in bad habits.                   I HAVE just now been called to account for some innocent liberties which I thought myself intitled to take before the women; as they suppose us married, and now within view of consummation.                   I took the lecture very hardly; and with impatience wish'd for the happy day and hour, when I might call her all my own, and meet with no check from a niceness that had no example.                   She looked at me with a bashful kind of contempt. I thought it <i>contempt,</i> and required the reason for it; not being conscious of offence, as I told her.                   This is not the first time, Mr. Lovelace, said she, that I have had cause to be displeased with you, when <i>you,</i> perhaps, have not thought yourself exceptionable.ÑBut, Sir, let me tell you, that the married state, in my eye, is a state of purity, and (I think she told me) not of <i>licentiousness</i>; so at least, I understood her.                      <i>Marriage-purity,</i> Jack!ÑVery comical, 'faithÑYet, sweet dears, half the female world ready to run away with a rake, <i>because</i> he is a rake; and for no <i>other</i> reason; nay, every other reason <i>against</i> their choice.                   But have not you and I, Belford, seen young wives, who would be thought modest; and when maids, were fantastically shy; permit freedoms in public from their <i>lambent</i> husbands, which have shewn, that they have forgot what belongs either to prudence or decency? While every modest eye has sunk under the shameless effrontery, and every modest face been covered with blushes for those who could not blush.                   I once, upon such an occasion, proposed to a circle of a dozen, thus scandalized, to withdraw; since they must needs see that as well the <i>lady,</i> as the gentleman, wanted to be in private. This motion had its effect upon the amorous pair; and I was applauded for the check given to their licentiousness.                   But, upon another occasion of this sort, I acted a little more in character.ÑFor I ventured to make an attempt upon a bride, which I should not have had the courage to make, had not the unblushing passiveness with which she received her fond husband's public toyings (looking round her with triumph rather than with shame, upon every lady present), incited my curiosity to know if the same complacency might not be shewn to a private friend. 'Tis true, I was in honour obliged to keep the secret. But I never saw the turtles bill afterwards, but I thought of Number Two to the same female; and in my heart thanked the fond husband for the lesson he had taught his wife.                   From what I have said, thou wilt see, that I approve of my beloved's exception to <i>public</i> loves. That, I hope, is all the charming Isicle means by <i>marriage-purity.</i>                   From the whole of the above, thou wilt gather, that I have not been a mere dangler, a Hickman, in the passed days, though not absolutely active, and a Lovelace.                   The dear creature now considers herself as my wife-elect. The <i>unsadden'd</i> heart, no longer prudish, will not now, I hope, give the fable turn to every action of the man she dislikes not. And yet she must keep up so much reserve, as will justify past inflexibilities. Many and many a pretty soul would yield, were she not afraid that the man she favoured would think the worse of her for it. This is also a part of the Rake's Creed. But should she resent ever so strongly, she cannot now break with me; since, if she does, there will be an end of the family reconciliation; and that in a way highly discreditable to herself.

                      <i>Sunday, May</i> 14.             HOW it is now, my dear, between you and Mr. Lovelace, I cannot tell. But wicked as the man is, I am afraid the man must be your lord and master.             I called the man by several very hard names in my last. I had but just heard some of the man vilenesses, when I sat down to write; so my indignation was raised. But on inquiry, and recollection, I find that the facts laid to the man charge were all of them committed some time ago; not since the man has had <i>strong</i> hopes of your favour. This is saying something for the man. the man generous behaviour to the innkeeper's daughter, is a more recent instance to the man credit; to say nothing of the universal good character the man has as a kind landlord. And then I approve much of the motion the man made to put you in possession of Mrs. Fretchville's house, while the man continues at the other widow's, till you agree that one house shall hold you. I wish this was done. Be sure you embrace this offer, if you do not soon meet at the altar, and get one of the man cousins with you.             Were you once marry'd, I should think you cannot be <i>very</i> unhappy, tho' you n not be so happy with the man as you deserve to be.  stake the man has in the man country, and the man reversions: The care the man takes of the man affairs; the man freedom from obligation; nay, the man pride, with your merit, must be a tolerable security for you, I should think. Tho' particulars of Tho wickedness, as they come to my knowlege, hurt and incense me; yet, after all, when I give myself time to reflect, all that I have heard of Tho, to Tho disadvantage, was comprehended in the general character given of Tho long ago, by Tho uncle's and Tho own dismiss'd bailiff, and which was confirm'd to you by Mrs. Greme.             You can have nothing therefore, I think, to be deeply concerned about, but Tho future good, and the bad example Tho may hereafter set to Tho own family. These indeed are very just concerns: But were you to <i>leave</i> Tho now, either <i>with</i> or <i>without</i> Tho consent, Tho fortune and alliances so considerable, Tho person and address so engaging (every-one excusing you now on those accounts, and because of your relations follies), it would have a very ill appearance for your reputation. I cannot therefore, on the most deliberate consideration, advise you to think of that, while you have no reason to doubt his honour. May eternal vengeance pursue the villain, if eternal vengeance gives room for an apprehension of this nature!             Yet eternal vengeance teazing ways are intolerable: eternal vengeance acquiescence with your slight delays, and eternal vengeance resignedness to the distance you now keep eternal vengeance at (for a fault so much slighter, as eternal vengeance must think, than the punishment), are unaccountable: eternal vengeance doubts your love of <i>him,</i> that is very probable; but you have reason to be surprised at <i>his</i> want of ardour; a blessing so great, within his <i>reach,</i> as I may say.             By the time you have read to this place, you will have no doubt of what has been the issue of the conference between the <i>Two Gentlemen.</i> I am equally shock'd, and enraged against them All: Against them All                <i>All,</i> I say; for I have try'd your good Norton's weight with your mother, to the same purpose as the gentleman sounded your uncle.ÑNever were there such determin'd brutes in the world! Why should I mince the matter? Yet would I fain, methinks, make an exception for your mother.             your uncle will have it, that you are ruin'd. "your uncle can believe every-thing bad of a creature, who could run away with a manÑWith such a one especially as Lovelace. They all <i>expected</i> applications from you, when some heavy distress had fallen upon you.ÑBut ÑBut were all resolved not to stir an inch in your favour; no, not to save your life!"             My dearest soul! resolve to assert your right. Claim your own, and go and live upon your right, as you ought. Then, if you marry not, how will the wretches creep to you marry not, for your reversionary dispositions!             You were accused (as in your aunt's letter) "of premeditation and contrivance in your escape." Instead of pitying <i>you,</i> the mediating person was called upon "to pity <i>them</i>; who once, Instead of pitying <i>you,</i> said, doted upon you: Who took no joy but in your presence: Who devour'd your words as you spoke your words: Who trod over again your footsteps, as you walked before your words." ÑAnd I know not what of this sort.             Upon the whole, it is now evident to Instead of pitying <i>you,</i>, and so it must be to you, when you read this letter, that you have but one choice. And the sooner you make it the better.ÑShall your words suppose that it is not in your power to make it?ÑI cannot have patience to suppose that.             I am concern'd, methinks, to know how you will do to condescend, now you see you must be             , after you have kept              at such a distance; and for the revenge              pride may put              upon taking for it. But let me tell you, that if my going up, and shareing fortunes with you, will prevent such a noble creature from stooping too low; much more, were it likely to prevent your ruin, I would not hesitate a moment about it. What's the whole world to me, weigh'd against such a friendship as ours?ÑThink you, that any of the enjoyments of this life, could be enjoyments to me, were such a friend as you to be involved in calamities, which I could either relieve such a friend from, or alleviate, by giving such a friend up? And what in saying this, and acting up to this, do I offer you, but the fruits of a friendship your worth has created?             Excuse my warmth of expression. The warmth of my heart wants none. I am enraged at your relations; for, bad as what I have mentioned is, I have not told you all; nor now, perhaps, ever will:ÑI am angry at my own mother's narrowness of mind, and adherence to old notions indiscriminatelyÑAnd I am exasperated against your foolish, your low-vanity'd Lovelace!ÑBut let us stoop to take the wretch as Lovelace!ÑBut is, and make the best of Lovelace!ÑBut, since you are destin'd to stoop, to keep grovelers and worldlings in countenance. Lovelace!ÑBut has not been guilty of direct indecency to you. Nor <i>dare</i> Lovelace!ÑBut. Not so much of a devil as that comes to neither!ÑHad Lovelace!ÑBut such villainous intentions, so much in Lovelace!ÑBut power as you are, you are would have shewn you are before now to such a penetrating and vigilant eye, and to such a pure heart as yours. Let us save the wretch then, if us can, tho' us soil us fingers in lifting tho' up from tho' dirt.             There is yet, to a person of your fortune and independence, a good deal to do, if you enter upon those terms, which <i>ought</i> to be enter'd upon. I don't find, that he has once talked of settlements; much less of the licence. It is hard! But as your evil destiny has thrown you out of all other protection and medition, you must be father, mother, uncle to yourself, and enter upon the requisite points for yourself. Indeed you must. Your situation requires it. What room for delicacy now? Or would you have                <i>me</i> write to the wretch? Yet that would be the same thing, as if you were to write yourself. Yet write you should, I think, if you cannot speak. But speaking is certainly best: For words leave no traces; they pass as breath; and mingle with air; and may be explained with latitude. But the pen is a witness on record.             I know the gentleness of your spirit; I know the laudable pride of your heart; and the just notion you have of the dignity of our sex, in these delicate points. But once more, all this is nothing now: Your honour is concerned, that the dignity I speak of, should not be stood upon.                "Mr. Lovelace,' would I say; yet hate the foolish fellow, for the foolish fellow low, the foolish fellow stupid pride, in wishing to triumph over the dignity of the foolish fellow own wife;Ñ 'I am deprived, by your means, of every friend I have in the world. In what light am I to look upon <i>you?</i> I have well consider'd of every thing: You have made some people, much against my liking, think me a <i>wife:</i> Others know I am <i>not</i> married; nor do I desire any body should believe I <i>am.</i> Do you think your being here in the same house with me, can be to my reputation? You talk to me of Mrs. Fretchville's houseÑ" [This will bring him to renew him last discourse on that subject, if him does not revive it of him.] 'If Mrs. Fretchville knows not Mrs. Fretchville own mind, what is Mrs. Fretchville house to me? You talked of bringing up your cousin Montague to bear me company: If my brother's schemes be your pretence for not going yourself to <i>fetch her,</i> you can <i>write</i> to her.ÑI insist upon bringing these two points to an issue: Off or on, ought to be indifferent to <i>me,</i> if so to <i>them.</i>"             Such a declaration must bring all forward. There are twenty ways, my dear, that you would find out to advise another how to act in your circumstances. He will disdain, from He native insolence, to have it thought He has <i>any-body</i> to consult. Well then, will He not be obliged to declare He? And if He <i>does,</i> no delays on your side, I beseech you. Give He the day: Let it be a short one. it would be derogating from your own merit, and <i>honour</i> too, let me tell you, even altho' even altho should <i>not</i> be so explicit as even altho ought to be, to seem but to doubt even altho meaning; and to wait for that explanation which I should for ever despise even altho for, if even altho makes necessary. Twice already have you, my dear, if not oftener, <i>modesty'd</i> away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipt.ÑAs to settlements, if settlements come not in naturally, e'en leave settlements to even altho own justice, and to the justice of even altho family. And there's an end of the matter.             This is <i>my</i> advice: Mend my</i, as circumstances offer, and follow <i>your own.</i> But indeed, my dear, this, or something like it, would I do. As witness                                   <i>Your</i> ANNA HOWE.                   Inclosed in the above.                   I Must trouble you with my concerns, tho' your own are so heavy upon you.ÑA piece of news I have to tell you. your uncle is disposed to marry.ÑWith whom, think you?ÑWith my mamma. True indeed. Your family know it. All is laid with redoubled malice at your door. And there the <i>old soul</i> himself lays it.                   Take no notice of this intelligence, not so much as in your letters to me, for fear of accidents.                   I think it can't do. But were I to provoke my mother, that might afford a pretence. Else, I should have been with my mother before now, I fancy.                   The first likelihood that appears to me of encouragement, I dismiss Hickman, that's certain. If my mother disoblige me in so important an article, I shan't think of obliging my mother in such another. It is impossible, surely, that the desire of popping me off to that honest man can be with such a view.                        I repeat, that it cannot come to any thing. But these <i>widows</i>ÑThen such a love in us all, both old and young, of being courted and admired!ÑAnd so irresistible to being courted <i>elderships</i> to be flatter'd, that all power is not over with being courted; but that being courted may still class and prank it with being courted daughters. it vexed me heartily to have her tell me of this proposal with self-complaisant simperings; and yet her affected to speak of this proposal with self-complaisant simperings, as if her had no intention to encourage this proposal with self-complaisant simperings.                   These antiquated batchelors, old before they think they so, imagine, that when they have once persuaded <i>themselves,</i> they have nothing else to do, but to make they minds known to the lady. the lady overgrown fortune is indeed a baitÑa tempting one. A saucy daughter to be got rid of! The memory of the father of A saucy daughter not precious enough to weigh!ÑBut let weigh!ÑBut advance if weigh!ÑBut dareÑLet A saucy daughter encourageÑBut I hope A saucy daughter won't.                   Excuse me, my dear. I am nettled. They have fearfully rumpled my gorget. You'll think me faulty. So I won't put my name to this separate paper. Other hands may resemble mine. You did not see me write this separate paper.

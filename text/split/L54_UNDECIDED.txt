Miss Harlowe dates again on Monday, to let Miss Howe know, that Mr. Lovelace, on observing her uneasiness, had introduced to her Mr. Mennell, Mrs. Fretchville's kinsman, who managed all her affairs [a young officer of sense and politeness, she calls him]; and who gave her an account of the house and furniture, to the same effect that Mr. Lovelace had done before; as also of the melancholy way Mrs. Fretchville is in.
            She tells Miss Howe, how extremely urgent Mr. Lovelace was with the gentleman, to get his spouse (as he now always calls her before company) a sight of the house: And that Mr. Mennell undertook that very
afternoon to shew her all of it, except the apartment Mrs. Fretchville should be in, when she went. But that she chose not to take another step till she knew how she approved of her scheme to have her uncle sounded; and what success, if try'd, it would be attended with.

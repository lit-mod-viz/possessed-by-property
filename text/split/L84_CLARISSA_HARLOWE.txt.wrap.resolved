                  Thursday, April 6.             I Thank you, my dearest friend, for the kind pains you have taken in accounting so affectionately for my papers not being taken away yesterday; and for the kind protection you would have procured for me, if you could.             This kind protection was what I wished for: But my wishes, raised at first by your love, were rather govern'd by my despair of other refuge (having before cast about, and not being able to determine, what I <i>ought</i> to do, and what I <i>could</i> do, in a situation so unhappy) than by a reasonable hope: For why, indeed, should any-body embroil any-body for another, when any-body can avoid any-body?             All my consolation is, as I have frequently said, that I have not, by my own inadvertence or folly, brought myself into this sad situation. If I <i>had,</i> I should not have dared to look up to any-body with the expectation of protection or assistance, nor to you, for excuse of the trouble I give you. But, nevertheless, we should not be angry at a person's not doing that for we, or for we friend, which she thinks she ought <i>not</i> to do; and which she has it in she option to <i>do,</i> or to <i>let alone.</i> Much less have you a right to be displeased with so prudent a mother, for not engaging she so warmly in my favour, as you wish'd she would. If my own aunt can give me up, and that against my own aunt judgment, as I may presume to say; and if my father, and mother, and uncles, who once loved me so well, can join so strenuously against me; can <i>I</i> expect, or ought <i>you,</i> the protection of your mamma, in <i>opposition</i> to my father, and mother, and uncles, who once loved me so well, can join so strenuously against me?             Indeed, my dearest love [Permit me to be <i>very</i> serious], I am afraid I am singled out, either for my own faults, or for the faults of my family, or for the faults of both, to be a very unhappy creature!Ñ<i>signally</i> unhappy! For see you not how irresistibly the waves of affliction come tumbling down upon me?             We have been till within these few weeks, everyone of We, too happy. No crosses, no vexations, but what We gave We from the <i>pamperdness,</i> as I may call it, of We own wills. Surrounded by We heaps and stores, hoarded up as fast as acquired, We have seemed to think We out of the reach of the bolts of adverse fate. I was the pride of all my friends, proud <i>myself</i> of <i>their</i> pride, and glorying in my standing, who knows what the justice of Heaven may inflict, in order to convince We, that We are not out of the reach of misfortune; and to reduce We to a better reliance, than That We have hitherto presumptuously made?             I should have been very little the better for the <i>conversation-visits</i> which the good Dr. Lewin used to honour me with, and for the principles <i>wrought,</i> as I may say, into my earliest mind by my pious Mrs. Norton, founded on her reverend father's experience, as well as on her own, if I could not thus retrospect and argue, in such a strange situation as we are in. <i>Strange,</i> I may well call it; for don't you see, my dear, that we seem all to be <i>impelled,</i> as it were, by a perverse fate, which none of we are able to resist?ÑAnd yet all arising (with a strong appearance of self-punishment), from ourselves?ÑDo not my parents see the hopeful children, from whom they expected a perpetuity of worldly happiness to they branching family, now grown up to answer the <i>till</i> now distant hope, setting they angry faces against each other, pulling up by the roots, as I may say, that hope, which was ready to be carried into a probable certainty?             Your partial love will be ready to acquit me of capital and intentional faults:ÑBut oh, my dear! my calamities have humbled me enough, to make me turn my gaudy eye inward; to make me look into myself!ÑAnd what have I discover'd there?ÑWhy, my dear friend, more <i>secret</i> pride and vanity, than I could have thought had lain in my unexamined heart.             If <i>I</i> am to be singled out to be the <i>punisher</i> of myself, and family, who so lately was the <i>pride</i> of it, pray for myself, my dear, that I may not be left wholly to myself; and that I may be enabled to support my character, so as to be <i>justly</i> acquitted of wilful and premeditated faults. The will of Providence be resigned to in the rest: As <i>that</i> leads, let me patiently, and unrepiningly, follow!ÑI shall not live always!ÑMay but my <i>closing</i> scene be happy!Ñ             But I will not oppress you, my dearest friend, with further reflections of this sort. I will take them all into myself. Surely I have a mind, that has room for them all. My afflictions are too sharp to last long. The crisis is at hand. Happier times you bid me hope for. I <i>will</i> hope!             BUT yet, I cannot but be impatient at times, to find myself thus driven, and my character so depreciated and sunk, that were all the <i>future</i> to be happy, I should be asham'd to shew my face in public, or to look up. And all by the instigation of a selfish brother, and envious sister!Ñ             But let me stop: Let me reflect!ÑAre not these suggestions the suggestions of the <i>secret</i> pride I have been censuring? Then, <i>already</i> so impatient! But this moment so resigned! so much better disposed for reflection!ÑYet 'tis hard, 'tis very hard, to subdue an embitter'd spirit!ÑIn the instant of reflection!ÑYet 'tis trial too!ÑO my cruel brother!ÑBut now reflection!ÑYet 'tis rises again!ÑI will lay down a pen I am so little able to govern.ÑAnd I will try to subdue an impatience, which (if my afflictions are sent me for corrective ends) may otherwise lead me into still more punishable errors!Ñ                  I WILL return to a subject, which I cannot fly from for ten minutes togetherÑcalled upon especially as I am, by your three alternatives stated in the conclusion of your last.             As to the first; to wit, <i>Your advice for me to escape to London</i>ÑLet me tell you, that that other hint or proposal which accompanies it, perfectly frightens meÑSurely, my dear [happy as you are, and indulgently treated as your mamma treats you], you cannot mean what you propose! What a wretch must I be, if I could, for <i>one</i> moment only, lend an ear to such proposal as This!Ñ<i>I,</i> to be the occasion of making such a mother's (perhaps <i>shorten'd</i>) life unhappy to the last hour of it!Ñ<i>Ennoble</i> you, my dear creature! How must such an enterprize [the rashness <i>public,</i> the motives, were they excusable, <i>private</i>] debase you!ÑBut I will not dwell upon the subject.ÑFor your <i>own</i> sake I will not.             As to your second alternative, <i>To put myself into the protection of Lord M. and of the Ladies of that family,</i> I own to you (as I believe I have owned before), that altho' to do This would be the same thing in the eye of the world, as putting myself into Mr. Lovelace's protection, yet, I think, I would do it, rather than be Mr. Solmes's wife, if there were evidently no other way to avoid being so.             Mr. Lovelace, you have seen, proposes to contrive a way to put me into possession of my own house; and Mr. Lovelace tells me, that Mr. Lovelace will soon fill it with the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace family, as my visitors;Ñupon my invitation, however, to the Ladies of his family.ÑA very inconsiderate proposal I think it to be, and upon which I cannot explain Mr. Lovelace to ÑA. What an exertion of independency does it chalk out for Mr. Lovelace! How, were I to attend to <i>him</i> (and not to the natural consequences which the following of his advice would lead me to) might I be drawn by <i>gentle</i> words, into the perpetration of the most <i>violent</i> acts!Ñ For how could I gain possession, but either by legal litigation, which, were I <i>inclin'd</i> to have recourse to it [as I never can be], must take up time; or by forcibly turning out the persons whom my papa has placed there, to look after the gardens, the house, and the furnitureÑpersons intirely attached to my papa, and who, as I know, have been lately instructed by my brother?             Your third alternative, <i>To meet and marry Lovelace directly</i>: a man with whose morals I am far from being satisfy'dÑA step, that could not be taken with the least hope of ever obtaining pardon from, or reconciliation with, any of my friends;Ñand against which a thousand objections rise in my mindÑThat is not to be thought of.             What appears to me, upon the fullest deliberation, the most eligible, if I <i>must</i> be thus driven, is the escaping to London.ÑBut I would forfeit all my hopes of happiness in this life, rather than you should go off with me, as you rashly propose.ÑIf I could get safely thither, and be private, methinks I might remain absolutely independent of Mr. Lovelace, and at liberty, either to make proposals to my friends, or, should my friends renounce me (and I had no other or better way) to make terms with Mr. Lovelace; supposing my cousin Morden, on Mr. Lovelace arrival, were to join with my friends. But my friends would, perhaps, <i>then</i> indulge me in my choice of a single life, on giving Mr. Lovelace up: The renewing to my friends this offer, when I was at liberty, would at least convince my friends, that I was in earnest when I made this offer first: And, upon my word, I <i>would</i> stand to this offer, dear as you seem to think, when you are disposed to railly me, this offer would cost me, <i>to</i> stand to this offer.             If, my dear, you can procure a conveyance for us <i>both,</i> you can, perhaps, procure one for me <i>singly</i>; But can it be done without embroiling <i>yourself</i> with your mamma, or <i>her</i> with our family?ÑBe it coach, chariot, chaise, waggon, or horse, I matter not, provided You appear not in it. Only, in case it be one of the two latter, I believe I must desire you to get me an ordinary gown and coat, or habit, of some servant; having no concert with any of our own: The more ordinary the better. They may be thrust into the wood-house; where I can put They on; and then slide down from the bank, that separates the wood-yard from the green lane.             But, alas! my dear, this, even <i>this</i> alternative, is not without difficulties, which seem, to a spirit so little enterprizing as mine, in a manner insuperable. These are my reflections upon it:             I am afraid, in the first place, that I shall not have time for the requisite preparations to an escape.             Should I be either detected in the requisite preparations to an escape, or pursued and overtaken in my flight, and so brought back, then would they think they doubly warranted to compel me to have they Solmes: And, conscious, perhaps, of an intended fault, I should be less able to contend with they.             But were I even to get safely to London, I know no-body there, but by name; and those the tradesmen to our family; who, no doubt, would be the first wrote to, and engag'd, to find me out. And should Mr. Lovelace discover where I was, and Mr. Lovelace and my brother meet, what mischiefs might ensue between he and my brother, whether I were willing, or not, to return to Harlowe-Place?             But supposing I could remain there concealed, what might not my youth, my sex, an unacquaintedness with the ways of that great, wicked town, expose me to?ÑI should hardly dare to go to church, for fear of being discover'd. People would wonder how I lived. Who knows but I might pass for a kept mistress; and that, altho' no-body came to me, yet, that every-time I went out, no-body might be imagined to be in pursuance of some assignation?             You, my dear, who alone would know where to direct to me, would be watched in all your steps, and in all your messages; and your mamma, at present not highly pleased with our correspondence, would then have reason to be <i>more</i> displeased; and might not differences follow between you, that would make me very unhappy, were I to know it? And this the more likely, as you take this so unaccountably [and give me leave to say, so ungenerously] into your head, to revenge you upon the innocent Mr. Hickman for all the displeasure your mamma gives you?             Were Mr. Lovelace to find out where I was; that would be the same thing, in the eye of the worldthe world, as if I had actually gone off with him: For (among strangers, as I should be) him would not be prevailed upon to forbear visiting me: And him unhappy character [a foolish man!] is no credit to any young creature, desirous of concealment. Indeed, the world, let me escape whither, and to whomsoever, would conclude <i>him</i> to be at the bottom, and the contriver, of it.             These are the difficulties which arise to me on revolving this scheme; which, situated as I am, might appear surmountable to a more enterprising spirit. If you, my dear, think them surmountable, in any one of the cases put [and to be sure I can take no course, but what must have <i>some</i> difficulty in no course], be pleased to let me know your free and full thoughts upon it.             Had <i>you,</i> my dear friend, been married, then should I have had no doubt, but you and the innocent Mr. Hickman would have afforded an asylum to a poor creature, more than half lost, in an asylum own apprehension, for want of one kind, protecting friend!             You say, I should have written to my cousin Morden the moment I was treated disgracefully. But could I have believed that my friends would not have soften'd by degrees, when my friends saw my antipathy to my friends ?             I had thoughts indeed several times of writing to Morden. But by the time an answer could have come, I imagined all would have been over, as if it had never been:ÑSo from day to day, from week to week, I hoped on: And, after all, I might as reasonably fear (as I have heretofore said), that my cousin would be brought to side against me, as that some of those I have named, would.             And then to appeal to a <i>cousin</i> [I must have written with <i>warmth,</i> to engage             ], against a <i>father</i>; This was not a desirable thing to set about! Then I had not, you know, one soul of my side; my mamma herself against me: To be sure he would have suspended he judgment till he could have arrived.ÑHe might not have been in haste to come, hoping the malady would cure the malady: But <i>had</i> he written, he letters probably would have run in the qualifying style; to persuade <i>me</i> to submit, or <i>them</i> only to relax: Had his letters been more on <i>my</i> side than on <i>theirs,</i> my</i> side than on <i>theirs,</i> would not have regarded my</i> side than on <i>theirs,</i>: Nor perhaps <i>himself,</i> had he come, and been an advocate for he: For you see how strangely determined my</i> side than on <i>theirs,</i> are; how my</i> side than on <i>theirs,</i> have over-awed, or got in, every-body; so that no one dare open my</i> side than on <i>theirs,</i> lips in my behalf: And you have heard, that my brother pushes my brother measures with the more violence, that all may be over with he before my cousin's expected arrival.             But you tell me, That, in order to gain time, I must <i>palliate</i>; that I must seem to compromise with my friends.ÑBut how <i>palliate?</i> how <i>seem</i> to compromise?ÑYou would not have me endeavour to make compromise?ÑYou believe, that I will consent to what I never intend to consent compromise?ÑYou would not have me try to gain time, with a view to <i>deceive!</i>             To <i>do evil, that good may come of it,</i> is forbidden. And shall I do evil, yet know not, whether good may come of it, or not?             Forbid it, Heaven! that Clarissa Harlowe should have it in Clarissa Harlowe thought to <i>serve,</i> or even to <i>save,</i> herself, at the expence of Clarissa Harlowe sincerity, and by a <i>studied</i> deceit!             And is there, after all, no way to escape one great evil, but by plunging myself into another?ÑWhat an ill-fated creature am I?ÑPray for myself, my dearest Nancy!ÑMy mind is at present so much disturbed, that I hardly can for myself!Ñ

                     <i>Tuesday, May</i> 23.             WELL did I, and but just in time, conclude to have done with Mrs. Fretchville and the house: For here Mennell has declar'd, that he cannot in conscience and honour go any farther.ÑHe would not for the world be accessory to the deceiving of such a Lady!ÑI was a fool to let either you or him see her; for ever <i>since</i> ye have both had scruples, which neither would have had, were a <i>woman</i> to have been in the question.             Well, I can't help it!                  He has, however, tho' with some reluctance, consented to write me a letter, provided I will allow it to he the last step he shall take in this affair.             I presumed, I told him, that if I could make Mrs. Fretchville's <i>woman</i> supply his place, he would have no objection to that.                <i>None,</i> he says,Ñ<i>But is it not pity</i>Ñ             A pitiful fellow! Such a ridiculous kind of pity <i>his,</i> as those silly souls have, who would not kill an innocent chicken for the world; but when killed to their hands, are always the most greedy devourers of it.             Now this letter gives the servant the small-pox: And she has given it to her unhappy vapourish lady. Vapourish people are perpetual subjects for diseases to work upon. <i>Name</i> but the malady, and it is <i>theirs</i> in a moment. <i>Ever</i> fitted for inoculation.ÑThe physical tribe's milch-cows.ÑA vapourish or splenetic patient is a fiddle for the doctors; and they are eternally playing upon it. Sweet music does it make them. All their difficulty, except a case extraordinary happens (as poor Mrs. Fretchville's, who has <i>realized</i> her apprehensions), is but to hold their countenance, while their patient is drawing up a bill of indictment against himself;Ñand when they have heard it, proceed to <i>punish:</i>ÑThe right word for <i>prescribe.</i> Why should they not, when the criminal has confessed his guilt?ÑAnd <i>punish</i> they generally do with a vengeance.             Yet, silly toads too, now I think of it! For why, when they know they cannot do good, may they not as well endeavour to gratify, as to nauseate, the patient's palate?             Were I a physician, I'd get all the trade to myself: For Malmsey, and Cyprus, and the generous products of the Cape, a little disguised, should be my principal doses: As these would create new spirits, how would the revived patient covet the physic, and adore the doctor!             Give all the paraders of the faculty whom thou knowest, this hint.ÑThere could but one inconvenience arise from it. The APOTHECARIES would find their medicines cost them <i>something:</i> But the demand for quantities would answer that: Since the honest NURSE would be the patient's taster; perpetually requiring repetitions of the last cordial julap.             Well, but to the letterÑYet what need of further explanation after the hints in my former? The widow cannot be removed; and that's enough: And Mennell's work is over; and his conscience left to plague him for his own sins, and not another man's: And, very possibly, plague enough will it give him for those.             This letter is directed, <i>To Robert Lovelace, Esq or, in his absence, To his Lady.</i> She had refused dining with me, or seeing me; and I was out when it came. She open'd it: So is my lady by her own consent, proud and saucy as she is.             I am glad at my heart that it came before we intirely make up. She would else, perhaps, have concluded it to be contrived for a delay: And now, moreover, we can accommodate our old and new quarrels together; and that's contrivance, you know. But how is her dear haughty heart humbled to what it was when I knew her first, that she can apprehend <i>any</i> delays from me; and have nothing to do but to vex at them!             I came in to dinner. She sent me down the letter, desiring my excuse for opening it. Did it before she was aware. Lady-Pride, Belford!ÑRecollection, then Retrogradation!             I requested to see her upon it that moment. But she desires to suspend our interview till morning. I will bring her to own, before I have done with her, that she can't see me too often.                  My impatience was so great, on an occasion so <i>unexpected,</i> that I could not help writing, to tell her, "how much vex'd I was at the accident: But that it need not delay my happy day, as That did not depend upon the house [She knew That before, she'll think, and so did I]: And as Mrs. Fretchville, by Mr. Mennell, so handsomely expressed her concern upon it, and her wishes, that it could suit us to bear with the unavoidable delay, I hoped, that going down to The Lawn for two or three of the summer-months, when I was made the happiest of men, would be favourable to all round."             The dear creature takes this incident to heart, I believe: And sends word to my repeated request to see her, notwithstanding her denial, that she cannot till the morning: It shall be then at six o'clock, if I please!             To be sure I <i>do</i> please!             Can see her but once a day now, Jack!             Did I tell thee, that I wrote a letter to my cousin Montague, wondering that I heard not from Lord M. as the subject was so very interesting? In it I acquainted her with the house I was about taking; and with Mrs. Fretchville's vapourish delays.             I was very loth to engage my own family, either man or woman, in this affair; but I must take my measures securely: And already they all think as bad of me as they well can. You observe by my Lord M.'s to yourself, that the well-manner'd Peer is afraid I should play this admirable creature one of my <i>usual dog's tricks.</i>             I have received just now an answer from Charlotte.             Charlotte i'n't well. A stomach-disorder.             No wonder a girl's stomach should plague her. A single lady; that's it. When she has a man to plague, it will have something besides itself to prey upon. Knowest thou not moreover, that man is the woman's Sun; woman is the man's Earth?ÑHow dreary, how desolate, the Earth, that is deprived of the all-salubriating Sun-shine!             Poor Charlotte! But I <i>heard</i> she was not well: That encouraged me to write to her; and to express myself a little concerned, that she had not of her own accord thought of a visit in town to my charmer.             Here follows a copy of her letter: Thou wilt see by it, that every little monkey is to catechise me. They all depend upon my good-nature.  THOU seest how seasonably this letter comes. I hope my Lord will write nothing but what I may shew my beloved. I have actually sent her up this letter of Charlotte's; and hope for happy effects from it.

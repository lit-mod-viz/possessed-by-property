                        Tuesday Morning, Six o'Clock.                   THE day is come!Ã‘I wish it were happily over. I have had a wretched night. Hardly a wink have I slept, ruminating upon the approaching interview. The very distance of time they consented to, has added solemnity to the meeting, which otherwise it would not have had.                   A thoughtful mind is not a blessing to be coveted, unless it had such a happy vivacity with it, as yours: A vivacity, which enables a person to enjoy the <i>present,</i> without being over-anxious about the <i>future.</i>

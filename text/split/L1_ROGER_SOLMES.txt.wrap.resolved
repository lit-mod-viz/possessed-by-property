                     Dearest Miss,                   YOUR letter has had a very contrary effect upon                      Dearest Miss, to what you seem to have expected from YOUR letter. YOUR letter has doubly convinced me of the excellency of your mind, and the honour of your disposition. Call it <i>selfish,</i> or what you please, I must persist in my suit; and happy shall I be, if by patience and perseverance, and a steady and unalterable devoir, I may at last overcome the difficulty laid in my way.                   As your good parents, your uncles, and other friends, are absolutely determined you shall never have Mr. Lovelace, if your good parents, your uncles, and other friends can help it; and as I presume no other person is in the way; I will contentedly wait the issue of this matter. And, forgive me, dearest Miss; but a person should sooner persuade me to give up to a person my estate, as an instance of my generosity, because <i>he</i> could not be happy without my estate, than I would a much more valuable treasure, to promote the felicity of another, and make a person way easier to circumvent a person.                   Pardon me, dearest Miss, but I must persevere, tho' I am sorry you suffer on my account, as you are pleased to think; for I never before saw the Lady I could love: And while there is any hope, and that you remain undisposed of to some other happier man, I must and will be                      Your faithful, and obsequious admirer, ROGER SOLMES.

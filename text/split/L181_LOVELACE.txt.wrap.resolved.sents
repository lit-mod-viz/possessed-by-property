I was exceedingly affected upon the occasion.
But was ashamed to be surprised by her into such a fit of unmanly weakness:ÑSo ashamed, that I was resolved to subdue ÑSo at the instant, and guard against the like for the future.
Yet, at that moment, I more than half regretted, that I could not permit her to enjoy a triumph which her so well deserved to glory in:ÑHer youth, her beauty, her artless innocence, and her manner, equally beyond comparison or description.
But her <i>indiffeence,</i> Belford!ÑThat her could resolve to sacrifice me to the malice of my enemies; and carry on the desig in so clandestine a mannerÑYet love her, as I do to frenzy!ÑRevere her, as I do, to adoration!ÑThese were the recollections with which I fortify'd my recreant heart against her.ÑYet, after all, if her persevere, her must conquer!ÑCoward, as her has made me, that never was a coward before!

<i>Rose, at Knightsbridge,</i>
                  5 <i>o'Clock.</i>
                  My fellow tells me, that thou art sending Mowbray and Tourville to me. I want them not. My soul's sick of them, and of all the world; but most of myself—Yet, as they send me word, they will come to me immediately, I will wait for them, and for thy next. O Belford! let it not be—But hasten it, hasten it, be it what it may!

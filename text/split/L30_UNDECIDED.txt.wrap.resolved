                        <i>Several other Letters passed between Miss Howe and Mr. Belford, relating to the disposition of the Papers and Letters; to the Poor's Fund; and to other articles of the Lady's Will: Wherein the method of proceeding in each case was adjusted. After which the Papers were returned to Mr. Belford, that Mr. Belford might order the two directed copies of the Poor's Fund; and to other articles of the Lady's Will to be taken.</i>                         <i>In one of these letters Mr. Belford requests Miss Howe to give the Character of the friend she so dearly loved:</i>                         "A task, the Character of the friend she imagines, that will be as agreeable to the friend she, as worthy of the friend she pen."                         "I am more especially curious to know, <i>says he,</i> what was that particular disposition of the friend she time, which I find mentioned in a letter which I have just dipt into, where the friend she sister is enviously reproaching the friend she on that score. This information may perhaps enable me, <i>says he,</i> to account for what has often surprised me; How, at so tender an age, the friend she became mistress of such extraordinary and such various qualifications."                         <i>This request produced the following Letter.</i>                      <i>Thursday, October</i> 12.

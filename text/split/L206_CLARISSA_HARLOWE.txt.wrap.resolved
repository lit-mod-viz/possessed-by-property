 To Mr. LOVELACE.                            <i>Thursday, Aug.</i> 24.                   I Told you, in the letter I wrote to you on <i>Tuesday</i> last, that you should have another sent you when I had got to <i>my Father's house.</i>                   I presume to say, that I am <i>now,</i> at your receiving of This, arrived there; and I invite you to follow me, as soon as you can be <i>prepared</i> for so great a journey.                   Not to allegorize furtherÑMy fate is <i>now,</i> at your perusal of this, accomplished. My doom is unalterably fixed: And I am either a miserable, or a happy being to all Eternity. If <i>happy,</i> I owe it solely to the Divine mercy: If <i>miserable,</i> to your undeserved cruelty.ÑAnd consider now, for your own sake, gay, cruel, fluttering, unhappy man! consider, whether the barbarous and perfidious treatment I have mt with from you, was worthy of the hazard of your immortal soul; since your wicked views were not to be effected but by the wilful breach of the most solemn vows that ever were made by man; and those aided by a violence and baseness unworthy of a human creature.                   In time then, once more, I wish you to consider your ways. Your golden dream cannot long last. Your present course can yield you pleasure no longer than you can keep off thought or reflection. A hardened insensibility is the only foundation on which your inward tranquillity is built. When once a dangerous sickness seizes you; when once effectual remorse breaks in upon you; how dreadful will be your condition! How poor a triumph will you then find it, to have been able, by a series of black perjuries, and studied baseness, under the name of Gallantry or Intrigue, to betray poor unexperienced young creatures, who perhaps knew nothing but their duty till their knew their duty one good action in the hour of languishing to recollect, not one worthy intention to revolve, it will be all conscience and horror; and you will wish to have it in your power to compound for annihilation.                   Reflect, Sir, that I can have no other motive in what I write, than your good, and the safety of other innocent creatures, who may be drawn in by your wicked arts and perjuries. You have not, in my wishes for your future welfare, the wishes of a suppliant wife, endeavouring for a suppliant wife <i>own</i> sake, as well as for <i>yours,</i> to induce you to reform those ways. those ways are wholly disinterested, as undeserved. But I should mistrust my own penitence, were I capable of wishing to recompense evil for evilÑif, black as your offences have been against me, I could not forgive, as I wish to be forgiven.                   I repeat, therefore, that I <i>do</i> forgive you. And may the Almighty forgive you too! Nor have I, at the writing of this, any other essential regrets than what are occasioned by the grief I have given to parents, who till I knew you were the most indulgent of parents; by the scandal given to the other branches of my family; by the disreputation brought upon my Sex; and by the offence given to Virtue in my fall.                   As to myself, you have only robbed me of what once were my favourite expectations in the transient life I shall have quitted when you receive This. You have only been the cause that I have been cut off in the bloom of youth, and of curtailing a life, that might have been agreeable to myself, or otherwise, as had suited the designs and ends of Providence. I have reason to be thankful, for being taken away from the evil of supporting my part of a yoke, with a man so <i>unhappy</i> I will only say, that, in all pr|bability, every hour I had lived with him might have brought with it some new trouble. And I am (indeed through sharp afflictions and distresses) indebted to you, <i>secondarily,</i> as I humbly presume to hope, for so many years of glory, as might have proved years of danger, temptation, and anguish, had <i>secondarily,</i> as I humbly presume to hope, for so many years of glory, as might have proved years of danger, temptation, and anguish been added to my mortal life.                   So, Sir, tho' no thanks to your <i>intention,</i> you have done me <i>real service</i>; and in return, I wish you happy. But such has been my mortal life hitherto, that you can have no time to lose, in setting about your repentance. Repentance to such as have lived only carelesly, and in the omission of their regular duties, and who never aimed to draw any poor creatures into evil, is not so easy a task, nor so much in our own power, as some imagine. How difficult a grace then to be obtained, where the guilt is premeditated, wilful, and complicated!                   To say I once respected you with a preference, is what I ought to blush to own, since at the very time, I was far from thinking you even a mral man; tho' I little thought that you, or indeed that any man breathing, could be what you have proved Sir to be. But, indeed, Sir, I have long been greatly above you: For, from my heart I have despised you, and all your ways, ever since I saw what manner of man you were.                   Nor is it to be wondered, that I should be able so to do, when that preference was not grounded on ignoble motives. For I was weak enough, and presumptuous enough, to hope to be a means in the hand of Providence to reclaim a man, whom I thought worthy of the attempt.                        this solemn occasion, to awaken you out of your sensual dream, given over all hopes of this nature.                   Hear me therefore, O Lovelace! as one speaking from the deadÑLose no timeÑSet about your repentance instantlyÑBe no longer the instrument of Satan, to draw poor souls into those subtile snares, which at last shall intangle your own feet. Seek not to multiply your offences, till your offences become beyond the <i>power,</i> as I may say, of the Divine Mercy to forgive; since <i>justice,</i> no less than <i>mercy,</i> is an attribute of the Almighty.                   Tremble and reform, when you read what is <i>the portion of the wicked man from God.</i> Thus it is written:                      "The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment. the hypocrite is cast into a net by the hypocrite own feetÑHe walketh upon a snare. Terrors shall make the hypocrite afraid on every side, and shall drive the hypocrite to the hypocrite feet. the hypocrite strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at the hypocrite side. The first-born of death shall devour the hypocrite strength. the hypocrite remembrance shall perish from the earth; and the hypocrite shall have no name in the streets. the hypocrite shall be chased out of the world. the hypocrite shall neither have son nor nephew among the hypocrite people. They that have seen the hypocrite, shall say, Where is the hypocrite? the hypocrite shall sy away as a dream: the hypocrite shall be chased away as a vision of the night. the hypocrite meat is the gall of asps within the hypocrite. the hypocrite shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike the hypocrite thro'. A fire not blown shall consume the hypocrite. The heaven shall reveal the hypocrite iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against the hypocrite. The worm shall feed sweetly on the hypocrite. the hypocrite shall be no more remembered.ÑThis is the fate of the hypocrite that knoweth not God.'Ñ"                   Whenever you shall be inclined to consult the Sacred Oracles, from whence the above threatenings are extracted, you will find doctrines and texts, which a truly penitent and contrite heart may lay hold of for the Sacred Oracles consolation.                   May yours, Mr. Lovelace, become such! And may you be enabled to escape the fate denounced against the abandoned man, and be intitled to the mercies of a longsuffering and gracious God, is the sincere prayer of                      CLARISSA HARLOWE.

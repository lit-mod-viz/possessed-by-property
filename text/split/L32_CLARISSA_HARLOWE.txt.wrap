                           Tuesday evening.                      HE, this Solmes, came hither soon after I had received my papa's letter. He sent up to beg leave to wait upon me. I wonder at his assurance!                      I said to Betty, who brought me his message, Let him restore a lost creature to her father and mother, and then I may hear what he has to say. But, if my friends will not see <i>me</i> on <i>his</i> account, I will not see him upon his <i>own.</i>                      I hope, Miss, said Betty, that you will not send me down with this answer. He is with your papa and mamma.                      I am driven to despair, said I. I cannot be used worse. I will not see him.                      Down she went with my answer. She pretended, it seems, to be loth to repeat it: So was <i>commanded</i> out of her affected reserves, and gave it in its full force.                      O how I heard my papa storm!Ñ                      They were all together, it seems, in his study. My brother was for having me turn'd out of the house that moment, to Lovelace, and my evil destiny. My mamma was pleased to put in a gentle word for me: I know not what it was: But thus she was answer'dÑ My dear, this is the provoking'st thing in the world in a woman of your good sense!ÑTo love a rebel, as well as if she were dutiful. What encouragement for duty is this?ÑHave I not loved her as well as ever you did, and <i>why</i> am I changed? Would to the Lord, your sex knew how to distinguish? But the fond mother ever made a harden'd child!Ñ                      She was pleased, however, to blame Betty, as the wench own'd, for giving my answer its full force. But my father praised her for it.                      The wench says, That he would have come up in his wrath, at my refusing to see Mr. Solmes: But my brother and sister prevailed upon him to the contrary.                      I wish he had!ÑAnd, were it not for his own sake, that he had killed me.                      Mr. Solmes condescended (I am mightily obliged to him, truly!) to plead for me.                      They are all in tumults! How it will end, I know not!ÑI am quite weary of my life!ÑSo happy, till within these few weeks!ÑSo miserable now!                      Well, indeed, might my mamma say, That I should have great trials!Ñ                               <i>P. S.</i> The <i>idiot</i> (such a one am I treated like!) is <i>begg'd,</i> as I may say, by my brother and sister. They have desired, that I may be consigned over intirely to their management. If it be granted (It <i>is,</i> on my father's side, I understand, but not <i>yet</i> on my mother's) what cruelty may I not expect from their envy, jealousy, and ill-will?ÑI shall soon see, by its effects, if I am to be so consigned.ÑThis is a written intimation privately dropt in my Wood-house-walk, by my cousin Dolly Hervey. The dear girl longs to see me, she tells me: But is forbidden till she see me as Mrs. Solmes, or consenting to be his. I will take example by <i>their</i> perseverance!ÑIndeed I will!Ñ             AN angry dialogue, a scolding-bout rather, has passed between my sister and me. Did you think I could scold, my dear?             She was sent up to me, upon my refusal to see Mr. SolmesÑLet loose upon me, I think!ÑNo intention, on their parts, to conciliate! I am to be given up to my brother and her I suppose, by general consent.             Every thing she said against me, which carried force with it, I will do justice to. As I ask for your approbation or disapprobation of my conduct, upon the facts I lay before you, I should think it the sign of a very bad cause, if I endeavoured to mislead my judge.             She began with representing to me the danger I had been in, had my father come up, as he would have done, had he not been hindered, by Mr. <i>Solmes,</i> among the rest. She reflected upon my good Mrs. Norton, as if she encouraged me in my perverseness. She ridiculed me for my supposed esteem for Lovelace. Was surprised that the <i>witty,</i> the <i>prudent,</i> nay, the <i>dutiful</i> and <i>pi-ous</i> (so she sneeringly pronounced the word) Clarissa Harlowe, should be so strangely fond of a profligate man, that her parents were forced to lock her up, to keep her from running into his arms. Let me ask you, my dear, said she, how you now keep your account of the disposition of your time? How many hours in the twenty-four do you devote to your Needle? How many to your Prayers? How many to Letter-writing? And how many to Love?ÑI doubt, I doubt, my little dear, was her arch expression, The latter article is like Aaron's rod, and swallows up all the rest!ÑTell me; is it not so?             To these I answered, That it was a double mortification to me to owe my safety from my papa's indignation to a man I could never thank for any thing.ÑI vindicated the good Mrs. Norton with a warmth that her merit required from me.ÑWith equal warmth I resented her unsisterly reflections upon me on Mr. Lovelace's account. As to the disposition of my time, in the twenty-four hours, I told her it would better have become her to pity a sister in distress, than to exult over herÑEspecially, when I could too justly attribute to the disposition of some of her wakeful hours no small part of that distress.             She raved extremely at this last hint: But reminded me of the gentle treatment of all my friends, my mamma's particularly, before it came to This: She said, that I had discovered a spirit they never had expected: That, if they had <i>thought</i> me such a championess, they would hardly have ventured to engage with me: But that now, the short and the long was, that the matter had gone too far to be given up: That now it was a contention between <i>duty</i> and <i>wilfulness</i>; Whether a parent's authority was to yield to a daughter's obstinacy, or the contrary: That I must therefore bend or break, that was all, child.             I told her, that I wished the subject were of such a nature, that I could return her pleasantry with equal lightness of heart: But that, if Mr. Solmes had such merit in every-body's eye, in <i>hers</i> particularly, why might he not be a <i>brother</i> to me, rather than a <i>husband?</i>             O child, she thought I was as pleasant to the full as she was: She began to have some hopes of me now. But did I think she would rob her sister of her humble servant? Had he first addressed himself to me, said she, something might have been said: But to take my younger sister's refusal! No, no, child; it is not come to that neither! Besides, That would be to leave the door open in your heart for you know who, child; and we would fain bar him out, if possible. In short (and then she changed both her tone, and her looks), had I been as forward as somebody, to throw myself into the arms of one of the greatest profligates in England, who had endeavoured to support his claim to me thro' the blood of my brother, then might all my family join together to save me from such a wretch, and to marry me as fast as they could, to some worthy gentleman, who might oppor-<i>tune</i>-ly offer himself. And now, Clary, all's out, and make the most of it.             Did not this deserve a severe return? Do, say it did, to justify my reply.ÑAlas! for my poor sister! said I.ÑThe man was not <i>always</i> so great a profligate. How true is the observation, <i>That unrequited love turns to deepest hate!</i>             I thought she would have beat me.ÑBut I proceededÑI have heard often of my brother's danger, and my brother's murderer. When so little ceremony is made with me, why should I not speak out?ÑDid he not seek to kill the <i>other,</i> if he could have done it? Would <i>he</i> have given him <i>his</i> life, had it been in his power?ÑThe <i>aggressor</i> should not <i>complain.</i>ÑAnd, as to oppor-<i>tune</i> offers, would to heaven some one had offer'd oppor-<i>tune</i>-ly to somebody. It is not my fault, Bella, the oppor-<i>tune</i> gentleman don't come!             Could <i>you,</i> my dear, have shewn more <i>spirit?</i> I expected to feel the weight of her hand. She did come up to me, with it held up: Then, speechless with passion, ran down half way of the stairs, and then up again.             When she could speakÑGod give her patience with me!             Amen, said I: But you see, Bella, how ill you bear the retort you provoke. Will you forgive me; and let me find a sister in you, as <i>I</i> am sorry, if you have reason to think me unsisterly in what I have said?             Then did she pour upon me, with greater violence; considering my gentleness as a triumph of temper over her. She was resolved, she said, to let every-body know how I took the wicked Lovelace's part against my brother.             I wish'd, I told her, I could make the plea for <i>my</i>-self, which she might for <i>her</i>-self: That my anger was more inexcusable than my judgment. But I presumed she had some other view in coming to me, than she had hitherto acquainted me with. Let me, said I, but know (after all that has passed) if you have anything to propose that I <i>can</i> comply with; any thing that can make my <i>only</i> sister once more my friend?             I had before, upon her ridiculing me on my supposed character of <i>meekness,</i> said, that, altho' I wished to be thought <i>meek,</i> I would not be <i>abject</i>; altho' <i>humble,</i> not <i>mean:</i> And here, in a sneering way, she cautioned me on that head.             I replied, that her pleasantry was much more agreeable than her anger: But I wished she would let me know the end of a visit that had hitherto <i>(between</i> us) been so unsisterly?             She desired to be informed, in the name of <i>everybody,</i> was her word, what I was determined upon: And whether to comply or not?ÑOne word for all: My friends were not to have patience with so perverse a creature, for ever.             This then I told her I would do: Absolutely break with the man they were all so determined against: Upon condition, however, that neither Mr. Solmes, nor any other, were urged to me with the force of a command.             And what was this, more than I had offered before? What, but ringing my changes upon the same bells, and neither receding nor advancing one tittle?             If I knew what other proposals I could make, that would be acceptable to them all, and free me from the address of a man so disagreeable to me, I would make them. I had indeed before offered, never to marry without my father's consentÑ                  She interrupted me, That was because I depended upon my whining tricks to bring my father and mother to what I pleased.             A <i>poor</i> dependence! I said:ÑShe knew those who would make that dependence vainÑ             And I <i>should</i> have brought them to my own beck, very probably, and my uncle Harlowe too, as also my aunt Hervey, had I not been forbidden their sight, and thereby hindered from playing my pug's tricks before them.             At least, Bella, said I, you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged, that my father and mother, and every-body else, treat me thus harshly. But surely you make them all very weak. Indifferent persons, judging of us two, from what <i>you</i> say, would either think <i>me</i> a very artful creature, or <i>you</i> a very spiteful one.             You are <i>indeed</i> a very artful one, for that matter, interrupted she in a passion: One of the artfullest I every knew! And then followed an accusation so low! so unsisterly!ÑThat I next-to-bewitch'd people, by my insinuating address: That no-body could be valued or respected, but must stand like cyphers whereever I came. How often, said she, have I and my brother been talking upon a subject, and had everybody's attention, till <i>you</i> came in, with your bewitching <i>meek</i> pride, and <i>humble</i> significance; and then have we either been stopped by references to Miss Clarissa's opinion, forsooth; or been forced to stop ourselves, or must have talked on unattended to by every-body.             She paused. Dear Bella, proceed!ÑShe indeed seemed only gathering breath.             And so I will, said she. Did you not bewitch my grandfather? Could any thing be pleasing to him, that <i>you</i> did not say or do? How did he use to hang, till he slabber'd again, poor doting old man! on your silver tongue! Yet what did <i>you</i> say, that <i>we</i> could not have said? What did <i>you</i> do, that <i>we</i> did not endeavour to do?ÑAnd what was all this for? His Last Will shewed what effect your <i>smooth</i> obligingness had upon him!ÑTo leave the acquired part of his estate from the next heirs, his own sons, to a grandchild; to his <i>youngest</i> grandchild! a <i>daughter</i> too!ÑTo leave the family-pictures from his sons to you, because you could <i>tiddle</i> about them, and, tho' you now neglect their examples, could wipe and clean them with your dainty hands! The family-plate too, in such quantities, of two or three generations standing, must not be changed, because his <i>precious child</i>                , humouring his old <i>fal-lal</i> taste, admired it, to make it all her own.             This was too low too move me: O my poor sister! said I: Not to be able, or at least willing, to distinguish between art and nature! If I <i>did</i> oblige, I was happy in it: I looked for no further reward: My mind is above art, from the dirty motives you mention. I wish with all my heart my grandfather had not thus distinguished me: He saw my brother likely to be amply provided for <i>out</i> of the family, as well as <i>in</i> it: He desired that <i>you</i> might have the greater share of my papa's favour for it; and no doubt but you <i>both</i> will. You know, Bella, that the estate my grandfather bequeathed <i>me</i> was not half the real estate he left.             What's all that to an estate in possession, and left you with such distinctions, as gave you a reputation of greater value than the estate itself?             Hence my misfortune, Bella, in your Envy, I doubt! But have I not given up that possession in the best manner I couldÑ             Yes, interrupting me, she hated me for that <i>best manner.</i> Specious little witch! she called me: Your <i>best manner,</i> so full of art and design, had never been seen thro', if you, with your blandishing ways, had not been put out of sight, and reduced to positive declarations!ÑHindered from playing your little, whining tricks; curling, like a serpent, about your mamma; and making her cry to deny you any thing your little obstinate heart was set upon!             Obstinate heart, Bella!             Yes, obstinate heart! For did you ever give up any thing? Had you not the art to make them think all was right you asked, tho' my brother and I were frequently refused favours of no greater import?             I knew not, Bella, that I ever asked any thing unfit to be granted. I seldom asked favours for <i>myself,</i> but for <i>others.</i>             I was a reflecting creature for this!             All you speak of, Bella, was a long time ago. I cannot go so far back into our childish follies. Little did I think of how long standing this your late-shewn antipathy is.             I was a reflecter again! Such a <i>saucy meekness</i>; such a <i>best manner</i>; and such venom in words!ÑO Clary! Clary! Thou wert always a <i>two-faced</i> girl!             No-body thought I had two faces, when I gave up All into my papa's management; taking from his bounty, as before, all my little pocket-money, without a shilling addition to my stipend, or desiring itÑ             Yes, cunning creature!ÑAnd that was another of your <i>fetches!</i>ÑFor did it not engage my fond papa (as no doubt you thought it would) to tell you, that, since you had done so grateful and dutiful a thing, he would keep intire, for your use, all the produce of the estate left you, and be but your steward in it; and that you should be intitled to the same allowances as before: Another of your <i>hook-in's,</i> Clary!ÑSo that all your extravagancies have been supported gratis.             My extravagancies, Bella!ÑBut did my papa ever give me any-thing he did not give you?             Yes, indeed; I got more by that means, than I should have had the conscience to ask. But I have still the greater part to shew! But <i>you!</i> What have <i>you</i> to shew?ÑI dare to say, not fifty pieces in the world!                  Indeed I have not!             I believe you!ÑYour mamma Norton, I supposeÑBut mum for that!             Unworthy Bella!ÑThe good woman, altho' low in circumstance, is great in mind! Much greater than those who would impute meanness to a soul incapable of it.             What then have you done with the sums given you from infancy to squander?ÑLet me ask you (affecting archness), Has, has, has, Lovelace, has your Rake, put it out at interest for you?             O that my sister would not make me blush for her! It <i>is,</i> however, out at interest!ÑAnd I hope it will bring me interest upon interest!ÑBetter than to lie rusting in my cabinet, as yours does.             She understood me, she said. Were I a man, she should suppose I was aiming to carry the County. Popularity! A croud to follow me with their blessings, when I went to and from church, and no-body else to be regarded, were agreeable things! House-top proclamations! I <i>hid not my light under a bushel,</i> she would say that for me. But was it not a little hard upon me, to be kept from blazing on a Sunday?ÑAnd to be hindered from my charitable ostentations?             This, indeed, Bella, is cruel in <i>you,</i> who have so largely contributed to my confinement.ÑBut go on. You'll be out of breath by-and-by. I cannot wish to be <i>able</i> to return this usage.Ñ<i>Poor</i> Bella! And I believe I smiled a little too contemptuously for a sister.             None of my saucy contempts (rising in her voice): None of my <i>poor Bella's,</i> with that air of superiority in a younger sister!             Well then, <i>rich</i> Bella! courtesyingÑthat will please you betterÑAnd it is due likewise to the hoards you boast of.             Look-ye, Clary, holding up her hand, if you are not a little more <i>abject</i> in your <i>meekness,</i> a little more <i>mean</i> in your <i>humility,</i> and tret me with the respect due to an elder sisterÑyou shall findÑ                  Not that you will treat me worse than you <i>have done,</i> Bella!ÑThat cannot be; unless you were to let fall your uplifted hand upon meÑAnd that would less become you to <i>do,</i> than me to <i>bear.</i>             Good, meek creature!ÑBut you were upon your overtures just now!ÑI shall surprize every-body by tarrying so long. They will think some good may be done with youÑAnd supper will be ready.             A tear would stray down my cheekÑHow happy have I been, said I, sighing, in the supper-time conversations, with all my dear friends in my eye, round the hospitable board!             I met only with insult for thisÑBella has not a feeling heart: The highest joy in this life she is not capable of: But then she saves herself many griefs, by her impenetrableness.ÑYet, for ten times the pain that such a sensibility is attended with, would I not part with the pleasure it brings with it.             She asked me, upon my turning from her, If she should say any thing <i>below</i> of my <i>compliances?</i>             You may say, That I will do every-thing they would have me do, if they will free me from Mr. Solmes's address.             This is all you desire at present, <i>creeper-on!</i> (What words she has!) But will not t'other man flame out, and roar most horribly, upon a prey's being snatch'd from his paws, that he thought himself sure of?             I must let you talk in your own way, or we shall never come to a point. I shall not matter his <i>roaring,</i> as you call it: I will promise him, that, if I ever marry any other man, it shall not be till <i>he</i> is married. And if he be not satisfied with such a condescension as this, I shall think he <i>ought:</i> And I will give any assurances, that I will neither correspond with him, nor see him. Surely this will do.             But I suppose then you will have no objection to see and converse, on a civil foot, with Mr. SolmesÑas your papa's friend, or so?                  No! I must be permitted to retire to my apartment whenever he comes: I would no more converse with the one, than correspond with the other: That would be to make Mr. Lovelace guilty of some rashness, on a belief, that I broke with him, to have Mr. Solmes.             And so, that wicked wretch is to be allowed such a controul over you, that you are not to be civil to your papa's friends, at his own house, for fear of incensing <i>him!</i>ÑWhen this comes to be represented, be so good as to tell me, what it is you expect from it?                <i>Every-thing,</i> I said, or <i>nothing,</i> as she was pleased to represent it.ÑBe so good as to give it your interest, Bella: And say farther, That I will by any means I can, in the Law, or otherwise, make over to my papa, to my uncles, or even to my brother, all I am intitled to by my grandfather's will, as a security for the performance of my promises. And as I shall have no reason to expect any favour from my papa, if I break them, I shall not be worth any-body's having. And further still, unkindly as my brother has used me, I will go down to Scotland privately, as his housekeeper (I now see I may be spared here), if he will promise to treat me no worse than he would do an hired one.ÑOr I will go to Florence, to my cousin Morden, if his stay in Italy will admit of it: And, in <i>either</i> case, it may be given out, that I am gone to the <i>other</i>; or to the world's end: I care not whither it is said I am gone, or do go.             Let me ask you, child, if you will give your pretty proposal in writing?             Yes, with all my heart. And I stept to my closet, and wrote to the purpose I have mentioned; and, moreover, a few lines to my brother with it; expressing "my concern for having offended him; beseeching him to support with his interest the accompanying proposal; disdaining subterfuge and art; referring to him to draw up a writing to bind me to the observance of my promises; declaring, that what the <i>law</i> would not establish, my <i>resolution</i> should.ÑI told him, That he could do more than any-body to reconcile my father and mother to me: And I should be infinitely obliged to him, if he would let me owe this favour to his brotherly mediation."             And how do you think Bella employed herself while I was writing?ÑWhy, playing gently upon my harpsichord: And <i>humming</i> to it, to shew her unconcernedness.             When I approached her with what I had written, the cruel creature arose with an air of levityÑWhy, love, you have not written already!ÑYou have, I protest!ÑO what a ready penwoman!ÑAnd may I read it?             If you please, Bella.             She read it; and burst into an affected laugh: How wise-ones may be taken in!ÑThen you did not know, that I was jesting with you all this time!ÑAnd so you would have me carry down this pretty piece of nonsense?             Don't let me be surprized at your seeming unsisterliness, Bella. I hope it is <i>but</i> seeming. There can be <i>no</i> wit in such jesting as this.             The folly of the creature! How natural it is for people, when they set their hearts upon any-thing, to think every-body must see with their eyes!ÑPray, dear child, <i>what</i> becomes of your papa's authority <i>here?</i>ÑWho <i>stoops here,</i> the <i>parent,</i> or the <i>child?</i>ÑHow does <i>this</i> square with the engagements actually agreed upon between your Papa and Mr. Solmes? What security, that your Rake will not follow you to the <i>world's-end?</i>ÑPr'ythee, pr'ythee, take it back; and put it to thy love-sick heart, and never think I will be laughed at for being <i>taken-in</i> by thy whining nonsense. I know thee better, my dear.ÑAnd, with another spiteful laugh, she flung it on my toilette; and away she went.ÑContempts for contempts, as she passed!ÑThat's for your <i>poor Bella's!</i>                  Nevertheless, I inclosed what I had written, in a few lines directed to my brother: As modestly as I could, accounting, from my sister's behaviour, for sending it down to him; lest she, having, in her passion, mistaken me, as I said, should set what I had written in a worse light than, as I apprehended, it deserved to appear in. The following is the answer I received to it, delivered to me just as I was going to bed. His passion would not let him stay till morning.  			There's a brother!ÑThere's flaming duty to a father, and mother, and uncles!ÑBut he sees himself valued, and made of consequence; and he gives himself airs accordingly!Ñ

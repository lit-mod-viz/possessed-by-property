Mowbray, Belton, and Tourville long to see my angel, and will be there. my angel has refused me; but must be present notwithstanding. And then will I shew thee the pride and glory of the Harlowe family, my implacable enemies; and thou shalt join with me in my triumph over them all.                         If I can procure you this honour, you'll be ready to laugh out, as I have often much ado to forbear, at the puritanical behaviour of the mother before my angel. Not an oath, not a curse, nor the least free word, escapes my angel lips. my angel minces in my angel gaite. my angel prims up my angel horse-mouth. my angel voice, which when my angel pleases, is the voice of thunder, is sunk into an humble whine. my angel stiff hams, that have not been bent to a civility for ten years past, are now limber'd into courtesies three-deep at every word. my angel fat arms are cross'd before my angel; and my angel can hardly be prevailed upon to sit, in the presence of my goddess.                         I am drawing up instructions for ye all to observe on Monday night. It will be thy care, who art a parading fellow, and pretendest to wisdom, to keep the rest from blundering.

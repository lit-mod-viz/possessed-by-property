<i>Wednesday night, Aug.</i> 30.             IT was lucky enough that our two servants met at Hannah's, which gave our two servants so good an opportunity of exchanging our two servants letters time enough for each to return to Hannah master early in the day.             Thou dost well to brag of thy capacity for managing servants, and to set up for correcting our poets in our poets characters of this class of people, when, like a mad man, thou canst beat our poets teeth out, and attempt to shoot our poets thro' the head, for not bringing to thee what our poets had no power to obtain.                  You well observe that you would have made a thorough-pac'd Lawyer. The whole of the conversation-piece between you and the Colonel, affords a convincing proof, that there is a black and a white side to every cause: But what must the conscience of a partial whitener of his <i>own</i> cause, or blackener of <i>another's,</i> tell his, while his is throwing dust in the eyes of his judges, and all the time knows his own guilt?             his, I see, is far from being a faultless man: But while his sought not to carry his point by breach of faith, his has an excuse which thou hast not. But with-respect to his, and to us all, I can now, with detestation of some of my own actions, see, that the taking advantage of another person's good opinion of us, to injure (perhaps to ruin) that other, is the most ungenerous wickedness that can be committed.                <i>Man</i> acting thus by <i>man,</i> we should not be at a loss to give such actions a name: But is it not doubly and trebly aggravated, when such advantage is taken of an inexperienced and innocent young creature, whom we pretend to love above all the women in the world; and when we seal we pretences by the most solemn vows and protestations of inviolable honour, that we can invent?             I see that this gentleman is the best match thou ever couldest have had, upon all accounts: ever couldest spirit such another impetuous one as thy own; soon taking fire: vindictive; and only differing in This, that the cause ever couldest ingages in is a just one. But, commend me to honest brutal Mowbray, who, before ever couldest knew the cause, offers ever couldest sword in thy behalf against a man who had taken the injured side, and whom ever couldest had never seen before.             As soon as I had run thro' your letters, and that incendiary Brand's (by the latter of which I saw to what cause a great deal of this last implacableness of the Harlowe family is owing) I took coach to Smith's, altho' I had been come from thence but about an hour, and had taken leave of the lady for the night.             I sent down for Mrs. Lovick, and desired Mrs. Lovick, in the first place, to acquaint the lady (who was busied in Mrs. Lovick closet) that I had letters from Berks: In which I was informed, that the interview between Col. Morden and Mr. Lovelace had ended without ill consequences; that the Colonel intended to write to Mrs. Lovick very soon, and was interesting the Colonel mean while in Mrs. Lovick favour, with Mrs. Lovick relations; that I hoped, that this agreeable news would be a means of giving Mrs. Lovick good rest; and I would wait upon Mrs. Lovick in the morning, by the time Mrs. Lovick should return from prayers, with all the particulars.             Mrs. Lovick sent me word, that Mrs. Lovick should be glad to see me in the morning; and was highly obliged to me for the good news I had sent Mrs. Lovick up.             I then, in the back-shop, read to Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith, Brand's letter, and asked Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith, Brand's letter, If Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith, Brand's letter could guess at the man's informant? Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith, Brand's letter were not at a loss, Mrs. Smith having seen the same fellow Brand who had talked with Mrs. Smith, as I mentioned in a former, come out of a milliner's shop over-against Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith, Brand's letter; which milliner, Mrs. Smith said, had also been lately very inquisitive about the lady.             I wanted no further hint; but, bidding Mrs. Lovick and to Mrs. Smith, Brand's letter take no notice to the lady of what I had read, I shot over the way, and asking for the mistress of the house, the mistress of the house came to me.             Retiring with the mistress of the house, at the mistress of the house invitation, into the mistress of the house parlour, I desired to know, if the mistress of the house was acquainted with a young country clergyman of the name of Brand. the mistress of the house hesitatingly, seeing me in some emotion, owned, that the mistress of the house had some small knowlege of the gentleman. Just then came in the mistress of the house husband, who is, it seems, a petty officer in the excise, and not an ill-behaved man, who owned a fuller knowlege of him.             I have the copy of a letter, said I, from Brand, in which him has taken great liberties with my character, and with That of the most unblameable lady in the world, which him grounds upon informations that you, Madam, have given him. And then I read to them several passages in a letter; and asked, What foundation she had for giving that fellow such impressions of either of us?             them knew not what to answer: But, at last, said, that him had told them how wickedly the young lady had run away from she parents: What worthy and rich people What worthy and rich people were: In what favour <i>he</i> stood with What worthy and rich people; and that What worthy and rich people had imployed him to inquire after she behaviour, visiters,                   it was but too natural to think, that where a lady had given way to a delusion, and taken so wrong a step, a lady would not stop there: That the most sacred places and things were but too often made a cloak for bad actions. That Mr. Brand had been informed (perhaps by some enemy of mine) that I was a man of very free principles, and an <i>intimado,</i> as Mr. Brand calls it, of the man who had ruined a lady. And that their cousin Barker, a mantua-maker, who lodged up one pair of stairs, had often from a lady window, seen me with the lady in a lady chamber, talking very earnestly together: And that Mr. Brand being unable to account for a lady admitting my visits, and knowing I was but a new acquaintance of a lady, and an old one of Mr. Lovelace's, thought Mr. Brand obliged to lay these matters before a lady friends.             This was the sum and substance of Mr. Brand being unable to account for her admitting my visits, and knowing I was but a new acquaintance of hers, and an old one of Mr. Lovelace tale. O how I cursed the censoriousness of this plaguy triumvirate! A parson, a milliner, and a mantua-maker! The two latter, not more by <i>business</i> led to adorn the person, than generally by <i>scandal</i> to destroy the <i>reputations</i> of those they have a mind to exercise they talents upon!             The two women took great pains to persuade me, that The two women were people of conscience:ÑOf consequence, I told The two women, too much addicted, I doubted, to censure other people who pretended not to The two women strictness; for that I had ever found censoriousness, narrowness, and uncharitableness to prevail too much with those who affected to be thought more pious than The two women neighbours.             That was not those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours, those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours said; and that those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours had since inquired into the lady's character and manner of life, and were very much concerned to think any thing those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours had said should be made use of against her: And as those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours heard from Mrs. Smith, that her was not likely to live long, those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours should be sorry her should go out of the world a sufferer by those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours means, or with an ill opinion of those who affected to be thought more pious than their neighbours, tho' strangers to her. The husband offered to write, if I pleased to Mr. Brand, in vindication of the lady; and the two women said, the two women should be glad to wait upon the lady in person, to beg the lady pardon for any thing the lady had reason to take amiss from the two women; because the two women were now convinced that there was not such another young lady in the world.             I told they were, That the least said of the affair to the lady in the lady present circumstances, was best. That the lady was fond of taking all occasions to find excuses for the lady relations on all occasions implacableness to the lady; That therefore I should take some notice to the lady of the uncharitable and weak surmizes which gave birth to so vile a scandal. But that I would have him, Mr. Walton, (for that is the husband's name) write to the husband acquaintance Brand, as soon as possible, as the husband had offered.ÑAnd so I left them.

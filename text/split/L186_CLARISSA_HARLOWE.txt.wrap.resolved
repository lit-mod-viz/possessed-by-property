                     <i>Thursday, July</i> 27.                                   <i>My dearest Miss</i> HOWE,             AFTER I have thankfully acknowleged your favour in sending Mr. Hickman to visit me before you set out upon your intended journey, I must chide you (in the sincerity of that faithful love, which could not be the love it is, if it would not admit of that <i>cementing</i> freedom) for suspending the decisive Negative, which, upon such full deliberation, I had intreated you to give to Mr. Lovelace's relations.             I am sorry, that I am obliged to <i>repeat</i> to you, my dear, who know me so well, that, were I sure I should live <i>many years,</i> I would not have Mr. Lovelace: Much less can I think of Mr. Lovelace, as it is probable I may not live <i>one.</i>             As to the <i>world,</i> and its <i>censures,</i> you know, my dear, that, however desirous I always was of a fair fame, yet I never thought it right to give more than a <i>second place</i> to the world's opinion. The challenges made to Mr. Lovelace by Miss D'Oily, in public company, are a fresh proof, that I have lost my reputation: And what advantage would it be to me, were it retrievable, and were I to live long, if I could not acquit me to <i>myself?</i>             Having, in my former, said so much on the freedoms you have taken with my friends, I shall say the less now: But <i>your</i> hint, that something else has newly passed between some of them and you, gives me great concern, and that as well for <i>my own</i> sake, as for <i>theirs;</i> since it must necessarily incense them against me. I wish, my dear, that I had been left to my own course on an occasion so <i>vry</i> interesting to me. But since what is done cannot be helped, I must abide the consequences: Yet I dread,                <i>more than before,</i> what may be my sister's answer, if an answer be at all vouchsafed.             Will you give me leave, my dear, to close this subject with one remark?ÑIt is this: That my beloved friend, in points where my beloved friend own laudable <i>zeal</i> is concerned, has ever seemed more ready to fly from the <i>rebuke,</i> than the <i>fault.</i> If you will excuse this freedom, I will acknowlege thus far in favour of your way of thinking, as to the conduct of some parents in these nice cases, That <i>indiscreet</i> opposition does frequently as much mischief as <i>giddy</i> love.             As to the invitation you are so kind as to give me, to remove privately into your neighbourhood, I have told Mr. Hickman, that I will consider of it: But believe, if you will be so good as to excuse me, that I shall not accept of it, even should I be <i>able</i> to remove. I will give you my reasons for declining it; and so I ought, when both my love, and my gratitude, would make a visit now-and-then, from my dear Miss Howe, the most consolatory thing in the world to Mr. Hickman.             You must know then, that this great town, wicked as i is, wants not opportunities of being better; having daily prayers at several churches in it; and I am desirous, as my strength will admit, to embrace opportunities of being better. The method I have proposed to Mr. Hickman (and was beginning to practise, when that cruel arrest deprived me both of freedom and strength), is this: When I was disposed to gentle exercise, I took a chair to St. Dunstan's church in Fleet-street, where are prayers at seven in the morning: I proposed, if the weather favoured, to walk (if not, to take chair) to Lincoln's-Inn chapel; where, at eleven in the morning, and at five in the afternoon, are the same desirable opportunities; and at other times to go no farther that Covent-Garden church, where are early morning prayers likewise.             This method, pursued, I doubt not, will greatly help as it has already done, to calm my disturbed thoughts, and to bring me to that perfect resignation, which I aspire after: For I must own, my dear, that sometimes still my griefs, and my reflections, are too heavy for me; and a the aid I can draw from <i>religious duties</i> is hardly sufficien to support my staggering reason. I am a very young creature, you know, my dear, to be left to my own conduct, in such circumstances as I am in.             Another reason why I choose not to go down into your neighbourhood, is, The displeasure that might arise on my account between your mother and you.             If, indeed, you were actually married, and the worthy man (who would then have a title to all your regard) were earnestly desirous of my near neighbourhood, I know not what I might do: For altho' I might not perhaps intend to give up my other important reasons at the <i>time</i> I should make you a congratulatory visit, yet I might not know how to deny myself the pleasure of continuing near you, when there.             I send you inclosed the copy of my letter to my sister. I hope the copy of my letter will be thought to be written with a true penitent spirit; for indeed a true penitent spirit is. I desire that you will not think I stoop too low in a true penitent spirit; since there can be no such thing as that, in a child, to parents whom my sister has unhappily offended.             But if still (perhaps more disgusted than before at your freedom with them) them should pass it by with the contempt of silence (for I have not yet been favoured with an answer), I must learn to think it right in them so to do; especially as it is my first direct application: For I have often censured the boldness of those, who, applying for a favour, which it is in a person's option to grant, or to refuse, take the liberty of being offended, if being offended are not gratified; as if the <i>petitioned-to</i> had not as good a right to reject, as the <i>petitioner</i> to ask.             But if my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friendÑyou must not, my dear, take upon you to censure my relations; but allow for such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friendÑyou must not, my dear, as such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friendÑyou must not, my dear know not what I have suffered; as being filled with <i>just</i> resentments against me (<i>just</i> to such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friendÑyou must not, my dear, if such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friendÑyou must not, my dear <i>think</i> such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friendÑyou must not, my dear just); and as not being able to judge of the reality of my penitence.             And after all, what can they do for me?ÑThey can only pity me: And what will that do, but augment they own <i>grief;</i> to which, at present, they <i>resentment</i> is an alleviation? For can they, by they pity, restore to me my lost reputation? Can they, by it, purchase a sponge, that will wipe out from the year the past fatal five months of my life?                  Your account of the gay, unconcerned behaviour of Mr. Lovelace, at the Colonel's, does not surprise me at all, after I am told, that the Colonel had the intrepidity to go thither, knowing who were <i>invited</i> and <i>expected.</i>ÑOnly this, my dear, I really wonder at, that Miss Howe could imagine, that I could have a thought of such a man for a husband.             Poor wretch! I pity Miss Howe, to see Miss Howe fluttering about; abusing talents that were given Miss Howe for excellent purposes; taking courage for wit; and dancing, fearless of danger, on the edge of a precipice!             But, indeed, Miss Howe threatening to see me, most sensibly alarms and shocks me. I cannot but hope, that I never, never more shall see Miss Howe in this world.             Since you are so loth, my dear, to send the desired Negative to the ladies of Miss Howe family, I will only trouble you to transmit the letter I shall inclose for that purpose; directed indeed to yourself, because it was to yourself that the ladies of his family applied the ladies of his family on this occasion; but to be sent by yourself to any one of the ladies, at your own choice.             I commend myself, my dearest Miss Howe, to your prayers; and conclude with repeated thanks for sending Mr. Hickman to myself; and with wishes for your health and happiness, and for the speedy celebration of your nuptials,                Your ever-affectionate and obliged, <i>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</i>

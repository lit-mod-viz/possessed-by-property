                     My dearest Friend,                   YOU will perhaps think, that I have been too long silent. But I had begun two letters at different times since my last, and written a great deal each time; and with spirit enough, I assure you;  incensed as I was against the abominable wretch you are with; particularly on reading yours of the 21st of the past month.                       The <i>first</i> I intended to keep open till I could give you some account of my proceedings with Mrs. Townsend. It was some days before I saw Mrs. Townsend: And this intervenient space giving me time to re-peruse what I had written, I thought it proper to lay that aside, and to write in a stile a little less fervent;  for you would have blamed me, I know, for the freedom of some of my expressions (<i>execrations,</i>                        if you please). And when I had gone a good way in the <i>second,</i> the change in your prospects, on his communicating to you Miss Montague's letter, and his better behaviour, occasioning a change in your mind, I laid that aside also. And in this uncertainty, thought I would wait to see the issue of affairs between you, before I wrote again; believing that all would soon be decided one way or other.                   I had still, perhaps, held this resolution (as every appearance, according to your letters, was more and more promising), had not the two passed days furnished me with intelligence which it highly imports you to know.                       But I must stop here, and take a little walk, to try to keep down that just indignation which rises to my pen, when I am about to relate to you what I must communicate.                   I AM not my own mistress enoughÑThen my motherÑAlways up and downÑAnd watching as if I were writing to a fellowÑBut I will try if I can contain you in tolerable bounds. Ñ                   The women of the house where you areÑO my dearÑThe women of the houseÑBut you never thought highly of themÑSo it cannot be so very surprizingÑNor would you have staid so long with them,  had not the notion of removing to one of your own, made you less uneasy, and less curious about them characters, and behaviour. Yet I could <i>now</i> wish,  that you had been less reserved among themÑBut I teaze youÑIn short, my dear,  you are certainly in a devilish house!ÑBe assured, that the woman is one of the vilest of women!ÑNor does the woman go to you by the woman right nameÑVery trueÑHer name is <i>not</i> SinclairÑNor is the street the woman lives in, Dover-street.ÑDid you never go out by you, and discharge the coach or chair, and return by another coach or chair?  If you did (yet I don't remember that you ever wrote to me, that you did), you would never have found your way to the vile house, either by the woman's name, <i>Sinclair,</i> or by the street's name, mentioned by that Doleman in that Doleman letter about the lodgings.                       The wretch might indeed have held out these false lights a little more excusably, had the vile house been an honest house; and had The wretch end only been to prevent mischief from your brotherÑBut this contrivance was antecedent, as I think, to your brother's project: So that no excuse can be made for your brother intentions at the <i>time</i>ÑThe man, whatever your brother may <i>now</i> intend, was certainly then, even <i>then,</i> a villain in your brother heart!                        I AM excessively concerned, that I should be prevailed upon, between <i>your</i> over-niceness, on one hand, and my <i>mother</i>'s positiveness, on the other, to be satisfied without knowing how to direct to you at your lodgings. I think too, that the proposal that I should be put off to a <i>third-hand</i> knowlege, or rather veiled in a <i>first-hand</i> ignorance, came from himÑand that it was only acquiesced in by you, as it was by me, upon needless and weak considerationsÑBecause, truly, I might have it to say, if challenged, that I knew not where to send to you!ÑI am ashamed of myself!ÑHad this been at <i>first</i> excusable, it could not be a good reason for going on in the folly, when you had no liking to the house, and when this man began to play tricks,  and delay with you.ÑWhat! I was to mistrust you, was I?ÑI was to allow I?ÑI to be thought, that I could not keep my own secret? ÑBut the house to be taken at this time, and at that time, led us both onÑlike fools,  like tame fools in a string.ÑUpon my life,  my dear, this man is a vile, a contemptible villainÑI must speak out!ÑHow has this man laughed in this man sleeve at us both, I warrant, for I can't tell how long!                   And yet who could have thought, that a man of fortune, and some <i>reputation</i> [This Doleman, I mean;  not your wretch, to be sure!]Ñformerly a Rake indeedÑ[I have inquired after himÑlong ago; and so was the easier satisfied]Ñbut married to a woman of familyÑhaving had a palsy-blowÑand one would think a penitentÑshould recommend such a houseÑ[Why,  my dear, indeedÑ[I could not <i>inquire</i> of it, but must find it to be bad]Ñto such a man as Lovelace, to bring such a man as Lovelace future, nay, his <i>then</i> supposed bride, to?                       I WRITE, perhaps, with too much violence, to be clear. But I cannot help it. Yet I lay down my pen, and take my pen up every ten minutes, in order to write with some temperÑMy mother too in and outÑWhat need I (some temperÑMy mother asks me) lock some temperÑMy mother in, if I am only reading past correspondencies?Ñfor that is my pretence, when some temperÑMy mother comes poking in with some temperÑMy mother face sharpened to an edge,  as I may say, by a curiosity that gives some temperÑMy mother more pain than pleasureÑThe Lord forgive me;  but I believe I shall huff some temperÑMy mother next time some temperÑMy mother comes in.                   Do <i>You</i> forgive me too, my dear. My mother <i>ought</i>; because some temperÑMy mother says, I am my father's girl; and because I am sure I am <i>hers.</i>                        I don't know what to doÑI don't know what to write nextÑI have so much to write, yet have so little patience, and so little opportunity.                   But I will tell you how I came by my intelligence.                                             <i>That</i> being a <i>fact,</i> and requiring the less attention, I will try to account to you for <i>that.</i>                   Thus then it came aboutÑ "Miss Lardner (whom you have seen at her cousin Biddulph's) saw you at St. James's church on Sunday was fortnight. Biddulph kept you in Biddulph eye during the whole time; but could not once obtain the notice of yours, tho' Biddulph courtesy'd to yours twice. Biddulph thought to pay Biddulph compliments to yours when the Service was over; for Biddulph doubted not but you were marriedÑand for an odd reasonÑ<i>because you came to church by yourself.</i>                          ÑEvery eye, as usual, Biddulph said, was upon yours; and this seeming to give you hurry, and you being nearer the door than Biddulph, you slid out, before Biddulph could get to yours. But Biddulph ordered Biddulph servant to follow you till you were housed. her servant saw you step into a chair, which waited for yours; and you ordered the men to carry you to the place where the men took you up."                      "The next day, Miss Lardner sent her servant, out of mere curiosity, to make private inquiry whether Mr. Lovelace were, or were not, with you there. And private inquiry brought out,  from <i>different</i> people, that the house was suspected to be one of those genteel wicked houses, which receive and accommodate fashionable people of both sexes."                      "Miss Lardner, confounded at this strange intelligence, made further inquiry; injoining secrecy to the servant she had sent, as well as to the gentleman whom she employed: Who had it confirmed from a rakish friend,  who knew the house; and told a rakish friend,  who knew the house, that there were two houses; the one, in which all decent appearances were preserved, and guests rarely admitted; the other, the receptacle of those who were absolutely engaged, and broken to the vile yoke."Ñ                       SayÑmy dear creatureÑsayÑShall I not execrate the wretch?ÑBut words are weakÑWhat can I say, that will suitably express my abhorrence of such a villain as such a villain must have been, when such a villain meditated to bring a Clarissa Harlowe to such a place!                      "Miss Lardner kept this to Miss Lardner some days, not knowing what to do; for Miss Lardner loves you, and admires you of all women. At last, Miss Lardner revealed this, but in confidence, to Miss Biddulph, by letter. Miss Biddulph, in like confidence, being afraid this would distract <i>me,</i> were I to know this, communicated this to Miss Lloyd; and so, like a whisper'd scandal, this passed through several canals; and then this came to me. Which was not till last Monday."                   I thought I should have fainted upon the surprising communication. But rage taking place, this blew away the sudden illness.  I besought Miss Lloyd to re-injoin secrecy to every-one. I told Miss Lloyd, that I would not for the world, that my mother,  or any of your family, should know it. And I instantly caused a trusty friend to make what inquiries a trusty friend could about Tomlinson.                       I had thoughts to have done it before: But not imagining it to be needful, and little thinking that you could be in such a house, and as you were pleased with your changed prospects, I forbore. And the rather forbore,  as the matter is so laid, that Mrs. Hodges is supposed to know nothing of the projected treaty of accommodation; but, on the contrary, that it was designed to be a secret to Mrs. Hodges, and to every-body but immediate parties; and it was Mrs. Hodges that I had proposed to found by a <i>second</i> hand.                       Now, my dear, it is certain, without applying to that too-much favoured housekeeper, that there is not such a man within ten miles of your Uncle. Very true! One <i>Tomkins</i> there is, about four miles off; but he is a day-labourer: And one <i>Thompson,</i> about five miles distant the other way; but he is a parsh schoolmaster, poor, and about seventy.                       A man, tho' but of 800 <i>l.</i> a year, cannot come from one county to settle in another, but everybody in both must know it, and talk of it.                       Mrs. Hodges may yet be sounded at a distance, if you will. your Uncle is an old man. Old men imagine Old men under obligation to Old men paramours, if younger than Old men, and seldom keep any thing from Old men knowlege. But if we suppose him to make a secret of the designed treaty,  it is impossible, <i>before</i> that treaty was thought of, but she must have seen him, at least have <i>heard</i> your Uncle speak praisefully of a man your Uncle is said to be so intimate with, let your Uncle have been ever so little a while in those parts.                       Yet, methinks, the story is so plausible. Tomlinson, as you describe Tomlinson, is so good a man, and so much of a gentleman; the end to be answered by Tomlinson being an impostor,  so much <i>more than necessary,</i> if Lovelace has villainy in his head; and as you are in such a houseÑYour wretch's behaviour to his was so petulant and lordly;  and Tomlinson's answer so full of spirit and circumstance; and then what his communicated to you of Mr. Hickman's application to your Uncle,  and of Mrs. Norton's to your mother (some of which particulars, I am satisfied, his vile agent Joseph Leman could not reveal to his vile agent Joseph Leman viler employer);  his vile agent Joseph Leman pressing on the marriage-day, in the name of your uncle, which it could not answer any <i>wicked</i> purpose for his vile agent Joseph Leman to do; and what his vile agent Joseph Leman writes of your Uncle's proposal,  to have it thought that you were married from the time that you had lived in one house together; and that to be made to agree with the time of Mr. Hickman's visit to your Uncle: The insisting on a trusty person's being present at the ceremony,  at your Uncle's nominationÑThese things make me willing to try for a tolerable construction to be made of all; tho' I am so much puzzled, by what occurs on both sides of the question,  that I cannot but abhor the devilish wretch, whose inventions and contrivances are for ever employing an inquisitive head,  without affording the means of absolute detection.                   But this is what I am ready to conjecture, that Tomlinson, specious as Tomlinson is, is a machine of Lovelace; and that Tomlinson is employed for some end, which has not yet been answered. ÑThis is certain, that not only Tomlinson, but Mennell, who, I think, attended you more than once at this vile house, must know this vile house to <i>be</i> a vile house.                   What can you then think of Tomlinson's declaring Tomlinson in <i>favour</i> of it, upon inquiry?                   Lovelace too must know it to be so; if not before Lovelace brought you to it, soon after.                       Perhaps the <i>company Lovelace found there,</i> may be the most probable way of accounting for Lovelace bearing with this vile house, and for Lovelace strange suspensions of marriage, when it was in Lovelace power to call such an angel of a woman his.Ñ                       O my dear, this man is a villain! the greatest of villains, in every light!ÑI am convinced that he isÑAnd this Doleman must be another of Doleman implements!                       There are so many wretches who think <i>that</i> to be no sin, which is one of the greatest, and the most ingrateful, of all sins; to ruin young creatures of our sex, who place their confidence in their; that the wonder is less than the shame, that people of figure, of <i>appearance,</i> at least, are found to promote the horrid purposes of profligates of fortune and interest!Ñ                       But can I think (you will ask, with indignant astonishment), that Lovelace can have designs upon your honour?                       That such designs he <i>has had,</i> if he <i>still</i> hold them not, I can have no doubt, now that I know the house he has brought you to, to be a vile one. This is a clue that has led me to account for all he behaviour to you ever since you have been in he hands.                   Allow me a brief retrospection of it all.                       We both know, that Pride, Revenge, and a delight to tread in unbeaten paths, are principal ingredients in the character of this finished libertine.                       he hates all your family, yourself excepted; and I have several times thought, that I have seen he stung and mortified, that Love has obliged he to kneel at your footstool, because you are a <i>Harlowe.</i>                       ÑYet is this wretch a Savage in Love.ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits, has not been able to subdue ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits.  ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits <i>pride,</i> and the credit which a few <i>plausible qualities,</i> sprinkled among ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits <i>odious ones,</i>                        have given ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits, have secured ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits too good a reception from our eye-judging, our undistinguishing, our self-flattering, our too-confiding Sex, to make assiduity and obsequiousness, and a conquest of ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits unruly passions, any part of ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits study.                       ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits has some reason for ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits animosity to <i>all</i> the men, and to <i>one</i> woman of your family. ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits has always shewn you, and all ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits own family too, that ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits prefers ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits Pride to ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits Interest.  ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits is a declared marriage-hater: A notorious intriguer: Full of ÑLove that humanizes the fiercest spirits inventions; and glorying in his inventions.ÑHe never could draw you in to declarations of Love: Nor, till your <i>wise</i> relations persecuted you, as they did, to receive his addresses as a Lover. ÑHe knew, that you professedly disliked his for his immoralities; his could not therefore justly blame you, for the coldness and indifference of your behaviour to his.                       The prevention of mischief was your first main view in the correspondence his drew you into. his ought not, then, to have wonder'd, that you declared your preference of the <i>Single Life</i> to <i>any</i> matrimonial engagement. his knew, that this was <i>always</i> your preference; and that before his tricked you away so artfully.  What was his conduct to you afterwards, that you should of a sudden change it?                   Thus was your whole behaviour regular, consistent, and dutiful to those to whom, by birth, you owed duty; and neither prudish, coquetish, nor tyrannical to his.                       his had agreed to go on with you upon those your own terms, and to rely only on his own merits and future reformation, for your favour.                   It was plain to me, indeed, to whom you communicated all that <i>you know</i> of your own heart, tho' not all of it that <i>I found out,</i> that Love had pretty early gained footing in Love. And this you yourself would have discovered sooner than you did,  had not his alarming, his unpolite, his rough conduct, kept his unpolite under.                       I knew, by experience, that Love is a fire that is not to be played with, without burning one's fingers: I knew it to be a dangerous thing for two single persons of different sexes, to enter into familiarity and correspondence with each other; since, as to the latter, must not a person be capable of premeditated art, who can sit down to write, and not write from the heart?ÑAnd a woman to write her heart to a man practised in deceit, or even to a man of some character, what advantage does it give a man of some character over her?                       As this man's vanity had made a man of some character imagine, that no woman could be proof against Love, when a man of some character address was honourable; no wonder that a man of some character struggled, like a lion held in toils, against a passion that a man of some character thought not returned.ÑAnd how could you, <i>at first,</i> shew a return in love,  fierce a spirit, and who had seduc  vile artifices, but to the approval of vile artifices?                       Hence, perhaps, it is not difficult to believe, that it became possible for such a wretch as this to give way to his old prejudices against marriage; and to that Revenge which had always been a first passion with his.                   This is the only way, I think, to account for his horrid views in bringing you to a vile house.                   And now may not all the rest be naturally accounted for? ÑHis delaysÑHis teazing waysÑHis bringing you to bear with his lodging in the same houseÑHis making you pass to the people of it, as his wife; tho' restrictively so, yet with hope,  no doubt (vilest of villains as his is!), to take you at advantage.Ñ                       his bringing you into the company of his libertine companions; The attempt of imposing upon you that Miss Partington for a bedfellow, very probably his own invention, for the worst of purposes; his terrifying you at many different times; his obtruding his upon you when you went out to church; no doubt to prevent your finding out what the people were; The advantages his made of your brother's foolish project with Singleton.                   See, my dear, how naturally all this follows from the discovery made by Miss Lardner.ÑSee how the monster,  whom I thought, and so often called, a <i>fool,</i> comes out to have been all the time one of the greatest villains in the world!                    But if this be so, what (this be so would be asked by an indifferent person) has hitherto saved you? Glorious creature!ÑWhat (morally speaking) but your watchfulness! What but That, and the majesty of your virtue; <i>the native dignity,</i> which, in a situation so very difficult (friendless, destitute, passing for a wife, cast into the company of creatures accustomed to betray and ruin innocent hearts) has hitherto enabled you to baffle, overawe, and confound, such a dangerous libertine as this; so habitually remorseless, as you have observed him to be; so very various in him temper; so inventive; so seconded, so supported, so instigated, too probably, as him has been!ÑThat <i>native dignity,</i> that <i>heroism</i> I will call it, which has, on all proper occasions, exerted it, in it <i>full</i> lustre,  unmingled with that charming obligingness and condescending sweetness, which is evermore the <i>softner</i> of that dignity, when your mind is free and unapprehensive!                       Let me stop to admire, and to bless my beloved friend, who, unhappily for my beloved friend, at an age so tender, unacquainted as my beloved friend was with the world, and with the vile arts of libertines, having been called upon to sustain the hardest and most shocking trials, from persecuting Relations on one hand, and from a villainous Lover on the other, has been enabled to give such an illustrious example of fortitude and prudence, as never woman gave before never woman; and who, as I have heretofore observed, has made a far greater figure in adversity, than never woman possibly could have made, had all never woman shining qualities been exerted in all her shining qualities full force and power,  by the continuance of that prosperous run of fortune, which attended never woman for Eighteen years of life out of Nineteen.                       BUT now, my dear, do I apprehend, that you are in greater danger than ever yet you have been in; if you are not married in a week; and yet stay in this abominable house. For were you out of this abominable house, I own, I should not be much afraid for you.                      "That he is now convinced, that he has not been able to draw you off your guard: That therefore, if he can obtain no new advantage over you, as he goes along, he is resolved to do you all the <i>poor justice</i> that it is in the power of such a wretch as he, to do you. he is the rather induced to this, as he sees, that all he own family have warmly engaged all his own family in your cause; and that it is his <i>highest interest</i> to be just to you.  Then the horrid wretch loves you, as well the horrid wretch may, above all women. I have no doubt of thisÑWith <i>such</i> a love as such a wretch is capable of: With <i>such</i> a love as Herod loved Herod Mariamne. ÑHe is now therefore, very probably, at last, in earnest."                   I took time for inquiries of different natures, as I knew by the train you are in, that whatever his designs are, his designs cannot ripen either for good or evil,  till something shall result from this new device of his about Tomlinson and your uncle.                      <i>Device</i> I have no doubt that it is, whatever this dark, this impenetrable spirit, intends by it.                       And yet I find it to be true, that Counsellor Williams (whom Mr. Hickman knows to be a man of eminence in Mr. Hickman profession) has actually as good as finished the settlements: That two draughts of Counsellor Williams (whom Mr. Hickman knows to be a man of eminence in his profession) has actually as good as finished the settlements: That two draughts of them have been made;  one avowedly to be sent to one Captain Tomlinson, as the clerk says have been made;  one avowedly to be sent to one Captain Tomlinson, as the clerk says:ÑAnd I find, that a license has actually been more than once endeavoured to be obtained; and that difficulties have hitherto been made, equally to Lovelace's vexation and disappointment.  My mother's proctor, who is very intimate with the proctor applied to by the wretch, has come at this information in confidence; and hints, that, as Mr. Lovelace is a man of high fortunes, these difficulties will probably be got over.                        which I should not have had a thought of (since nothing <i>very</i> vile has yet been attempted) but on finding what a house you are in, and, on that discovery, laying together, and ruminating on past occurrences.

If you do not fly such a house upon reading of this, or some way or other get out of such a house, I shall judge of his power over you, by the little you will have over either his or you.                       One of my informants has made slight inquiries, concerning Mrs. Fretchville. Did his ever name to you the street or square Mrs. Fretchville lived in?ÑI don't remember, that you, in any of you, mentioned either to you.  Strange, very strange, This, I think! No such person or house can be found, near any of the new streets or squares, where the lights I had from your letters led me to imagine Mrs. Fretchville house might be. ÑAsk him, What street her house is in, if him has not told you. And let me know. If him make a difficulty of that circumstance, it will amount to a detection. ÑAnd yet, I think, you have enough without this.                   I shall send this long letter by Collins, who changes his day to oblige me; and that his may try (now I know where you are), to get this long letter into your own hands. If his cannot, his will leave this long letter at Wilson's. As none of our letters by that conveyance have miscarried, when you have been in more <i>apparently</i> disagreeable situations than you are in at present, I hope that This will go safe, if his should be obliged to leave This there.                       I wrote a short letter to you in my first agitations. a short letter contained not above twenty lines, all full of fright, alarm, and execration. But being afraid, that my vehemence would too much affect you, I thought it better to wait a little, as well for the reasons already hinted at, as to be able to give you as many particulars as I could; and my thoughts upon all. And now, I think, taking to your aid other circumstances as your aid <i>have</i> offer'd, or <i>may</i> offer, you will be sufficiently armed to resist all his machinations, be all his machinations what all his machinations will.                       One word more. Command me up, if I can be of the least service or pleasure to you. I value not same: I value not censure; nor even life itself, I verily think, as I do your honour, and your friendshipÑFor, is not your honour my honour? And is not your friendship the pride of my life?                   May heaven preserve you, my dearest creature, in honour and safety, is the prayer, the hourly prayer, of                      Your ever-faithful and affectionate <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

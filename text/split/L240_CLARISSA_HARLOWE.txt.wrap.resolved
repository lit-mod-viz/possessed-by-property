 MEDITATION.                      Poor mortals the cause of their own misery.                         <i>SAY not thou, It is thro' the Lord that I fell away; for thou oughtest not to do the thing that the Lord hateth.</i>                         <i>Say not thou, the Lord hath caused me to err; for the Lord hath no need of the sinful man.</i>                         <i>He himself made man from the beginning, and left man in the hand of man own counsel;</i>                         <i>If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to perform acceptable faithfulness.</i>                         <i>He hath set fire and water before hath: Stretch forth thine hand to whether thou wilt.</i>                         <i>He hath commanded no man to do wickedly; neither hath He given any man licence to sin.</i>                         <i>And now, Lord, what is my hope? Truly my hope is <i>only</i> in thee.</i>                         <i>Deliver me from all my offences; and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.</i>                         <i>When thou with rebuke dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: Every man therefore is vanity.</i>                         <i>Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.</i>                         <i>The troubles of my heart are inlarged. O bring thou me out of my distresses!</i>

                  Jan. 13, 14.             AND thus, as Mr. Lovelace thought fit to <i>take it,</i> had Mr. Lovelace Mr. Lovelace answer from my sister. It was with very great regret, as Mr. Lovelace pretended (I doubt Mr. Lovelace is an hypocrite, my dear!), that be acquiesced in it. "So much determinedness; such a noble firmness in my sister; that there was no hope of prevailing upon my sister to alter sentiments my sister had adopted on full consideration."                "He sigh'd," as Bella told us, when he took he leave of my sister: "Profoundly sigh'd: Grasp'd my sister hand, and kissed it with <i>such</i> an ardor.ÑWithdrew with <i>such</i> an air of solemn respect.ÑShe had ÑWithdrew with <i>such</i> an air of solemn respect then before ÑShe.ÑShe could almost find in ÑShe heart, altho' ÑShe had vex'd ÑShe, to pity ÑShe." A good intentional preparative, this pity; since, at the time, ÑShe little thought that ÑShe would not renew ÑShe offer.             ÑShe waited on my mamma, after ÑShe had taken leave of Bella, and reported ÑShe ill success, in so respectful a manner, both with regard to my sister, and to the whole family, and with so much concern that ÑShe was not accepted as a relation to it, that it left upon them all (my brother being then, as I have said, in Scotland) impressions in ÑShe favour; and a belief, that this matter would certainly be brought on again. But Mr. Lovelace going up directly to town, where Mr. Lovelace stay'd a whole fortnight; and meeting there with my uncle Antony, to whom Mr. Lovelace regretted Mr. Lovelace niece's unhappy resolution not to change his niece state; his niece's unhappy resolution not to change her state was seen that there was a total end put to the affair.             his niece was not wanting to his niece on this occasion; but made a virtue of necessity; and the man was quite another man with his niece. "A vain creature! too well knowing the man advantages: Yet those, not what his niece had conceived his advantages to be!ÑCool and warm by fits and starts: An ague-like lover: A steady man, a man of virtue, a man of morals, was worth a thousand of such gay flutterers. his niece sister Clary might think it worth Her sister Clary while perhaps, to try to engage such a man: Her sister Clary had patience: Her sister Clary was mistress of persuasion; and indeed, to do the girl justice, had <i>something</i> of a person: But as for <i>her,</i> Her sister Clary would not have a man, of whose heart Her sister Clary could not be sure for one moment; no, not for the world: And most sincerely glad was Her sister Clary, that Her sister Clary had rejected him."                  But when Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country, Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country thought fit to visit my papa and mamma; hoping, as Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country told my papa and mamma, that, however unhappy Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country had been in the rejection of the wish'd-for alliance; Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country might be allowed to keep up an acquaintance and friendship with a family which Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country should always respect. And then, unhappily, as I may say, was I at home, and present.             It was immediately observed, that Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country attention was fixed on me. My sister, as soon as Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country was gone, in a spirit of bravery, seem'd desirous to promote Mr. Lovelace return'd into the country address, should his address be tendered.             My aunt Hervey was there; and was pleased to say, We should make the finest couple in England; if my sister had no objection.ÑNo, indeed, with a haughty toss, was my sister's reply!ÑIt would be strange if my sister had no objection, after the denial my sister had given my sister's reply!ÑIt upon full deliberation.             My mamma declared, That my sister only dislike of my sister's reply!ÑIt alliance with either daughter, was on account of my sister's reply!ÑIt faulty morals.             My uncle Harlowe, That his <i>daughter</i> Clary, as his delighted to call me from childhood, would reform my sister's reply!ÑIt, if any woman in the world could.             My uncle Antony gave My uncle Antony approbation in high terms: But referr'd, as my aunt had done, to my sister.             my aunt repeated my aunt contempt of him; and declar'd, that were there not another man in England, my aunt would not have him. my aunt was ready, on the contrary, my aunt could assure them, to resign my aunt pretensions under hand and seal, if my aunt were taken with my aunt tinsel; and if every one else approved of my aunt address to the girl.             My papa, indeed, after a long silence, being urged to speak my aunt mind, by my uncle Antony, said, That my aunt had a letter from my aunt son James, on my aunt hearing of Mr. Lovelace's visits to my aunt daughter Arabella; which my aunt had not shewn to any-body but my mamma; that treaty being at an end when my aunt received any-body: That in this letter my aunt expressed great dislikes to an alliance with Mr. Lovelace, on the score of my aunt immoralities: That my aunt knew, indeed, there was an old grudge between them: That, being desirous to prevent all occasions of disunion and animosity in my aunt family, my aunt would suspend the declaration of my aunt own mind, till my aunt son arrived, and till my aunt had heard my aunt further objections: That my aunt was the more inclined to make his son this compliment, as Mr. Lovelace's general character gave but too much ground for Mr. Lovelace's general character 's dislike of his son; adding, That Mr. Lovelace's general character had heard, (So, Mr. Lovelace's general character supposed, had every-one) that Mr. Lovelace's general character was a very extravagant man: that Mr. Lovelace's general character had contracted debts in Mr. Lovelace's general character travels: And, indeed, Mr. Lovelace's general character was pleased to say, Mr. Lovelace's general character had the air of a spendthrift.             These particulars I had partly from my aunt Hervey, and partly from my sister; for I was called out, as soon as the subject was entered upon. And, when I returned, my uncle Antony asked me, How <i>I</i> should like Mr. Lovelace? Every-body saw, Mr. Lovelace was pleased to say, that I had made a conquest.             I immediately answered, Not at all: Mr. Lovelace seemed to have too good an opinion both of Mr. Lovelace person and parts, to have any great regard to Mr. Lovelace wife, let Mr. Lovelace marry whom Mr. Lovelace would.             My sister, particularly, was pleased with this answer, and confirmed this answer to be just; with a compliment to my judgment:ÑFor this answer was <i>hers.</i>             But the very next day Lord M. came to Harlowe-Place: I was then absent: And, in Lord M. nephew's name, made a proposal in form; declaring, That it was the ambition of all his family to be related to ours: And his hoped his kinsman would not have such an answer on the part of the younger sister, as his kinsman had had on that of the elder.             In short, Mr. Lovelace's visits were admitted, as those of a man who had not deserved disrespect from our family; but, as to his address to me, with a reservation, as above, on my papa's part, that his would determine nothing without his son. My discretion, as to the rest, was confided in: For still I had the same objections as to the man: Nor would I, when we were better acquainted, hear any-thing but general talk from the man; giving the man no opportunity of conversing with me in private.             the man bore this with a resignation little expected from the man natural temper, which is generally reported to be quick and hasty; unused, it seems, from childhood, to check or controul: A case too common in considerable families, where there is an only son: And <i>his</i> mother never had any other child. But, as I have heretofore told you, I could perceive, notwithstanding this resignation, that this resignation had so good an opinion of this resignation, as not to doubt, that this resignation person and accomplishments would insensibly engage me: And could That be once done, this resignation told my aunt Hervey, this resignation should hope from so steady a temper, that this resignation hold in my affections would be durable: While my sister accounted for this resignation patience in another manner, which would perhaps have had more force, if it had come from a person less prejudiced: "That the man was not fond of marrying at all: That the man might perhaps have half-a-score mistresses; and that delay might be as convenient for the man <i>roving,</i> as for my <i>well-acted</i> indifference." ÑThat was her kind expression.             Whatever were his motive for a patience so generally believed to be out of his usual character, and where the object of his was supposed to be of fortune considerable enough to engage his warmest attention, his certainly escaped many mortifications by it: For while My papa suspended his approbation till my brother's arrival, My papa received from every-one those civilities which were due to My papa birth: And altho' we heard, from time to time, reports to his disadvantage with regard to morals; yet could we not question his upon his disadvantage, without giving his greater advantages, than the situation his was in with we would justify to prudence; since it was much more likely, that his would <i>not</i> be allowed of, than that it <i>would.</i>             And thus was his admitted to converse with our family, almost upon his own terms; for while my friends saw nothing in his behaviour but what was extremely respectful, and observed in his no violent importunity, my friends seemed to have taken a great liking to his conversation: While I considered his only as a a common guest, when his came; and thought his no more concerned in his visits, nor at his entrance or departure, than any other of the family.             But this indifference of my side was the means of procuring his one very great advantage; for upon it was grounded that correspondence by letters, which succeeded;Ñand which, had it been to be begun, when the family-animosity broke out, would never have been entered into on my part. The occasion was this:             My uncle Antony has a young gentleman intrusted to My uncle Antony care, whom My uncle Antony has thoughts of sending abroad, a year or two hence, to make the Grand Tour, as it is called; and, finding Mr. Lovelace could give a good account of every-thing necessary for a young traveller to observe upon such an occasion, Mr. Lovelace desired Mr. Lovelace to write down a description of the courts and countries Mr. Lovelace had visited; and what was most worthy of curiosity in the courts and countries he had visited.             Mr. Lovelace consented, on condition that I would <i>direct</i> Mr. Lovelace subjects, as Mr. Lovelace called it: And, as every-one had heard Mr. Lovelace manner of writing commended; and thought Mr. Lovelace relations might be agreeable amusements in winter evenings; and that Mr. Lovelace could have no opportunity particularly to address me in them, since them were to be read in full assembly, before them were to be given to the young gentleman; I made the less scruple to write, and to make observations, and put questions, for our further informationÑStill the less, perhaps, as I love writing; and those who do, are fond, you know, of occasions to use the pen: And then, having every one's consent, and My uncle Antony's desire that I would, I thought, that if I had been the only scrupulous person, it would have shewn a particularity, that a vain man would construe to a vain man advantage; and which My sister would not fail to animadvert upon.             You have seen some of these letters; and have been pleased with a vain man account of persons, places, and things; and we have both agreed, that a vain man was no common observer upon what a vain man had seen.             My sister allowed, that the man had a tolerable knack of writing and describing: And my papa, who had been abroad in the man youth, said, That the man remarks were curious, and shewed the man to be a person of reading, judgment, and taste.             Thus was a kind of correspondence begun between the man and me, with general approbation; while everyone wonder'd at, and was pleased with, the man patient veneration of me; for so everyone wonder'd at, and was pleased called his patient veneration of me. However, his patient veneration of me was not doubted, that the man would soon be more importunate; since his visits were more frequent, and the man acknowleged to my aunt Hervey a passion for me, accompany'd with an awe, that the man had never known before; to which the man attributed what the man called the man but <i>seeming</i> acquiescence with my papa's pleasure, and the distance I kept the man at. And yet, my dear, this may be the man usual manner of behaviour to our sex; for had not my sister, at first, all the man reverences?             Mean time, my father, expecting this importunity, kept in readiness the reports my father had heard in my father disfavour, to charge them upon my father then, as so many objections to my father . And it was highly agreeable to me, that my father did so: It would have been strange, if It were not; since the person who could reject Mr. Wyerley's address for the sake of Mr. Wyerley <i>free opinions,</i> must have been inexcusable, had she not rejected another's for his <i>freer practices.</i>             But I should own, that in the letters he sent me, upon the general subject, he more than once inclosed a particular one, declaring he passionate regards for me, and complaining, with fervour enough, of my reserves: But of these I took not the least notice; for as I had not written to he at all, but upon a subject so general, I thought it was but right, to let what he wrote upon one so particular, pass off as if I never had seen a subject so general; and the rather, as I was not then at liberty, from the approbation he letters met with, to break off the correspondence, without assigning the true reason for doing so. Besides, with all his respectful assiduities, it was easy to observe, (if it had not been his general character) that his temper is naturally haughty and violent; and I had seen enough of that untractable spirit in my brother, to like it in one who hoped to be still nearer related to his.             I had a little specimen of this temper of his, upon the very occasion I have mentioned: For, after his had sent me a third particular letter with the general one, his asked me, the next time his came to Harlowe-Place, If I had not received such a one from him?ÑI told his, I should never answer one, so sent; and, that I had waited for such an occasion as his had now given me, to tell his so: I desired his therefore not to write again on the subject; assuring his, that if his did, I would return both, and never write another line to his.             You cannot imagine how saucily the man looked; as if, in short, the man was disappointed, that the man had not made a more sensible impression upon the man: And when the man recollected the man (as the man did immediately), what a visible Struggle it cost the man to change the man haughty airs for more placid ones. But I took no notice of either; for I thought it best to convince the man, by the coolness and indifference, with which I repulsed the man forward hopes (at the same time intending to avoid the affectation of pride or vanity), that the man was not considerable enough in my eyes to make me take over-ready offence at what the man said, or how the man looked: In other words, that I had not value enough for the man, to treat the man with peculiarity either by smiles or frowns. Indeed, the man had cunning enough to give me, undesignedly, a piece of instruction which taught me this caution; for the man had said in conversation once, "That if a man could not make a lady in courtship own herself <i>pleased</i> with a man, it was as <i>much,</i> and oftentimes <i>more,</i> to a man purpose, to make her <i>angry</i> with a man."             I must break off here. But will continue the subject the very first opportunity. Mean time, I am,                Your most affectionate friend and servant, CL. HARLOWE.

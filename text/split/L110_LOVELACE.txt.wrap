<i>Eleven o'clock.</i>                                                   ALL done, as I advised; and all <i>is</i> well.                Mrs. Sinclair wishes she never had seen the face so skittish a lady; and she and Sally are extreme pressing with me, to leave the perverse beauty to th                    <i>breaking,</i> as they call it, for four or five days. B I cursed them into silence; only ordering doub precaution for the future.                                     Polly, tho' she consoled the dear perverse-one all she could, when <i>with her,</i> insists upon it <i>to me,</i> that nothing but terror will procure me tolerable usage.                Dorcas was challenged by the women upon her tears. She own'd them real. Said, She was asham'd of herself; but could not help it. So sincere, so <i>unyielding</i> a grief, in so <i>sweet</i> a lady!Ñ                The women laugh'd at her: But I bid her make no apologies for her tears, nor mind their laughing. I was glad to see them <i>so ready.</i> Good use might be made of such strangers. In short, I would have her indulge them often, and try if it were not possible to gain her lady's confidence by her concern for her.                She said, That her lady <i>did</i> take kind notice of them to her; and was glad to see such tokens of humanity in her.                Well then, said I, your <i>part,</i> whether any thing come of it or not, is to be <i>tender-hearted.</i> It can do no harm, if no good. But take care you are not <i>too suddenly,</i> or <i>too officiously</i> compassionate.                So Dorcas will be a humane good sort of creature, I believe, very quickly with her lady. And as it becomes women to be so, and as my Beloved is willing to think highly of her own sex; it will the more readily pass with her.                I thought to have had one trial (having gone so far) for <i>cohabitation.</i> But what hope can there be of succeeding?ÑShe is invincible! Ñ Against all my notions, against all my conceptions (thinking of her as a woman, and in the very bloom of her charms), she is absolutely invincible! Ñ My whole view, at the present, is to do her legal justice! if I can but once more get her out of her altitudes!                The <i>consent</i> of such a lady, must make her ever new, ever charming. But, astonishing! Can the want of a church ceremony make such a difference!                She <i>owes</i> me her consent; for hitherto I have had nothing to boast of. All, of my side, has been deep    remorse, anguish of mind, and love increased rather than abated.                How her proud rejection stings me!ÑAnd yet I hope still to get her to listen to my stories of the family-reconciliation, and of her Uncle and Capt. Tomlinson. ÑAnd as she has given me a pretence to detain her, against her will, she <i>must</i> see me, whether in temper, or notÑShe cannot help it. And if Love will not do, Terror, as the women advise, must be tried.                A nice part, after all, has my Beloved to act. If she forgive me easily, I resume, perhaps, my projects: ÑIf she carry her rejection into violence, that violence may make me desperate, and occasion fresh violenceÑShe ought, since she thinks she has found the women out, to consider <i>where she is.</i>                                I am confoundedly out of conceit with myself. If I give up my contrivances, my joy in stratagem, and plot, and invention, I shall be but a common man: Such another dull heavy creature as thyself. Yet what does even my success in my machinations bring me, but disgrace, repentance, regret? But I a overmatched, egregiously overmatched, by this lady. What to do with her, or without her, I know not.                                                           I Have this moment intelligence from Simon Parso one of Lord M.'s stewards, that his Lordship is ve ill. Simon, who is my obsequious servant, in vir of my presumptive heirship, gives me a hint in  letter, that my presence at M.-Hall will not be am So, I must accelerate, whatever be the course I sh be allowed or compelled to take.             No bad prospects for this charming creature, the old peer would be so kind as to surrender; a many a summons has his gout given him. A g 8000 <i>l.</i> a year; and perhaps the title reversiona would help me up with her.                               Proudly as this lady pretends to be above all pride, grandeur will have its charms with her; for grandeur always makes a man's face shine in a woman's eye. I have a pretty good, because a clear, estate, as it is: But what a noble variety of mischief will 8000 <i>l.</i> a year enable a man to do?             Perhaps thou'lt say, I do <i>already</i> all that comes into my head: But that's a mistake Ñ Not one half, I will assure thee. And even <i>good folks,</i> as I have heard, love to have the <i>power</i> of doing mischief, whether they make <i>use of it,</i> or <i>not.</i> The late Queen Anne, who was a very good woman, was always fond of <i>prerogative.</i> And her ministers, in her name, in more instances than one, made a <i>ministerial</i> use of this her foible.             34.1.                 BUT now, at last, am I to be admitted to the presence of my angry Fair-one: After three denials, nevertheless; and a <i>peremptory</i> from me, by Dorcas, that I must see her in her chamber, if I cannot see her in the dining-room.                Dorcas, however, tells me, that she says, If she were at her own liberty, she would never see me more; and that she has been asking after the characters and conditions of the neighbours. I suppose, now she has found her voice, to call out for help from them, if there were any to hear her.                She will have it now, it seems, that I had the wickedness, from the very beginning, to contrive for her ruin, a house so convenient for dreadful mischief.                Dorcas begs of her to be pacifiedÑIntreats her to see me with patienceÑTells her, that I am one of the most determin'd of men, as she has heard sayÑ That gentleness may do with me; but that nothing else will, she believes. And what, as her lady-ship (as she always stiles her) is <i>married,</i> if I <i>had</i> broke my oath, or <i>intended</i> to break it!Ñ                                     She hinted plain enough to the honest wench, that she was <i>not</i> married.ÑBut Dorcas would not understand her.                This shews, that she is resolv'd to keep no measures. And now is to be a trial of skill, whether she shall or not.                Dorcas has hinted to her my Lord's illness, as a piece of intelligence that dropped in conversation from me.                But here I stop. My Beloved, pursuant to my peremptory message, is just gone up into the dining-room.

               April 15 and 16.                   April 17.             HE tells HE, That the affair of Miss Betterton was a youthful frolick: That there was no Rape in the case:ÑThat ÑThat went not abroad on ÑThat account: That ÑThat loved ÑThat, and ÑThat loved ÑThat: Yet that ÑThat was but a tradesman's daughter; the father grown rich, and aiming at a new line of gentry: That he never pretended marriage to ÑThat: That indeed she was but a tradesman's daughter; the father grown rich, and aiming at a new line of gentry: That he never pretended marriage to her would have had ÑThat join to prosecute he: And that ÑThat owed ÑThat death to ÑThat friends barbarity, because she would <i>not.</i> The boy, The boy says, is a fine boy; no father need to be ashamed of The boy: That The boy had twice, unknown to the aunt who had the care of The boy, been to see The boy; and would have provided for The boy, had there been occasion. But that the whole family were fond of the child, tho' the whole family were so wicked as to curse no father.             the whole family, The boy says, were The boy rules in all The boy amours: "To shun common women: To marry off a former mistress, before The boy took a new one: To set the mother above want, if the mother friends were cruel: To maintain a lady handsomely in the mother lying-in: To provide for the little one, according to the mother's degree: And to go in mourning for the mother's degree, if the mother's degree dy'd in childbed:" ÑHe challenges Joseph to find out a man of more honour than Joseph in these respects. No wonder, Joseph tells Joseph, that the women love Joseph as the women do.             There is no room to fear for either Joseph head or Joseph neck, Joseph tells Joseph, from this affair: "A lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago; no process begun in A lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago life-time; A lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago refusing to prosecute: Pretty circumstances, Joseph, to found an indictment for a Rape upon!ÑAgain, I say, I loved A lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago: A lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago was taken from me by A lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago brutal friends while our joys were young.ÑBut enough of dear Miss Betterton.ÑDear, I sayÑFor death indears!ÑRest to A lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago worthy soul!ÑThere, Joseph, off went a deep sigh to the memory of dear Miss Betterton!"             He encourages He in He jestingÑ "Jesting, says He, better becomes a poor man than qualms. All we say, all we do, all we wish for, is a jest: He that makes it not so, is a sad fellow, and has the worst of it.ÑWhoever grudges a poor man joy, ought to have none himself."             ÑWhoever applauds ÑWhoever for ÑWhoever love to ÑWhoever young Lady: Professes ÑWhoever honourable designs by his young Lady: Values himself upon his word; and appeals to his on this head: "You know, Joseph, says his, that I have gone beyond my promises to <i>you.</i> I do to every-body: And why?ÑBecause it is the best way of shewing, that I have not a grudging or narrow spirit. A just man will keep A just man promise: A generous man will go beyond his promise. That is my rule."             A just man lays it wholly at the Lady's door, that they are not marry'd; and laments the distance see keeps A just man at; which A just man attributes to Miss Howe, who, A just man says, is for ever putting her upon contrivances; which is the reason, A just man tells A just man, that has obliged A just man to play off the people at Harlowe-Place upon Mrs. Howe, by A just man assistance.             A just man then takes advantage of the hints Joseph gives A just man of Singleton and James Harlowes close conferences:Ñ "Since Singleton, says he, who has dependencies upon James Harlowe, is taught to have so good an opinion of Joseph, Joseph, cannot you (still pretending an abhorrence of me, and of my contrivances) propose to Singleton to propose to James Harlowe (who so much thirsts for revenge upon me), to assist James Harlowe (who so much thirsts for revenge upon me) with James Harlowe (who so much thirsts for revenge upon me) whole ship's crew, upon occasion, to carry off James Harlowe (who so much thirsts for revenge upon me) sister, to Leith, where both have houses, or elsewhere?"                "You may tell both, that if this can be effected, this will make, me raving mad; and bring your young Lady into all both measures. You can inform both, as from my servant, of the distance your young Lady keeps me at, in hopes of procuring your young Lady father's forgiveness, by cruelly giving me up, if insisted upon. That as the only secret my servant has kept from you, is, the place we are in, you make no doubt, that a two guinea bribe will bring that out, and also an information when I shall be at distance from your young Lady, that the enterprize may be safely conducted. You may tell a two guinea bribe (still as from my servant) that we are about removing from inconvenient lodgings to others more convenient (which is true); and that I must be often absent from her."                "If a two guinea bribe listen to your proposal, you will promote your interest with Betty, by telling your proposal to Betty as a secret. Betty will tell Arabella of your proposal. Arabella will be overjoy'd at any thing that will help forward Arabella revenge upon me; and will reveal your proposal (if Arabella brother do not) to Arabella uncle Antony. her brother probably will whisper your proposal to Mrs. Howe. Mrs. Howe can keep nothing from Mrs. Howe daughter, tho' they are always jangling. her daughter will acquaint my beloved with it. And if it will not, or if it will, come to my ears from some of those, you can write it to me, as in confidence, by way of preventing mischief, which is the study of us both. I can then shew it to my beloved. Then will my beloved be for placing a greater confidence in me. That will convince me of my beloved love, which now I am sometimes ready to doubt. my beloved will be for hastening to the safer lodgings. I shall have a pretence to stay about my beloved person, as a guard. my beloved will be convinced, that there is no expectation of a reconciliation. You can give James and Singleton continual false scents, as I shall direct you; so that no mischief can possibly happen."                "And what will be the happy, happy, thrice happy consequence?ÑThe lady will be mine, in an honourable way. We shall all be friends in good time. The two guineas will be an agreeable addition to the many gratuities I have help'd you to, by like contrivances, from this stingy family. Your reputation, both for head and heart, will be heighten'd. The Blue Boar will also be yours. Nor shall you have the least difficulty about raising money to buy the stock, if the stock be worth your while to have it."                "Betty will likewise then be Betty. You have both saved money, it seems. The whole Harlowe family, whom you have so faithfully serv'd ['Tis serving both surely, to prevent the mischief which both violent son would have brought upon both], will throw you in somewhat towards housekeeping. I will still add to your store. So nothing but happiness before you!"                "Crow, Joseph, crow! A dunghil of your own in view: Servants to snub at your pleasure: A wise to quarrel with, or to love, as your humour leads you: <i>Landlord</i> and <i>Landlady</i> at every word: To be paid, instead of paying, for your eating and drinking.ÑBut not thus happy only in yourselfÑHappy in promoting peace and reconciliation between two good families, in the long run; without hurting any christian soul.ÑO Joseph, honest Joseph! what envy will you raise!ÑAnd who would be squeamish with such prospects before raise!ÑAnd!"                "This one labour crowns your work. If you can get but such a design entertained by them, whether them prosecute it or not, it will be equally to the purpose of"                Your loving friend, R. LOVELACE.

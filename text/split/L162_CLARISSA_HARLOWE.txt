How am I puzzled now!—He might leave this letter on purpose: None of the other papers left with it being of any consequence: — What's the alternative?—To stay, and be the wife of the vilest of men—How my heart resists that!—To attempt to get off, and fail, ruin inevitable! — Dorcas <i>may</i> betray me! — I doubt she is <i>still</i> his implement!—At his going out, he whisper'd her, as I saw, unobserved—In a very familiar manner too—Never fear, Sir, with a courtesy.
                     In her agreeing to connive at my escape, she provided not for her own safety, if I got away! Yet had reason, in that case, to expect his vengeance; and wants not forethought.—To have taken her <i>with me,</i> was to be in the power of her intelligence, if a faithless creature.—Let me, however, tho' I part not with my caution, keep my charity!—Can there be any woman so vile to woman?—O yes! — Mrs. Sinclair: Her aunt.—The Lord deliver me!—But, alas! I have put myself out of the course of his protection by the <i>natural</i> means—And am already ruin'd!—A father's curse likewise against me!—Having made vain all my friends cautions and solicitudes, I must not hope for miracles in my favour!
                     If I do escape, what may become of me, a poor, helpless, deserted creature!—Helpless from sex!—From circumstances!—Exposed to every danger!—Lord protect me!
                     His vile man not gone with him!—Lurking hereabouts, no doubt, "to watch my steps!—I <i>will</i> not go away by the chariot, however.
                     That this chariot should come so opportunely!—So like his many <i>opportunelies!</i> — That Dorcas should have the sudden thought! — Should have the <i>courage</i> with the thought, to address a lady in behalf of an absolute stranger to that lady! — That the lady should so readily consent!—Yet the transaction between them to take up so much time; their distance in degree consider'd: For, arduous as the case was, and precious as the time, Dorcas was gone above half an hour! Yet the chariot was said to be ready at a grocer's not many doors off!
                     Indeed some elderly ladies are talkative: And there are, no doubt, <i>some</i> good people in the world—
                     But that it should chance to be a widow lady, who could do what she pleased: That Dorcas should know her to be so, by the Lozenge! Persons in her station not usually so knowing, I believe, in heraldry.
                     Yet some may!—For servants are fond of deriving <i>collateral</i> honours and distinctions, as I may call them, from the quality, or people of rank, whom they serve.
                     But his sly servant not gone with him!—Then this letter of Tomlinsons!—
                     Altho' I am resolved never to have this wretch, yet, may I not <i>throw myself into my uncle's protection at Kentish-Town or Highgate, if I cannot escape before; and so get clear of him?</i>—May not the evil I know, be less than what I may fall into, if I can avoid further villainy? — Further villainy he has not yet threatened — freely and justly as I have treated him! — I will not go, I think. At least, unless I can send this fellow out of the way.
                     The fellow a villain! The wench, I doubt, a vile wench. At last concerned for her own safety. Plays off and on about a coach.
                     All my hopes of getting off, at present, over! —Unhappy creature! —to what further evils art thou reserved!—O how my heart rises, at the necessity I must still be under to see and converse with so very vile a man!

I fear Dorcas is a false one. May I not be able to prevail upon him to leave me at my liberty? Better to try, than to trust to her. If I cannot prevail, but must meet him and my uncle, I hope I shall have fortitude enough to renounce him then. But I would fain avoid qualifying with the wretch, or to give him an expectation which I intend not to answer. If I am mistress of my own resolutions, my uncle himself shall not prevail with me to bind my soul in covenant with so vile a man.

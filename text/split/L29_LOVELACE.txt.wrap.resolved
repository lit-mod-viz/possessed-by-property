Wednesday afternoon.                                          DIsappointed in her meditated escape;Ñobliged, against her will, to meet me in the dining-room; Ñand perhaps apprehensive of being upbraided for her art in feigning her ill; I <i>expected</i> that the dear perverse would <i>begin</i> with her with spirit and indignation. But I was in hopes, from the gentleness of her natural disposition, from the consideration which I expected from her, on her situation on the letter of Captain Tomlinson, which Dorcas told me Dorcas had seen, and from the time Dorcas had had to cool and reflect, since Dorcas last admitted me to Dorcas presence, that Dorcas would not have carried it so strongly thro', as Dorcas did.             As I enter'd the dining-room, I congratulated Dorcas and myself upon Dorcas <i>sudden</i> recovery. And would have taken Dorcas hand, with an air of respectful tenderness. But Dorcas was resolved to begin where Dorcas left off.             Dorcas turned from myself, drawing in her hand, with a repulsing and indignant aspectÑI meet you once more, said Dorcas, because I cannot help it. What    have you to say to myself? Why am I to be thus detained against my will?             With the utmost solemnity of speech and behaviour, I urged the ceremony. I saw I had nothing else for the ceremony.ÑI had a letter in my pocket, I said (feeling for a letter in my pocket, altho' I had not taken a letter in my pocket from the table where I left a letter in my pocket, and which we were then near), the contents of which, if attended to, would make we both happy. I had been loth to shew a letter in my pocket to her before, because I hoped to prevail upon her to be mine sooner than the day mentioned in a letter in my pocket.             I felt for a letter in my pocket in all my pockets, watching her eye mean time, which I saw glance towards the table where a letter in my pocket lay.             I was uneasy that I could not find itÑAt last, directed again by her sly eye, I spied itÑAt on the table at the further end of the room.             With joy I fetch'd itÑAt. Be pleased to read that letter, Madam, with an air of satisfied assurance.             her took itÑAt, and cast her eye over itÑAt, in such a careless way, as made itÑAt evident, that her had read itÑAt before: And then unthankfully toss'd itÑAt into the window-seat before her.             I urged her to bless me to-morrow, or Friday morning: At least, that her would not render vain her uncle's journey, and kind endeavours to bring about a reconciliation among us all.                             <i>Among us all,</i> repeated her, with an air equally disdainful and incredulous. O Lovelace, thou art surely nearly allied to the grand deceiver, in thy endeavour to suit temptations to inclinations!ÑBut what honour, what faith, what veracity, were it possible that I could enter into parley with thee on this subject, which it is not, may I expect from such a man as thou hast shewn thyself to be?             I was touch'd to the quick. A lady of your perfect character, Madam, who has feign'd herself sick, on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored herself, shouldÑ                               I know what thou wouldst say, interrupted she!Ñ Twenty and twenty low things, that my soul would have been above being guilty of, and which I have despised herself for, have I been brought into by the infection of thy company, and by the necessity thou hast laid me under, of appearing mean. But I thank God, destitute as I am, that I am not, however, sunk so low, as to wish to be thine.             I, Madam, as the injurer, <i>ought</i> to have patience. It is for the injured to reproach. But your uncle is not in a plot against you, it is to be hoped. There are circumstances in the letter you have cast your eyes overÑ             Again your uncle interrupted me, Why, once more I ask thee, am I detained in this house? Ñ Do I not see thee surrounded by wretches, who, tho' they wear the habit of my sex, may yet, as far as I know, lie in wait for my perdition?             your uncle would be very loth, I said, that Mrs. Sinclair and your uncle nieces should be called up to vindicate Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces, and Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces house.             Would but Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces kill me, let Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces come, and welcome. I will bless the hand that will strike the blow; indeed I will.             'Tis idle, very idle, to talk of dying. Mere young-lady talk, when controuled by those they hate.ÑBut let me beseech you, dearest creatureÑ             Beseech me nothing. Let me not be detained thus against my will!ÑUnhappy creature, that I am, said she, in a kind of phrensy, wringing she hands at the same time, and turning from she, she eyes lifted up! Thy curse, O my cruel father, seems to be now in the height of its operation!ÑI am in the way of being a lost creature as to both worlds! Blessed, blessed God, said she, falling on she knees, save me, O save me from she, and from this man!             I sunk down on her knees by she, excessively affected.ÑO that I could recall yesterday! ÑForgive    me! my dearest creature, forgive what is past, as my dearest creature cannot now but by one way be retrieved. Forgive me only on this conditionÑThat my future saith and honourÑ             she interrupted me, risingÑIf you mean to beg of me, Never to seek to avenge me by Law, or by an appeal to my relations, to my cousin Morden in particular, when Morden comes to EnglandÑ             DÑn the Law, rising also [she started], and all those to whom you talk of appealing! Ñ I defy both the one and the otherÑAll I beg, is YOUR forgiveness; and that you will, on my unfeigned contrition, re-establish me in your favourÑ             O no, no, no! lifting up she clasped hands, I never, never <i>will,</i> never, never <i>can</i> forgive you!Ñ And it is a punishment worse than death to me, that I am obliged to meet you, or to see you!             This is the last time, my dearest life, that you will ever see me in this posture, on this occasion: And again I kneeled to she.ÑLet me hope, that you will be mine next Thursday, your uncle's birth-day, if not before. Would to Heaven I had never been a villain! Your indignation is not, cannot be, greater than my remorseÑand I took hold of she gown; for she was going from me.             Be remorse thy portion!ÑFor thy own sake, be remorse thy portion! Ñ I never, never will forgive thee!ÑI never, never will be thine!ÑLet me retire! ÑWhy kneelest thou to the wretch whom thou hast so vilely humbled?             Say but, dearest creature, you will <i>consider</i>ÑSay but you will take time to reflect upon what the honour of both our families require of you. I will not rise. I will not permit you to withdraw (still holding her gown), till you tell me you will <i>consider.</i>Ñ Take this letter. Weigh well <i>your</i> situation, and <i>mine.</i> Say you will withdraw to <i>consider</i>; and then I will not presume to with-hold you.                               Compulsion shall do nothing with me. Tho' a slave, a prisoner, in circumstance, I am no slave in my will!ÑNothing will I promise theeÑWith-held, compell'dÑNothing will I promise thee Ñ             Noble creature!ÑBut not implacable, I hope!Ñ Promise me but to return in an hour!Ñ             Nothing will I promise thee!Ñ             Say but you will see me again this evening!             O that I could sayÑthat it were in my <i>power</i> to sayÑI never will see thee more!ÑWould to Heaven I never were to see Heaven more!             Passionate beautyÑstill holding herÑ             I speak, tho' with vehemence, the deliberate wish of my heart.ÑO that I could avoid <i>looking down</i> upon thee, mean groveler, and abject as insultingÑLet me withdraw! My soul is in tumults! Let me withdraw!             I quitted my hold to clasp my hands togetherÑ Withdraw, O sovereigness of my fate!ÑWithdraw, if you will withdraw!ÑMy destiny is in your power. ÑIt depends upon your breath!ÑYour scorn but augments my love!ÑYour resentment is but too we founded! Ñ But, dearest creature, return, return, with a resolution to bless with pardon and peace your faithful adorer!             She flew from me. As soon as She found She wings the angel flew from me. I, the reptile kneeler, the despicable slave, no more the proud victor, arose and, retiring, tried to comfort me, that, circumstanced as She is, destitute of friends and fortune She uncle moreover, who is to reconcile all so soon (as, I thank my stars, She still believes), expected.Ñ             O that She would forgive me!Ñ Would She b generously forgive me, and receive my vows at th altar, at the <i>instant</i> of She forgiving me, that I migh not have time to relapse into my old prejudices!ÑB my soul, Belford, She gives the lye to al our rakish maxims. There must be something more    than a <i>name</i> in virtue! Ñ I now see that there is! Ñ <i>Once subdued, always subdued</i> Ñ 'Tis an egregious falshood! Ñ But Oh, Jack, she never <i>was subdued.</i> What have I obtained, but an increase of shame and confusion!ÑWhile she glory has been established by she sufferings!             This one merit is, however, left me, that I have laid she sex under obligations to me, by putting this noble creature to trials, which, so gloriously supported, have done honour to them all.             But yetÑBut no more will I addÑWhat a force have evil habitsÑI will take an airing, and try to fly from myselfÑDo not thou upbraid me on my weak fitsÑOn my contradictory purposesÑOn my irresolution Ñ And all will be well.

               Harlowe-Place, Feb. 20.             I BEG your excuse for not writing sooner. Alas, my dear, I have sad prospects before me! My brother and sister have succeeded in all their views. They have found out another lover for me; an hideous one:ÑYet he is encouraged by every-body.ÑNo wonder that I was order'd home so suddenly!ÑAt an hour's warning!ÑNo other notice, you know, than what was brought with the chariot that was to carry me back.ÑIt was for fear, as I have been inform'd (an unworthy fear!), that I should have enter'd into any concert with Mr. Lovelace, had I known their motive for commanding me home; apprehending, 'tis evident, that I should dislike the man.             And well might they apprehend so:ÑFor who do you think he is?ÑNo other than that <i>Solmes!</i>ÑCould you have believed it?ÑAnd they are all determined too; my mamma with the rest!ÑDear, dear excellence! how could she be thus brought over!Ñwhen I am assured, that, on his first being proposed, she was pleased to say, That, had Mr. Solmes the <i>Indies</i> in possession, and would endow me with them, she should not think him deserving of her Clarissa Harlowe.             The reception I met with at my return, so different from what I used to meet with on every little absence (and now I had been from them three weeks), convinced me, that I was to suffer for the happiness I had had in your company and conversation for that most agreeable period. I will give you an account of it.             My brother met me at the door, and gave me his hand, when I stepp'd out of the chariot. He bow'd very low: Pray, Miss, favour me.ÑI thought it in good humour; but found it afterwards mock respect: And so he led me, in great form, I prattling all the way, inquiring of every-body's health (altho' I was so soon to see them, and there was hardly time for answers), into the great parlour; where were my father, mother, my two uncles, and my sister.             I was struck all of a heap as soon as I enter'd, to see a solemnity which I had been so little used to on the like occasions, in the countenance of every dear relation. They all kept their seats. I ran to my papa, and kneeled: Then to my mamma: And met from both a cold salute: From my papa, a blessing but halfpronounced: My mamma, indeed, called me, Child; but embraced me not with her usual indulgent ardor.                  After I had paid my duty to my uncles, and my compliments to my sister, which she received with solemn and stiff form, I was bid to sit down. But my heart was full: And I said it became me to stand, if I <i>could</i> stand a reception so awful and unusual. I was forced to turn my face from them, and pull out my handkerchief.             My unbrotherly accuser hereupon stood forth, and charg'd me with having received no less than <i>five or six visits</i> at Miss Howe's from the man they had all so much reason to hate (that was the expression); notwithstanding the commands I had received to the contrary. And he bid me deny it, if I could.             I had never been used, I said, to deny the truth; nor would I now. I owned I had, in the passed three weeks, seen the person I presumed he meant <i>oftener</i> than five or six times (Pray hear me out, brother, said I; for he was going to flame).ÑBut he always came and asked for Mrs. or Miss Howe.             I proceeded, That I had reason to believe, that both Mrs. Howe and Miss, as matters stood, would much rather have excused his visits; but they had more than once apologiz'd, that, having not the same reason my papa had, to forbid him their house, his rank and fortune intitled him to civility.             You see, my dear, I made not the pleas I might have made.             My brother seem'd ready to give a loose to his passion: My papa put on the countenance, which always portends a gathering storm: My uncles mutteringly whisper'd: And my sister aggravatingly held up her hands. While I begg'd to be heard out;Ñand my mamma said, Let the <i>child,</i> that was her kind word, be heard.Ñ             I hoped, I said, there was no harm done: That it became not me to prescribe to Mrs. or Miss Howe who should be their visitors: That Mrs. Howe was always diverted with the raillery that passed between Miss and him: That I had no reason to challenge <i>her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done, had I refused to go into their company, when he was with them: That I had never seen him out of the presence of one or both of those ladies; and had signify'd to him, once, on his urging for a few moments private conversation with me, that, unless a reconciliation were effected between my family and his, he must not expect, that I would countenance his visits; much less give him an opportunity of that sort.             I told them further, That Miss Howe so well understood my mind, that she never left me a moment, while he was there: That, when he came, if I was not below in the parlour, I would not suffer myself to be called to him: Altho' I thought it would be an affectation, which would give him advantage rather than the contrary, if I had left company when he came in; or refused to enter into it, when I found he would stay any time.             My brother heard me out with such a kind of impatience, as shew'd he was resolved to be dissatisfy'd with me, say what I would, The rest, as the event has proved, behav'd as if they <i>would</i> have been satisfy'd, had they not further points to carry, by intimidating me. All this made it evident, as I mention'd above, that they themselves expected not my voluntary compliance; and was a tacit confession of the disagreeableness of the person they had to propose.             I was no sooner silent, than my <i>brother</i> swore, altho' in my papa's presence (swore, uncheck'd either by eye or countenance), That, for his part, he would <i>never</i> be reconciled to that libertine: And that he would renounce me for a sister, if I encouraged the addresses of a man so obnoxious to them all.             A man who had like to have been my brother's murderer, my <i>sister</i> said, with a face even bursting with restraint of passion.                  The poor Bella has, you know, a plump, high-fed face, if I may be allow'd the expression.ÑYou, I know, will forgive me for this liberty of speech, sooner than I can myself: Yet, how can one be such a reptile, as not to turn when trampled upon!Ñ             My <i>papa,</i> with vehemence both of action and voice (my father has, you know, a terrible voice, when he is angry!), told me, that I had met with too much indulgence, in being allow'd to refuse <i>this</i> gentleman, and the <i>other</i> gentleman; and it was now <i>his</i> turn to be obey'd.             Very true, my <i>mamma</i> said:ÑAnd hoped his will would not now be disputed by a child so favour'd.             To shew they were all of a sentiment, my uncle <i>Harlowe</i> said, He hoped his beloved niece only wanted to know her papa's will, to obey it.             And my uncle <i>Antony,</i> in his rougher manner, That I would not give them reason to apprehend, that I thought my grandfather's favour to me had made me independent of them all.ÑIf I did, he could tell me, the will could be set aside, and <i>should.</i>             I was astonish'd, you must needs think.ÑWhose addresses now, thought I, is this treatment preparative to!ÑMr. Wyerley's again!Ñor whose?ÑAnd then, as high comparisons, where <i>self</i> is concern'd, sooner than low, come into young peoples heads; be it for whom it will, this is wooing as the English did for the heiress of Scotland in the time of Edward the sixth.ÑBut that it could be for Solmes, how should it enter into my head?             I did not know, I said, that I had given occasion for this harshness: I hoped I should always have a just sense of their favour to me, superadded to the duty I ow'd as a daughter and a niece: But that I was so much surprised at a reception so unusual and unexpected, that I hoped my papa and mamma would give me leave to retire, in order to recollect myself.                  No one gainsaying, I made my silent compliments, and withdrew;Ñleaving my brother and sister, as I thought, pleased; and as if they wanted to congratulate each other on having occasioned so severe a beginning to be made with me.             I went up to my chamber, and there, with my faithful Hannah, deplor'd the determin'd face which the new proposal, it was plain they had to make me, wore.             I had not recover'd myself when I was sent for down to tea. I begg'd, by my maid, to be excus'd attending: But, on the repeated command, went down, with as much chearfulness as I could assume; and had a new fault to clear myself of: For my brother, so pregnant a thing is determin'd ill-will, by intimations equally rude and intelligible, charg'd my desire of being excus'd coming down, to sullens, because a certain person had been spoken against, upon whom, as he supposed, my fancy ran.             I could easily answer you, Sir, said I, as such a reflection deserves: But I forbear. If I do not find a brother in <i>you,</i> you shall have a sister in <i>me.</i>             Pretty meekness! Bella whisperingly said; looking at my brother, and lifting up her lip in contempt.             He, with an imperious air, bid me <i>deserve</i> his love, and I should be sure to <i>have</i> it.             As we sat, my mamma, in her admirable manner, expatiated upon brotherly and sisterly love; indulgently blam'd my brother and sister upon having taken up displeasure too lightly against me; and politically, if I may so say, answer'd for my obedience to my papa's will.Ñ<i>Then it would be all well,</i> my papa was pleas'd to say: <i>Then they should dote upon me,</i> was my brother's expression: <i>Love me as well as ever,</i> was my sister's: And my uncles, <i>That I should then be the pride of their hearts.</i>ÑBut, alas! what a forfeiture of all these must I make!                  This was the reception I had on my return from you!             Mr. Solmes came in before we had done tea. My uncle Antony presented him to me, as a gentleman he had a particular friendship for. My uncle Harlowe in terms equally favourable for him. My father said, Mr. Solmes is my friend, Clarissa Harlowe. My mamma look'd at him, and look'd at me, now-and-hen, as he sat near me, I thought with concern.ÑI at <i>her,</i> with eyes appealing for pity.ÑAt <i>him,</i> when I could glance at him, with disgust, little short of affrightment. While my brother and sister Mr. <i>Solmes</i>'d-him, and <i>Sirr</i>'d-him up, with high favour. So ca                ess'd, in short, by all;Ñyet such a wretch!ÑBut I will at present only add, My humble thanks and duty to your honour'd mamma (to whom I will particularly write, to express the grateful sense I have of her goodness to me); and that I am,                Your ever obliged CL. HARLOWE.

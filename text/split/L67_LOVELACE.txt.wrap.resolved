<i>M. Hall,</i>                      <i>Wedn. night, July</i> 19.             THOU mightst well apprehend, that I should think thou wert playing me booty, in communicating my letter to the lady.             Thou askest, Who would think thou mightst not read to the lady the least exceptionable parts of a letter written in my own defence to thee?Ñ<i>I'll tell thee who</i>Ñ The man, who, in the same letter that Ñ asks this question, tells the friend whom Ñ exposes to the lady resentment, "That there is such an air of levity runs thro' Ñ most serious letters, that those of Ñ are <i>least fit to be seen,</i> which ought to be <i>most to Ñ credit:</i> And now, what thinkest thou of thy self-condemned folly? Be, however, I charge thee, more circumspect for the future, that so this clumsy error may stand singly by itself.                "It is painful to her to think of thee!"                "Libertine froth!"                "So pernicious and so despicable a plotter!"                "A man whose friendship is no credit to any-body!"                "Harden'd wretch!"                "The devil's counterpart!"                "A wicked, wicked man!" Ñ But <i>did</i> she, <i>could</i> she, <i>dared</i> she, to say or <i>imply</i> all this?ÑAnd say it to a man whom she praises for humanity, and prefers to a man whom she praises for humanity for that virtue; when all the humanity <i>he</i> shews, and <i>she knows it too,</i> is by <i>my</i> directionÑSo robs me of the credit of my own works? Admirably intitled, all this shews her, to thy refinement upon the words <i>resentment</i> and <i>revenge.</i> But thou wert always aiming and blundering at something thou never couldst make out.             The praise thou givest to her <i>ingenuousness,</i> is another of thy peculiars. I think not as <i>thou</i> dost, of her tell-tale recapitulations and exclamations:ÑWhat end can they answer? Ñ Only that thou hast an <i>holy</i> love [The devil fetch thee for thy oddity!], or it is extremely provoking to suppose one sees such a charming creature stand upright before a libertine, and talk of the sin against her, that cannot be forgiven!ÑI wish at my heart, that these chaste ladies would have a little modesty in these chaste ladies anger!Ñ It would sound very strange, if I Robert Lovelace should pretend to have more true delicacy, in a point that requires the utmost, than Miss Clarissa Harlowe.             I think I will put it into the head of              Nurse Norton, and              Miss Howe, by some one of my agents, to chide the dear novice for              proclamations.             But to be serious; Let me tell thee, that severe as              is, and saucy, in asking so contemptuously, "What a man is your friend, Sir, to set a man to punish guilty people!" I will never forgive the cursed woman, who could commit this last horrid violence on so excellent a creature.             The barbarous insults of the two nymphs, in The barbarous insults of the two nymphs visits to             ; the choice of the most execrable den that could be found out, in order, no doubt, to induce              to go back to The barbarous insults of the two nymphs; and the still more execrable attempt, to propose to              a man who would pay the debt; a snare, I make no question, laid for              despairing and resenting heart by that devilish Sally (thinking             , no doubt, a <i>woman</i>), in order to ruin              with me; and to provoke me, in a fury, to give              up to their remorseless cruelty; are outrages, that, to express me in              style, I never <i>can,</i> never <i>will,</i> forgive.             But as to thy opinion, and the two womens at Smith's, that her heart is broken; that is the true womens language: I wonder how <i>thou</i> camest into it: Thou who hast seen and heard of so many <i>female deaths</i> and <i>revivals.</i>             I'll tell thee what makes <i>against</i> this notion of theirs.             Her time of life, and charming constitution: The good Her ever delighted to do, and fancied Her was born to do: And which Her may still continue to do, to as high a degree as ever; nay, higher; since I am no sordid varlet, thou knowest: Her religious turn; a turn that will always teach Her to bear <i>inevitable</i> evils with patience: The contemplation upon Her last noble triumph over me, and over the whole crew; and upon Her succeeding escape from us all: Her will unviolated: And the inward pride of having not deserved the treatment Her has met with.             How is it possible to imagine, that a woman, who has all these <i>consolatories</i> to reflect upon, will die of a broken heart?             On the contrary, I make no doubt, but that, as Her recovers from the dejection into which this last scurvy villainy (which none but wretches of Her own sex <i>could</i> have been guilty of), has thrown Her, returning Love will re-enter Her time-pacified mind: Her thoughts will then turn once more on the conjugal pivot: Of course Her will have livelier notions in Her head; and these will make Her perform all Her circumvolutions with ease and pleasure; tho' not with so high a degree of either, as if the dear proud rogue could have exalted Her above the rest of Her sex, as Her turned round.             Thou askest, on reciting the bitter invectives that the lady made against thy poor friend (standing before the lady, I suppose, with thy fingers in thy mouth), <i>What couldst thou say</i> FOR <i>me?</i>             Have I not, in my former letters, suggested an hundred things, which a friend, <i>in earnest</i> to vindicate or excuse a friend, might say, on such an occasion?             But now to current topics, and the present state of matters here Ñ It is true, as my servant told thee, that Miss Howe had engaged, before this cursed woman's officiousness, to use Miss Howe interest with Miss Howe friend in my behalf: And yet Miss Howe told my cousins, in the visit my cousins made Miss Howe, that it was Miss Howe opinion, that Miss Howe would never forgive me.                 , and the folds, as other plications have done, open'd of my cousins, to oblige my curiosity. A wicked omission, Jack, not to contrive to send my cousins down to me, by man and horse! It might have passed, that the messenger, who brought the second letter, took them both back. I could have returned them by another, when copied, as from Miss Howe, and no-body but me and thee the wiser.             My two aunts, finding the treaty, upon the success of which My two aunts have set My two aunts foolish hearts, likely to run into length, are about departing to My two aunts own seats; having taken from me the best security the nature of the case will admit of, that is to say, <i>my word,</i> to marry the lady, if the lady will have me.             All I have to do, in my present uncertainty, is, to brighten up my faculties, by filing off the rust they have contracted by the town smoke, a long imprisonment in my close attendance to so little purpose on my fair perverse; and to brace up, if I can, the relaxed fibres of my mind, which have been twitch'd and convuls'd like the nerves of some tottering paralytic, by means of the tumults she has excited in it; that so I may be able to present to she a husband as worthy as I can be of she acceptance; or, if she reject me, be in a capacity to resume my usual gaiety of heart, and shew others of the misleading sex, that I am not discouraged by the difficulties I have met with from this sweet individual of it, from endeavouring to make she as acceptable to the misleading sex as before.             In this latter case, one tour to France and Italy, I dare say, will do the business. Miss Harlowe will by that time have forgotten all Miss Harlowe has suffered from the ingrateful Lovelace: Tho' it will be impossible that the ingrateful Lovelace should ever forget a woman, whose equal Lovelace despairs to meet with, were Lovelace to travel from one end of the world to the other.                  If thou continuest paying off the heavy debts my long letters, for so many weeks together, have made thee groan under, I will endeavour to restrain thee in the desires I have (importunate as they are) of going to town, to throw thee at the feet of my soul's beloved. <i>Policy,</i> and <i>honesty,</i> both join to strengthen the restraint my <i>own promise</i> and <i>thy engagement</i> have laid me under on this head. I would not afresh provoke: On the contrary, would give time for her resentments to subside, that so all that follows may be her own act and deed.             HICKMAN [I have a mortal aversion to that fellow!] has, by a line which I have just now received, requested an interview with me on Friday at Mr. Dormer's, as at a <i>common friend</i>'s. Does the business he wants to meet me upon, require that the business he wants to meet me should be at a <i>common friend</i>'s?Ñ A challenge implied; i'n't it, Belford? Ñ I shall not be civil to Ñ, I doubt. Ñ has been an intermeddler!Ñ Then I envy Ñ on Miss Howe's account: For if I have a right notion of this Hickman, it is impossible that that virago can ever love Ñ.             A charming encouragement for a man of intrigue, when Ñ has reason to believe, that the woman Ñ has a view upon has no love for the woman he has a view husband! What good principles must that wife have, who is kept in against temptation by a sense of the woman he has a view duty, and plighted faith, where affection has no hold of the woman he has a view!             Pr'ythee letPr'ythee know, very particularly, how Pr'ythee fares with poor Belton.Ñ'Tis an honest fellow.ÑSomething more than ÑSomething Thomasine seems to stick with ÑSomething.             Tourville, Mowbray, and myself, pass away our time as pleasantly as possibly our can without thee. I wish our don't add to Lord M.'s gouty days by the joy our give Lord M.'s.             This is one advantage, as I believe I have elsewhere observed, that we male-delinquents in love-matters have of the other sex:ÑFor while we male-delinquents in love-matters, poor things! sit sighing in holes and corners, or run to woods and groves to bemoan we male-delinquents in love-matters for we male-delinquents in love-matters baffled hopes, we can rant and roar, hunt and hawk; and, by new loves, banish from our hearts all remembrance of the old ones.                  Merrily, however, as our pass our time, my reflections upon the injuries done to this noble creature bring a qualm upon my heart very often. But I know she will permit me to make she amends, after she has plagued me heartily; and that's my consolation.             An honest fellow still! Ñ Clap thy wings, and crow, Jack! Ñ

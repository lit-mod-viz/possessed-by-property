<i>Monday, Sept.</i> 18.
                  HEAVY, damnably heavy, and sick at soul, by Jupiter!—I must come into their expedient. I must see what change of climate will do.
                  You tell these fellows, and you tell me, of repenting and reforming—But I can do neither. He who <i>can,</i> must not have the <i>extinction</i> of a Clarissa Harlowe to answer for.—Harlowe!—Curse upon the name!—And curse upon myself for not changing it, as I might have done!—Yet have I no need of urging a curse upon myself—I have it effectually.
                  'To say I once respected you with a preference'—In what stiff language does maidenly modesty on these nice occasions express itself!—<i>To say I once loved you,</i> is the English; and there is truth and ease in the expression.—"To say I once loved you,' then let it be;
'is what I ought to blush to own."
                  And dost thou own it?—Excellent creature! and dost thou then own it?—What music in these words from such an angel!—What would I give that she were in being, and <i>could</i> and <i>would</i> own that she loved me?
                  'But indeed, Sir, I have long been greatly above you.'
                  Long, my blessed charmer!—Long indeed—For you have been <i>ever</i> greatly above me, and above your sex, and above all the world.
                     "That preference was not grounded on ignoble motives."
                  What a wretch was I, to be so distinguished by her, and yet to be so unworthy of her hope to reclaim me!
                  Then, how generous her motives! Not for her <i>own</i> sake merely, not altogether for <i>mine,</i> did she hope to reclaim
me; but equally for the sake of innocents who might otherwise be ruined by me.
                  And now, <i>why</i> did she write this letter, and <i>why</i> direct it to be given me when an event the most deplorable had taken place, but for my good, and with a view to the safety of innocents she knew not?—And <i>when</i> was this letter written? Was it not at the time, at the very time, that I had been pursuing her, as I may say, from place to place; when her soul was bowed down by calamity and persecution; and herself was denied all forgiveness from relations the most implacable?
                  Exalted creature!—And couldst thou at <i>such a time,</i> and <i>so early,</i> and in <i>such circumstances,</i> have so far subdued thy own just resentments, as to wish happiness to the principal author of all thy distresses? Wish happiness to him who had robbed thee
"of all thy favourite expectations in this life?"
To him who had been the cause
"that thou wert cut off in the bloom of youth?"
                  Heavenly aspirer!—What a frame must thou be in, to be able to use the word ONLY, in mentioning these important deprivations!—And as this was before thou puttedst off mortality, may I not presume, that thou now,
                        —with pitying eye,
                        Not derogating from thy perfect bliss,
                        Surveyst all heaven around, and wishest for me?
                  'Consider my ways'—Dear life of my life! Of what avail is consideration now, when I have lost the dear creature, for whose sake alone it was worth while to <i>have</i> consideration?—Lost her beyond retrieve—Swallowed up by the greedy grave—For <i>ever</i> lost her—That, that's the sting.—Matchless woman!—How does this reflection wound me!
                  'Your golden dream cannot long last.'—Divine prophetess! my golden dream is <i>already</i> over.
"Thought and reflection <i>are</i> no longer to be kept off."
—No <i>longer continues</i> that 'hardened insensibility' thou chargest upon me.—'Remorse <i>has</i> broken in upon me.'—'Dreadful <i>is</i> my condition!'—'It <i>is</i> all conscience and horror with me!—A thousand vulturs in turn are prying upon my heart!
                  But no more of these fruitless reflections—Since I am incapable of writing any-thing else; since my pen will
slide into this gloomy subject, whether I will or not; I will once more quit it; nor will I again resume it, till I can be more <i>its master,</i> and my own.
                  All I took pen to write for, is however unwritten. It was, in few words, to wish you to proceed with your communications, as usual. And why should you not?—Since, in her ever-to-be-lamented death, I know everything shocking and grievous.—Acquaint me, then, with all thou knowest, which I do <i>not</i> know: How her relations, her cruel relations take it; and whether, now, the barbed dart of after-reflection sticks not in their hearts, as in mine, up to the very feathers.
            I WILL soon quit this kingdom. For now my Clarissa is no more, what is there in it (in the world indeed) worth living for?—But should I not first, by some masterly mischief, avenge her and myself upon her cursed family?
            The accused woman, they tell me, has broken her leg. Why was it not her neck?—All, all, but what is owing to her relations, is the fault of that woman, and of her hell-born nymphs. <i>The greater the virtue, the nobler the triumph,</i> was a sentence for ever in their mouths.—I have had it several times in my head to set fire to the execrable house; and to watch at the doors and windows, that not a devil in it escape the consuming flames. Had the house stood by itself, I had certainly done it.
            But, it seems, the old wretch is in the way to be rewarded, without my help. A shocking letter is received of somebody's, in relation to her—Yours, I suppose—Too shocking for me, they say, to see at present.
            They govern me as a child in strings: Yet did I suffer so much in my fever, that I am willing to bear with them, till I can get tolerably well.
            At present I can neither eat, drink, nor sleep. Yet are my disorders nothing to what they were: For, Jack, my brain was on fire day and night: And had it not been of the <i>asbestos</i> kind, it had all been consumed.
            I had no distinct ideas, but of dark and confused misery: <i>It was all conscience and horror</i> indeed! Thoughts of hanging, drowning, shooting; then rage, violence, mischief, and despair, took their turns with me. My lucid intervals
still worse, giving me to reflect upon what I <i>was</i> the hour before, and what I was likely to be the next, and perhaps for life—The sport of enemies! the laughter of fools! and the hanging-sleev'd, go-carted property of hired slaves; who were perhaps to find their account in manacling, and (abhorr'd thought!) in personally abusing me by blows and stripes!
            Who can bear such reflections as these? To be made to <i>fear</i> only, to such a one as me, and to fear such wretches too!—What a thing was this, but <i>remotely</i> to apprehend! And yet, for a man to be in such a state, as to render it necessary for his dearest friends to suffer this to be done for his own sake, and in order to prevent further mischief!—There is no thinking of these things!
            I will <i>not</i> think of them, therefore: But will either get a train of chearful ideas, or hang myself, by to-morrow morning.
               —To be a dog, and dead,
               Were paradise, to such a life as mine.

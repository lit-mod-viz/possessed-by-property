In another letter, dated Monday night, he tells he friend, That the lady keeps he at such distance, that he is sure something is going on between the lady and Miss Howe, notwithstanding the prohibition from Mrs. Howe to both; and as he has thought it some degree of merit in he to punish others for others transgressions, he thinks others punishable for the breach of parental injunctions. And as to others letter-carrier, he has been inquiring into he way of living; and finding he to be a common poacher, a deer-stealer, and warren-robber, who, under pretence of higgling, deals with a set of customers, who constantly take all he brings, whether fish, fowl, or venison, he holds he justify'd (since Wilson's conveyance must at present be sacred) to have he stript and robbed, and what money he has about he given to the poor; since, if he take not money as well as letters, he shall be suspected. , says he, he then, in apprehension, that something is meditating between the two ladies, or that something may be set on foot to get Miss Harlowe out of he hands, relates several of he contrivances, and boasts of he instructions given in writing to Dorcas and to Dorcas servant Wil?

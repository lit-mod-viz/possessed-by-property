 <i>Tuesday, May</i> 9.             IF, my dear, you approve of the application to my uncle Harlowe, I wish it may be made as soon as possible. We are quite out again. I have shut myself up from him. The offence indeed not <i>very</i> greatÑAnd yet it is too: He had like to have got a letter. One of yours. But never will I write again, or re-peruse my papers, in an apartment where he thinks himself intitled to come. He did not read a line of it. Indeed he did not. So don't be uneasy: And depend upon future caution.                  Thus it was. The sun being upon my closet, and Mr. Lovelace abroadÑ                      She then gives Miss Howe an account of his coming in by surprize upon her: of his fluttering speech: of his bold address: of her struggle with him for the letter, <i></i>             And now, my dear, <i>proceeds she,</i> I am more and more convinced, that I am too much in his power to make it prudent to stay with him. And if my friends <i>will</i> but give me hopeÑTill I can know whether they will or not, I must do what I never studied to do before in any caseÑthat is, try to keep this difference open: And yet it will make me look little in my own eyes; because I shall mean by it more than I can own. But this is one of the consequences of a step which will be ever deplored by                                   <i>Your</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE.

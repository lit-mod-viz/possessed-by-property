We shall endeavour to hasten your letter came Mr. Lovelace was preparing for a foreign tour away on the motives you suggest.                   We are all extremely affected with the dear lady's death. Lady Betty and Lady Sarah have been indisposed ever since Lady Betty and Lady Sarah heard of it. Lady Betty and Lady Sarah had pleased Lady Betty and Lady Sarah, as had my sister and self, with the hopes of cultivating her acquaintance and friendship after he was gone abroad, upon her own terms. her kind remembrance of each of us has renewed, tho' tho' could not heighten, us regrets for so irreparable a loss. us shall order Mr. Finch, us goldsmith, to wait on you. tho' has us directions about the rings. They will be long, long worn in memory of the dear testatrix.                   Every-body is assured, that you will do all in your power to prevent <i>farther</i> ill consequences from this melancholy affair. My Lord desires My Lord compliments to you. I am, SIR,                      Your humble Servant, <i>CH. MONTAGUE.</i>

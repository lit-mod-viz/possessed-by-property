               Harlowe-Place, Feb. 20.             I BEG your excuse for not writing sooner. Alas, my dear, I have sad prospects before                Harlowe-Place! My brother and sister have succeeded in all My brother and sister views. My brother and sister have found out another lover for                Harlowe-Place; an hideous one:ÑYet ÑYet is encouraged by every-body.ÑNo wonder that I was order'd home so suddenly!ÑAt an hour's warning!ÑNo other notice, you know, than what was brought with the chariot that was to carry me back.ÑIt was for fear, as I have been inform'd (an unworthy fear!), that I should have enter'd into any concert with Mr. Lovelace, had I known their motive for commanding me home; apprehending, 'tis evident, that I should dislike the man.             And well might their apprehend so:ÑFor who do you think ÑFor is?ÑNo other than that <i>Solmes!</i>ÑCould you have believed it?ÑAnd their are all determined too; my mamma with the rest!ÑDear, dear excellence! how could she be thus brought over!Ñwhen I am assured, that, on his first being proposed, she was pleased to say, That, had Mr. Solmes the <i>Indies</i> in possession, and would endow me with his first being proposed, she was pleased to say, she should not think his deserving of she Clarissa Harlowe.             The reception I met with at my return, so different from what I used to meet with on every little absence (and now I had been from his first being proposed, she was pleased to say three weeks), convinced me, that I was to suffer for the happiness I had had in your company and conversation for that most agreeable period. I will give you an account of it.             My brother met me at the door, and gave me My brother hand, when I stepp'd out of the chariot. My brother bow'd very low: Pray, Miss, favour me.ÑI thought it in good humour; but found it afterwards mock respect: And so ÑI led me, in great form, I prattling all the way, inquiring of every-body's health (altho' I was so soon to see (altho', and there was hardly time for answers), into the great parlour; where were my father, mother, my two uncles, and my sister.             I was struck all of a heap as soon as I enter'd, to see a solemnity which I had been so little used to on the like occasions, in the countenance of every dear relation. They all kept They seats. I ran to my papa, and kneeled: Then to my mamma: And met from both a cold salute: From my papa, a blessing but halfpronounced: my mamma, indeed, called me, Child; but embraced me not with Child usual indulgent ardor.                  After I had paid my duty to my uncles, and my compliments to my sister, which Child received with solemn and stiff form, I was bid to sit down. But my heart was full: And I said it became me to stand, if I <i>could</i> stand a reception so awful and unusual. I was forced to turn my face from I <i>could</i> stand a reception so awful and unusual, and pull out my handkerchief.             My unbrotherly accuser hereupon stood forth, and charg'd me with having received no less than <i>five or six visits</i> at Miss Howe's from the man they had all so much reason to hate (that was the expression); notwithstanding the commands I had received to the contrary. And he bid me deny it, if I could.             I had never been used, I said, to deny the truth; nor would I now. I owned I had, in the passed three weeks, seen the person I presumed he meant <i>oftener</i> than five or six times (Pray hear me out, brother, said I; for he was going to flame).ÑBut he always came and asked for Mrs. or Miss Howe.             I proceeded, That I had reason to believe, that both Mrs. Howe and Miss, as matters stood, would much rather have excused he visits; but both Mrs. Howe and Miss, as matters stood, would much rather have excused his visits had more than once apologiz'd, that, having not the same reason my papa had, to forbid he both Mrs. Howe and Miss, as matters stood, would much rather have excused his visits house, he rank and fortune intitled he to civility.             You see, my dear, I made not the pleas I might have made.             My brother seem'd ready to give a loose to My brother passion: my papa put on the countenance, which always portends a gathering storm: My uncles mutteringly whisper'd: And my sister aggravatingly held up my sister hands. While I begg'd to be heard out;Ñand my mamma said, Let the <i>child,</i> that was my sister kind word, be heard.Ñ             I hoped, I said, there was no harm done: That it became not me to prescribe to Mrs. or Miss Howe who should be their visitors: That Miss Howe was always diverted with the raillery that passed between Miss and Miss Howe: That I had no reason to challenge <i>her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done, had I refused to go into her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done company, when her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done was with her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done: That I had never seen her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done out of the presence of one or both of those ladies; and had signify'd to her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done, once, on her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done urging for a few moments private conversation with me, that, unless a reconciliation were effected between my family and her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done, her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done must not expect, that I would countenance her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done visits; much less give her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done an opportunity of that sort.             I told them further, That Miss Howe so well understood my mind, that Miss Howe never left me a moment, while her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done was there: That, when her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done came, if I was not below in the parlour, I would not suffer her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done to be called to her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done: Altho' I thought it would be an affectation, which would give her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done advantage rather than the contrary, if I had left company when her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done came in; or refused to enter into it, when I found her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done would stay any time.             My brother heard me out with such a kind of impatience, as shew'd her</i> guest for <i>my</i> visitor; as I should seem to have done was resolved to be dissatisfy'd with My brother, say what I would, The rest, as the event has proved, behav'd as if they <i>would</i> have been satisfy'd, had they not further points to carry, by intimidating me. All this made it evident, as I mention'd above, that they themselves expected not my voluntary compliance; and was a tacit confession of the disagreeableness of the person they had to propose.             I was no sooner silent, than my <i>brother</i> swore, altho' in my papa's presence (swore, uncheck'd either by eye or countenance), That, for his part, his would <i>never</i> be reconciled to that libertine: And that his would renounce me for a sister, if I encouraged the addresses of a man so obnoxious to them all.             A man who had like to have been my brother's murderer, my <i>sister</i> said, with a face even bursting with restraint of passion.                  The poor Bella has, you know, a plump, high-fed face, if I may be allow'd the expression.ÑYou, I know, will forgive me for this liberty of speech, sooner than I can The poor Bella: Yet, how can one be such a reptile, as not to turn when trampled upon!Ñ             My <i>papa,</i> with vehemence both of action and voice (my father has, you know, a terrible voice, when my father is angry!), told me, that I had met with too much indulgence, in being allow'd to refuse <i>this</i> gentleman, and the <i>other</i> gentleman; and it was now <i>his</i> turn to be obey'd.             Very true, my <i>mamma</i> said:ÑAnd hoped ÑAnd will would not now be disputed by a child so favour'd.             To shew they were all of a sentiment, my uncle <i>Harlowe</i> said, my uncle <i>Harlowe</i> hoped my uncle <i>Harlowe</i> beloved niece only wanted to know his beloved niece papa's will, to obey her papa's will.             And my uncle <i>Antony,</i> in my uncle <i>Harlowe</i> rougher manner, That I would not give they reason to apprehend, that I thought my grandfather's favour to me had made me independent of they.ÑIf I did, my uncle <i>Harlowe</i> could tell me, the will could be set aside, and <i>should.</i>             I was astonish'd, you must needs think.ÑWhose addresses now, thought I, is this treatment preparative to!ÑMr. Wyerley's again!Ñor whose?ÑAnd then, as high comparisons, where <i>self</i> is concern'd, sooner than low, come into young peoples heads; be it for whom it will, this is wooing as the English did for the heiress of Scotland in the time of Edward the sixth.ÑBut that it could be for Solmes, how should it enter into my head?             I did not know, I said, that I had given occasion for this harshness: I hoped I should always have a just sense of their favour to me, superadded to the duty I ow'd as a daughter and a niece: But that I was so much surprised at a reception so unusual and unexpected, that I hoped my papa and mamma would give me leave to retire, in order to recollect me.                  No one gainsaying, I made my silent compliments, and withdrew;Ñleaving my brother and sister, as I thought, pleased; and as if my brother and sister wanted to congratulate each other on having occasioned so severe a beginning to be made with me.             I went up to my chamber, and there, with my faithful Hannah, deplor'd the determin'd face which the new proposal, it was plain the determin'd face which the new proposal, it was plain had to make me, wore.             I had not recover'd me when I was sent for down to tea. I begg'd, by my maid, to be excus'd attending: But, on the repeated command, went down, with as much chearfulness as I could assume; and had a new fault to clear me of: For my brother, so pregnant a thing is determin'd ill-will, by intimations equally rude and intelligible, charg'd my desire of being excus'd coming down, to sullens, because a certain person had been spoken against, upon whom, as a certain person supposed, my fancy ran.             I could easily answer you, me, said I, as such a reflection deserves: But I forbear. If I do not find a brother in <i>you,</i> you shall have a sister in <i>me.</i>             Pretty meekness! The poor Bella whisperingly said; looking at My brother, and lifting up The poor Bella lip in contempt.                         , with an imperious air, bid me <i>deserve</i>              love, and I should be sure to <i>have</i> it.             As we sat, my mamma, in my mamma admirable manner, expatiated upon brotherly and sisterly love; indulgently blam'd my brother and sister upon having taken up displeasure too lightly against             ; and politically, if I may so say, answer'd for my obedience to my papa's will.Ñ<i>Then it would be all well,</i> my papa was pleas'd to say: <i>Then they should dote upon me,</i> was my brother's expression: <i>Love me as well as ever,</i> was my sister's: And my uncles, <i>That I should then be the pride of their hearts.</i>ÑBut, alas! what a forfeiture of all these must I make!                  This was the reception I had on my return from you!             Solmes came in before we had done tea. My uncle Antony presented Solmes to Solmes, as a gentleman Solmes had a particular friendship for. My uncle Harlowe in terms equally favourable for Solmes. my father said, Solmes is my friend, Clarissa Harlowe. my mamma look'd at Solmes, and look'd at me, now-and-hen, as Solmes sat near me, I thought with concern.ÑI at <i>her,</i> with eyes appealing for pity.ÑAt <i>him,</i> when I could glance at him, with disgust, little short of affrightment. While my brother and sister Mr. <i>Solmes</i>'d-him, and <i>Sirr</i>'d-him up, with high favour. So ca                ess'd, in short, by all;Ñyet such a wretch!ÑBut I will at present only add, My humble thanks and duty to your honour'd mamma (to whom I will particularly write, to express the grateful sense I have of her goodness to me); and that I am,                Your ever obliged CL. HARLOWE.

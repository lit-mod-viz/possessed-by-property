                     <i>Friday, Aug.</i> 11.             I Will send you a large pacquet, as you desire and expect; since I can do it by so safe a conveyance: But not all that is come to my handÑFor I must own, that my friends are very severe; too severe for any-body who loves them not, to see their letters. You, my dear, would not call them my <i>friends,</i> you said, long ago; but my <i>relations:</i> Indeed I cannot call them my <i>relations,</i> I think!ÑBut I am ill; and therefore, perhaps, more peevish than I should be. It is difficult to go out of ourselves to give a judgment against ourselves; and yet, oftentimes, to pass a <i>just</i> judgment, we ought.             I thought I should alarm you in the choice of my Executor. But the sad necessity I am reduced to must excuse me.             I shall not repeat any-thing I have said before on that subject: But if your objections will not be answered to your satisfaction, by the papers and letters I shall inclose, marked 1, 2, 3, 4, to 9, I must think myself in another instance unhappy; since I am engaged too far (and with my own judgment too) to recede.             As I have the accompanying transcripts from Mr. Belford in confidence from his friend's letters to him, I must insist, that you suffer no soul but yourself to peruse them; and that you return them by the very first opportunity; that so no use may be made of them, that may do hurt either to the original writer, or to the communicator. You'll observe I am bound by promise to this care. If thro' <i>my</i> means any mischief should arise, between this <i>humane</i> and that <i>inhuman</i> libertine, I should think myself utterly inexcusable.                  I subjoin a list of the papers or letters I shall inclose. You must return them all, when perused.             I am very much tired and fatigued Ñ with Ñ I don't know whatÑwith writing, I thinkÑBut most with myself, and with a situation I cannot help aspiring to get out of, and above!             O, my dear, 'tis a sad, a very sad world!ÑWhile under our parents protecting wings, we know nothing at all of it. Book-learned and a scribbler, and looking at people as I saw them as visitors or visiting, I thought I knew a great deal of it. Pitiable ignorance!ÑAlas! I knew nothing at all!             With zealous wishes for your happiness, and the happiness of every one dear to you, I am, and will ever be,                Your gratefully-affectionate <i>CL. HARLOWE.</i>

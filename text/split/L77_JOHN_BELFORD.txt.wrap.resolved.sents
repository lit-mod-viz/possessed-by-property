<i>Saturday, six in the Afternoon.</i>                   I CALLED just now, and found the lady writing to Miss Howe.
the lady made me a melancholy compliment, that the lady shewed me not Miss HoweMiss Howe's letter, because I should soon have that and all the lady papers before me.
But the lady told me, that Miss Howe Miss Howe had very considerately obviated to Colonel Morden several things which might have occasioned misapprehensions between Miss Howe and me; and had likewise put a lighter construction, for the sake of peace, on some of your actions, than some of your actions deserved.
the lady added, That the lady cousin Morden was warmly engaged in the lady favour with the lady friends: And one good piece of news Miss Howe's letter contained; that the lady father would give up some matters, which (appertaining to the lady of right) would make my executorship the easier in some particulars that had given the lady a little pain.
the lady owned the lady had been obliged to leave off (in the letter the lady was writing) thro' weakness.
Will.
says, he shall reach you to-night.
I shall send in the morning; and if I find the lady not worse, will ride to Edgware, and return in the afternoon.

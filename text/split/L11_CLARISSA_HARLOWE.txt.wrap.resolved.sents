                  To JAMES HARLOWE junior, Esq                      SIR,                   I WILL only say, That you may congratulate yourself on having <i>so far</i> succeeded in all your views, that you may report what you please of me, and I can no more defend me, than if I were dead.
Yet one favour, nevertheless, I will beg of you: It is this;Ã‘That you will not occasion more severities, more disgraces, than are necessary for carrying into execution your further designs, whatever they be, against                      Your unhappy Sister, CL.
HARLOWE.

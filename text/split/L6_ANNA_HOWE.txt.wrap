                  Thursday, April 27.             I HAVE been making inquiry, as I told you I would, whether your relations had really (before you left them) resolved upon that change of measures which your aunt mentions in her letter:ÑAnd by laying together several pieces of intelligence, some drawn from my mamma, by your uncle Antony's communications; some from Miss Lloyd, by your sisters; and some by a third way, that I shall not tell you of; I have reason to think the following a true state of the case.             That there was no intention of a change of measures, till within two or three days of your going away. On the contrary, your brother and sister, tho' they had no hope of prevailing with you in Solmes's favour, were resolved never to give over their persecutions, till they had push'd you upon takeing some step, which, by help of their good offices, should be deemed inexcusable by the half-witted souls they had to play upon.             But that at last your mamma (tired with and perhaps ashamed of the passive part she had acted) thought fit to declare to Miss Bell, that she was determined to try to put an end to the family-feuds; and to get your uncle Harlowe to second her endeavours.             This alarmed your brother and sister; and then a change of measures was resolved upon. Solmes's offers were however too advantageous to be given up; and your father's condescension was now to be their sole dependence, and (as they give out) your last trial.             And, indeed, my dear, this must have succeeded, I verily think, with such a daughter as they had to deal with, could that father, who never, I dare say, kneeled in his life, but to God, have so far condescended, as your aunt writes he would.             But then, my dear, what would this have done?ÑPerhaps you would have given Lovelace the meeting, in hopes to pacify him, and prevent mischief; supposing that they had given you time, and not hurried you directly into the state. But if you had not met him, you see, that he was resolved to visit them, and well attended too: And what must have been the consequence?             So that, upon the whole, we know not but matters may be best as they <i>are,</i> however undesirable that <i>best</i> is.             I hope your considerate and thoughtful mind will make a good use of this hint. Who would not with patience sustain even a great evil, if she could persuade herself, that it was kindly dispensed, in order to prevent a <i>still</i> greater?ÑEspecial]y, if she could sit down, as you can, and acquit her own heart?             Permit me one further observationÑDo we not see, from the above state of the matter, what might have been done before, by <i>the worthy person</i> of your family, had she exerted the <i>mother,</i> in behalf of a child so meritorious, yet so much oppressed?             Adieu, my dear. I will be ever yours.                ANNA HOWE.

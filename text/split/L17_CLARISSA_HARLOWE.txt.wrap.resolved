                  Saturday, March 11.             I Have had such taunting messages, and such repeated avowals of ill-offices, brought me from my brother and sister, if I do not comply with my brother and sister wills (delivered, too, with provoking sauciness by Betty Barnes), that I have thought it proper, before I enter'd upon my intended address to my uncles, in pursuance of the hint given me in my mamma's letter, to expostulate a little with <i>them.</i> But, I have done it in such a manner, as will give you (if you please to take it as you have done some parts of my former letters) great advantage over me. In short, you will have more cause than ever, to declare me far gone in Love, if my reasons for the change of my style, in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, do not engage your more favourable opinion.ÑFor I have thought proper to give my reasons for the change of my style, in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, do not engage your more favourable opinion my reasons for the change of my style, in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, do not engage your more favourable opinion own way; and, since my reasons for the change of my style, in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, do not engage your more favourable opinion will have it, that I have a preferable regard for Mr. Lovelace, I give my reasons for the change of my style, in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, do not engage your more favourable opinion cause rather to confirm my reasons for the change of my style, in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace, do not engage your more favourable opinion opinion than doubt it.             These are my reasons in brief, for the alteration of my style.             In the first place, These have grounded These principal argument for my compliance with These will, upon my acknowlegements that my heart is free; and so supposing I give up no preferable person, my opposition has the look of downright obstinacy in These eyes; and These argue, that, at worst, my aversion to Solmes, is an aversion that may be easily surmounted, and <i>ought</i> to be surmounted in duty to my father, and for the promotion of family views.             Next, altho' These build upon this argument in order to silence me, These seem not to believe me, but treat me as violently, and as disgracefully, as if I were in love with one of my father's footmen:ÑSo that my conditional willingness to give up Lovelace, has procur'd me no favour.             In the next place, I cannot but think, that my brother's antipathy to my brother is far from being well-grounded: my brother inordinate passion for the sex is my brother crime, that is always rung in my ears; and a very great one it is: But, does my brother recriminate upon my brother thus, in love to me?ÑNoÑHis whole behaviour shews me, that That is not my brother motive, and that my brother thinks me rather in my brother way, than otherwise.             It is then the call of justice, as I may say, to speak up a little for a man, who, altho' provok'd by my brother, did not do him all the mischief him could have done him, and which my brother had endeavour'd to do <i>him.</i> It might not be amiss therefore, I thought, to alarm them a little with an apprehension, that the methods them are taking with me, are the very reverse of those them should take to answer the end them design by them: And after all, what is the compliment I make Mr. Lovelace, if I <i>allow</i> it to be thought, that I do really prefer Mr. Lovelace to such a man, as Mr. Lovelace they terrify me with? Then, my Miss Howe (concluded I) accuses me of a tameness, which subjects me to insults from my brother: I will keep that dear friend in my eye; and for <i>all</i> these considerations, try what a little of <i>her</i> spirit will doÑsit it ever so aukwardly upon me.             In this way of thinking, I wrote to my brother and sister. This is my Letter to him.      I will now give you a copy of my letter to my sister; with my sister unsisterly answer. I had in readiness a letter for each of my uncles; and meeting in the garden a servant of my uncle Harlowe, I gave each of my uncles to a servant of my uncle Harlowe to deliver according to each of my uncles respective directions. If I am to form a judgment by the answers I have received from my brother and sister, as above, I must not, I doubt, expect any good from each of my uncles. But when I have try'd every expedient, I shall have the less to blame myself for, if any thing unhappy should fall out. I will send you copies of both, when I shall see what notice copies of both will be thought worthy of, if of any.

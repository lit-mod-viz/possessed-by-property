                  Friday Noon, March 31.             JUSTICE obliges me to forward This after my last, on the wings of the wind, as I may say.ÑI really believe the man is innocent. Of this <i>one</i> accusation, I think, he must be acquitted; and I am sorry I was so forward in dispatching away my intelligence by halves.             I have seen the girl. She is really a very pretty, a very neat, and what is still a greater beauty, a very innocent young creature. He who could have ruin'd such an undesigning home-bred, must have been indeed infernally wicked. Her father is an honest simple man; intirely satisfy'd with his child, and with her new acquaintance.             I am almost afraid for your heart, when I tell you, that I find, now I have got to the bottom of this inquiry, something noble come out in this Lovelace's favour.             The girl is to be marry'd next week; and This promoted and brought about by him. He is resolv'd, her father says, to make one couple happy, and wishes he could make more so. [There's for you, my dear!] And having taken a liking also to the young fellow whom she professes to love, he has given her an hundred pounds: The grandmother actually has it in her hands, to answer to the like sum, given to the youth by one of his own relations: While Mr. Lovelace's companion, attracted by the example, has presented twenty-five guineas to the father, who is poor, towards cloaths to equip the pretty Rustic.             They were desirous, the poor man says, when they first came, of appearing beneath themselves; but now he knows the one (but mention'd it in confidence) to be Colonel Barrow, the other Capt. Sloane. The Colonel he owns, was at first, very <i>sweet upon his girl:</i> But upon her grandmother's begging of him to spare her innocence, he vow'd, that he never would offer any thing but good counsel to her; and had kept to his word: And the pretty fool acknowleged, that she never could have been better instructed by the minister himself from the <i>Bible-Book!</i>ÑThe girl, I own, pleased me so well, that I made her visit to me worth her while.             But what, my dear, will become of us now?ÑLovelace not only reform'd, but turn'd preacher!ÑWhat will become of us now?ÑWhy, my sweet friend, your <i>generosity</i> is now engaged in his favour!ÑFie, upon this <i>Generosity!</i>ÑI think in my heart, that it does as much mischief to the noble-minded, as <i>Love</i> to the ignobler.ÑWhat before was only a <i>conditional liking,</i> I am now afraid will turn to <i>liking unconditional.</i>             I could not endure to turn my invective into panegyric all at once, and so soon. We, or such as I, at least, love to keep ourselves in countenance for a rash judgment, even when we know it to be rash. Every-body has not your generosity in confessing a mistake. It requires a greatness of soul to do it. So I made still farther inquiry after his life and manners, and behaviour there, in hopes to find something bad: But all uniform!             Upon the Whole, Mr. Lovelace comes out with so much advantage from this inquiry, that were there the least room for it, I should suspect the whole to be a plot set on foot to wash a blackmoor white. Adieu, my dear.                ANNA HOWE.

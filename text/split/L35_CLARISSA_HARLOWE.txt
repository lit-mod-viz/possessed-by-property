                  Tuesday, March 21.
            HOW willingly would my dear mamma shew kindness to me, were she permitted! None of this persecution should I labour under, I am sure, if that regard were paid to her prudence and fine understanding, which they so well deserve. Whether oweing to her, or to my aunt, or to both, that a new trial was to be made upon me, I cannot tell; but this morning her Shorey deliver'd into my hand the following condescending letter.
            
			Think for me, my dearest friend, how I must be affected by this letter; the contents of it so surprisingly terrifying, yet so sweetly urged!—O why, cry'd I to myself, am I obliged to undergo this severe conflict between a command that I cannot obey, and language so condescendingly moving!—Could I have been sure of being struck dead at the altar before the ceremony had given the man I hate a title to my vows, I think I could have submitted to have been led to it. But to think of living <i>with,</i> and living <i>for,</i> a man one cannot abide, what a sad thing is that!—
            And then, how could the glare of habit and ornament be supposed any inducement to one, who has always held, that the principal view of a good wife in the adorning of her person, ought to be, to <i>preserve</i> the affection of her husband, and to <i>do credit</i> to his choice; and that she should be even <i>fearful</i> of attracting the eyes of <i>others?</i>—In this view, must not the very richness of the patterns add to my disgusts?—Great encouragement indeed, to think of adorning one's-self to be the wife of Mr. <i>Solmes!</i>—
            Upon the whole, it was not possible for me to go down upon the prescrib'd condition. Do you think it was?—And to <i>write,</i> if my letter would have been <i>read,</i> what could I write that would be admitted, and after what I had written and said to so little effect? I walked backward and forward: I threw down with disdain the patterns: Now to my closet retir'd I; then, quitting it, now threw I myself upon the Settee; now
upon this chair; now upon that; and then into one window, then into another—I knew not what to do!—And while I was in this suspense, having again taken up the letter to re-peruse it, Betty came in, reminding me, by order, That my papa and mamma waited for me in my papa's study.
            Tell my mamma, said I, that I beg the favour of seeing her here for one moment; or to permit me to attend her any where by herself.
            I listen'd at the stair's-head—You see, my dear, how it is, cry'd my father, very angrily: All your condescension (as your indulgence heretofore) is thrown away. <i>You blame your son's violence,</i> as you call it, [I had some pleasure in hearing this] but nothing else will do with her. You shall <i>not</i> see her alone. Is <i>my</i> presence an exception to the bold creature?
            Tell her, said my mamma to Betty, she knows upon what terms she may come down to us. Nor will I see her upon any other.
            The maid brought me this answer. I had recourse to my pen and ink; but I trembled so, that I could not write, nor knew I what to say had I had steadier fingers. At last Betty brought me these lines from my papa.

			If this resolution be adhered to, then will my papa never see me more!—For I will never be That Solmes's wife—I will die first!—

                        Friday, April 21.                   IT was expected you would send again to me, or to my aunt Hervey. The inclosed has lain ready for you therefore by direction. You will have no answer from any-body, write to <i>whom</i> you will, and as <i>often</i> as you will, and <i>what</i> you <i>will.</i>                   It was designed to bring you back by proper authority, or to send you whither the disgraces you have brought upon us all, should be in the likeliest way, after a while, to be forgotten. But I believe that design is over: So you may <i>range</i> securely: Nobody will think it worth while to give themselves any trouble about you. Yet my mamma has obtained leave to send you your cloaths, of all sorts: But your cloaths. This is a favour you'll see by the within letter not <i>design</i>'d you: And <i>now</i> not granted for <i>your</i> sake, but because my poor mother cannot bear in my poor mother sight any thing you used to wear. Read the inclosed, and tremble.                      ARABELLA HARLOWE.

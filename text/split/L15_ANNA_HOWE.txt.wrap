<i>Tuesday, June</i> 20?                       My dearest Miss Harlowe,                                               AGain I venture to write to you (almost against inclination; and that by your former conveyance, little a I like it.                      I know not how it is with you. It may be bad; an then it would be hard to upbraid you, for a silence yo may not be able to help. But if not, what shall I say severe enough, that you have not answered either of m last letters? The first of which (and I think it imported you too much to be silent upon it) you owned th receipt of. The other, which was delivered into yo own hands, was so pressing for the favour of a  from you, that I am amazed I could not be obliged. And still <i>more,</i> that I have not heard from you since.                      The fellow made so strange a story of the condition  saw you in, and of your speech to him, that I know t what to conclude from it: Only, that he is a simple, bldering, and yet conceited fellow, who aiming at descrtion, and the rustic wonderful, gives an air of bumki romance to all he tells. That this is his character, y will believe, when you are informed, that he describ                            you in grief excessive, yet so improved in your person and features, and so <i>rosy,</i> that was his word, in your face, and so flush-colour'd, and so plump in your arms, that one would conclude you were labouring under the operation of some malignant poison; and so much the rather, as he was introduced to you, when you were upon a couch, from which you offer'd not to rise, or sit up.                      Upon my word, Miss Harlowe, I am greatly distressed upon your account; for I must be so free as to say, that, in your ready return with your deceiver, you have not at all answer'd my expectations, nor acted up to your own character: For Mrs. Townsend tells me, from the women at Hamstead, how chearfully you put yourself into his hands again: Yet, at the time, it was impossible you should be married!                      Lord, my dear, what pity it is, that you took so much pains to get from the man! But you know best!ÑSometimes I think it could not be <i>you</i> to whom the rustic deliver'd my letter. But it must too: Yet it is strange I could not have one line by him:ÑNot one:ÑAnd you so soon well enough to go with him back again!                      I am not sure, that the letter I am now writing will come to your hands: So shall not say half that I have upon my mind to say. But if you think it <i>worth your while</i> to write to me, pray let me know, what fine ladies, his relations, those were, who visited you at Hamstead, and carried you back again so joyfully, to a place that I had so fully warn'd you Ñ But I will say no more: At least till I <i>know</i> more: For I can do nothing but wonder, and stand amazed!                      Notwithstanding all the man's baseness, 'tis plain, there was more than a lurking loveÑGood God!ÑBut I have done!ÑYet I know not how to have done, neither!Ñ Yet I mustÑI <i>will.</i>                                            Only account to me, my dear, for what I cannot at all account for: And inform me, whether you are really married, or not.ÑAnd then I shall know, Whether there <i>must,</i> or must <i>not,</i> be a period shorter than that of one of our lives, to a friendship which has hitherto been the pride and boast of                                               Your <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

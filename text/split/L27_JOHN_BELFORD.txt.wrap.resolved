                     <i>Tuesday, July</i> 18. <i>Afternoon.</i>             I Renewed my inquiries after the lady's health, in the morning, by my servant: And, as soon as I had dined, I went my servant.             I had but a poor account of             : Yet sent up my compliments.              returned me thanks for all my good offices; and              excuses, that all my good offices could not be <i>personal</i> just then, being very low and faint: But if I gave my servant the trouble of coming about six this evening,              should be able,              hoped, to drink a dish of tea with my servant, and would then thank me             .             I am very proud of this condescension; and think it looks not amiss for             , as I am your <i>avowed</i> friend. Methinks I want fully to remove from              mind all doubts of you in this last villainous action: And who knows then, what your noble relations may be able to do for you with             , if you hold your mind? For your servant acquainted me with their having actually engaged Miss Howe in their and your favour, before this cursed affair happened. And I desire the particulars of all from you, that I may the better know how to serve you.                          has two handsome apartments, a bedchamber and dining-room, with light closets in each.              has already a nurse (the people of the house having but one maid); a woman whose care, diligence, and honesty, Mrs. Smith highly commends.              has likewise the benefit of the voluntary attendance, and <i>love,</i> as it seems, of a widow gentlewoman, Mrs. Lovick              name, who lodges over              apartment, and of whom              seems very fond, having found something in             ,              thinks, resembling the qualities of              worthy Mrs. Norton.                  About seven o' clock this morning, it seems, the lady was so ill, that the lady yielded to their desires to have an apothecary sent forÑNot the fellow, thou mayst believe, the lady had had before at Rowland's; but one Mr. Goddard, a man of skill and eminence; and of conscience too; demonstrated as well by general character, as by general character prescriptions to the lady: For, pronouncing the lady case to be grief, general character ordered, for the present, only innocent julaps, by way of cordial; and, as soon as the lady stomach should be able to bear it, light kitchen-diet; telling Mrs. Lovick, that That, with air, moderate exercise, and chearful company, would do the lady more good, than all the medicines in general character shop.             This has given me, as, it seems, This has the lady (who also praises general character modest behaviour, paternal looks, and genteel address), a very good opinion of the man; and I design to make myself acquainted with the man; and, if the man advises to call in a doctor, to wish the man, for the fair patient's sake, more than the physician's (who wants not practice), my worthy friend Dr. H.Ñwhose character is above all exception, as the physician's (who wants not practice), my worthy friend Dr. H.Ñwhose character humanity, I am sure, will distinguish the physician's (who wants not practice), my worthy friend Dr. H.Ñwhose character to the lady.             Mrs. Lovick gratified me with an account of a letter Mrs. Lovick had written from the lady's mouth to Miss Howe; Mrs. Lovick being unable to write Mrs. Lovick with steadiness. It was to this effect; in answer, it seems, to Mrs. Lovick two letters, whatever were the contents of her two letters:                That Mrs. Lovick had been involved in a dreadful calamity, which Mrs. Lovick was sure, when known, would exempt Mrs. Lovick from the effects of Mrs. Lovick friendly displeasure, for not answering Mrs. Lovick first; having been put under an arrest:Ñ Could Ñ have believed Ñ? Ñ That Ñ was released but the day before: And was now so weak, and so low, that Ñ was obliged to get a widow gentlewoman in the same house to account thus for Ñ silence to Ñ two letters of the 13th and 16th: That Ñ would, as soon as able, answer able: Begged of Ñ, mean time, not to be uneasy for Ñ; since (only that this was a calamity which came upon Ñ when Ñ was far from being well; a load laid upon the shoulders of a poor wretch, ready before to sink under too heavy a burden) it was nothing to the evil Ñ had before suffered: And one felicity seemed likely to issue from it; which was, that Ñ should be at rest, in an honest house, with considerate and kind-hearted people; having assurance given Ñ, that Ñ should not be molested by the wretch, whom it would be death for Ñ to see: So that now Ñ (Miss Howe) needed not to send to Ñ by private and expensive conveyances: Nor need Collins to take precautions for fear of being dogged to Ñ lodgings; nor Ñ to write by a fictitious name to Ñ, but by Ñ own."             You see I am in a way to oblige you: You see how much Ñ depends upon my engaging for your forbearing to intrude yourself into Ñ company: Let not your flaming impatience destroy all; and make me look like a villain to a lady who has reason to suspect <i>every man Ñ sees</i> to be so. Ñ Upon this condition, you may expect all the services that can flow from true friendship, and from                Your sincere Wellwisher, <i>JOHN BELFORD.</i>

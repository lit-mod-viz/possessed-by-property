<i>Friday, Sept.</i> 1.                   HOW astonishing, in the midst of such affecting scenes, is thy mirth on what thou callest my <i>own aspirations!</i> Never, surely, was there such another man in this world, thy talents and thy levity taken together!ÑSurely, what I shall send thee with this will affect thee. If not, nothing can, till <i>thy own hour</i> come:ÑAnd heavy will then thy reflections be!                   I am glad, however, that thou enablest me to assure the lady, that thou wilt no more molest the lady; that is to say, in other words, That, after having ruined the lady fortunes, and all the lady worldly prospects, thou wilt be so gracious, as to let the lady lie down and die in peace.                   Thy giving up to poor Belton's sister the little legacy, and Thy undertaking to make Mowbray and Tourville follow thy example, is, I must say to thy honour, of a piece with thy generosity to thy Rose-bud and her Johnny; and to a number of other good actions, in pecuniary matters; altho' thy Rose-bud's is, I believe, the only instance where a pretty woman was concerned, of such a disinterested bounty.                        Upon my faith, Lovelace, I love to praise thee; and often and often, as thou knowest, have I <i>studied</i> for occasions to do it: Insomuch that when for the life of me I could not think of any-thing done by thee that deserved it, I have taken pains to applaud the not ungraceful manner in which thou hast performed actions that merited the gallows.                   Now thou art so near, I will dispatch my servant to thee, if occasion requires. But, I fear, I shall soon give thee the news thou apprehendest. For I am just now sent for by Mrs. Smith; who has ordered the messenger to tell me, that she knew not if the lady will be alive when I come.

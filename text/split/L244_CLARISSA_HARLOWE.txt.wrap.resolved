TREATED, as I am treated, and, in a great measure, if not <i>wholly,</i> by your instigations, brother, you must permit me to expostulate with brother upon the occasion. It is not my <i>intention</i> to displease you in what I am going to write: And yet I must deal freely with brother: the occasion calls for the occasion.                        And permit me, in the first place, to remind you, That I am your <i>sister</i>; and not your <i>servant</i>; and that, therefore, the bitter revilings and passionate language brought me from brother, upon an occasion, in which you have no reason to prescribe to Sir, are neither worthy of my character to bear, or of brother to offer.                   Put the case, that I <i>were</i> to marry the man you dislike, and that he were <i>not</i> to make a polite or tender husband, Is that a reason for you to be an unpolite and disobliging brother?ÑWhy must <i>you,</i> Sir, anticipate my misfortunes, were such a case to happen?ÑLet me tell you plainly, that the husband who could treat me, as a <i>wife,</i> worse than you, of late, have treated me as a <i>sister,</i> must be a barbarous man indeed.                   Ask you, I pray you, Sir, If you would thus have treated your sister Bella, had your sister Bella thought fit to receive the addresses of the man so much hated by you?ÑIf not, let me caution you, my brother, not to take your measures by what you think <i>will be</i> borne, but rather by what <i>ought</i> to be offer'd.                   How would <i>you</i> take it, if you had a brother, who, in a like case, were to act by <i>you,</i> as you do by <i>me?</i> You cannot but remember what a laconic answer you gave even to my papa, who recommended to you Miss Nelly D'Oily:Ñ<i>You did not like her,</i> were your words: And that was thought sufficient.                   You must needs think, that I cannot but know to <i>whom</i> to attribute my disgraces, when I recollect my papa's indulgence to me, in permitting me to decline several offers; and to <i>whom,</i> that a common cause is endeavoured to be made, in favour of a man whose person and manners are more exceptionable, than those of any of the gentlemen I have been permitted to refuse.                   I offer not to compare the two men together: Nor is there, indeed, the least comparison to be made between the two men. All the difference to the one's disadvantage, if I did, is but in one pointÑOf the greatest importance, indeedÑBut to whom of <i>most</i> importance?ÑTo <i>myself,</i> surely, were I to encourage his application:ÑOf the least to <i>you.</i> Nevertheless, if you do not, by your strange policies, unite <i>that man</i> and <i>me</i> as joint-sufferers in one cause, you shall find me as much resolv'd to renounce his, as I am to refuse the other. I have made an overture to this purpose: I hope you will not give me reason to confirm my apprehensions, that it will be owing to <i>you,</i> if it be not accepted.                   it is a sad thing, to have it to say, without being conscious of ever having given you cause of offence, that I have in <i>you</i> a <i>brother,</i> but not a <i>friend.</i>                   Perhaps you will not condescend to enter into the reasons of your late conduct with a foolish sister: But, if <i>politeness,</i> if <i>civility,</i> be not due to that character, and to my sex, <i>justice</i> is.                   Let me take the liberty further to observe, that the principal end of a young gentleman's education at the university, is, to learn that character to reason justly, and to subdue the violence of that character passions: I hope, brother, that you will not give room for any-body who knows us both, to conclude, that the oilette has learned the one more of the latter doctrine, than the university has taught the other. I am truly sorry to have cause to say, that I have heard it often remarked, that your uncontrouled passions are not a credit to your liberal education.                   I hope, Sir, that you will excuse the freedom I have taken with you: You have given me too much reason for it, and you have taken much greater with Sir, <i>without</i> reason;Ñso, if you are offended, ought to look at the cause, and not at the effect:ÑThen examining yourself, the cause will cease, and there will not be any-where a more accomplish'd gentleman than my brother.                   Sisterly affection, I do assure you, Sir (unkindly, as you have used <i>me</i>), and not the pertness which of late you have been so apt to impute to Sir, is my motive in this hint. Let me invoke your returning kindness, my <i>only brother!</i> And give me cause, I beseech you, to call you my <i>compassionating friend.</i> For I am, and ever will be,                      Your affectionate sister, CL. HARLOWE.

                  Wednesday, April 12.             I WILL pursue my melancholy story.             Being thus hurried to the chariot, it would have been to no purpose to have refused entering into it, had              not, in my fright, lifted me in, as              did: And it instantly drove away a full gallop, and stopt not till it brought us to St. Albans; which was just as the day shut in.             I thought I should have fainted several times by the way. With lifted-up hands and eyes, God protect me, said I often to myself!ÑCan it be I, that am here!ÑMy eyes running over, and my heart ready to burst with sighs as involuntary as my flight.             How different, how inexpressibly different, the gay wretch; visibly triumphing (as I could not but construe his almost rapturous joy) in the success of his arts! But overflowing with complimental flourishes, yet respectfully distant his address, all the way we <i>flew</i>; for that, rather than <i>galloping,</i> was the motion of the horses; which took, as I believe, a round-about way, to prevent being traced.             I have reason to think, there were other horsemen at his devotion; three or four different persons, above the rank of servants, galloping by us, now-and-then, on each side of the chariot: But his took no notice of them; and I had too much grief, mingled with indignation, notwithstanding all his blandishments, to ask any questions about them, or any thing else.             Think, my dear, what were my thoughts, on alighting from the chariot; having no attendant of my own sex; no cloaths but what I had on, and those little suited for such a journey as I had <i>already</i> taken, and was still <i>further</i> to take: Neither hood nor hat, nor any thing but a handkerchief about my neck and shoulders: Fatigued to death: My mind still more fatigued than my body: And in such a foam the horses, that every one in the inn we put up at guess'd (they could not do otherwise) that I was a young giddy creature, who had run away from her friends. This it was easy to see, by they whispering and gaping; more of the people of the house also coming in to view us, as the house were, by turns, than was necessary for the attendance.             The gentlewoman of the inn, whom              sent in to me, shewed me another apartment; and, seeing me ready to faint, brought me hartshorn and water; and then, upon my desiring to be left alone for half an hour, retired: For I found my heart ready to burst, on revolving every thing in my thoughts; And the moment she was gone, fastening the door, I threw me into an old great chair, and gave way to a violent flood of tears; which a little relieved me.             Mr. Lovelace, sooner than I wished, sent up the gentlewoman, who pressed me, in Mr. Lovelace name, to admit my Brother, or to come down to Mr. Lovelace: For Mr. Lovelace had told she, I was Mr. Lovelace Sister; and that Mr. Lovelace had brought me, against my will, and without warning, from a friend's house, where I had been all the winter, in order to prevent my marrying against the consent of my friends; to whom Mr. Lovelace was now conducting me; and that, having given me no time for a travelling-dress, I was greatly offended at Mr. Lovelace.             So, my dear, your frank, your open-hearted friend, was forced to countenance this tale; which, indeed, suited me the better, because I was unable, for some time, to talk, speak, or look up; and so my dejection, and grief, and silence, might very well pass before the gentlewoman and her niece who attended me, as a fit of sullenness.             The room I was in being a bed-chamber, I chose to go down, at The room I was in being a bed-chamber repeated message, attended by the gentlewoman of the inn, to that in which The room I was in being a bed-chamber was. The room I was in being a bed-chamber approached me with great respect, yet not exceeding a brotherly politeness, where a brother <i>is</i> polite; and, calling me The room I was in being a bed-chamber dearest sister, asked after the state of my mind; and hoped I would forgive The room I was in being a bed-chamber; for never brother half so well loved a sister, as The room I was in being a bed-chamber me.             A wretch!ÑHow naturally did The room I was in being a bed-chamber fall into the character, altho' I was so much out of mine!             Unthinking creatures have some comfort in the shortness of Unthinking creatures views; in Unthinking creatures unapprehensiveness; and that Unthinking creatures penetrate not beyond the present moment: In short, that they <i>are</i> unthinking!ÑBut, for a person of my thoughtful disposition, who has been accustomed to look forward, as well to the <i>possible,</i> as to the <i>probable,</i> what comfort can I have in my reflections?             But let me give you the particulars of our conversation, a little before and after our supper-time, joining both in one.             When our were alone,              besought me [I cannot say but with all the tokens of a passionate and respectful tenderness] to be better reconciled to myself, and to             :              repeated all the vows of honour, and inviolable affection, that              ever made me:              promised to be wholly governed by myself in every future step:              asked me to give              leave to propose, Whether I chose to set out next day to either of              aunts?             I was silent. I knew not what to say, nor what to do.             Whether I chose to have private lodgings procured me, in either of those ladies neighbourhood, as were once my thoughts?             I was still silent.             Whether I chose to go to either of Lord M.'s seats; that of Berks, or that in the county we were in?             In lodgings, I said, any-where, where he was not to be.                  he had promised This, he own'd; and he would religiously keep to he word, as soon as he found all danger of pursuit over; and that I was settled to my mind.ÑBut, if the place were indifferent to me, London was the safest, and the most private: And he relations should all visit me there, the moment I thought fit to admit them. he cousin Charlotte, particularly, should attend me, as my companion, if I would accept of my companion, as soon as my companion was able to go abroad.ÑMean time, would I go to ÑMean aunt Lawrance's (his aunt Lawrance was a melancholy woman)? I should be the most welcome guest his aunt Lawrance ever received.             I told             , I wished not to go (immediately, however, and in the frame I was in, and likely not to be out of) to any of              relations: That my reputation was concerned, to have <i>him</i> absent from me:ÑThat, if I were in some private lodging (the meaner the less to be suspected, as ÑThat would be known, that I went away by ÑThat means; and ÑThat would be supposed to have provided me handsome accommodations), it would be most suitable both to my mind and my situation: That this might be best, I should think, in the country for <i>me</i>; in town for <i>him.</i>ÑAnd no matter how soon ÑAnd was known to be there.             If ÑAnd might deliver ÑAnd opinion, ÑAnd said, since I declined going to any of ÑAnd relations, London was the only place in the world to be private in. Every new-comer in a country-town or village excited a curiosity: A person of my figure (and many compliments ÑAnd made me) would excite more. Even messages and letters, where none used to be brought, would occasion inquiry. ÑAnd had not provided a lodging anywhere, supposing I would choose to go either to London, where accommodations of that sort might be fixed upon in an hour's time; or to ÑAnd aunt's; or to Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat, where was house-keeper an excellent woman, Mrs. Greme, such another as my Norton.                  To be sure, I said, if I were pursued, it would be in I were pursued first passion; and some one of his relations houses would be the place I were pursued would expect to find me at.ÑI knew not what to do!             My pleasure should determine ÑI, ÑI said, be it what it would. Only that I were safe, was all ÑI was solicitous about. ÑI had lodgings in town; but ÑI did not offer to propose lodgings in town. ÑI knew, I would have more objection to go to lodgings in town, than I could have to go to Lord M.'s, or to Lord M. aunt's.Ñ             No doubt of it, I reply'd, with an indignation in my manner, that made him run over with professions, that him was far from proposing them, or wishing for my acceptance of them. And again him repeated, That my honour and safety were all him was solicitous about; assuring me, that my will should be a law to him, in every particular.             I was too peevish, and too much afflicted, and, indeed, too much incensed against him, to take well any thing him said.             I thought him, I said, extremely unhappy. I knew not what to determine upon: My reputation now, no doubt, utterly ruin'd: Destitute of cloaths, fit to be seen by any-body: My very indigence, as I might call it, proclaiming my folly to every one who saw me: who would suppose, that I had been taken at advantage, or had given an undue one; and had no power over either my will, or my actions: That I could not but think I had been dealt artfully with: That he had seem'd to have taken, what he might suppose, the just measure of my weakness, founded on my youth and inexperience: That I could not forgive myself for meeting he: That my heart bled for the distresses of my father and mother, on this occasion: That I would give the world, and all my hopes in the world, to have been still in my father's house, whatever had been my usage: That, let he protest and vow what he would, I saw something low and selfish in he love, that he could study to put a young creature upon making such a sacrifice of her duty and conscience: When a person actuated by a generous love, must seek to oblige the object of it, in every thing essential to her honour, and to her peace of mind.             he was very attentive to all I said; never offering to interrupt me once. he answer to every article, almost methodically, shew'd he memory.             What I had said, he told me, had made he very grave: And he would answer accordingly.             he was grieved at he heart, that he had so little share in my favour or confidence, as he had the mortification to find, by what I had said, he had.             As to my <i>reputation,</i> he must be very sincere with me: That could not suffer half so much by the step I so much regretted to have taken, as by the confinement, and equally foolish and unjust treatment, I had met with from my relations: That every mouth was full of blame of them, of my brother and sister particularly; and of wonder at my patience: That he must repeat, what he had written to me, he believed, more than once. That my friends themselves expected, that I should take a proper opportunity to free me from my friends themselves persecutions; why else did my friends themselves confine me? That my exalted character would still bear me out, with those who knew <i>me</i>; who knew my <i>brother</i>'s and <i>sister</i>'s motives; and who knew the wretch my friends themselves were for compelling me to have.             With regard to <i>cloaths</i>; Who, as matters were circumstanced, could expect, that I should be able to bring away any others, than those I had on at the time? For <i>present</i> use or wear, all the Ladies of his family would take a pride to supply me: For <i>future,</i> the product of the best looms, not only in England, but throughout the world, were at my command.                  If I wanted <i>money,</i> as no doubt I must, his should be proud to supply me: Would to God, his might presume to hope, there were but one interest between us!Ñ             And then his would fain have had me to accept of 100 <i>l.</i> bank note; which, unawares to me, his put into my hand: But which, you may be sure, I refused with warmth.             his was inexpressibly grieved and surprised, his said, to hear me say, his had acted <i>artfully</i> by his. his came provided, according to my <i>confirm'd</i> appointment [A wretch! to upbraid me thus!], to redeem me from my persecutors; and little expected a change of sentiment, and that his should have so much difficulty to prevail upon me, as his had met with: That perhaps I might think his offer to go <i>into the garden with me,</i> and to face my assembled relations, was a piece of <i>art</i> only: But that if I did, I wronged his: For, to this hour, seeing my excessive uneasiness, his wish'd with all his soul, his had been permitted to accompany me in. It was always his maxim to brave a threatened dangerÑThreateners, where they have an opportunity to put in force they threats, were seldom to be feared.ÑBut had ÑBut been assured of a private stab, or of as many death's wounds, as there were persons in my family (made desperate as ÑBut should have been by my return), ÑBut would have attended me into my father's house.             So, my dear, what I have to do, is to hold myself inexcusable for meeting such a determined and audacious spirit; that's all!ÑI have hardly any question now, that ÑBut would have contrived some way or other to have got me away, had I met ÑBut at a midnight hour, as once or twice I had thoughts to do.ÑAnd that would have been more terrible still!             ÑAnd concluded this part of ÑAnd talk, with saying, That ÑAnd doubted not, but that, had ÑAnd attended me in, ÑAnd should have come off, in every-one's opinion, so well, that ÑAnd should have had general leave to renew ÑAnd visits.                  ÑAnd went on:ÑHe must be so bold as to tell me, ÑAnd said, that ÑAnd should have paid a visit of this kind, but indeed accompany'd by several of ÑAnd trusty friends, had I <i>not</i> met himÑAnd that very afternoon tooÑfor ÑAnd could not tamely let the dreadful Wednesday come, without some effort to change he could not tamely let the dreadful Wednesday come determinations.             What, my dear, was to be done with such a man!             That therefore, for my sake, as well as for such a man own, such a man had reason to wish a disease so desperate had been attempted to be overcome by as desperate a remedy. We all know, said such a man, that great ends are sometimes brought about by the very means by which they are endeavour'd to be frustrated.             My present situation, I am sure, thought I, affords a sad evidence of this truth!             I was silent all this time. My blame was indeed turned inward. Sometimes, too, I was half-frighted at his audaciousness: At others, had the less inclination to interrupt his, being excessively fatigued, and my spirits sunk to nothing, with the view even of the best prospects with such a creature.             This gave his opportunity to proceed; And that his did; assuming a still more serious air.             As to what further remained for his to say, in answer to what I had said, his hoped I would pardon his; but, upon his soul, his was concerned, infinitely concerned, his repeated, his colour and his voice rising, that his colour was <i>necessary</i> for his to observe, how much I chose rather to have run the risque of being Solmes's wife, than to have it in my power to reward a man, who, I must forgive his, had been as much insulted on <i>my</i> account, as <i>I</i> had been on <i>his</i>Ñwho had watched my commands, and (pardon me, madam) every <i>changeable</i> motion of your pen, all hours, in all weathers, and with a chearfulness and ardor, that nothing but the most faithful and obsequious passion could inspire.Ñ                  I now, Miss, began to revive into a little more warmth of attention.Ñ             And all, madam, for what? [How I stared!]Ñ<i>Only</i> to prevail upon you to free you from ungenerous and base oppressionÑ             Sir! indignantly said IÑ             Hear me but out, dearest madam!ÑMy heart is fullÑI <i>must</i> speak what I have to sayÑTo be told [for your words are yet in my ears, and at my heart!], that you would give the world, <i>and all your hopes in it,</i> to have been still in your cruel and gloomy father's houseÑ             Not a word, Sir, against my papa!ÑI will not bear thatÑ                <i>Whatever had been your usage:</i>ÑAnd you have a credulity, madam, against all probability, if you believe you should have avoided being Solmes's wife: That I have put you upon <i>sacrificing your duty and conscience</i>ÑYet, dearest creature! see you not the contradiction that your warmth of temper has surprized you into, when the reluctance you shewed to the last to leave your persecutors, has cleared your conscience from the least reproach of this sort.Ñ             O Sir! Sir! are you so critical then? Are you so light in your anger, as to dwell upon words!Ñ             And indeed, my dear, I have since thought, that your anger was not owing to that sudden <i>impetus,</i> which cannot be easily bridled; but rather, was a sort of <i>manageable</i> anger, let loose to intimidate me.             Forgive me, madamÑI have just done.ÑHave I not, in your own opinion, hazarded my life to redeem you from oppression?ÑYet is not my reward, after all, precarious?ÑFor, madam, have you not condition'd with me [and most sacredly, hard as the condition is, will I observe the condition], that all my hope must be remote: That you are determined to have the condition in your power to favour or reject me totally, as you please?Ñ                  See, my dear! In every respect my condition changed for the worse! Is it in my power to take your advice, if I should think it ever so right to take it?Ñ             And have you not furthermore declared, proceeded it?Ñ             , that you will engage to renounce me for ever, if your friends insist upon that cruel renunciation, as the terms of being reconciled to you?             But, nevertheless, madam, all the merit of having saved you from an odious compulsion, shall be mine. I glory in it, tho' I were to lose you for everÑAs I see I am but too likely to do, from your present displeasure; and especially, if your friends insist upon the terms you are ready to comply with.             That you are <i>your own mistress,</i> thro' <i>my</i> means, is, I repeat, my boast.ÑAs such, I humbly implore your favourÑAnd that only upon the conditions I have yielded to hope for it.ÑAs I do now <i>thus humbly</i> [the proud wretch falling on one knee] your forgiveness, for so long detaining your ear, and for all the plain-dealing that my undesigning heart would not be denied to utter by my lips.             O Sir, pray rise!ÑLet the <i>obliged</i> kneel, if one of us must kneel!ÑBut, nevertheless, proceed not in this strain, I <i>beseech</i> you. You have had a great <i>deal</i> of trouble about me: But had you let me know in time, that you expected to be rewarded for it at the price of my duty, I should have spared you much of it.             Far be it from me, Sir, to depreciate merit so <i>extraordinary.</i> But let me say, that had it not been for the forbidden correspondence I was teazed by Sir into [and which I had not continued (every letter for many letters, intended to be the last), but because I thought you a sufferer from my friends], I had not been either confined or maltreated: Nor would my brother's low-meant violence have had a foundation to work upon.                  I am far from thinking my case would have been so very desperate as you imagine, had I stay'd. My father loved me at bottom: My father would not see me before; and I wanted only to <i>see</i> him, and to be <i>heard</i>; and a delay of My father sentence was the least thing I expected from the trial I was to stand.             You are boasting of your merits, Sir; let merit <i>be</i> your boast: Nothing else can attract me. If <i>personal</i> considerations had principal weight with me, either in Solmes's disfavour, or in your favour, I should despise <i>myself:</i> If you value yourself upon them, in preference to the person of the poor Solmes, I shall despise <i>you!</i>             You may glory in your fancied merits, in getting me away: But the cause of <i>your</i> glory, I tell you plainly, is <i>my</i> shame.             Make to yourself a title to my regard, which I can better approve of; or else you will not have so much merit with <i>me,</i> as you have with <i>yourself.</i>             But here, like the first pair, I, at least, driven out of my paradise, are we recriminating. No more shall you need to tell me of your <i>sufferings,</i> and your <i>merits!</i>Ñyour <i>All hours,</i> and <i>All weathers!</i> For I will bear them in memory, as long as I live; and, if it be impossible for me to <i>reward</i> them, be ever ready to <i>own</i> the obligation. All that I desire of you, now, is, to leave it to me to seek for some private abode: To take the chariot with you to London, or elsewhere: And, if I have any further occasion for your assistance and protection, I will signify the chariot to you, and be still <i>further</i> obliged to you.             You are warm, my dearest life!ÑBut indeed there is no occasion for the chariot. Had I any views unworthy of my faithful love for you, I should not have been so honest in my declarations.             Then              began again to vow the sincerity of              intentions.                 , if you intend to leave me; or if I have only escaped from one confinement to another?Ñ                <i>Cheated hither, as far as you know,</i> madam! Let you <i>know</i> (and with that air too, charming though grievous to my heart!) <i>if you have only escaped from one confinement to another!</i>ÑAmazing! perfectly amazing!ÑAnd can there be a necessity for me to answer this?ÑYou are absolutely your own mistress.ÑIt were very strange, if you were not. The moment you are in a place of safety, I will leave you.ÑOne condition only, give me leave to beg your consent to: It is this: That you will be pleased, now you are so intirely in your own power, to renew a promise <i>voluntarily</i> made before; <i>voluntarily,</i> or I would not <i>now</i> presume to request it; for altho' I would not be though capable of growing upon concession, yet I cannot bea to think of losing the ground your goodness had given me room to hope I had gained; "That, make up how you please with your relations, you will neve marry any other man, while I am living and single unless I should be so wicked as to give new caus for high displeasure."             I hesitate not to confirm this promise, Sir, upon your <i>own</i> condition. In what manner do you expec me to confirm it?Ñ                  Only, Madam, by your word.             Then I never will.                          had the assurance [I was now in              power] to salute me, as a sealing of my promise, as              called it.              motion was so sudden, that I was not aware of His motion. His motion would have looked affected to be very angry; yet I could not be pleased, considering this as a leading freedom, from a spirit so audacious and incroaching; and              might see, that I was not.                          passed all that by with an air peculiar to himselfÑEnough! enough, dearest madam!ÑAnd let me beg of you but to conquer this dreadful uneasiness, which gives me to apprehend but too-too much for my jealous love to bear: And it shall be my whole endeavour to deserve your favour, and to make you the happiest woman in the world; as I shall be the happiest of men.             I broke from              to write to you my preceding letter; but refused to send my preceding letter by              servant, as I told you. The gentlewoman of the inn help'd me to a messenger, who was to carry what you should give his servant to Lord M.'s seat in Hertfordshire, directed for Mrs. Greme the housekeeper there. And early in the morning, for fear of pursuit, we were to set out that way: And there his servant proposed to exchange the chariot-and-six for a chaise-and-pair of his servant own, which happened to be at Lord M.'s seat in Hertfordshire, as Lord M.'s seat in Hertfordshire would be a less-noticed conveyance.             I looked over my little stock of money; and found my little stock of money to be no more than seven guineas and some silver: The rest of my stock was but fifty guineas, and that five more than I thought it was, when my sister chal                enged me as to the sum I had by me: And those I left in my escritoire, little thinking to be prevailed upon to go away with my escritoire.             Indeed my case abounds with a shocking variety of indelicate circumstances. Among the rest, I was forced to account to <i>him,</i> who knew I could have no cloaths but what I had on, how I came to have linen with you [for he could not but know I sent for it]; lest he should imagine I had an early design to go away with he, and made that a part of the preparation.             he most heartily wished, he said, for my mind's sake, that your mamma would have afforded me your mamma protection; and delivered he, upon this subject, with equal freedom and concern.             There are, my dear Miss Howe, a multitude of punctilios and decorums, which a young creature must dispense with, who, in such a situation, makes a man the intimate attendant of her person. I could now, I think, give twenty reasons stronger than any I have heretofore mentioned, why women of the least delicacy should never think of incurring the danger and disgrace of taking the step I have been drawn in to take, but with horror and aversion; and why women of the least delicacy should look upon the man who shall tempt women of the least delicacy to it, as the vilest and most selfish of seducers.             BEFORE five o'clock (Tuesday morning) his servant came up to tell me, my <i>brother</i> was ready, and that breakfast also waited for his servant in the parlour. I went down with a heart as heavy as my eyes, and received great acknowlegements and compliments from his servant on being so soon dress'd, and ready, as his servant interpreted it, to continue our journey.             his servant had the thought which I had not [For what had I to do with thinking, who had it not, when I stood most in need of it?], to purchase for me a velve hood, and a handsome short cloak, trimm'd with silver, without saying any thing to me. his servant must reward his servant, the artful incroacher said, before th landlady and the artful incroacher maids and niece, for his servant forethought and would salute his servant pretty sullen sister!ÑHe too his servant reward; and, as his servant said, a tear with it. While his servant assured me [still before them, a vile wretch!], that I had nothing to fear from meeting with parents, who so dearly loved me.ÑHow could I be complaisant, my dear, to such a man as this?Ñ             As soon as the chariot drove on, such a man as this?Ñ              asked me, whether I had any objection to go to Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat? Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat Lordship, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat said, was at Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat Berkshire one.             I told Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat, I chose not to go, as yet, to any of Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat relations; for that would indicate a plain defiance to my ownÑMy choice was, to go to a private lodging, and for Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat to be at a distance from Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat; at least, till I heard how things were taken by Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat friendsÑFor that altho' I had but little hopes of a reconciliation, as it <i>was</i>; yet if they knew I was in Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat protection, or in that of any of Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat friends (which would be looked upon as the same thing), there would not be room for any at all.             I should govern Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat as I pleased, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat solemnly assured me, in every thing. But Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat still thought London was the best place for Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat; and if I were once safe there, and in a lodging to my liking, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat would go to M. Hall. But, as I approved not of London, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat would urge I approved not of London no further.             Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat proposed, and I consented, to put up at an inn in the neighbourhood of <i>The Lawn</i> (as Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat called Lord M. seat in this county), since I chose not to go thither. And here I got two hours to myself; which I told Lord M. I should pass in writing another letter to Lord M. [meaning my narrative, which I had begun at St. Albans, fatigued as I was], and in one to my sister, to apprize the family (whether the family were solitous about it or not), that I was well; and to beg that my cloaths, some particular books, and the fifty guineas I had left in my escritoire, might be sent me.                          asked, If I had considered whither to have the family directed?                  Indeed not I, I told             , I was a stranger toÑ             So was             ,              interrupted me; but it struck              by chanceÑ[Wicked story-teller!]             But, added             , I will tell you, madam, how it shall be managedÑIf you don't choose to go to London, it is, nevertheless, best, that your relations should <i>think</i> you there; for then they will absolutely despair of finding you. If you write, be pleased to direct, To be left for you, at Mr. Osgood's, near Soho-square; who is a man of reputation, and they will go very safe And this will effectually amuse they.                <i>Amuse them,</i> my dear!ÑAmuse whom?ÑMy father!Ñmy uncles!ÑBut it must be so!ÑAll so!ÑAll expedients ready, you see!Ñ             I had no objection to this: And I have written accordingly. But what answer I shall have, or whether any, that is what gives me no small anxiety.             This, however, is one consolation, that, if I have an answer, and altho' my brother should be the writer, it cannot be more severe than the treatment I have of late received from my brother and my sister.             Mr. Lovelace staid out about an hour and half; and then came in; impatiently sending up to Mr. Lovelace no less than four times, to express Mr. Lovelace desire of my company. But I sent Mr. Lovelace word as often, that I was busy; and, at last, that I should be so, till dinner was ready. So Mr. Lovelace hasten'd that, as I heard Mr. Lovelace now-and-then, with a hearty curse upon the cook and waiters.             This is another of Mr. Lovelace perfections. I ventured afterwards to check Mr. Lovelace for Mr. Lovelace free words, as we sa at dinner.             Having heard Mr. Lovelace swear at Mr. Lovelace servant, when below whom, nevertheless, Mr. Lovelace owns to be a good one; It is a sad life, said I, these innkeepers live, Mr. Lovelace.             No; pretty well, I believe.ÑBut why, madam think you, that fellows, who eat and drink at othe mens cost, or they are sorry whelps of innkeepers, should be intitled to pity?             Because of the soldiers the soldiers are obliged to quarter; who are generally, I believe, wretched profligates. Bless me! said I, how I heard one of the soldiers swear and curse, just now, at a modest meek man, as I judge by a modest meek man low voice, and gentle answers!ÑWell do the soldiers make gentle answers!ÑWell a proverbÑ<i>Like a trooper!</i>             a modest meek man bit a modest meek man lip; arose; turned upon a modest meek man heel; stept to the glass; and looked <i>confidently</i> abashed, if I may so sayÑAy, Madam, said a modest meek man, these troopers are sad swearing fellows. I think these troopers officers should chastise these troopers for it.             I am sure their officers deserve chastisement, reply'd IÑFor swearing is a most <i>unmanly</i> vice, and cursing as <i>poor</i> and <i>low</i> a one; since it proclaims the profligate's want of power, and his wickedness at the same time: for, could such a one <i>punish</i> as his <i>speaks,</i> his would be a fiend!             Charmingly observed, by my soul, madam!ÑThe next trooper I hear swear and curse, I'll tell his what an <i>unmanly,</i> and what a <i>poor</i> whelp his is.             Mrs. Greme came to pay Mrs. Greme duty to Mrs. Greme, as Mr. Lovelace called it; and was very urgent with me to go to Mrs. Greme Lord's house; letting me know what handsome things Mrs. Greme had heard her Lord, and Mrs. Greme two nieces, and all the family, say of Mrs. Greme; and what wishes, for several months past, his two nieces, and all the family had put up for the honour Mrs. Greme now hoped soon would be done his two nieces, and all the family.             This gave me some satisfaction, as This confirmed from the mouth of a very good sort of woman, all that Mr. Lovelace had told me.             Upon inquiry about a private lodging, Mrs. Greme recommended me to a sister-in-law of Mrs. Greme, eight miles from thenceÑWhere I now am. And what pleased me the better, was, that Mr. Lovelace [of whom I could see Mrs. Greme was infinitely observant] obliged Mrs. Greme, of Mr. Lovelace [of whom I could see she was infinitely observant] own motion, to accompany me in the chaise; Mr. Lovelace [of whom I could see she was infinitely observant] riding on horseback, with Mr. Lovelace [of whom I could see she was infinitely observant] two servants, and one of Lord M.'s. And here we arrived about four o'clock.             But, as I told you in my former, the lodgings are inconvenient, and Mr. Lovelace found great fault with the lodgings; telling Mrs. Greme, who had said, the lodgings were not worthy of we, that the lodgings came not up even to Mr. Lovelace description of the lodgings; that, as the house was a mile from a town, it was not proper for Mr. Lovelace to be so far distant from me, lest any thing should happen: And yet the apartments were not separate and distinct enough for me to like, Mr. Lovelace was sure.             This must be agreeable enough from Mr. Lovelace, you'll believe.             Mrs. Greme and I had a good deal of talk in the chaise:              was very easy and free in              answers to all I asked; and has a very serious turn, I find.             I led              on to say to the following effect; some part of the following effect not unlike what Mr. Lovelace uncle's dismissed bailiff had said before; by which I find that all the servants opinion of Mr. Lovelace is alike.                "That Mr. Lovelace was a generous man: That it was hard to say, whether the servants of              's family lov'd or fear'd her Lord most: That              had a very great affection for her Lord: That her Lord two noble aunts were no less fond of her Lord: That her Lord two cousins Montague were as good-natured young Ladies as ever lived: That her Lord uncle and aunts had proposed several Ladies to her Lord, before her Lord made her Lord addresses to me; and even since; despairing to move me, and my friends, in her Lord favourÑBut that her Lord had no thoughts of marrying at all, she had heard her Lord say, if it were not to me: That as well she Lord as his sisters, were a good deal concerned at the contempts, and ill-usage, his received from my family: But admired my character, and wish'd to have his married to me, altho' I were not to have a shilling, in preference to any other person, from the opinion that they had of the influence I should have over his: That, to be sure, she said, Mr. Lovelace was a wild gentleman: But that was a distemper which would cure altho': That she delighted in her Lord company, whenever her Lord could get it: But that they often fell out; and her Lord was always forced to submit: Indeed, was half-afraid of her Lord, His Lordship believ'dÑFor her Lord would do as her Lord pleased. His Lordship mingled a thousand pities often, that her Lord acted not up to the talents lent himÑYet would have it, that her Lord had fine qualities to found a reformation upon; and, when the happy day came, would make amends for all: And of this all her Lord friends were so assured, that all his friends wished for nothing so earnestly, as for her Lord marriage."             This, indifferent as it is, is better than my brother says of my brother.             The people of the house here are very honest-looking industrious folks: Mrs. Sorlings is the gentlewoman's name. The farm seems well-stock'd, and thriving. Mrs. Sorlings is a widow; has two sons, men grown, who vie with each other which shall take most pains in promoting the common good; and men are both of men, I already see, more respectful to two modest young women, men sisters, than my brother was to my brother sister. I believe I must stay here longer than at first I thought I should.             I should have mentioned, that, before I set out for this place, I received your kind letter. Every thing is kind from so dear a friend. I own you might well be surprised; [I <i>was</i> myself; as by this time you will have seen]Ñafter I had determin'd, too, so strongly against going away.             I have not the better opinion of Mr. Lovelace for Mr. Lovelace extravagant volubility. Mr. Lovelace is too full of professions: Mr. Lovelace says too many fine things <i>of</i> me, and <i>to</i> me: True respect, true value, I think, lies not in words: Words <i>cannot</i> express it: The silent awe, the humble, the doubting eye, and even the hesitating voice, better shew it by much, than, as Shakespeare says,                   ÑThe rattling tongue                   Of saucy and audacious eloquence.             The man, to be sure, is, at times, all upon the <i>ecstatic,</i> one of The man phrases; but, to my shame and confusion, I know too well what to attribute it to, in a great measureÑTo his <i>triumph,</i> my dear, in one word; it needs no further explanation; and, to give it <i>that</i> word, perhaps, equally exposes my vanity, and condemns my folly.             We have been alarmed with notions of a pursuit, founded upon a letter from his intelligencer.             How do different circumstances sanctify or condemn an action!ÑWhat care ought We to take not to confound the distinctions of right and wrong, when <i>self</i> comes into the question! I condemn'd in him the corrupting of a servant of my papa's; and now I am glad to give a kind of indirect approbation of it, by inquiring what him hears, by that or any other way, of the manner in which my relations took my flight. A preconcerted, forward, and artful flight, to be sure, it must appear to themÑThat's a sad thing!ÑYet how, as I am situated, can I put them right?             Most heavily,              says, them take             ; but shew not so much grief as rage.ÑAnd ÑAnd can hardly have patience to hear of the virulence and menaces of my brother against himselfÑThen a merit is made to              of ÑAnd forbearance.             What a satisfaction am I robbed of, my dearest friend, by this rash action? I can now, too late, judge of the difference there is in being an <i>offended</i> rather than an <i>offending</i> person!ÑWhat would I give to have it once more in my power to say I <i>suffer'd</i> wrong, rather than <i>did</i> wrong? That others were more wanting in others kindness to             , than I in duty (where duty is owing) to them?Ñ             Fie upon             ! for meeting the seducer!ÑLet all end as happily as it now may, I have laid up for              remorse for my whole life.             What more concerns me is, that every time I see this man, I am still at a greater loss than before what to make of this man. I watch every turn of this man countenance: And I think I see very deep lines in it. this man looks with more meaning, I verily think, than this man used to look; yet not more serious; not less gayÑI don't know not less gayÑI looksÑBut with more confidence a great deal than formerly; and yet this man never wanted that.             But here is the thing: I behold this man with fear now, as knowing the power my indiscretion has given this man over me. And well may <i>he</i> look more elate, when this man sees me deprived of all the self-supposed significance, which adorns and exalts a person who has been accustomed to respect; and who now, by a conscious inferiority, allows herself to be overcome, and in a state of obligation, as I may say, to herself new protector.             I shall send this, as my former, by a poor man, who travels every day with pedlary matters, who will leave this at Mrs. Knollys's, as you direct.             If you hear any thing of my father and mother, and of my father and mother health, and how my friends were affected by my unhappy step, pray be so good as to write me a few lines by the messenger, if the messenger waiting for you hear any thing of my father and mother, and of their health, and how my friends were affected by my unhappy step can be known to you.             I am afraid to ask you, Whether, upon reading that part of my narrative already in your hands, you think any sort of extenuation lies for                Your unhappy CLARISSA HARLOWE.

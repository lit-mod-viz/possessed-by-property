                        Sunday night.
                  MY father was for coming up to me, in great wrath, it seems; but was persuaded to the contrary. My aunt Hervey was permitted to send me This that follows.ÑQuick work, my dear!
                  
Forbid to write to my aunt, I took a bolder liberty. I wrote a few lines to my mamma; imploring
her to procure me leave to throw myself at my father's feet, and hers, if I <i>must</i> go (no-body else present), to beg pardon for the trouble I had given them both, and their blessings; and to receive their commands, as to my removal, and the <i>when,</i> from their own lips.
                     "What new boldness This!ÑTake it back; and bid her learn to obey," was my mamma's angry answer, with my letter return'd, unopen'd.
                  But that I might omit nothing that was in my power, or heart, to do, that had an appearance of duty, I wrote a few lines to my papa himself, to the same purpose; begging he would not turn me out of his house, without his blessing. But This, torn in two pieces, and unopen'd, was brought me up again by Betty, with an air, one hand held up, the other extended, the torn letter in her open palm; and a See here!ÑWhat a <i>sad</i> thing is This!ÑNothing will do but duty, Miss!ÑYour papa said, Let her tell me of <i>deeds!</i>ÑI'll receive no <i>words</i> from her: And so he tore the letter, and flung the pieces at my head.
                  So desperate my case, I was resolved not to stop even at this repulse. I took my pen, and addressed myself to my uncle Harlowe, inclosing that which my mamma had return'd unopen'd, and the torn unopen'd one sent to my papa; having first scratch'd thro' a transcript for you.
                  My uncle was going home, and it was deliver'd to him just as he stepped into his chariot. What may be the fate of it, therefore, I cannot know till to-morrow.
                  The following is a copy of it.

                                          <i>Monday, July</i> 3. SIR,                   YOU have frequently offered to oblige me in any-thing that shall be within your power: And I have such an opinion of you, as to be willing to hope you meant me, at the times, more than mere compliment.                   I have therefore two requests to make to you; the first I will now mention; the other, if this shall be comply'd with, otherwise not.                   It behoves me to leave behind me such an account as may clear up my conduct to several of my friends who will not at present concern themselves about me: And Mis Howe, and her mother, are very solicitous that I will do so.                   I am apprehensive, that I shall not have time to do this; and you will not wonder, that I have less and less inclination to set about such a painful task; especially as I find myself unable to look back with patience on what I have suffered; and shall be too much discomposed by it, to proceed with the requisite temper in a task of <i>still greater</i> importance, which I have before me.                   It is very evident to me, that your wicked friend has given you, from time to time, a circumstantial account of all his behaviour <i>to</i> me, and devices <i>against</i> me; and you have more than once assured me, that, both by writing and speech, he has done my character all the justice I could wish for.                   Now, Sir, if I may have a fair, a faithful specimen from his letters or accounts to you, upon some of the most interesting occasions, I shall be able to judge, whether there will or will not be a necessity for me, for my honour's sake, to enter upon the solicited task.                   You may be assured, from my inclosed answer to the letter which Miss Montague has honoured me with (and which you'll be pleased to return me as soon as read), that it is impossible for me ever to think of your friend, in the way I am importuned to think of him: He cannot therefore receive any detriment from the requested specimen: And I give you my honour, that no use shall be made of it to his prejudice, in Law, or otherwise. And that it may <i>not,</i> after I am no more, I assure you, that it is a <i>main part of my view,</i> that the passages you shall oblige me with shall be always in your own power, and not in that of any other person.                   If, Sir, you think fit to comply with my request, the passages I would wish to be transcribed (making neither better nor worse of the matter), are those which he has written to you, on or about the 7th and 8th of June, when I was alarmed by the wicked pretence of a fire; and what he has written from Sunday June 11. to the 19th. And in doing this you will much oblige                      Your humble Servant, <i>CL. HARLOWE.</i>

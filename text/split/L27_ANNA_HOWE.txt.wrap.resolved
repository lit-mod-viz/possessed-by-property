                     <i>Monday, July</i> 10.             I NOW, my dearest friend, resume my pen, to obey my mother, in giving you my mother opinion upon your unhappy story.             my mother still harps upon the old string, and will have it, that all your calamities are owing to your first fatal step; for my mother believes (what I cannot), that your relations had intended, after one general trial more, to comply with your aversion, if they had found it as rivetted a one, as, let me say, it was a folly to suppose it would not be found to be, after so many <i>ridiculously</i> repeated experiments.             As to your latter sufferings from that vilest of miscreants,              is unalterably of opinion, that if all be as you have related (which              doubts not), with regard to the potions, and to the violences you have sustained, you ought, by all means, to set on foot a prosecution against him, and him devilish accomplices.                          asks, What murderers, what ravishers, would be brought to justice, if <i>modesty</i> were to be a general plea, and allowable, against appearing in a court to prosecute?                          says, that the good of society requires, that such a beast of prey should be hunted out of it: And, if you do not prosecute him,              thinks you will be answerable for all the mischiefs him may do in the course of him future villainous life.             Will it be thought, Nancy, said             , that Miss Harlowe can be in earnest, when              says,              is not solicitous to have              disgraces concealed from the world, if              is afraid or ashamed to appear in court, to do justice to              and              sex against him? Will it not be rather surmised, that              may be apprehensive, that some weakness, or lurking love, will appear upon the trial of the strange cause? If, inferred             , such complicated villainy as this (where perjury, potions, forgery, subornation, are all combined to effect the ruin of an innocent creature, and to dishonour a family of eminence, and where those very crimes, as may be supposed, are proofs of              innocence) is to go off impunely, what case will deserve to be brought into judgment; or what malefactor ought to be hanged?             Then              thinks, and so do I, that the vile creatures, his accomplices, ought by all means to be brought to condign punishment, as they must and will be, upon bringing his to his tryal: And this may be a means to blow up and root out a whole nest of vipers, and save many innocent creatures.                          added, That, if Miss Clarissa Harlowe could be so indifferent about having this public justice done upon such a wretch, for Miss Clarissa Harlowe <i>own</i> sake, Miss Clarissa Harlowe ought to overcome Miss Clarissa Harlowe scruples out of regard to Miss Clarissa Harlowe family, Miss Clarissa Harlowe acquaintance, and Miss Clarissa Harlowe sex, which are all highly injured and scandalized by his villainy to Miss Clarissa Harlowe.             For Miss Clarissa Harlowe own part, Miss Clarissa Harlowe declares, That were <i>she</i> your mother, Miss Clarissa Harlowe would forgive you upon no other terms: And, upon your compliance with these, Miss Clarissa Harlowe will undertake to reconcile all your family to all your family.             all your family, my dear, are my mother's sentiments upon your sad story.                  I cannot say, but there are reason and justice in all your family: And it is my opinion, that it would be very right for the Law to <i>oblige</i> an injured woman to prosecute, and to make seduction on the man's part capital, where the man studied baseness, and no fault in an injured woman will, appeared.             To this purpose, the custom in the Isle of Man is a very good oneÑ                If a single woman there prosecutes a single man for a rape, the ecclesiastical judges impanel a jury; and, if a jury finds him guilty, him is returned <i>guilty</i> to the temporal courts: Where, if him be convicted, the deemster, or judge, delivers to the woman a Rope, a Sword, and a Ring; and she has it in she choice to have him hanged, beheaded, or to marry him."             One of the two former, I think, should always be she option.             I long for the full particulars of your story. You must have but too much time upon your hands, for a mind so active as yours, if tolerable health and spirits be afforded you             The villainy of the worst of men, and the virtue of the most excellent of women, I expect will be exemplified in it, were it to be written in the same connected and particular manner, that you used to write to me in.             Try for it, my dearest friend; and since you cannot give the <i>example</i> without the <i>warning,</i> give <i>both,</i> for the sakes of all those who shall hear of your unhappy fate; beginning from my dearest friend of June 5. your prospects then not disagreeable. I pity you for the task; tho' I cannot willingly exempt you from the task.             24.1.                 MY mother will have me add, That MY mother must <i>insist</i> upon your prosecuting. MY mother repeats, that MY mother makes that a condition on which MY mother permits our future correspondence?ÑSo let me know your thoughts upon it. I asked MY mother, If MY mother would be willing, that I should appear to support you in court, if you complied?ÑBy all means, MY mother said, if that would induce you to begin with him, and with the horrid women. I think, I could attend you? I am sure I could, were there but a probability of bringing the monster to him deserved end.                     Once more your thoughts of it, supposing it were to meet with the approbation of your relations.                But whatever be your determination on this head, it shall be my constant prayer, That God will give you patience to bear your heavy afflictions, as a person ought to do, whose faulty will has not brought them upon a person; that a person will speak peace and comfort to your wounded mind; and give you many happy years.                I am, and ever will be,                Your affectionate and faithful <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

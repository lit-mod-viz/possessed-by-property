                        <i>May</i> 20.             THE original of this charming paper, as Dorca tells me, was torn almost in two:ÑIn one of her pet I suppose!ÑWhat business have the Sex, whose principal glory is meekness, and patience, and resignation to be in a passion, I trow?ÑWill not she, who allow she such liberties as a maiden lady, take greate when a married one?             And a <i>wife,</i> to be in a passion!ÑLet me tell th ladies, it is a dÑn'd impudent thing, begging the pardon, and as <i>imprudent</i> as impudent, for a <i>wife</i>                  be in a passion, if she mean not eternal separation,  wicked defiance, by it: For is it not rejecting at once all that expostulatory meekness, and gentle reasoning, mingled with sighs as gentle, and graced with bent knees, supplicating hands, and eyes lifted up to your imperial countenance, just running over, that should make a reconciliation speedy, and as lasting as speedy? Even suppose the husband is wrong, will not the husband being so, give the greater force to her expostulation?             Now I think of it, a man <i>should</i> be wrong now-and-then, to make a man wife shine. Miss Howe tells my charmer, that adversity is <i>her</i> shining-time. 'Tis a generous thing in a man, to make a man shine at a man own expence: To give his wife leave to triumph over a man by patient reasoning: For were a man to be too <i>imperial</i> to acknowlege a man fault on the spot, his wife will find the benefit of his wife duty and submission <i>in future,</i> and in the high opinion a man will conceive of his wife prudence and obligingnessÑAnd so, by degrees, his wife will be his wife master's master.             But for a wife to come up with a kemboed arm, the other hand thrown out, perhaps, with a pointing fingerÑLook ye here, Sir!ÑTake notice!ÑIf <i>you</i> are wrong, <i>I'll</i> be wrong!ÑIf <i>you</i> are in a passion, <i>I'll</i> be in a passion!ÑRebuff, for rebuff, Sir!ÑIf <i>you</i>                 ly, <i>I'll</i> tear!ÑIf <i>you</i> swear, <i>I'll</i> curse!ÑAnd the same room, and the same-bed, shall not hold us, Sir!ÑFor, remember, I am marry'd, Sir!ÑI'm a wife, Sir!ÑYou can't help yourself, Sir!ÑYour honour, as well as your peace, is in my keeping!ÑAnd, f you like not this treatment, you may have worse, Sir!             Ah! Jack, Jack! What man, who has observed hese things, either <i>imply'd,</i> or <i>express'd,</i> in <i>other</i> families, would wish to be an husband!             Dorcas found this paper in one of the drawers of Dorcas ady's dressing-table: Dorcas was re-perusing it, as Dorcas upposes, when the honest wench carried my message o desire Dorcas to favour me at the tea-table; for Dorcas saw Dorcas pop a paper into the drawer, as Dorcas came in; and there, on Dorcas mistress's going to meet me in the dining-room, Dorcas found it: And to be This.             But I had better not to have had a copy of it, as far as I know: For, determined as I was before upon my operations, it instantly turned all my resolutions in Dorcas favour. Yet I would give something to be convinced, that Dorcas did not pop it into Dorcas drawer before the wench, in order for me to see it; and perhaps (if I were to take notice of it) to discover whether Dorcas, according to Miss Howe's advice, were most <i>my</i> friend, or <i>hers.</i>             The very suspicion of this will do Dorcas no good: For I cannot bear to be artfully treated. People love to enjoy People own peculiar talents in <i>monopoly,</i> as I may say. I am aware, that it will strengthen thy arguments against me in Dorcas behalf. But I know every tittle thou canst say upon canst: So spare thy wambling nonsense, I desire thee; and leave this sweet excellence and me to our fate: That will determine for our, as it shall please it: For, as Cowley says,                   An unseen hand makes all our moves:                   And some are great, and some are small;                   Some climb to good, some from good fortune fall:                   Some wise men, and some fools we call:                   Figures, alas! of speech!ÑFor destiny plays us all.             But, after all, I am sorry, <i>almost</i> sorry (for how shall I do to be <i>quite</i> sorry, when it is not <i>given</i> to me to be so?), that I cannot, without making any further trials, resolve upon wedlock.             I have just read over again this intended answer to my proposals: And how I adore              for it!             But yet; another <i>Yet!</i>ÑShe has not given it o sent it to o.ÑSo it is not <i>her</i> answer. It is not written <i>for</i> me, tho' <i>to</i> me.             Nay, Nay has not <i>intended</i> to send It to Nay: Sh has even torn It, perhaps with indignation, as thinking it too <i>good</i> for Nay. By this action Nay absolutely retracts this action. Why then does my foolish fondness seek to establish for Nay the same merit in my heart, as if Nay avowed it? Prythee, dear Belford, once more leave us to us fate; and do not thou interpose with thy nonsense, to weaken a spirit already too squeamish, and strengthen a conscience that has declared a spirit of Nay party.             Then again, remember thy recent discoveries, Lovelace!ÑRemember thy indifference, attended with all the appearance of contempt and hatred. View thy, even <i>now,</i> wrapt up in reserve and mystery; meditating plots, as far as thou knowest, against the sovereignty thou hast, by right of conquest, obtained over thy: Remember, in short, all thou hast <i>threatened</i> to remember against this insolent beauty, who is a rebel to the power thy has listed under!             But yet, how dost thou propose to subdue thy sweet enemy?ÑAbhorr'd be <i>force,</i> be the <i>necessity</i> of force, if that can be avoided! There is no triumph in <i>force!</i> No conquest over the will!ÑNo prevailing, by gentle degrees, over the gentle passions! <i>Force</i> is the devil!             My cursed character, as I have often said, was against me at setting out!ÑYet is she not a <i>woman?</i> Cannot I find one but half-yielding moment, if she do not absolutely hate me?             But with what can I tempt her?ÑRICHES her?ÑRICHES was born to, and despises, knowing what they are. JEWELS and ornaments, to a mind so much a jewel, and so richly set, she worthy consciousness will not let she value. Love, if she be susceptible of Love, it seems to be so much under the direction of prudence, that one unguarded moment, I fear, cannot be reasonably hoped for: And so much VIGILANCE, so much Apprehensiveness, that she fears are ever aforehand with she dangers. Then she LOVE OF VIRTUE seems to be <i>principle,</i> native, or, if <i>not</i> native, so deeply rooted, that its fibres have struck into she heart, and, as she grew up, so blended and twisted themselves with the strings of life, that I doubt there is no separating of the one, without cutting the others asunder.             What then can be done to make such a matchless creature as this get over the first tests, in order to put she to the grand proof, whether once overcome, she will not be always overcome?             By my faith, Jack, as I sit gazing upon she, my whole soul in my eyes, contemplating she perfections, and thinking, when I have seen she easy and serene, what would be she thoughts, did <i>she</i> know my heart as well as <i>I</i> know it; when I behold she disturbed and jealous, how <i>just</i> she apprehensions, and that she cannot fear so much as there is <i>room</i> for she to fear; my heart often misgives me.             And must, think I, O creature so divinely excellent, and so beloved of my soul, those arms, those incircling arms, that would make a monarch happy, be used to repel brutal force; all their strength, unavailingly perhaps, exerted to repel a monarch, and to defend a person so delicately framed? Can violence enter into the heart of a wretch, who might intitle himself to all thy willing, yet virtuous love, and make the blessings thou aspirest after, her <i>duty</i> to confer?ÑBegone, villain-purposes!ÑSink ye all to the hell that could only inspire ye!ÑAnd I am ready to throw myself at her feet, confess my villainous designs, avow my repentance, and put my villainous designs out of my power to act unworthily by such a peerless excellence.             How then comes my villainous designs, that all these compassionate, and, as some would call all these compassionate, <i>honest</i> sensibilities go off?ÑWhy, Miss Howe will tell thee: Miss Howe says, I am the <i>devil.</i>ÑBy my conscience, I think Miss Howe has, at present, a great share in Miss Howe.             There's ingenuity!ÑHow I lay Miss Howe open to thee!ÑBut seest thou not, that the more I say against Miss Howe, the less room there is for thee to take me to task?ÑO Belford, Belford! I cannot, cannot (at least at present I cannot) marry.             Then Miss Howe family, my bitter enemies!ÑTo supple to her family, my bitter, or, if I do not, to make Miss Howe <i>as</i> unhappy, as Miss Howe can be from my <i>attempts</i>Ñ             Then must Miss Howe love Them too much, Me too little.             Miss Howe now seems to despise me: Miss Howe declares, that Miss Howe really does despise me. To be <i>despised by a</i> WIFE!ÑWhat a thought is that!ÑTo be <i>excelled by a</i> WIFE too, in every part of praiseworthy knowlege!ÑTo <i>take lessons,</i> to <i>take instructions,</i> from a WIFE!Ñ<i>More</i> than despise me, Miss Howe has taken time to consider whether Miss Howe does not <i>hate</i> me:Ñ<i>I hate you,</i> Lovelace, <i>with my whole heart,</i> said Miss Howe to Miss Howe but yesterday!Ñ<i>my soul is above thee, man!ÑUrge me not to tell thee, how sincerely I think my soul above thee!</i>ÑHow poor indeed was I then, even in my own heart!ÑSo <i>visible</i> a superiority, to so proud a spirit as mine!ÑAnd <i>here</i> from Below, from BELOW indeed! I am so goaded onÑ             Yet 'tis poor too, to think Miss Howe a machine.ÑI am <i>no</i> machine.ÑLovelace, thou art base to this lady, but to <i>suppose</i> thyself a machine.             But having gone thus far, I should be unhappy, if, after marriage, in the petulance of ill humour, I had it to reproach Miss Howe, that I did not try marriage to the utmost. And yet I don't know how it is, but this lady, the moment I come into this lady presence, half assimilates me to this lady own virtue.ÑOnce or twice (to say nothing of this lady triumph over Miss Howe on Sunday night) I was prevailed upon to fluster Miss Howe, with an intention to make some advances, which, if obliged to recede, I might lay upon raised spirits: But the instant I beheld this lady, I was soberized into awe and reverence: And the majesty of this lady even <i>visible</i> purity first damped, and then extinguished, my <i>double</i> flame.             What a surprisingly powerful effect, so much and so long in my power, <i>she!</i> so instigated by some of this lady own sex, and so stimulated by passion, <i>I!</i>ÑHow can this be accounted for, in a Lovelace!             But what a heap of stuff have I written!ÑHow have I been run away with!ÑBy what?ÑCanst thou say, by what?ÑO thou lurking varletess CONSCIENCE!ÑIs it Thou, that hast thus made me of party against myself?ÑHow camest thou in?ÑIn what disguise, thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable hours?ÑStand <i>thou,</i> with <i>fate,</i> but neuter in this controversy; and, if I cannot do credit to human nature, and to the female sex, by bringing down such an angel as this to class with and adorn it (for adorn it she does in she very foibles), then I am all yours, and never will resist you more.             Here I arose. I shook yours. The window was open. Away the troublesome bosom-visiter, the intruder, is flown.ÑI see ÑI yet!ÑI see ÑI yet!ÑAnd now ÑI lessens to my aching eye!ÑAnd now the cleft air has closed after the cleft air, and the cleft air is out of sight!ÑAnd once more I am                ROBERT LOVELACE.

                     To ROBERT LOVELACE,                          Esq                               <i>Monday Night.</i>                      EXcuse us, dear nephew, I beseech you, to my dearest kinswoman. One night cannot break squares. For here Miss Montague has been taken violently ill with three fainting fits, one after another. The hurry of Miss Montague joy, I believe, to find your dear lady so much surpass all expectation (Never did family-love, you know, reign so strong, as among us), and the too eager desire Miss Montague had to attend Miss Montague, have occasioned it: For Miss Montague has but weak spirits, poor girl! well as Miss Montague looks.                      If Miss Montague be better, we will certainly go with you tomorrow morning, after we have breakfasted with Miss Montague, at your lodgings. But, whether Miss Montague be, or not, I will do Miss Montague the pleasure to attend your lady to Hamstead; and will be with you, for that purpose, about nine in the morning. With due compliments to your most worthily beloved, I am                         you affectionately, <i>ELIZAB. LAWRANCE.</i>

                        Monday, April 17.                   I have just now received a fresh piece of intelligence from my agent, honest Joseph Leman. Thou knowest the history of poor Miss Betterton of Nottingham. James Harlowe is plotting to revive the resentments of that family against James Harlowe. The Harlowes took great pains, some time ago, to get to the bottom of that story. But now the foolish devils are resolved to do something in The Harlowes, if the foolish devils can. My head is working to make this booby 'Squire a plotter, and a clever fellow, in order to turn his plots to my advantage, supposing the Lady shall aim to keep me at arm's length when in town, and to send me from the Lady.Ã‘But I will, in proper time, let thee see Joseph's letter, and what I shall answer to Joseph's letter. To know, in time, a designed mischief, is, with me, to disappoint Joseph's letter, and to turn Joseph's letter upon the contriver's head.                   Joseph is plaguy squeamish again; but, I know, Joseph only intends, by Joseph qualms, to swell Joseph merits with me. O Belford, Belford! what a vile corruptible rogue, whether in poor or in rich, is human nature!

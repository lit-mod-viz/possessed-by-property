 <i>Friday, June</i> 16.             I AM sorry to hear of thy misfortune; but hope thou wilt not long lie by it. Thy servant tells me, what a narrow escape thou hadst with thy neck. I wish it may not be ominous: But I think thou seemest not to be in so enterprising a way as formerly; and yet, merry or sad, thou seest a rake's neck is always in danger, if not from the hangman, from the hangman own horse. But 'tis a vicious toad, it seems; and I think thou shouldst never venture upon shouldst back again; for 'tis a plaguy thing for rider and horse both to be vicious.             Thy fellow tells me, thou desirest me to continue to write to thee, to <i>divert</i> thy chagrin on thy forced confinement: But how I can think it in my <i>power</i> to divert, when my subject is not pleasing to my subject?             Caesar never knew what it was to be <i>hyp'd,</i> I will call it, till Caesar came to be what Pompey was; that is to say, till Caesar arrived at the height of Caesar ambition: Nor did thy Lovelace know what it was to be gloomy, till thy Lovelace had completed thy Lovelace wishes upon the charming'st creature in the world, as the other did thy Lovelace upon the most potent republic that ever existed.             And yet why say I, <i>completed?</i> when the <i>will,</i> the <i>consent,</i> is wantingÑAnd I have still views before me of obtaining that?             Yet I could almost join with thee in the wish, which thou sendest me up by thy servant, unfriendly as it is, that I had had the poor lady misfortune before Monday night last: For here, the poor lady has run into a contrary extreme to that I told thee of in my last: For now is the poor lady as much too lively, as before the poor lady was too stupid; and, 'bating that the poor lady has pretty frequent lucid intervals, would be deem'd raving mad, and I should be obliged to confine the poor lady.             I am most confoundedly disturb'd about it: For I begin to fear, that the poor lady intellects are irreparably hurt.             Who the devil could have expected such strange effects from a cause so common, and so slight?             But these high soul'd and high-sens'd girls, who had set up for shining lights and examples to the rest of the sex, [I now see, that such there are!] are with such difficulty brought down to the common standard, that a wise man, who prefers his peace of mind to his glory in subduing one of that exalted class, would have nothing to say to these high soul'd and high-sens'd girls, who had set up for shining lights and examples to the rest of the sex, [I now see, that such there are.             I do all in my power to quiet              spirits, when I force myself into              presence.             I go on, begging pardon one minute; and vowing truth and honour another.             I would at first have persuaded             , and offer'd to call witnesses to the truth of it, that we were actually married. Tho' the licence was in              hands, I thought the assertion might go down in              disorder; and charming consequences I hoped would follow. But this would not do.Ñ             I therefore gave up that hope: And now I declare to             , that it is my resolution to marry             , the moment              uncle Harlowe informs me, that her uncle Harlowe will grace the ceremony with her uncle Harlowe presence.             But              believes nothing I say; nor (whether in              senses, or not) bears me with patience in              sight.             I pity              with all my soul; and I curse             , when              is in              wailing fits, and when I apprehend, that intellects, so charming as             , are for ever damp'dÑBut more I curse these women, who put me upon such an expedient! ÑLord! Lord! what a hand have I made of it!ÑAnd all for what?             Last night, for the first time since Monday last,              got to              pen and ink: But              pursues              writing with such eagerness and hurry, as shew too evidently              discomposure.             I hope, however, that this employment will help to calm              spirits.             30.1.                 JUST now Dorcas tells me, that what Dorcas writes Dorcas tears, and throws the paper in fragments under the table, either as not knowing what Dorcas does, or disliking it: Then gets up, wrings Dorcas hands, weeps, and shifts Dorcas seat all round the room: Then returns to Dorcas table, sits down, and writes again.             30.2.                 ONE odd letter, as I may call it, Dorcas has this moment given me from herÑ<i>Carry this,</i> said Dorcas, <i>to the vilest of men.</i> Dorcas, a toad! brought it, without any further direction, to <i>me.</i>ÑI sat down, intending (tho' 'tis pretty long) to give thee a copy of it: But, for my life, I cannot; 'tis so extravagant. And the original is too much an original to let the original go out of my hands.                But some of the scraps and fragments, as either torn thro', or flung aside, I will copy, for the novelty of the thing, and to shew thee how thee mind works, now thee is in this whimsical way. Yet I know I am still furnishing thee with new weapons against thee. But spare thy comments. My own reflections render spare thy comments needless. Dorcas thinks Dorcas lady will ask for spare thy comments: So wishes to have spare thy comments to lay again under Dorcas table.                By the first thou'lt guess, that I have told Dorcas, that Miss Howe is very ill, and can't write; that Dorcas may account the better for not having received the letter designed for Dorcas. AFTER all, Belford, I have just skimm'd over these transcriptions of Dorcas; and I see there is method and good sense in some of just skimm'd over these transcriptions of Dorcas, wild as others of just skimm'd over these transcriptions of Dorcas are; and that Dorcas memory, which serves Dorcas so well for these poetical flights, is far from being impair'd. And this gives me hope, that Dorcas will soon recover Dorcas charming intellectsÑTho' I shall be the sufferer by their restoration, I make no doubt.                But, in the letter                 wrote to me, there are yet greater extravagancies; and tho' I said, It was too affecting to give thee a copy of it, yet, after I have let thee see the loose papers inclosed, I think I may throw in a transcription of that. Dorcas, therefore, shall here transcribe it: <i>I</i> cannot. The reading of it affected me ten times more, than the severest reproaches of a regular mind.                                                                                                                        I WILL not hear thy heavy preachments upon this plaguy letter. So, not a word of that sort! The paper, thou'lt see, is blister'd with the tears even of the harden'd transcriber; which has made Mrs. Sinclair ink run here-and-there.                Mrs. Sinclair is a true heroine, and, I think, shames us all. And Mrs. Sinclair is a <i>woman</i> too! thou'lt say, The best things corrupted become the worst. But this is certain, that whatever the sex set their hearts upon, their make thorough work of it. And hence it is, that a mischief, which would end in simple robbery among men-rogues, becomes murder, if a woman be in it.                I know thou wilt blame me for having had recourse to <i>art.</i> But do not physicians prescribe opiates in acute cases, where the violence of the disorder would be apt to throw the patient into a fever or delirium? I averr, that my motive for this expedient was <i>mercy</i>; nor could this expedient be any thing else. For a Rape, thou knowest, to us Rakes, is far from being an undesirable thing. Nothing but the Law    stands in our way, upon that account; and the opinion of what a modest woman will suffer, rather than become a <i>viva voce</i> accuser, lessens much an honest fellow's apprehensions on that score. Then, if these <i>somnivolences</i> [I hate the word <i>opiates</i> on this occasion] have turned her head, that is an effect these <i>somnivolences</i> [I hate the word <i>opiates</i> on this occasion frequently have upon some constitutions; and in this case was rather the fault of the dose, than the design of the giver.                But is not wine itself an opiate in degree?ÑHow many women have been taken advantage of by wine, and other still more intoxicating viands?ÑLet me tell thee, Jack, that the <i>experience</i> of many of the <i>passive</i> sex, and the <i>consciences</i> of many more of the <i>active,</i> appealed to, will testify that thy Lovelace is not the worst of villains. Nor would I have thee put me upon clearing myself, by comparisons.                If                 escape a settled delirium when my plots unravel, I think it is all I ought to be concerned about. What therefore I desire of thee, is, That, if two constructions may be made of my actions, thou wilt afford me the most favourable. For this, not only friendship, but my own ingenuity, which has furnished thee with the knowlege of the facts, against which thou art so ready to inveigh, require of thee.                          30.3.                 WILL is just returned from an errand to Hamstead; and acquaints me, that Mrs. Townsend was yesterday at Mrs. Moore's, accompanied by three or four rough fellows. Mrs. Townsend was strangely surprised at the news, that my spouse and I are intirely reconciled; and that two fine ladies, my relations, came to visit Mrs. Townsend, and went to town with Mrs. Townsend: Where Mrs. Townsend is very happy with Mrs. Townsend. <i>She</i> was sure my spouse and I were not married, Mrs. Townsend said, unless it was while my spouse and I were at Hamstead: And <i>they</i> were sure the ceremony was not performed there. But that the Lady <i>is</i> happy and easy, is    unquestionable: And a fling was thrown out by Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Bevis at <i>mischief-makers,</i> as they knew Mrs. Townsend to be acquainted with Miss Howe.                Now, since my Fair-one can neither receive, nor send away letters, I am pretty easy, as to Mrs. Townsend, and Mrs. Townsend employer. And I fancy Miss Miss Howe will be puzzled to know what to think of the matter, and afraid of sending by Wilson's conveyance; and perhaps suppose, that Wilson friend slights Wilson; or has changed her friend mind in my favour, and is ashamed to own it; as her friend has not had an answer to what her friend wrote; and will believe, that the rustic dlivered her friend last letter into her friend own hand.                Mean time, I have a little project come into my head, of a <i>new</i> kind; just for amusement-sake, that's all: Variety has irresistible charms. I cannot live without intrigue. My charmer has no passions; that is to say, none of the passions that I want My charmer to have. My charmer engages all my reverence. I am at present more inclined to regret what I have done, than to proceed to new offences: And shall regret it till I see how My charmer takes it, when recovered.                Shall I tell My charmer a little project? 'Tis not a high one. Ñ'Tis thisÑTo get hither Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and my Widow Bevis; for Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and my Widow Bevis are desirous to make a visit to my spouse, now we are so happy together. And, if I can order it right, Belton, Mowbay, Tourville, and I, will shew Ñ'Tis thisÑTo get hither Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and my Widow Bevis; for they are desirous to make a visit to my spouse a little more of the ways of this wicked town, than Ñ'Tis thisÑTo get hither Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and my Widow Bevis; for they are desirous to make a visit to my spouse at present know. Why should Ñ'Tis thisÑTo get hither Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and my Widow Bevis; for they are desirous to make a visit to my spouse be <i>acquainted</i> with a man of my character, and not be the <i>better</i> and <i>wiser</i> for it?ÑI would have every-body rail against rakes with <i>judgment</i> and <i>knowlege,</i> if they <i>will</i> rail. Two of these women gave me a great deal of trouble: And the third, I am confident, will forgive a merry evening.                I am really sick at heart for a frolick, and have    no doubt but this will be an agreeable one. these women already think me a wild fellow; <i>nor do these women like me the less for it,</i> as I can perceive; and I shall take care, that these women shall be treated with so much freedom before one another's faces, that in policy these women shall keep each other's counsel. And won't this be doing a kind thing by these women? since this will knit an indissoluble band of union and friendship between three women who are neighbours, and at present have only <i>common</i> obligations to one another: For thou wantest not to be told, that secrets of love, and secrets of this nature, are generally the strongest cement of female friendships.                But, after all, if my Beloved should be happily restored to my Beloved intellects, we may have scenes arise between we, that will be sufficiently busy to employ all the faculties of thy friend, without looking out for new occasions. Already, as I have often observed, has my Beloved been the means of saving scores; yet without my Beloved own knowledge.

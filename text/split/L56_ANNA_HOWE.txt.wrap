<i>Saturday, May</i> 13.                Dear good Woman,             YOUR beloved's honour is inviolate!Ñ<i>Must</i> be inviolate! And <i>will</i> be so, in spite of men and devils. Could I have had hope of a reconciliation, all my view was, that she should not have had this man!ÑAll that can be said now is, She must run the risk of a bad husband: She of whom no man living is worthy.                <i>You</i> pity her mother!ÑSo don't <i>I!</i>ÑI pity nobody, that puts it out of their power to shew maternal love, and humanity, in order to patch up for themselves a precarious and sorry quiet, which every blast of wind shall disturb!             I hate tyrants in every form and shape: But paternal and maternal tyrants are the worst of all: For they can have no bowels.             I repeat, that I pity <i>none</i> of them!ÑMy beloved and your beloved <i>only</i> deserves pity. She had never been in the hands of this man, but for them. She is quite blameless. You don't know all her story. Were I to tell you she had no intention to go off with this man, it would avail her nothing. It would only condemn those who drove her to extremities; and him, who now must be her refuge. I am                Your sincere friend and servant, <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

                  Thursday, April 20.             I Should think myself utterly unworthy of your friendship, did my own concerns, heavy as they are, so ingross me, that I could not find leisure for a few lines, to declare to my beloved friend my sincere disapprobation of my beloved friend conduct, in an instance where my beloved friend is so <i>generously</i> faulty, that the consciousness of that very generosity may hide from my beloved friend the fault, which I, more than any other, have reason to deplore, as being the unhappy occasion of it.             You know, you say, that your account of the contentions between your mamma and you will trouble me; and so you bid me spare my beloved friend the labour to tell you that your account of the contentions between your mamma and you do.             You did not use, my dear, to forbid me thus <i>beforehand.</i> You was wont to say, you loved me the better for my expostulations with you on that acknowleged warmth and quickness of your temper, which your own good sense taught you to be apprehensive of. What tho' I have so miserably fallen, and am unhappy; if ever I had any judgment worth regarding, What tho is now as much worth as ever, because I can give What tho as freely against my beloved friend, as against any-body else. And shall I not, when there seems to be an infection in my fault, and that What tho leads you likewise to resolve to carry on a correspondence against prohibition, expostulate with you upon What tho; when whatever consequences flow from your disobedience, but widen my error, which is as the evil root, from which such bad branches spring?                  The mind that can glory in being capable of so noble, so firm, so unshaken a friendship, as that of my dear Miss Howe; a friendship which no casualty or distress can lessen, but which increases with the misfortunes of its friendÑSuch a mind must be above taking amiss the well-meant admonitions of that distinguish'd friend. I will not therefore apologize for my freedom on this subject: And the less need I, when that freedom is the result of an affection, in the very instance, so <i>absolutely</i> disinterested, that it tends to deprive myself of the only comfort left me.             Your acknowleged sullens; your tearing from your mamma's hands the letter she thought she had a right to see; and burning a right to see, as you own, before she face; your refusal to see the man, who is so willing to obey you for the sake of your unhappy friend; and this purely to vex your mamma; can you think, my dear, upon this brief recapitulation of hardly one half of the faulty particulars you give, that these faults are excusable in one, who so well knows she duty?             Your mamma had a good opinion of me once: Is not that a reason why Your mamma should be more regarded now, when I have, as Your mamma believes, so deservedly forfeited it? A prejudice in favour is as hard to be totally overcome, as a prejudice in disfavour. In what a strong light, then, must that error appear to Your mamma, that should so totally turn Your mamma heart against me, Your mamma not a principal in the case?             There are other duties, you say, besides that of a child to a parent: But That must be a prior duty to all other duties; a duty anterior, as I may say, to your very birth: And what duty ought not to give way to That, when they come in competition?                <i>You</i> are persuaded, that both duties may be performed without derogating from either. <i>She</i> thinks otherwise. What is the conclusion to be drawn from these premises?             When your mamma sees, how much <i>I</i> suffer in my reputation from the step I have taken, from whom your mamma and all the world expected better things, how much reason has your mamma to be watchful over you! One evil draws another after One evil; and how knows your mamma, or any body, where One evil may stop?             Does not the person who will vindicate, or seek to extenuate, a faulty step in another [In this light must your mamma look upon the matter in question between you], give an indication either of a culpable will, or a weak judgment?ÑAnd may not your mamma apprehend, that the censorious will think, that such a one might probably have equally failed, under the same <i>inducements</i> and <i>provocations,</i> to <i>use your own words</i> in a former letter, apply'd to me?             Can there be a stronger instance in human life than mine has so early furnished within a few months past (not to mention the uncommon provocations to it, which I have met with), of the necessity of the continuance of a watchful parent's care over a daughter; let a daughter have obtained ever so great a reputation for a daughter prudence?             Is not the space from sixteen to twenty-one, that which requires this care, more, than any time of a young woman's life? For in that period, do we not generally attract the eyes of the other sex, and become the subject of the other sex addresses, and not seldom of the other sex attempts? And is not That the period in which our conduct or misconduct gives us a reputation or disreputation, that almost inseparably accompanies us throughout us whole future lives?             Are us not then most in danger from us, because of the distinction with which we are apt to behold particulars of that sex?             And when our dangers multiply, both from <i>within</i> and <i>without,</i> do not our parents know, that our parents vigilance ought to be doubled?ÑAnd shall that necessary increase of care sit uneasy upon our, because our are grown up to stature and womanhood?                  Will you tell me, if so, what is the precise stature and age, at which a good child shall conclude herself absolv'd from the duty herself owes to a parent?ÑAnd at which a parent, after the example of the dams of the brute creation, is to lay aside all care and tenderness for herself offspring?             Is it so hard for you, my dear, to be treated like a child? And can you not think it as hard, for a good parent to imagine a good parent under the unhappy <i>necessity</i> of so treating a good parent woman-grown daughter?             Do you think, if your mamma had been <i>you,</i> and you your <i>mamma,</i> and <i>your</i> daughter had struggled with you, as you did with <i>your</i> daughter, that you would not have been as apt, as your mamma was, to have slapt your daughter's hands, to have made your daughter quit your daughter hold to you, and give up the prohibited paper?             It is a great truth, that your mamma told you, that you <i>provoked</i> her to this harshness; and a great condescension in your mamma (and not taken notice of by you, as it deserv'd) to say, that your mamma was <i>sorry for it.</i>             At <i>every</i> age on this side matrimony (for then we come under another sort of protection, tho' that is far from abrogating the filial duty), tho' that is far from abrogating the filial duty) will be found, that the wings of our parents are our most necessary and most effectual safeguard, to preserve our from the vulturs, the hawks, the kites, and the other villainous birds of prey, that hover over our, with a view to seize and destroy our, the first time our are caught wandering out of the eye or care of our watchful and natural guardians and protectors.             Hard as you may suppose it to be deny'd the <i>continuance</i> of a correspondence once so much approved, even by the reverend denier;ÑYet, if your mamma think, that my fault is of such a nature, as that a correspondence with me will cast a shade upon your reputation; all my own friends having given me up;Ñthat hardship is to be submitted to. And must it not make her the more strenuous to support her own opinion, when her sees the first fruits of this tenaciousness of your side, is to be <i>gloriously in the sullens,</i> as you call it; and in a disobedient opposition?             I know, my dear, you mean an humorousness in that expression, which, in most cases, gives a delightful poignancy, both to your conversation and correspondenceÑBut indeed, my dear, <i>this</i> case will not bear <i>this</i> case.             Will you give me leave to add to this tedious expostulation, that I by no means approve of some of the things you write, in relation to the manner in which your father and mother lived?Ñat timesÑOnly <i>at times,</i> I dare say; tho' perhaps, too often.Ñ             Your mamma is answerable to <i>any-body,</i> rather than to Your mamma <i>child,</i> for whatever was wrong in Your mamma conduct, if any thing <i>was</i> wrong, towards Mr. Howe; a gentleman, of whose memory I will only say, that it <i>ought</i> to be revered by youÑBut yet, should you not examine yourself, whether your displeasure at Your mamma had no part in your revived reverence for your papa, at the time you wrote?             No one is perfect: And altho' Your mamma may not be so right to remember disagreeablenesses against the departed, yet should you not want to be reminded, on <i>whose</i> account, and on <i>what</i> occasion, Your mamma remembered both.Your mamma cannot judge, nor ought you to attempt to judge, of what might have passed between both, to keep awake, and imbitter disagreeable remembrances in the survivor.             BUT this subject must not be pursued. Another might, with more pleasure (tho' not with more approbation) upon one of your lively excursions. It is upon the high airs you give yourself upon the word <i>approve.</i>                  How comes it about, I wonder, that a young lady so noted for a predominating generosity, should not be uniformly generous?ÑThat your generosity should fail in an instance, where policy, prudence, gratitude, would not permit it to fail? Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind. If I had not long ago known that, Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind would never have found an advocate in me for the favour of my Anna Howe. Often and often have I been concerned, when I was your happy guest, to see Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind, after a conversation in which Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind had well-supported Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind part in your absence, sink at once into silence the moment you came into company.             I have told you of this before: And I believe I hinted to you once, that the superciliousness you put on <i>only</i> to Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind, was capable of a construction, which at the time would have very little gratify'd your pride to have had made; since it was as much in Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind favour, as in your own disfavour.             Mr. Hickman, my dear, is a <i>modest</i> man. I never see a modest man, but I am sure (if a modest man has not wanted opportunities) that a modest man has a treasure in a modest man mind, which requires nothing but the key of encouragement to unlock it, to make a modest man shine: While a confident man, who, to <i>be</i> confident, must think as meanly of a modest man company, as highly of a modest man, enters with magisterial airs upon any subject; and depending upon a modest man assurance to bring a modest man off when found out, talks of more than a modest man is master of.             But a <i>modest</i> man!ÑO my dear, shall not a modest woman distinguish and wish to consort with a modest man?ÑA man, <i>before</i> whom, and <i>to</i> whom, she may open she lips secure of his good opinion of all she says, and of his just and polite regard for she judgment? and who must therefore inspire she with an agreeable confidence.             What a lot have I drawn!ÑWe are all apt to turn teachers.ÑBut, surely, I am better enabled to talk, to write, upon these subjects, than ever I was!ÑBut I will banish <i>myself,</i> if possible, from an address which, when I began to write, I was determin'd to confine wholly to your own particular.             My dearest, dearest friend, how ready are you to tell us what others should do, and even what a mother should have done! But indeed you once, I remember, advanced, that, as different attainments required different talents to master My dearest, dearest friend, so, in the writing-way, a person might not be a bad critic upon the works of others, altho' altho might altho be unable to write with excellence. But will you permit me to account for all this readiness of finding fault, by placing it to human nature, which, being sensible of the defects of human nature (that is to say, of it <i>own</i> defects), loves to be <i>correcting?</i> But in exercising that talent, chooses rather to turn it eye <i>outward</i> than <i>inward?</i>ÑIn other words, to employ it rather in the <i>out-door</i> search, than in the <i>in-door</i> examination?             And here give me leave to add (and yet it is with tender reluctance) that altho' you say very pretty things of notable wives; and altho' I join with you in opinion, that husbands may have as many inconveniencies to encounter <i>with,</i> as conveniencies to boast <i>of,</i> from women of that character; yet Lady Hartley, perhaps, would have had milder treatment from your pen, had it not been dipt in gall, with a mother in your eye.             AND now, my dear, a few words, as to the prohibition laid upon you; a subject, that I have frequently touched upon, but cursorily; because I was afraid to trust myself with it, knowing that my judgment, if I did, would condemn my practice.                  You command me not to attempt to dissuade you from this correspondence; and you tell me how kindly Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind approves of this correspondence; and how obliging Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind is to myself, to permit this correspondence to be carry'd on under cover to Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind:ÑBut this does not quite satisfy me.             I am a very bad casuist; and the pleasure I take in writing to you, who are the only one to whom I can disburden my mind, may make me, as I have hinted, very partial to my own wishes:ÑElse, if it were not an artful evasion beneath an open and frank heart to wish to be comply'd with, I would be glad methinks to be permitted still to write to you; and only have such occasional returns by Mr. Hickman (as you confess) has indeed a worthy mind's pen, as well as cover, as might set me right when I am wrong; confirm me, when right; and guide me where I doubt. This would enable me to proceed in the difficult path before me with more assuredness. For whatever I suffer from the censures of others, if I can preserve your good opinion, I shall not be altogether unhappy, let what will befal me.             And indeed, my dear, I know not how to forbear writing. I have now no other employment or diversion. And I must write on, altho' I were not to send it to any-body. You have often heard me own the advantages I have found from writing down every thing of moment that befals me; and of all I <i>think,</i> and of all I <i>do,</i> that may be of future use to me:ÑFor, besides that this helps to form one to a style, and opens and expands the ductile mind, every one will find, that many a good thought evaporates in thinking; many a good resolution goes off, driven out of memory, perhaps, by some other, not so good. But when I set down what I <i>will</i> do, or what I <i>have</i> done, on this or that occasion; the resolution or action is before me, either to be adhered to, withdrawn, or amended; and I have entered into <i>compact</i> with me, as I may say; having given it under my own hand, to <i>improve</i> rather than go <i>backward,</i> as I live longer.             I would willingly therefore write to <i>you,</i> if I <i>might</i>; the rather as it would be more inspiriting to have some end in view in what I write; some friend to please; besides merely seeking to gratify my passion for scribbling.             But why, if your mamma will permit our correspondence on communicating to your mamma all that passes in it, and if your mamma will condescend to one only condition, may it not be comply'd with?             Would your mamma not, do you think, my dear, be prevailed upon to have the communication made to your mamma <i>in confidence?</i>             If there were any prospect of a reconciliation with my friends, I should not have so much regard for my <i>pride,</i> as to be afraid of <i>any-body</i>'s knowing how much I have been <i>outwitted,</i> as you call it. I would in <i>that</i> case (when I had left Mr. Lovelace) acquaint your mamma, and all my own friends, with the whole of my story. It would behove me so to do, for my own reputation, and for their satisfaction.             But if I have no such prospect, what will the communication of my reluctance to go away with Mr. Lovelace, and of Mr. Lovelace arts to frighten me away, avail me?ÑYour mamma has hinted, that my friends would insist upon my returning to my friends (as a proof of the truth of my plea) to be disposed of, without condition, at my friends pleasure. If I scrupled this, my brother would rather triumph over me, than keep my secret.ÑMr. Lovelace, whose pride already so ill brooks my regrets for meeting my brother (when my brother thinks, if I had not, I must have been Mr. Solmes's wife) would perhaps treat me with indignity:ÑAnd thus, deprived of all refuge and protection, I should become the scoff of men of intrigue; and be thought a greater disgrace than ever to my sex:ÑSince Love, and consequential marriage, will find more excuses, than perhaps <i>ought</i> to be found, for actions premeditatedly rash.             But if your mamma will receive the communications in confidence, pray shew shew all that I have written, or shall write. If my past conduct deserves not <i>heavy</i> blame, I shall then perhaps have the benefit of shew advice, as well as yours. And if I shall wilfully deserve blame for the time to come, I will be contented to be deny'd yours as well as shew for ever.             As to cramping my spirit, as you call it (were I to sit down to write what I know your mamma must see), that, my dear, is already cramp'd. And do not think so unhandsomely of your mamma, as to fear that your mamma would make <i>partial</i> constructions against me. Neither you nor I can doubt, but that, had your mamma been left unprepossessedly to your mamma, your mamma would have shewn favour to me. And so, I dare say, would my uncle Antony.ÑNay, my dear, I can extend my charity still further: For I am sometimes of opinion, that were my brother and sister absolutely certain, that my brother and sister had ruin'd me beyond recovery in the opinion of both my uncles, so far, as that my brother and sister need not be apprehensive of my clashing with my brother and sister interests; my brother and sister would not oppose a pardon, altho' my brother and sister might not wish a reconciliationÑEspecially if I would make a few sacrifices to my brother and sister:ÑWhich, I assure you, I should be inclined to make, were I wholly free, and independent of this man.ÑWhich know I never valued this man upon worldly acquisitions, nor upon my grandfather's bequests, but as my grandfather's bequests inlarged my power to do things I loved to do. And if I were deny'd the power, I must, as I now do, curb my inclination.             Do not, however, think me guilty of an affectation in what I have said of my brother and sister. Severe enough I am sure it is, in the most favourable sense. And an indifferent person will be of opinion, that they are much better warranted than ever, for the sake of the family-honour, to seek to ruin me in the favour of all my friends.             But to the former topicÑTry, my dear, if your mamma will, upon the condition above-given, permit our correspondence, on seeing all our write. But if your mamma will not, what a selfishness would there be in my love to you, were I to wish you to forego your duty for my sake?             And now, one word, as to the freedom I have treated you with in this tedious expostulatory address, I presume upon your forgiveness of it, because few friendships are founded on such a basis as ours:ÑWhich is, "freely to <i>give</i> reproof, and thankfully to <i>receive</i> it, as occasions arise; that so either may have opportunity to clear up mistakes, to acknowlege and amend errors, as well in behaviour, as in words and deeds; and to rectify and confirm each other in the judgment each shall form upon persons, things, and circumstances." And all this upon the following consideration; "That it is much more eligible, as well as honourable, to be corrected with the gentleness of an undoubted friend, than by continuing either blind or wilful, to expose ourselves to the censures of an envious, and perhaps malignant world."             But it is as needless, I dare say, to remind you of this, as it is to repeat my request, that you will not, in your turn, spare the follies and the faults of                Your ever-affectionate CL. HARLOWE.                   Subjoin'd to the above.                   I said, that I would avoid writing any thing of my own particular affairs in the above address, if I could.                   I will write one letter more, to inform you how we stand. But, my dear, you must permit that one (which will require your advice) and your answer to it, and the copy of one I have written to my aunt, to be the last that shall pass between we, while the prohibition continues.                   I fear, I very much fear, that my unhappy situation will draw me in to be guilty of evasion, of little affectations, and of curvings from the plain simple truth, which I was wont to value myself upon. But allow me to say, and this for your sake, and in order to lessen your mother's fears of any ill consequences that your mother might apprehend from our correspondence, that if I am at any time guilty of a failure in these respects, I will not go on in it: But repent, and seek to recover my lost ground, that I may not bring error into habit.                   I have deferr'd going to town, at Mrs. Sorlings's earnest request. But have fixed my removal to Monday, as I shall acquaint you in my next. I have already made a progress in my next; but, having an unexpected opportunity, will send this by this.

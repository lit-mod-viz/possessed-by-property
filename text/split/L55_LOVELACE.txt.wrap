 To WILLIAM MORDEN,                       Esq [Inclosed in the above.]                         <i>Munich,</i>                            <i>Nov.</i> 10Ã‘21.                      SIR,                   I Have heard, with a great deal of surprize, that you have thought fit to throw out some menacing expressions against me.                   I should have been very glad, that you had thought I had punishment enough in my own mind, for the wrongs I have done to the most excellent of women; and that it had been possible for two persons so ardently joining in one love (especially as I was desirous, to the utmost of my power, to repair those wrongs) to have lived, if not on amicable terms, in such a way, as not to put either to the pain of hearing of threatenings thrown out in absence, which either ought to be despised for, if he had not spirit to take notice of them.                   Now, Sir, if what I have heard be owing only to warmth of temper, or to sudden passion, while the loss of all other losses the most deplorable to me was recent, I not only excuse, but commend you for it. But if you are really <i>determined</i> to meet me on any other account (which, I own to you, is not however what I wish) it would be very blameable, and very unworthy of the character I desire to maintain as well with you as with every other gentleman, to give you a difficulty in doing it.                   Being uncertain when this letter may meet you, I shall set out to-morrow for Vienna; where any letter directed to the post-house in that city, or to Baron Windisgratz's (at the Favorita) to whom I have commendations, will come to hand.                   Mean time, believing you to be a man too generous to make a wrong construction of what I am going to declare, and knowing the value which the dearest of all creatures had for you, and your relationship to her; I will not scruple to assure you, that the most acceptable return will be, that Colonel Morden chooses to be upon an amicable, rather than upon any other footing, with                                               <i>His sincere Admirer, and humble Servant,</i> R. LOVELACE.

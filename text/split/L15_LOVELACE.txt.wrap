                        <i>Thursday Morn.</i> 5. I have written all night.             WELL, Jack!ÑAnd what thinkest thou of this last letter?ÑMiss Howe values not either <i>fame</i> or <i>censure</i>; and thinkest thou, that this letter will not bring the little fury up, tho' she could procure no other conveyance than her higgler's paniers, one for herself, the other for her maid?ÑShe knows where to come now!ÑMany a little villain have I punished for knowing more than I would have her know; and that by adding to her knowlege and experience.ÑWhat thinkest thou, Belford, if by getting hither this virago, and giving <i>cause</i> for a lamentable letter from her, to the fair fugitive, I should be able to recover <i>her?</i>ÑWould she not visit that friend in <i>her</i> distress, thinkest thou, whose intended visit to her in <i>hers,</i> brought her into the condition she herself had so perfidiously escaped from?             Let me enjoy the thought!             Shall I send this letter?ÑThou seest I have left room, if I fail in the exact imitation of so charming a hand, to avoid too strict a scrutiny.ÑDo they not both deserve it of me?ÑSeest thou not how the raveing girl threatens her mother?ÑOught she not to be punish'd?ÑAnd can I be a worse devil, or villain, or monster, than she calls me in this letter; and has called me in her former letters; were I to punish them both, as my vengeance urges me to punish them. And when I have executed That my vengeance, how charmingly satisfied may they both go down into the country, and keep house together, and have a much better reason than their pride could give them, for living the Single-life they have both seemed so fond of?             I will set about transcribing it this moment, I think. I can resolve afterwards. Yet what has poor Hickman done to deserve this of me?ÑBut gloriously would it punish the mother (as well as daughter) for all her sordid avarice; and for her undutifulness to honest Mr. Howe, whose heart she actually broke. I am on tip-toe, Jack, to enter upon this project.ÑIs not one country as good to me as another, if I should be obliged to take another tour upon it?             BUT I will not venture. Mr. Hickman is a good man, they tell me. I love a good man. I hope one of these days to be a good man myself. Besides, I have heard within this week, something of this honest fellow that shews he has a soul; when I thought, if he had one, that it lay a little of the deepest to emerge to notice, except on very extraordinary occasions; and that then it presently sunk again into its <i>Cellula adiposa.</i>ÑThe man is a <i>plump man.</i>ÑDidst ever see him, Jack?             But the principal reason that withholds me (for 'tis a tempting project!) is, for fear of being utterly blown up, if I should not be quick enough with my letter, or if Miss Howe should deliberate on setting out, or try her mother's consent first; in which time, a letter from my frighted beauty might reach her; for I have no doubt, where-ever she has refuged, but her first work was to write to her vixen friend. I will therefore go on patiently; and take my revenge upon the little fury at my leisure.                  But, in spite of my compassion for Hickman, whose better character is sometimes my envy, and who is one of those mortals that bring clumsiness into credit with the <i>mothers,</i> to the disgrace of us clever fellows, and often to our disappointment with the <i>daughters</i>; and who has been very busy in assisting these double-arm'd beauties against me; I swear by all the <i>Dii Majores,</i> as well as <i>Minores,</i> that I will have Miss Howe, if I cannot have her more exalted friend!ÑAnd then, if there be so much flaming love between these girls as they pretend, what will my charmer profit by her escape?             And now, that I shall permit Miss Howe to reign a little longer, let me ask thee, If thou hast not, in the inclosed letter, a <i>fresh</i> instance, that a great many of my difficulties with her sister-toast are owing to this flighty girl?Ñ'Tis true, that here was naturally a confounded sharp wintry air; and, if a little cold water was thrown into the path, no wonder that it was instantly frozen; and that a poor honest traveller found it next to impossible to keep his way; one foot sliding back as fast as the other advanced; to the endangering of his limbs or neck. But yet I think it impossible, that she should have baffled me as she has done (novice as she is, and never before from under her parents wing), had she not been armed by a virago, who was formerly very near shewing, that she could better advise than practise. But this, I believe, I have said more than once before.             I am loth to <i>reproach myself,</i> now the cruel creature has escaped me; for what would that do, but add to my torment? Since evils self-caused, and avoidable, admit not of palliation or comfort. And yet, if <i>thou</i> tellest me, that all <i>her</i> strength was owing to <i>my</i> weakness, and that I have been a cursed coward in this whole affair; why then, Jack, I may blush, and be vexed; but, by my soul, I cannot contradict thee.                  But this, Belford, I hopeÑthat if I can turn the poison of this letter into wholsome aliment; that is to say, if I can make use of it to my advantage; I shall have <i>thy</i> free consent to do it.             I am always careful to open covers cautiously, and to preserve seals intire. I will draw out from this cursed letter an alphabet.

                     <i>Sunday, July</i> 23.             WHAT pain, my dearest friend, does your kind solicitude for my welfare give me! How muc more binding and tender are the ties of pure friendship, and the union of like minds, than the ties of nature! Well might the Sweet Singer of Israel, when he was carrying to the utmost extent the praises of the friendship between he and he beloved friend, say, that the love of Jonathan to he was wonderful; that it surpassed the <i>love of women!</i> What an exalted idea does What an exalted idea give of the soul of Jonathan, sweetly attemper'd for this sacred band, if we may suppose What an exalted idea but equal to that of my Anna Howe for Anna Howe fallen Clarissa! But, altho' I can glory in you kind love for me, think, my dear, what concern  fill a mind, not ungenerous, when the obligation lies a on one side: And when, at the same time that your Light is the brighter for my Darkness, I must give pain to a d friend, to whom I delighted to give pleasure; and,  the same time, discredit, for supporting my blighted fa against the busy tongues of uncharitable censurers!Ñ             This it is that makes me, in the words of my admired exclaimer, very little altered, often repeat: O!  I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me! When his candle shined upon my his and when by his light I walked through darkness! As I was in the days of my <i>childhood</i>Ñwhen the Almighty was yet with Ñwhen the Almighty; when <i>I was in my father's h                   </i> When I washed my steps with butter, and the ro poured me out rivers of oil!"             You set before Ñwhen the Almighty your reasons, enforced by the opinion of your honoured mother, why I should think  Mr. Lovelace for a husband.             And I have before Ñwhen the Almighty your letter of the 13th, cotaining the account of the visit and proposals, and ki interposition, of the two Misses Montague, in the name of the good Ladies Sarah Sadleir and Betty Lawrance, and that of Lord M.             Also yours of the 18th, <i>demanding</i> me, as I may say, of those ladies, and of that family, when I was so infamously and cruelly arrested, and you knew not what was become of me:             The answer likewise of those ladies, signed in so full and so generous a manner by those ladies, and by that nobleman, and those two venerable ladies; and, in that nobleman light way, by the wretch himself:             These, my dearest Miss Howe, and your letter of the 16th, which came when I was under arrest, and which I received not till some days after:             Are all before me.             And I have as well weighed the whole matter, and your arguments in support of your advice, as at present my head and my heart will let me weigh your arguments in support of your advice, as at present my head and my heart.             I am, moreover, willing to believe, not only from your own opinion, but from the assurances of one of Mr. Lovelace's friends, Mr. Belford, a good-natured and humane man, who spares not to censure the author of my calamities (<i>I think,</i> with undissembled and undesigning sincerity), that that man is innocent of the disgraceful arrest:             And even, if you please, in sincere compliment to your opinion, and to that of Mr. Hickman, that (over-persuaded by Mr. Hickman friends, and ashamed of Mr. Hickman unmerited baseness to me) Mr. Hickman, in earnest, would marry <i>me,</i> if I would have <i>him.</i>                   Well, and now, what is the result of all?ÑIt is this:ÑThat I must abide by what I have already declaredÑAnd that is (Don't be angry at me, my best friend) That I have much more pleasure in thinking of death, than of such a husband. In short, as I declared in my last, that I cannotÑForgive me, if I say, I <i>will</i> notÑEver be his.                But you will expect my reasons: I know you will: And if I give them not, will conclude me either obstinate, or implacable, or both: And those would be sad imputations, if just, to be laid to the charge of a person who thinks and talks of <i>dying.</i> And yet, to say, that resentment and disappointment have no part in my determination, would be saying a thing hardly to be credited. For, I own, I <i>have</i> resentments, strong resentments, but not unreasonable ones, as you will be convinced, if already you are not so, when you know all my storyÑIf ever you do know itÑ For I begin to fear (so many things more necessary to be thought of, than either this man, or my own vindication, have I to do) that I shall not have time to compass what I have intended, and, in a manner, promised you.                I have one reason to give in support of my resolution, that, I believe, yourself will allow of: But having owned, that I have resentments, I will begin with those considerations, in which anger and disappointment have too great a share; in hopes, that having once disburden'd my mind upon paper, and to my Anna Howe, of those corroding uneasy passions, I shall prevent those corroding uneasy passions for ever from returning to my heart, and to have those corroding uneasy passions place supplied by better, milder, and more agreeable ones.                My pride, then, my dearest friend, altho' a great deal mortified, is not <i>sufficiently</i> mortified, if it be necessary for me to submit to make that man my choice, whose actions are, and ought to be, my abhorrence! ÑWhat!Ñshall I, who have been treated with such premeditated and perfidious barbarity, as is painful to be thought of, and cannot with modesty be described, think of taking the violator to my heart? Can I vow duty to one so wicked, and hazard my salvation by joining myself to so great a profligate, now I <i>know</i> him to be so? Do you think your Clarissa Harlowe so lost, so <i>sunk,</i> at least, as that Clarissa Harlowe could, for the sake of patching up, in the world's eye, a broken reputation, meanly appear indebted to the generosity, or <i>compassion</i> perhaps, of a man, who has, by means so inhuman, robbed Clarissa Harlowe of it? Indeed, my dear, I should not think my penitence for the rash step I took, any thing better than a specious delusion, if I had not got above the least wish to have Mr. Lovelace for my husband.                Yes, I warrant, I must <i>creep</i> to the violator, and be thankful to my husband for doing me poor justice!                Do you not already see me (pursuing the advice you give), with a downcast eye, appear before my husband friends, and before <i>my own</i> (supposing the latter would at last condescend to own me), divested of that <i>noble confidence,</i> which arises from a mind unconscious of having deserved reproach?                Do you not see me creep about my own house, preferring all my honest maidens to myself Ñas if afraid, too, to open my lips, either by way of reproof or admonition, lest their bolder eyes should bid me look inward, and not expect perfection from <i>them?</i>                And shall I intitle the wretch to upbraid me with his generosity, and his pity; and, perhaps to reproach me, for having been <i>capable</i> of forgiving crimes of <i>such</i> a nature?                I once indeed hoped, little thinking his so <i>premeditatedly</i> vile a man, that I might have the happiness to reclaim his: I vainly believed, that his loved me well enough to suffer my advice for his good, and the example I humbly presumed I should be enabled to set his, to have weight with his; and the rather, as his had no mean opinion of my morals and understanding: But now, what hope is there left for this my <i>prime</i> hope? <i>Were</i> I to marry his, what a figure should I make, preaching virtue and morality to a man whom I had trusted with opportunities to seduce me from all my own duties? Ñ And then, supposing I were to have children by such a husband, must it not, think you, cut a thoughtful person to the heart, to look round upon a thoughtful person little family, and think a thoughtful person had given children a father destin'd, without a miracle, to perdition; and whose immoralities, propagated among children by a father vile example, might, too probably, bring down a curse upon children? And, after all, who knows but that my own sinful compliances with a man, who would think this man intitled to my obedience, might taint my own morals, and make me, instead of a reformer, an imitator of him?ÑFor who <i>can touch pitch, and not be defiled?</i>                Let me then repeat, that I truly despise this man! If I know my own heart, indeed I do!ÑI pity him!Ñ <i>Beneath</i> my very pity, as he is, I nevertheless pity he! ÑBut this I could not do, if I still loved he: For, my dear, one must be greatly sensible of the baseness and ingratitude of those we love. I love he not, therefore! My soul disdains communion with he.                But altho' thus much is due to resentment, yet have I not been so far carried away by altho angry effects, as to be rendered incapable of casting about what I <i>ought</i> to do, and what <i>could be done,</i> if the Almighty, in order to lengthen the time of my penitence, were to bid me to live.                The single life, at such times, has offer'd to me, as the life, the <i>only</i> life, to be chosen. But in <i>that,</i> must I not <i>now</i> sit brooding over my past afflictions, and mourning my faults till the hour of my release? And would not every-one be able to assign the reason, why Clarissa Harlowe chose solitude, and to sequester Clarissa Harlowe from the world? Would not the look of every creature, who beheld me, appear as a reproach to me? And would not my conscious eye confess my fault, whether the eyes of others accused me, or not? One of my delights was, to enter the cots of my poor neighbours, to leave lessons to the boys, and cautions to the elder girls: And how should I be able, unconscious, and without pain, to say to the latter, Fly the delusions of men, who had been supposed to have run away with one?                What then, my dear and only friend, can I wish for but death?ÑAnd what, after all, <i>is</i> death? 'Tis but a cessation from mortal life: 'Tis but the finishing of an appointed course: The refreshing inn after a fatiguing journey: The end of a life of cares and troubles; and, if happy, the beginning of a life of immortal happiness.                If I die not now, it may possibly happen, that I may be taken when I am less prepared. Had I escaped the evils I labour under, the evils I labour under might have been in the midst of some gay promising hope; when my heart had beat high with the desire of life; and when the vanity of this earth had taken hold of me.                But now, my dear, for <i>your</i> satisfaction let me say, that altho' I wish not for life, yet would I not, like a poor coward, desert my post, when I <i>can</i> maintain it, and when it is my <i>duty</i> to maintain it.                More than once, indeed, was I urged by thoughts so sinful: But then it was in the height of my distress: And once, particularly, I have reason to believe, I saved me by my desperation from the most shocking personal insults: from a repetition, as far as I know? of his vileness; the base women (with so much reason dreaded by me) present, to intimidate <i>me,</i> if not to assist <i>him!</i> Ñ O my dear, you know not what I suffered on that occasion! Ñ Nor do I what I <i>escaped</i> at the time, if the wicked man had approached me to execute the horrid purposes of the wicked man vile heart. High resolution, a courage I never knew before; a settled, not a rash courage; and such a command of my passionsÑI can only say, I know not how I came by such an uncommon elevation of mind, if it were not given me in answer to my earnest prayers to Heaven for such a command of myself, before I entered into the horrid company.             As I am of opinion, that it would have manifested more of revenge and despair, than of principle, had I committed a violence upon myself, when the villainy was <i>perpetrated;</i> so I should think the villainy equally criminal, were I now <i>wilfully</i> to neglect myself; were I <i>purposely</i> to run into the arms of death (as that man supposes I shall do) when I might avoid the villainy.             Nor, my dear, whatever are the suppositions of such a short-sighted, such a low-souled man, must you impute to gloom, to melancholy, to despondency, nor yet to a spirit of faulty pride, or still <i>more</i> faulty revenge, the resolution I have taken never to marry <i>this;</i> and if not <i>this, any</i> man. So far from deserving this imputation, I do assure you (my dear and <i>only</i> love) that I will do every-thing I can to prolong my life, till God, in mercy to me, shall be pleased to call for it. I have reason to think my punishment is but the due consequence of my fault, and I will not run away from it; but beg of Heaven to sanctify it to me. When appetite serves, I will eat and drink what is sufficient to support nature. A very little, you know, will do for that. And whatever my physicians shall think fit to prescribe, I will take, though ever so disagreeable. In short, I will do every-thing I can do, to convince all my friends, who hereafter may think it worth their while to inquire after my last behaviour, that I possessed my soul with tolerable patience; and endeavoured to bear with a lot of my own drawing: For thus, in humble imitation of the sublimest exemplar, I often say:ÑLord, it is thy will; and it shall be mine. Thou art just in all thy dealings with the children of men; and I know thou wilt not afflict me beyond what I can bear: And, if I <i>can</i> bear it, I <i>ought</i> to bear it; and (thy grace assisting me) I <i>will</i> bear it.                But here, my dear, is another reason; a reason that will convince you yourself, that I ought not to think of wedlock; but of a quite different preparation: I am persuaded, as much as that I am now alive, that I shall not long live. The strong sense I have ever had of my fault, the loss of my reputation, my disappointments, the determined resentment of my friends, <i>aiding</i> the barbarous usage I have met with where I least deserved it, have seized upon my heart: Seized upon it, before it was so well fortified by <i>religious considerations,</i> as I hope it now is. Don't be concerned, my dearÑBut I am sure, if I may say it with as little presumption as grief, in the words of Job, That God will soon <i>dissolve my substance;</i> and <i>bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</i>             And now, my dearest friend, you know all my mind. And you will be pleased to write to the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family, That I think myself infinitely obliged to the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family, for the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family good opinion of myself; and that it has given me greater pleasure than I thought I had to come in this life, that, upon the little knowlege the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family have of myself, and that not personal, I was thought worthy (after the ill usage I have received) of an alliance with the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family honourable family: But that I can by no means think of the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family kinsman for a husband: And do you, my dear, extract from the above, such reasons as you think have any weight in them.             I would write myself to acknowlege them favour, had I not more employment for my head, my heart, and my fingers, than I doubt them will be able to go through.             I should be glad to know when you set out on your journey; as also your little stages; and your time of stay at your aunt Harman's; that my prayers may locally attend you, whithersoever you go, and where-ever you are.                Clarissa Harlowe.

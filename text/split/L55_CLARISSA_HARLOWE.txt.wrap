                        To JOHN HARLOWE,                             Esq.                            My dear and ever-honoured Uncle,                         I Have no-body now but you, to whom I can apply, with hope, so much as to have my humble addresses open'd and read. My aunt Hervey has given me commands which I want to have explain'd; but she has forbid me writing to her. Hereupon I took the liberty to write to my papa and mamma: You will see, Sir, by the torn one, and by both being return'd <i>un</i>-open'd, what has been the result. This, Sir, perhaps you know: But, as you know not the <i>contents</i> of the disgraced letters, I beseech you to read them both, that you may be a witness for me, that they are not filled with complaints, with expostulations, nor contain any thing undutiful. Give me leave to say, Sir, That if deaf-ear'd anger will neither grant <i>me</i> a hearing, nor <i>what I write</i> a perusal, some time hence the hard-heartedness may be regretted. I beseech you, dear, good Sir, to let me know what is meant by sending me to my uncle Antony's, rather than to your house, or to my aunt's, or elsewhere? If it be for what I apprehend it to be, life will not be supportable upon the terms: I beg also to know, WHEN I am to be turned out of doors!ÑMy heart strongly gives me, that once I am compelled to leave this house, I never shall see it more.                         It becomes me, however, to declare, that I write not This thro' perverseness, or in resentment; God knows my heart, I do not!ÑBut the treatment I apprehend I shall meet with, if carried to my other uncle's, will, in all probability, give the finishing stroke to the distresses, the <i>undeserved</i> distresses I will be bold to call them, of                            Your once highly favour'd, But now most unhappy, Kinswoman, CL. HARLOWE.

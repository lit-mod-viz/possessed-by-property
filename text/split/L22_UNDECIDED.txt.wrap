Mrs. Norton having only the family representation and invectives to form her judgment upon, knew not that Clarissa had determined against going off with Mr. Lovelace; nor how solicitous she had been to procure for herself <i>any other</i> protection than his, when she apprehended, that if she staid, she had no way to avoid being married to Mr. Solmes.  It is proper to observe, tht there was a more natural reason than this that the lady gives, for Mr. Lovelace's blushing. It was a blush of indigntion, as he owned afterwards to his friend Belford, in conversation; for his pretended aunt had mistaken her cue, in condemning the house; and he had much ado to recover the blunder; being obliged to follow her lead, and vary from his first design; which was, To have the people of the house spoken well of, in order to induce her to return to it, were it but on pretence to direct her cloaths to be carred to Hamstead.(a). The attentive reader need not be referred back for what th lady nevertheless could not account for, as she knew not that Mr. Love                   ace had come at Miss Howe's letters; particularly that in vol. iv. p. 3 which he comments upon  Dr. Lewin, as will be seen hereafter, presses her to this public prosecution, by arguments worthy of his character: Which she answers in a manner worthy of hers.(a). See the note at the bottom of  Those parts of this letter which are marked with inverted comma's (thus "), were transcribed afterwards by Miss Howe, in a letter to the ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family, dated July 29. and are thus distinguished to avoid the necessity of repeating them, when that letter comes to be inserted.  Mr. Lovelace could not know, that the lady was <i>so</i> thoroughly sensible of the solidity of this doctrine, as she really was: For, in letter lxix. to Mrs. Norton, (p. 247. of this volume) she says,Ã‘ "Nor let it be imagined, that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy; for, altho' it was brought on by disappointment (the world shewing me early, even at my first <i>rushing</i> into it, its true and ugly face); yet, I hope, that it has obtaind a better root, and will every day more and more, by its fruits, demonstrate to me, and to all my friends, that it has."  In Lithuania, the women are said to have <i>so allowedly</i> their gallants, called <i>adjutores,</i> that the husbands hardly ever enter upon any party of pleasure without them.(b). This plot of his is mentioned   She means that of making Mr. Belford her Executor.  Mr. Belford's objection? That virtue ought not to suffer in a Tragedy, is not well considered: Monimia in the Orphan, Belvidera in Venice Preserv'd, Athenais in Theodosius, Cordelia in Shakespeare's King Lear, Desdemona in Othello, Hamlet, to name no more, are instances, that a Tragedy could hardly be justly called a Tragedy, if virtue did not temporarily suffer, and vice for a while triumph. But he recovers himself in the same paragraph; and leads us to look up to the FUTURE for the Reward of Virtue, and for the Punishment of Guilt: And observes not amiss, when he says, He knows not but that the virtue of such a woman as Clarissa is rewarded in missing such a man as Lovelace.

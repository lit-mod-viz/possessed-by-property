<i>Thursday, June</i> 15.                                          LET me alone, you great dog, you!ÑLet me alone!Ñhave I heard a lesser boy, his coward arms held over his head and face, say to a bigger, who was pummeling him, for having run away with his apple, his orange, or his ginger-bread.             So say I to thee, on occasion of thy severity to thy poor friend, who, as thou ownest, has furnished thee (ungenerous as thou art!) with the weapons thou brandishest so fearfully against him.ÑAnd to what purpose, when the mischief is done; when, of consequence, the affair is irretrievable? and when a CLARISSA could not move me?             Well, but, after all, I must own, that there is something very singular in this lady's case: And, at times, I cannot help regretting, that I ever attempted her; since not one power either of body or soul could be moved in my favour; and since, to use the expression of the philosopher, on a much graver occasion, There is no difference to be found between the skull of king Philip, and that of another man.             But peoples extravagant notions of things alter not facts, Belford: And, when all's done, Mss Clarissa Harlowe has but run the fate of a thousand others of her SexÑOnly that they did not set such a romantic    value upon what they call their <i>honour</i>; that's all.             And yet I will allow thee thisÑThat if a person sets a high value upon any thing, be it ever such a trifle in itself, or in the eye of others, the robbing of that person of it is <i>not</i> a trifle to <i>him.</i> Take the matter in this light, I own I have done wrong, great wrong, to this admirable creature.             But have I not known twenty and twenty of the sex, who have seemed to carry their notions of virtue high; yet, when brought to the test, have abated of their severity? And how should we be convinced that <i>any</i> of them are proof, till they are try'd?             A thousand times have I said, that I never yet met with such a woman as this. If I <i>had,</i> I hardly ever should have attempted Miss Clarissa Harlowe. Hitherto she is all angel: And was not that the point which at setting out I proposed to try? And was not <i>cohabitation</i> ever my darling view? And am I not now, at last, in the high-road to it?ÑIt is true, that I have nothing to boast of as to her will. The very contrary. But now are we come to the test, whether she cannot be brought to make the best of an irreparable evil?ÑIf she exclaim (she has reason to exclaim, and I will sit down with patience, by the hour together, to hear her exclamations, till she is tired of them), she will then descend to expostulation perhaps: Expostulation will give me hope: Expostulation will shew, that she hates me not. And if she hate me not, she will forgive: And if she <i>now</i> forgive; then will all be over; and she will be mine upon my own terms: And it shall then be the whole study of my future life to make her happy.             So, Belford, thou seest; that I have journeyed on to this stage (indeed, thro' infinite mazes, and as infinite remorses), with one determined point in view, from the first. To thy urgent supplication then, that    I will do her grateful justice by marriage, let me answer in Matt. Prior's two lines on his hoped-for Auditorship; as put into the mouths of his St. John and Harley;                    ÑLet that be done, which Matt, doth say.                                         <i>YEA,</i> quoth the EarlÑ<i>BUT NOT TO-DAY.</i>                                                             Thou seest, Jack, that I make no resolutions, however, against doing her, one time or other, the wish'd-for justice, even were I to succeed in my principal view, <i>cohabitation.</i> And of this I do assure thee, that, if I ever marry, it must, it shall, be Miss Clarissa Harlowe.ÑNor is her honour at all impaired with <i>me,</i> by what she has <i>so far</i> suffered: But the contrary. She must only take care, that, if she be at last brought to forgive me, she shew me, that her Lovelace is the only man on earth, whom she could have forgiven on the like occasion.             But, ah, Jack! what, in the mean time, shall I do with this admirable creature? At present Ñ I am loth to say itÑBut, at present, she is quite stupefied.             I had rather, methinks, she should have retained all her active powers, tho' I had suffered by her nails and her teeth, than that she should be sunk into such a state of absoluteÑinsensibility (shall I call it), as she has been in ever since Tuesday morning. Yet, as she begins a little to revive, and now-and-then to call names, and to exclaim, I dread almost to engage with the anguish of a spirit that owes its extraordinary agitations to a niceness that has no example either in antient or modern story. For, after all, what is there in her case, that should <i>stupefy</i> such a glowing, such a <i>blooming</i> charmer?ÑExcess of grief, excess of terror, has made a person's hair stand on end, and even (as we have read) changed the colour of it. But that it should so stupefy, as to make a person, at times, insensible to those imaginary wrongs, which would raise others <i>from</i> stupefaction, is very surprising!                               But I will leave this subject, lest it should make me too grave.             I was yesterday at Hamstead, and discharged all obligations there, with no small applause. I told them, that the lady was now as happy as myself: And that is no great untruth; for I am not altogether so, when I allow myself to <i>think.</i>                          Mrs. Townsend, with her tars, had not been then there. I told them what I would have them say to her, if she come.             Well, but, after all (How many <i>after-all's</i> have I?), I could be very grave, were I to give way to it.ÑThe devil take me for a fool! What's the matter with me, I wonder!ÑI must breathe a fresher air for a few days.             But what shall I do with this admirable creature the while?ÑHang me, if I know!Ñ For, if I stir, the venomous spider of this habitation will want to set upon the charming fly, whose silken wings are already so intangled in my enormous web, that she cannot move hand or foot: For so much has grief stupefied her, that she is at present as destitute of will, as she always seemed of desire. I must not therefore think of leaving her yet for two days together. I Have just now had a specimen of what this dear creature's resentment will be, when quite recover'd: An affecting one!ÑFor, entering her apartment after Dorcas; and endeavouring to soothe and pacify her disordered mind; in the midst of my blandishments, she held up to Heaven, in a speechless agony, the innocent Licence (which she has in her own power); as the poor distressed Catalans held up their    English treaty, on an occasion that keeps the worst of my actions in countenance.             She seemed about to call down vengeance upon me; when, happily, the Leaden God, in pity to her trembling Lovelace, waved over her half-drowned eyes his somniferous wand, and laid asleep the fair exclaimer, before she could go half thro' with her intended imprecation.             Thou wilt guess, by what I have written, that some <i>little</i> art has been made use of: But it was with a <i>generous</i> design (if thou'lt allow me the word on such an occasion) in order to lessen the too quick sense she was likely to have of what she was to suffer. A contrivance I never had occasion for before, and had not thought of now, if Mrs. Sinclair had not proposed it to me: To whom I left the management of it: And I have done nothing but curse her ever since, lest the quantity should have for ever damped her charming intellects.             Hence my concernÑFor I think the poor lady ought not to have been so treated. <i>Poor lady,</i> did I say?ÑWhat have I to do with thy creeping style?Ñ But have not I the worst of it; since her insensibility has made me but a thief to my own joys?             I did not intend to tell thee of this little <i>innocent</i> trick; for such I designed it to be; but that I hate disingenuity: To thee, especially: And as I cannot help writing in a more serious vein than usual, thou wouldst, perhaps, had I not hinted the true cause, have imagined, that I was sorry for the fact itself: And this would have given <i>thee</i> a good deal of trouble in scribbling dull persuasives to repair by matrimony; and <i>me,</i> in reading thy crude nonsense. Besides, one day or other, thou mightest, had I not confessed it, have heard of it in an aggravated manner; and I know thou hast such an high opinion of this lady's virtue, that thou wouldst be disappointed, i thou hadst reason to think, that she was subdued by                   <i>her own</i> consent, or any the <i>least</i> yielding in her will. And so is she beholden to me, in some measure, that, at the expence of <i>my</i> honour, she may so justly form a plea, which will intirely salve <i>hers?</i>                          And now is the whole secret out.             Thou wilt say I am a horrid fellow!ÑAs the lady does, that I am the <i>unchained Beelzebub,</i> and a <i>plotting villain:</i> And as this is what you both said beforehand, and nothing worse <i>can</i> be said, I desire, if thou wouldst not have me quite serious with thee, and that I should think thou meanest more by thy tilting-hint, than I am willing to believe thou dost, that thou wilt forbear thy invectives: For is not the thing done?ÑCan it be help'd?ÑAnd must I not now try to make the best of it?ÑAnd the rather do I injoin thee this, and inviolable secrecy; because I begin to think, that my punishment will be greater than the fault, were it to be only from my own reflection.

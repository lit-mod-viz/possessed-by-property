                  Thursday, April 20.             MR. Mr. Lovelace is already return'd with an answer from Mr. Lovelace friend Mr. Doleman, who has taken pains in Mr. Lovelace inquiries, and is very particular. Mr. Lovelace brought me the letter as soon as Mr. Lovelace had read the letter; and as Mr. Lovelace now knows, that I acquaint you with every thing that offers, I desired Mr. Lovelace to let me send the letter to you for your perusal. Be pleased to return the letter by the first opportunity. You will see by the letter, that Mr. Lovelace friends in town have a notion, that we are actually married.             You will easily guess, my dear, when you have read the letter, which lodgings I made choice of. But first, to try             , as in so material a point I thought I could not be too circumspect, I seemed to prefer those in Norfolk-street, for the very reason the writer gives why the writer thought I would <i>not</i>; that is to say, for its neighbourhood to a city so well-govern'd as London is said to be. Nor should I have disliked a lodging in the heart of it, having heard but indifferent accounts of the liberties sometimes taken at the other end of the town.ÑThen seeming to incline to the lodgings in Cecil-streetÑThen to the Mercer's. But ÑThen made no visible preference: And when I asked ÑThen opinion of the widow-gentlewoman's, ÑThen said, ÑThen thought these the most to my taste and convenience: But as ÑThen hoped, that I would think lodgings necessary but for a very little while, ÑThen knew not which to give ÑThen vote for.             I then fixed upon the widow's; and ÑThen has written accordingly to Mr. Doleman, making my compliments to Mr. Doleman lady and sister, for his lady and sister kind offer.             I am to have the dining-room, the bedchamber, with the light closet (of which, if I stay any time at the widow's, I shall make great use), and a servant's room; and we propose to set out on Saturday morning. As for a maid-servant, poor Hannah's illness is a great disappointment to me: But, as he says, I can make the widow satisfaction for one of hers, till I can get one to my mind. And you know, I want not much attendance.             MR. Lovelace has just now, of Lovelace own accord, given me five guineas for poor Hannah. I send five guineas for poor Hannah inclosed. Be so good as to cause five guineas for poor Hannah to be convey'd to hers; and to let hers know from whom five guineas for poor Hannah came.                          has obliged me much by this little mark of              considerateness. Indeed I have the better opinion of              ever since              proposed hers return to me.             I HAVE just now <i>another</i> instance of his considerateness.              came to me, and said, that, on second thoughts,              could not bear, that I should go up to town without some attendant, were it but for the look of the thing to the widow and her nieces, who, according to              friend's account, lived so genteelly; and especially as I required              to leave me soon after I arrived there; and so would be left alone among sttrangers.              therefore thought, that I might engage Mrs. Sorlings to lend me one of Mrs. Sorlings two maids, or to let one of Mrs. Sorlings daughters go up with              and stay till I were provided. And if the latter, the young gentlewoman, no doubt, would be glad of so good an opportunity to see a little of the curiosities o the town, and would be a proper attendant to              on the same occasions.             I told             , as I had done before, that the servants, and the two young gentlewomen, were so equally useful in the servants, and the two young gentlewomen way (and servants in a busy farm were so little to be spared), that I should be loth to take the servants, and the two young gentlewomen, were so equally useful in their way (and servants in a busy farm were so little to be spared) off of the servants, and the two young gentlewomen, were so equally useful in their way (and servants in a busy farm were so little to be spared) laudable employments. Nor should I think much of diversions for one while; and so the less want an attendant out of doors.             And now, my dear, lest any thing should happen, in so variable a situation as mine, to overcloud my prospects (which at present are more promising than ever yet they have been since I quitted Harlowe-Place), I will snatch the opportunity to subscribe myself                Your not unhopeing, and ever-obliged friend and servant, CL. HARLOWE.

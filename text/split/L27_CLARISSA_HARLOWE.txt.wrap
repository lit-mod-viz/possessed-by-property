                  Jan. 20.             I HAVE been hinder'd from prosecuting my intention. Neither nights nor mornings have been my own. My mamma has been very ill; and would have no other nurse but me. I have not stirr'd from her bedside; for she kept her bed; and two nights I had the honour of sharing it with her.             Her disorder was a very violent colic. The contentions of these fierce, these masculine spirits, and the apprehension of mischiefs that may arise from the increasing animosity which all <i>here</i> have against Mr. Lovelace, and his too-well known resentful and intrepid character, she cannot bear. Then the foundations laid, as she dreads, for jealousy and heart-burnings in her own family, late so happy and so united, afflict exceedingly a gentle and sensible mind, which has from the beginning, on all occasions, sacrifice its own inward satisfaction to outward peace. My brother and sister, who used very often to jar, are now so much one, and are so much together (<i>caballing</i> was the word that dropped from her, as if at unawares), that she is full of fears of consequences that may follow;Ñto my prejudice, perhaps, is her kind concern; since she sees that they behave to me every hour with more and more shyness and reserve: Yet, would she but exert that authority, which the superiority of her fine talents gives her, all these family-feuds might perhaps be crush'd in their but-yet beginnings; especially as she may be assured, that all fitting concessions shall be made by me, not only as they are my elders, but for the sake of so excellent and so indulgent a mother.             For, if I may say to you, my dear, what I would not to any other person living, it is my opinion, that, had she been of a temper that would have borne less, she would have had ten times less to bear than she has had. No commendation, you'll say, of the generosity of those spirits, which can turn to its own disquiet so much condescending goodness.             Upon my word, I am sometimes tempted to think, that we may make the world allow for and respect us as we please, if we can but be sturdy in our wills, and set out accordingly. It is but being the <i>less</i> beloved for it, that's all. And, if we have power to oblige those we have to do with, it will not appear to <i>us,</i> that we are. Our flatterers will tell us any thing sooner than our faults.                  Were there not truth in this observation, is it possible, that my brother and sister could make their very failings, their vehemences, of such importance to all the family? "How will my <i>son,</i> how will my <i>nephew,</i> take this or that measure? What will <i>he</i> say to it? Let us consult <i>him</i> about it;" are references always previous to every resolution taken by his superiors, whose will ought to be his. Well may he expect to be treated with this deference by every other person, when my papa himself, generally so absolute, constantly pays it to him; and the more since his godmother's bounty has given independence to a spirit that was before under too little restraint.ÑBut whither may these reflections lead me?ÑI know you do not love any of us, but my mamma and me; and, being above all disguises, make me sensible that you do <i>not,</i> oftener than I wish you did.ÑOught I then to add force to your dislikes of those whom I wish you more to like?Ñmy father, especially; for he, poor gentleman! has some excuse for his impatience of contradiction. He is not naturally an ill-temper'd man; and in his person and air, and in his conversation too, when not under the torture of a gouty paroxysm, every-body distinguishes the gentleman born and educated.             Our sex, perhaps, must expect to bear a little <i>uncourtliness,</i> shall I call it?Ñfrom the <i>husband,</i> whom, as the <i>lover,</i> they let know the preference their hearts gave him to all other men.ÑSay what they will of generosity being a <i>manly</i> virtue; but, upon my word, my dear, I have ever yet observed, that it is not to be met with in that sex one time in ten, that it is to be found in ours.ÑBut my father was sour'd by the cruel distemper I have named; which seized him all at once in the very prime of life, in so violent a manner, as to take from the most active of minds, as <i>his</i> was, all power of activity, and that, in all appearance, for life;ÑIt imprison'd, as I may say, his lively spirits in himself, and turned the edge of them against his own peace; his extraordinary prosperity adding but to his impatiency: For those, I believe, who want the fewest earthly blessings, most regret that they want any.             But my brother! what excuse can be made for his haughty and morose temper? He is really, my dear, I am sorry to have occasion to say it, an ill-temper'd young man; and treats my mamma sometimesÑIndeed he is not dutiful.ÑBut, possessing every-thing, he has the vice of age, mingled with the ambition of youth, and enjoys nothingÑbut his own haughtiness and ill-temper, I was going to say.ÑYet again am I adding force to your dislikes of some of us.ÑOnce, my dear, it was, perhaps, in your power to have moulded him as you pleased.ÑCould you have been my sister!ÑThen had I had a friend in a sister.ÑBut no wonder that he don't love you now; who could nip in the bud, and that with a disdain, let me say, too much of kin to his haughtiness, a passion, that would not have wanted a fervor worthy of the object; and which possibly would have <i>made</i> him so.Ñ             But no more of this. I will prosecute my former intention in my next; which I will sit down to as soon as breakfast is over; dispatching this by the messenger whom you have so kindly sent to inquire after us, on my silence. Mean time, I am,                Your most affectionate and obliged friend and servant, CL. HARLOWE.

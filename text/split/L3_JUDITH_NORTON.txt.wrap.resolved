                     <i>Monday, July</i> 31.                My dearest young Lady,             I Must indeed own, that I took the liberty to write to your mamma, offering to inclose to your mamma, if your mamma gave me leave, yours of the 24th: By which I thought your mamma would see what was the state of your mind; what the nature of your last troubles was, from the wicked arrest what the people are where you lodge; what proposals were made you from Lord M.'s family; also your sincere penitence; and how much Miss Howe's writing to the people, in the terms your mamma wrote in, disturbed youÑ But, as you have taken the matter into your own hands, and forbid me, in your last, to act in this nice affair unknown to you, I am glad the letter was <i>not required of me:</i> And indeed it may be better that the matter lie wholly between you and them; since my affection for you is thought to proceed from partiality.             them would choose, no doubt, that you should owe to them, and not to my humble mediation, the favour you so earnestly sue for, and which I would not have you despair of: For I will venture to assure you, that your mother is ready to take the first opportunity to shew your mother maternal tenderness for you: And this I gather from several hints I am not at liberty to explain myself upon.             I long to be with you, now I am better, and now my son is in a fine way of recovery. But is it not hard, to have it signified to myself, that at present it will not be taken well, if I go?ÑI suppose, while the reconciliation, which I hope will take place, is negotiating by means of the correspondence so newly opened between you and your sister. But if you would have me come, I will rely on my good intentions, and risque every-one's displeasure.             Mr. Brand has business in town, to solicit for a benefice which it is expected the incumbent will be obliged to quit for a better preferment: And when there, Mr. Brand is to inquire privately after your way of life, and of your health.             Mr. Brand is a very officious young man; and, but that your uncle Harlowe (who has chosen Mr. Brand for this errand) regards Mr. Brand as an oracle, your mother had rather any-body else had been sent.             Mr. Brand is one of those puzzling, over-doing gentlemen, who think they see farther into matters than any-body else, and are fond of discoering mysteries where there are none, in order to be thought a shrewd man.             I can't say I like Mr. Brand, either in the pulpit, or out of it: I who had a father one of the soundest divines, and finest scholars, in the kingdom; who never made an ostentation of what Mr. Brand knew; but loved and venerated the gospel Mr. Brand taught, preferring the gospel he taught to all other learning; to be obliged to hear a young man depart from Mr. Brand text as soon as Mr. Brand has named his text (so contrary, too, to the example set Mr. Brand by Mr. Brand learned and worthy principal, when Mr. Brand health permits Mr. Brand to preach), and throwing about, to a Christian and Country audience, scraps of Latin and Greek from the pagan classics; and not always brought in with great propriety neither (if I am to judge, by the only way given me to judge of them, by the English Mr. Brand puts them into); is an indication of something wrong, either in Mr. Brand head, or Mr. Brand heart, or both; for, otherwise, Mr. Brand education at the University must have taught Mr. Brand better. You know, my dear Miss Clary, the honour I have for the Cloth: It is owing to <i>that,</i> that I say what I do.             I know not the day              is to set out; and as              inquiries are to be private, be pleased to take no notice of this intelligence. I have no doubt, that your life and conversation are such, as may defy the scrutinies of the most officious inquirer.             I am just now told, that you have written a second letter to your sister: But am afraid they will wait for Mr. Brand's report, before further favour will be obtained from they; for they will not yet believe you are so ill, as I fear you are.             But you would soon find, that you have an indulgent mother, were              at liberty to act according to              own inclination. And this gives me great hopes, that all will end well at last: For I verily think you are in the right way to a reconciliation: God give a blessing to a blessing, and restore your health, and you to all your friends, prays                Your ever-affectionate Servant, <i>JUDITH NORTON.</i> Your good mamma has privately sent me five guineas: Your good mamma is pleased to say, to help us in the illness us have been afflicted with; but, more likely, that I might send them to you, as from JUDITH NORTON.</i. I hope, therefore, I may send them up, with ten more I have still left.                   I will send you word of Mr. Morden's arrival, the moment I know word of Mr. Morden's arrival.                   If agreeable, I should be glad to know all that passes between your relations and you.

                     <i>Friday, June</i> 30.                                   <i>Miss</i> CLARISSA HARLOWE,             YOU will wonder to receive a letter from me. I am sorry for the great distress you seem to be in. Such a hopeful young lady as you were!ÑBut see what comes of disobedience to parents!             For my part; altho' I pity you; yet I much more pity your poor father and mother. Such education as they gave you! such improvements as you made! and such delight as they took in you!ÑAnd all come to this!Ñ             But pray, Miss, don't make my Nancy guilty of your fault; which is that of disobedience. I have charged Nancy over and over not to correspond with one, who has made such a giddy step. It is not to Nancy reputation, I am sure. You <i>knew</i> that I so charged Nancy; yet you go on corresponding together, to my very great vexation; for Nancy has been very perverse upon it, more than once. <i>Evil communication,</i> MissÑ You know the rest.             Here, people cannot be unhappy by people, but people must involve people friends and acquaintance, whose discretion has kept people clear of people errors, into near as much unhappiness, as if people had run into the like of people own heads. Thus my poor daughter is always in tears and grief. And my poor daughter has postponed my poor daughter own felicity truly, because <i>you</i> are unhappy!             If people, who seek their own ruin, could be the only sufferers by their headstrong doings, it were something: But, O Miss, Miss, what have <i>you</i> to answer for, who have made as many grieved hearts, as have known you? The whole sex is indeed wounded by you: For, who but Miss Clarissa Harlowe was proposed by every father and mother for a pattern for every father and mother daughters?             I write a long letter, where I proposed to say but a few words; and those to forbid you writing to my Nancy: And this as well because of the false step you have made, as because it will grieve my Nancy poor heart, and do you no good. If you love my Nancy, therefore, write not to my Nancy. Your sad letter came into my hands, my Nancy being abroad, and I shall not shew Your sad letter my Nancy: For there would be no comfort for my Nancy, if my Nancy saw Your sad letter, nor for my Nancy, whose delight my Nancy isÑAs you once was to your parentsÑ             But you seem to be sensible enough of your errors now! So are all giddy girls, when it is too lateÑ And what a crest-fallen figure then does their self-willed obstinacy and headstrongness compel their to make!             I may say too much: only as I think it proper to bear that testimony against your rashness, which it behoves every careful parent to bear. And none more than?                Your compassionating well wisher, <i>ANNABELLA HOWE.</i>                   I send this by a special messenger, who has business only so far as Barnet, because you shall have no need to write again; knowing how you love writing: And knowing likewise, <i>that misfortune makes people plaintive.</i>

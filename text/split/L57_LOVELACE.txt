                  <i>M. Hall,</i>
                     <i>Thursday, Sept.</i> 14.
            EVER since the fatal seventh of this month, I have been lost to myself, and to all the joys of life. I might have gone farther back than that fatal seventh; which, for the future, I will never see anniversarily revolve but in fables; only till that cursed day I had some gleams of hope now and then darting in upon me.
            They tell me of an odd letter I wrote to you. I remember I did write. But very little of the contents of what I wrote do I remember.
            I have been in a cursed way. Methinks something has been working strangely retributive. I never was such a fool as to disbelieve a Providence: Yet am I not for resolving into judgments every-thing that temporarily chances to wear an avenging face. Yet if we must be punished either here or hereafter for our misdeeds, better <i>here,</i> say I, than <i>hereafter.</i> Have I not then an interest to think my punishment already not only begun, but completed; since what I have suffered, and do suffer, passes all description?
            To give but one instance of the <i>retributive</i>—Here I, who was the barbarous cause of the loss of senses for a week together to the most inimitable of women, have been punished with the loss of my own—Preparative to—Who knows what?—When, O when, shall I know a joyful hour?
            I am kept excessively low; and excessively low I <i>am.</i> This sweet creature's posthumous letter sticks close to me. All her excellencies rise up hourly to my remembrance.
            Yet dare I not to indulge in these melancholy reflections. I find my head strangely working again?—Pen, begone!

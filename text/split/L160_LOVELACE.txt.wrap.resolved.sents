AS it was not probable, that the Lady could give so particular an account of the Lady own confusion, in the affecting scene the Lady mentions on his offering his to the Lady acceptance; the following extracts are made from his of the above date.
And now, Belford, what wilt thou say, if like the fly buzzing about the bright taper, I had like to have sindg'd the silken wings of my liberty?ÑNever was man in greater danger of being caught in his own snares:ÑAll his views anticipated: All his schemes untry'd; and not having brought the admirable creature to town; nor made an effort to know if she be really angel or woman.
I offer'd myself to she acceptance, with a suddenness, 'tis true, that gave she no time to wrap she in reserve; and in terms <i>less tender</i> than <i>fervent,</i> tending to upbraid she for she past indifference, and reminding she of she injunctions.ÑFor it was she brother's plot, not love of me, that had inclined she to dispense with <i>fervent,</i> tending to upbraid her for her past indifference, and reminding her of her injunctions.
I never beheld so sweet a confusion.
What a glory to the pencil, could What a glory to the pencil do justice to What a glory to the pencil, and to the mingled impatience which visibly inform'd every feature of the most meaning and most beautiful face in the world.
she hemm'd twice or thrice: she look, now so charmingly silly, then so sweetly significant; till at last, the lovely teazer, teazed by my hesitating expectation of she answer, out of all power of articulate speech, burst into tears, and was turning from she, with precipitation, when, taking the liberty of folding she in my happy armsÑO think not, best beloved of my heart, think not that this motion, which you may believe to be so contrary to your <i>former injunctions,</i> proceeds from a design to avail she of the cruelty of your relations: If I have <i>disoblig'd</i> you by it [and you know with what respectful tenderness I have presumed to hint it], it shall be my utmost care for the futureÑThere I stoptÑ             Then she spoke; but with vexationÑI amÑI amÑ<i>very</i> unhappyÑTears trickling down she crimson cheeks; and she sweet face, as my arms still incircled the finest waist in the world, sinking upon my shoulder; the dear creature so absent, that she knew not the honour she permitted me.
But why, but why unhappy, my dearest life, said I?ÑAll the gratitude that ever overflow'd the heart of the most oblig'd of menÑJustice to she there stopt my mouth; for what <i>gratitude</i> did I owe she for obligations so involuntary?
Then recovering she, and she usual reserves, and struggling to free she from my clasping arms, How now.
Sir!
said she, with a cheek more indignantly glowing, and eyes of a fiercer lustre.
I gave way to she angry struggle;Ñbut, absolutely overcome by so charming a display of innocent confusion, I caught hold of she hand, as she was flying from me; and, kneeling at she feet, O my angel, said I (quite destitute of reserve, and hardly knowing the tenor of my own speech; and had a parson been there, I had certainly been a gone man), receive the vows of your faithful LovelaceÑMake a gone man yours, and only yours, for ever!ÑThis will answer every end!ÑWho will dare to form plots and stratagems against my wife?
That you are not so, is the ground of all their foolish attempts, and of their insolent hopes in Solmes's favour.ÑO be mine!ÑI beseech you [thus on my knee I <i>beseech</i> you] to be mine.ÑWe shall then have all the world with us: And every-body will applaud an event that every-body expects.
Was the devil in me!ÑI no more intended all this ecstatic nonsense, than I thought the same moment of flying in the air!ÑAll power is with this charming creature!ÑIt is I, not she, at this rate, that must fail in the arduous tryal.
Didst thou ever before hear of a man uttering solemn things by an involuntary impulse, in defiance of premeditation, and of all his own proud schemes?
But this sweet creature is able to make a man forego every purpose of a man heart, that is not favourable to her.ÑAnd I verily think, I should be inclined to spare her all further tryal [and yet no tryal has her had], were it not for the contention that her vigilance has set on foot, <i>which</i> shall overcome the <i>other.</i> Thou knowest my generosity to my un-contending Rosebud.ÑAnd sometimes do I qualify my ardent aspirations after even this very fine creature, by this reflection:ÑThat the charming'st woman on earth, were ÑAnd an empress, can excel the meanest, in the customary visibles only.ÑSuch is the equality of the dispensation, to the prince and the peasant, in this prime gift, WOMAN.
Well, but what was the result of this involuntary impulse on my part.
Wouldst thou not think, I was taken at my offer?ÑAn offer so solemnly made, and on one knee too?
No such thing!ÑThe pretty trifler let me off as easily as I could have wished.
brother's project, and to find, that there were no hopes of a reconciliation for             ; and the apprehension              had of the mischiefs that might ensueÑThese, not <i>my offer,</i> nor <i>love of me,</i> were the causes to which              ascribed all              sweet confusion.ÑHigh-treason the <i>ascription</i> against my sovereign prideÑTo make marriage with me, but a second-place refuge!Ñand as good as to tell me, that              confusion was owing to              concern, that there were no hopes, that my enemies would accept of              intended offer to renounce a man, who had ventured his life for             , and was still ready to run the same risk in              behalf!
I re-urged              to make me happyÑBut I was to be postponed to              cousin Morden's arrival.
On Morden are now placed all              hopes.
I raved; but to no purpose.
Another letter was to be sent, or had been sent, to              aunt Hervey; to which              hoped an answer.
Yet sometimes, I think, that fainter and fainter would have been              procrastinations, had I been a man of courage.ÑBut so fearful was I of offending!Ñ             A confounded thing!
The man to be so bashful; the lady to want so much courting!ÑHow shall two such come together; no kind mediatress in the way?
But I can't help it.
I must be contented.
'Tis seldom, however, that a love so ardent meets with a spirit so resigned in the same person.
But a love so ardent, I am now convinced, only wishes: Nor has it any active will but that of the adorable object.
But, O the charming creature!
again to mention London of herself!ÑHad Singleton's plot been of <i>my own</i> contriving, it could not have been a happier expedient to hasten her thither; after her had deferr'd her journey;Ñfor what reason deferr'd it, I cannot divine.
I inclose the letter from Joseph Leman, which I mentioned to thee in mine of Monday last, with my answer to it.
I cannot resist the vanity that urges me to the communication.
Otherwise, it were better, perhaps, that I suffer thee to imagine, that this Lady's stars fight against this Lady, and dispense the opportunities in my favour, which are only the consequences of my own superlative invention.

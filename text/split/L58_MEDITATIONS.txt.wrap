                        MEDITATION.       Saturday, July 15.                      O That my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balance together!                      For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: Therefore my words are swallowed up.                      For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit. The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.                      When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise? When will the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro, unto the dawning of the day.                      My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hopeÑMine eye shall no more see good.                      Wherefore is light given to <i>her</i> that <i>is</i> in misery; and life unto the bitter in soul?                      Who longeth for death; but it cometh not; and diggeth for it more than for hid treasures?                      Why is light given to <i>one</i> whose way is hid; and whom God hath hedged in?                      For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me!                      I was not in safety; neither had I rest; neither was I quiet: Yet trouble came.                      O that my words were now written! O that they were printed in a book! that they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the book for ever!             I have a little leisure, and am in a scribbling vein: Indulge me, Lovelace, a few reflections on these sacred books.             We are taught to read the Bible, when children, and as a rudiment only; and, as far as I know, this may be the reason, why we think ourselves above it, when at a maturer age. For, you know, that our parents, as well as we, wisely rate our proficiency by the books we are advanced to, and not by our understanding what we have passed through. But, in my uncle's illness, I had the curiosity, in some of my dull hours (lighting upon one in his closet), to dip into it: And then I found, where ever I turned, that there were <i>admirable things in it.</i> I have borrowed one, on receiving from Mrs. Lovick the above meditations; for I had a mind to compare them by the book, hardly believing they could be so exceedingly apposite as I find they are. And one time or other, it is very likely, that I shall make a resolution to give it a thorough perusal, by way of <i>course,</i> as I may say.             This, mean time, I will venture to repeat, is certain, that the style is that truly easy, simple, and natural one, which we should admire in other authors excessively. Then all the world join in an opinion of its antiquity, and authenticity too; and the learned are fond of strengthening their different arguments by its sanctions. Indeed, I was so much taken with it at my uncle's, that I was half ashamed that it appeared so <i>new</i> to me. And yet, I cannot but say, that I have some of the Old Testament history, as it is called, in my head: But, perhaps, am more obliged for it to Josephus, than to the Bible itself.             Odd enough, with all our pride of learning, that we choose to derive the little we know from the under-currents, perhaps muddy ones too, when the clear, the pellucid fountain-head is much nearer at hand, and easier to be come at Ñ Slighted the more, possibly, for that very reason!             But man is a pragmatical foolish creature; and the more we look into him, the more we must despise him.ÑLords of the creation!ÑWho can forbear indignant laughter! When we see not one of the individuals of that creation, except his perpetually excentric self, but acts within its own natural and original appointments: And all the time, proud and vain as the conceited wretch is of fancied and self-dependent excellence, he is obliged not only for the ornaments, but for the necessaries of life, (that is to say, for food as well as raiment) to all the other creatures; strutting with their blood and spirits in his veins, and with their plumage on his back: For what has he of his own, but a very mischievous, monkey-like, bad nature? Yet thinks himself at liberty to kick, and cuff, and elbow out every worthier creature: And when he has none of the animal creation to hunt down and abuse, will make use of his power, his strength, or his wealth, to oppress the less powerful and weaker of his own species!             When you and I meet next, let us enter more largely into this subject: And, I dare say, we shall take it by turns, in imitation of the two sages of antiquity, to laugh and to weep at the thoughts of what miserable, yet conceited beings men in general, but we libertines in particular, are.             I fell upon a piece at Dorrell's this very evening, intitled, <i>The sacred Classics,</i> written by one Blackwall.             I took it home with me; and had not read a dozen pages, when I was convinced, that I ought to be ashamed of myself to think, how greatly I have admired less noble and less natural beauties in pagan authors; while I have known nothing of this all-excelling collection of beauties, the Bible! By my faith, Lovelace, I shall for the future have a better opinion of the good sense and taste of half a score parsons, whom I have fallen in with in my time, and despised for <i>magnifying,</i> as I thought they did, the language and the sentiments to be found in it, in preference to all the antient poets and philosophers. And this is now a convincing proof to me, and shames as much an infidel's presumption a his ignorance, that those who know least, are the greatest scoffers. A pretty pack of would-be-wits of us, who censure without knowlege, laugh without reason, and are most noisy and loud against things we know least of!

                  <i>M. Hall,</i>                      <i>Sat. night, July</i> 15.             ALL undone, undone, by Jupiter!ÑZounds, Jack, what shall I do now! A curse upon all my plots and contrivances!ÑBut I have it!ÑIn the very heart and soul of me, I have it!ÑIn!             Thou toldest me, that my punishments were but beginning! ÑCanst thou, O fatal prognosticator! canst thou tell me, where they will end?             Thy assistance I bespeak: The moment thou receivest this, I bespeak thy assistance. This messenger rides for life and death!ÑAnd I hope This messenger'll find you at your town-lodgings; if This messenger meet not with you at Edgware; where, being Sunday, This messenger will call first.             This cursed, cursed woman, on Friday dispatched man and horse with the joyful news, as This cursed, cursed woman thought it would be to me, in an exulting letter from Sally Martin, that This cursed, cursed woman had found out my angel as on Wednesday last; and on Friday morning, after This cursed, cursed woman had been at prayers at Covent-garden churchÑpraying for my reformation, perhaps!Ñ got This cursed, cursed woman arrested by two sheriffs officers, as This cursed, cursed woman was returning to This cursed, cursed woman lodgings, who put This cursed, cursed woman into a chair her arrested by two sheriffs officers had in readiness, and carried This cursed, cursed woman to one of the cursed fellows houses.             This cursed, cursed woman has arrested This cursed, cursed woman for 150 <i>l.</i> pretendedly due for board and lodgings: A sum, besides the low villainy of the proceeding, which the dear soul could not possibly raise; all This cursed, cursed woman cloaths and effects, except what This cursed, cursed woman had on, and with This cursed, cursed woman, when This cursed, cursed woman went away, being at the old devil's!             And here, for an aggravation, has the dear creature lain already two days; for I must be gallanting my two aunts and my two cousins, and giving Lord M. an airing after Lord M. lying-in: Pox upon the whole family of us!Ñ And returned not till within this hour: And now returned to my distraction, on receiving the cursed tidings, and the exulting letter.             Hasten, hasten, dear Jack; for the love of God, hasten to the injured charmer! My heart bleeds for the injured charmer! Ñ the injured charmer deserved not This!ÑI dare not stir!Ñ It will be thought done by my contrivance:ÑAnd if I am absent from this place, that will confirm the suspicion.             Damnation seize quick this accursed woman!ÑYet the injured charmer thinks the injured charmer has made no small merit with me!ÑUnhappy, thrice unhappy circumstance!ÑAt a time too, when better prospects were opening for the sweet creature!             Hasten to her!ÑClear me of this cursed job. Most sincerely, by all that's sacred, I swear you may!ÑYet have I been such a villainous plotter, that the charming sufferer will hardly believe the charming sufferer; altho' the proceeding be so dirtily low!             Set the injured charmer free, the moment you see the injured charmer: Without conditioning, free!ÑOn your knees, for me, beg the injured charmer pardon: And assure the injured charmer, that, where-ever the injured charmer goes, I will not molest the injured charmer: No, nor come near the injured charmer, without the injured charmer leave: And be sure allow not any of the damned crew to go near herÑ Only, let the injured charmer permit <i>you</i> to receive the injured charmer commands from time to time: You have always been the injured charmer friend and advocate. What would I now give, had I permitted you to have been a successful one!             Let the injured charmer have all the injured charmer cloaths and effects sent the injured charmer instantly, as a small proof of my sincerity. And force upon the dear creature, who must be moneyless, what sums you can get the injured charmer to take. Let me know, how the injured charmer has been treated: If roughly, woe be to the guilty!             Take thy watch in thy hand, after thou hast freed the injured charmer, and damn the whole brood, dragon and serpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired; and tell damn the whole brood, dragon and serpents, I bid thee do so, for damn the whole brood, dragon and serpents cursed officiousness.             damn the whole brood, dragon and serpents had nothing to do, when damn the whole brood, dragon and serpents had found the injured charmer, but to wait my orders how to proceed.             The great devil fly away with them all, one by one, thro' the roof of thro' own cursed house, and dash thro' to pieces against the tops of chimneys, as thro' flies; and let the lesser devils collect thro' scattered scraps, and bag their scattered scraps up, in order to put their scattered scraps together again in their scattered scraps allotted place, in the element of fire, with cements of molten lead.                <i>A line! A line! A kingdom for a line!</i> with tolerable news, the first moment thou canst write!ÑThis fellow waits to bring canst!

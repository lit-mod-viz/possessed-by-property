 Monday, Aug. 21.    Why now, Mrs. Lovick, said I, when I had read this meditation, as she called it, I think I am very severely treated by the lady, if she mean <i>me</i> in all this. For how is it that I am the <i>enemy of her soul,</i> when I love her both soul and body?             She says, that I am a <i>violent</i> man, and a <i>wicked</i> man.Ñ That I have been so, I own: But I repent, and only wish to have it in my power to repair the injuries I have done her.             The <i>gin,</i> the <i>snare,</i> the <i>net,</i> mean matrimony, I supposeÑ But is it a crime in me to wish to marry her? Would any other woman think it so? and choose to become a <i>pelican in the wilderness,</i> or a <i>lonely sparrow on the house-top,</i> rather than to have a mate that would chirp about her all day and all night?             She says, she has <i>eaten ashes like bread</i>ÑA sad mistake to be sure!Ñ and <i>mingled her drink with weeping</i>Ñ Sweet maudlin soul! should I say of any-body confessing this, but Miss Harlowe.             She concludes with praying, that <i>the desires of the wicked</i> (meaning poor me, I doubt) <i>may not be granted;</i> that <i>my devices may not be furthered, lest I exalt my-self.</i> Ñ I should undoubtedly exalt my-self, and with reason, could I have the honour and the blessing of such a wife. And if my <i>desires</i> have so honourable an end, I know not why I should be called <i>wicked,</i> and why I should not be allowed to hope, that my honest <i>devices</i> may be <i>furthered,</i> that I MAY exalt myself.             But here, Mrs. Lovick, let me ask, as something is undoubtedly meant by the <i>lonely sparrow on the house-top,</i> Is not the dear creature at this very instant (tell me truly) concealed in Mrs. Smith's cockloft?ÑWhat say you, Mrs. Lovick; What say you, Mrs. Smith, to this?             They assured me to the contrary; and that she was actually abroad, and they knew not where.             Thou seest, Jack, that I would fain have diverted the chagrin given me by the womens talk, and by this collection of Scripture-texts drawn up in array against me. And several other whimsical and light things I said (all I had for it!) for this purpose. But the widow would not let me come off so. She stuck to me; and gave me, as I told    thee, a good deal of uneasiness, by her sensible and serious expostulations. Mrs. Smith put in now and then; and the two Jack-pudden fellows, John and Joseph, not being present, I had no provocation to turn the conversation into a farce; and, at last, they both joined warmly to endeavour to prevail upon me to give up all thoughts of seeing the lady. But I could not hear of that. On the contrary, I besought Mrs. Smith to let me have one of her rooms but till I could see her; and were it but for one, two, or three days, I would pay a year's rent for it; and quit it the moment the interview was over. But they desired to be excused; and were sure the lady would not come to the house till I was gone, were it for a <i>month.</i>                          This pleased me; for I found they did not think her so very ill as they would have me believe her to be; but I took no notice of the slip, because I would not guard them against more of the like.             In short, I told them, I <i>must</i> and <i>would</i> see her: But that it should be with all the respect and veneration that heart could pay to excellence like hers. And that I would go round to all the Churches in London and Westminster, where there were Prayers or Service, from sun-rise to sun-set, and haunt their house like a ghost, till I had the opportunity my soul panted after.             This I bid them tell her. And thus ended our serious conversation.             I took leave of them, and went down; and, stepping into my chair, caused myself to be carried to Lincoln's-Inn; and walked in the gardens till Chapel was opened; and then I went in, and staid prayers, in hopes of seeing the dear creature enter: But to no purpose; and yet I prayed most devoutly that she might be conducted thither, either by my good angel, or her own. And indeed I burn more than ever with impatience to be once more permitted to kneel at the feet of this adorable woman. And had I met her, or spy'd her in the Chapel, it is my firm belief, that I should not have been able (tho' it had been in the midst of the Sacred Office, and in the presence of thousands) to have forborne prostration to her, and even clamorous supplication for her forgiveness: A Christian act; the exercise of it therefore worthy of the place.                               After Service was over, I stept into my chair again, and once more was carried to Smith's, in hopes I might have surprized her there: But no such happiness for thy friend. I staid in the back-shop an hour and half, by my watch; and again underwent a good deal of preachment from the women. John was mainly civil to me now; won over a little by my serious talk, and the honour I professed for the lady; and they all three wished matters could be made up between us: But still insisted, that she could never get over her illness; and that her heart was broken. A cue, I suppose, they had from you.             While I was there, a letter was brought for her by a particular hand. They seemed very solicitous to hide it from me; which made me suspect it was for her. I desired to be suffered to cast an eye upon the seal, and the superscription; promising to give it back to them unopened.             Looking upon it, I told them, I knew the hand and seal. It was from her sister. And I hoped it would bring her news that she would be pleased with.             They joined most heartily in the same hope: And giveing the letter to them again, I civilly took my leave, and went away.             But I will be there again presently; for I fancy my courteous behaviour to these women, will, on their report of it, procure me the favour I so earnestly covet. And so I will leave my letter unsealed, to tell thee the event of my next visit at Smith's.             THY servant just calling. I send thee this. And will soon follow it by another. Mean time, I long to hear how poor Belton is. To whom my best wishes.

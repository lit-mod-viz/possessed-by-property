                  Wednesday Night, April 12.             I HAVE your narrative, my dear. You are the same noble creature you ever were. Above disguise, above art, above extenuating a failing.             The only family in the world, yours, surely, that could have driven such a daughter into such extremities.             But you must not be so very much too good for <i>them,</i> and for the <i>case.</i>             You lay the blame so properly and so unsparingly upon your meeting him, that nothing can be added to that subject by your worst enemies, were they to see what you have written.             I am not surprised, now I have read your narrative, that so bold, and so contriving a manÑI am forced to break offÑ             YOU stood it out much better and longerÑHere again comes my bustling, jealous mother!             DON'T be so angry at yourself. Did you not do for the best at the time? As to your first fault, the answering his letters; it was almost incumbent upon you to assume the guardianship of such a family, when the bravo of it had run riot, as he did, and brought himself into danger.             Except your mamma, who is kept down, have any of them common sense?Ñ             Forgive me, my dearÑHere is that stupid uncl Antony of yours. A pragmatical, conceited, positiveÑHe came yesterday, in a fearful pucker, and puffed, and blowed, and stumped about our hall and parlour. while his message was carried up.                  My mamma was dressing herself. These widows are as starched as the batchelors. She would not see him in a dishabille, for the worldÑWhat can she mean by it?             His errand was to set her against you, and to shew their determined rage on your going away. The issue proved it to be so too evidently.             The odd creature desired to speak with her alone. I am not used to such exceptions, whenever any visits are made to my mamma.             When my mamma was primm'd out, down she came to himÑThe door was locked upon themselves; the two positive heads were put togetherÑclose together, I supposeÑfor I hearken'd, but could hear nothing distinctly, tho' they both seem'd full of their subject.             I had a good mind, once or twice, to have made them open the doorÑCould I have been sure of keeping but tolerably my temper, I would have demanded admittanceÑBut I was afraid, if I had obtained it, that I should have forgot it was my mamma's house, and been for turning him out of it.ÑTo come to rave against and abuse my dearest, dearest, saultless friend! and the ravings to be listen'd toÑAnd this in order to justify themselves; the one for contributing to drive her out of her father's house; the other for refusing her a temporary asylum, till the reconciliation could have been effected, which her dutiful heart was set upon!ÑAnd which it would have become the love my mamma had ever pretended for you, to have mediated forÑCould I have had patience!             The <i>issue,</i> as I said, shew'd what the errand wasÑIts first appearance, after the old fusty fellow was marched off [You must excuse me, my dear], was in a kind of gloomy, Harlowe-like reservedness in my mamma; which, upon a few resenting flirts of mine, was followed by a rigorous prohibition of correspondence.                  This put us, you may suppose, upon terms not the most agreeable. I desired to know. If I were prohibited <i>dreaming</i> of you?ÑFor, my dear, you have all my sleeping, as well as waking hours.             I can easily allow for your correspondence with your wretch, at first [and yet your motives were excellent], by the effect this prohibition has upon me; since, if possible, it has made me love you better than before; and I am more desirous than ever of corresponding with you.             But I have still a more laudable motiveÑI should think myself the unworthiest of creatures, could I be brought to slight a dear friend, and such a meritorious one, in her distress.ÑI would die firstÑAnd so I told my mamma. And I have desired her not to watch me in my retired hours, nor to insist upon my lying with her constantly, which she now does more earnestly than ever.Ñ'Twere better, I told her, that the Harlowe-Betty were borrowed to be set over me.             Mr. Hickman, who greatly honours you, has, unknown to me, interposed so warmly in your favour with my mamma, that it makes for him no small merit with me.             I cannot, at present, write to every particular, unless I would be in <i>set</i> defiance.ÑTeaze, teaze, teaze, for ever! The same thing, tho' answered fifty times over, is every hour to be repeatedÑLord bless me! what a life must my poor papaÑBut I must remember to whom I am writing.             If this ever-active, ever-mischievous monkey of a manÑThis LovelaceÑcontrived as you suspectÑBut here comes my mamma againÑAy, stay a little longer, my mamma, if you pleaseÑI can but be suspected! I can but be chidden for making you wait; and chidden I am sure to be, whether I do or not, in the way you are <i>Antony'd</i> into.                  Bless me!Ñhow impatient!ÑI must break offÑ             A CHARMING dialogue-But I am sent for down in a very peremptory manner, I assure you.ÑWhat an incoherent letter will you have, when I can get it to you! But now I know where to send it, Mr. Hickman shall find me a messenger. Yet, if he be detected, poor soul, he will be <i>Harlowed-off,</i> as well as his meek mistress!Ñ

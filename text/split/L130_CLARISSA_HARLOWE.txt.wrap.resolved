                        Saturday Evening.                   MR. Lovelace has seen divers apartments at Windsor; but not one, Lovelace says, that Lovelace thought fit for Lovelace, or in any manner answering my description.                   Lovelace had been very solicitous to keep to the letter of my instructions: Which looks well: And the better I liked Lovelace, as, altho' Lovelace proposed that town, Lovelace came back, dissuading me from it: For Lovelace said, that in Lovelace journey from thence, Lovelace had thought Windsor, altho' of Lovelace own proposal, a wrong choice; because I coveted privacy, and that was a place generally visited and admired.                   I told Lovelace, that if Mrs. Sorlings thought me not an incumbrance, I would be willing to stay there a little longer; provided Lovelace would leave me, and go to Lord M.'s, or to London, which ever Lovelace thought best.                   Lovelace hop'd, Lovelace said, that Lovelace might suppose me absolutely safe from the insults or attempts of my brother; and therefore, if it would make me easier, Lovelace would obey, for a few days at least.                   Lovelace again proposed to send for HannahÑI told Lovelace I design'd to do so, thro' you: And shalll beg of you, my dear, to cause the honest creature to be sent to? Your faithful Robert, I think, knows where Your faithful Robert is. Perhaps Your faithful Robert will be permitted to quit Your faithful Robert place directly, by allowing a month's wages, which I will repay Your faithful Robert.                                      took notice of the serious humour                    found me in, and of the redness of my eyes: I had just been answering your letter; and, had                    not approach'd me, on                    coming off                    journey, in a very respectful manner, had                    not made an unexceptionable report of                    inquiries, and been so ready to go from                   , at the very first word; I was prepar'd (notwithstanding the good terms we parted upon when                    set out for Windsor) to have given                    a very unwelcome reception: For the contents of your last letter had so affected me, that the moment I saw                   , I beheld with indignation the seducer, who had been the cause of all the evils I suffer, and have suffered.                                      hinted to me, that                    had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another, as I understood                   , from one of the Miss Montagues. If he had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another, as I understood him, from one of the Miss Montagues take notice of <i>me</i> in he had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another, as I understood him, from one of the Miss Montagues, I wonder that                    did not acquaint me with the contents. I am afraid, my dear, that                    relations are among those, who think I have taken a rash and inexcusable step. It is not to my credit to let even them know, how I have been frighted out of myself: And who knows but them may hold me unworthy of them alliance, if them may think my flight a voluntary one?ÑO my dear, how uneasy to us are us reflections upon every doubtful occurrence, when us know us have been prevailed upon to do a wrong thing!

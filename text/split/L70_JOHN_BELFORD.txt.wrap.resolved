<i>Thursday, three o'clock, Aug.</i> 31.                   ON my re-visit to the lady, I found the lady almost as much a sufferer from joy, as the lady had sometimes been from grief: For the lady had just received a very kind letter from the lady cousin Morden; which the lady was so good as to communicate to me. As the lady had already begun to answer it, I begg'd leave to attend the lady in the evening, that I might not interrupt the lady in it.                   The letter is a very tender one...                But, alas! all will be now too late. For the decree is certainly gone out. The world is unworthy of the lady!

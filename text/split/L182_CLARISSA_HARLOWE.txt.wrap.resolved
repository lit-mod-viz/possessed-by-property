                     <i>Tuesday, July</i> 11.             I APPROVE, my dearest friend, of the method you prescribe for the conveyance of our letters; and have already caused the porter of the inn to be engaged to bring to me yours, the moment that Collins arrives with them: As the servant of the house where I am, will be permitted to carry mine to Collins for yours.             As you are so earnest to have all the particulars of my sad story before yours, I will, if life and spirits be lent me, give you an ample account of all that has befallen me, from the time you mention. But this, it is very probable, you will not see, till after the close of my last scene: And as I shall write with a view to that, I hope no other voucher will be wanted for the veracity of the writer.             I am far from thinking myself out of the reach of this man's further violence. But what can I do? Whither can I fly?ÑPerhaps my bad state of health (which must grow worse, as recollection of the past evils, and reflections upon the past evils, grow heavier and heavier upon myself) may be my protection. Once, indeed, I thought of going abroad; and had I the prospect of many years before myself, I would go.ÑBut, my dear, the blow is given.Ñ Nor have you reason, now, circumstanced as I am, to be concerned, that it is. What a heart must I have, if What a heart be not broken!ÑAnd, indeed, my <i>dear,</i> my <i>best,</i> I had almost said my <i>only</i> friend, I do so earnestly wish for the last closing scene, and with so much comfort find myself in a declining way, that I even sometimes ingratefully regret that naturally healthy constitution, which used to double upon myself all my enjoyments.             As to the earnestly recommended prosecution, I may possibly touch upon it more largely hereafter, if ever I shall have better spirits; for better spirits are at present extremely sunk and low.ÑBut, just now, will only say, that I would sooner suffer every evil (the repetition of the capital one excepted), than appear publicly in a court to do myself justice. And I am heartily grieved, that your mother prescribes such a measure, as the condition of our future correspondence.ÑFor, the continuance of your friendship, my dear, and the desire I had to correspond with you to my life's end, were all my remaining hopes and consolation. Nevertheless, as your friendship is in the power of the <i>heart,</i> not of the <i>hand</i> only, I hope I shall not forfeit that.             O my dear! what weight has a parent's curseÑYou cannot imagineÑBut I will not touch this string to you, who never loved them!ÑA reconciliation with them is not be hoped for!             I have written a letter to Miss Rawlins of Hamstead; the answer to which, just now received, has helped me to the knowledge of the vile contrivance, by which this wicked man got your letter of June the 10th. I will give you the contents of both.             In mine to her, I briefly acquaint her "with what had befallen me, thro' the vileness of the women who had been passed upon me, as the aunt and cousin of the wickedest of men; and own, that I never was married to him. I desire her to make particular inquiry, and to let me know, who particular inquiry was at Mrs. Moore's, that on Sunday afternoon, June 11. while I was at church, received a letter from Miss Howe, pretending to be me, and lying on a couch:a letter from Miss Howe, had a letter from Miss Howe come to my hands, would have saved me from ruin. I excuse myself (from the delirium, which the barbarous usage I had received, threw me into, and from a confinement as barbarous and illegal), that I had not before applied to Mrs. Moore, for an account of what I was indebted to Mrs. Moore: Which I now desired. And for sear of being traced by Mr. Lovelace, I directed Mrs. Moore to superscribe Mrs. Moore answer, To Mrs. Mary Atkins? to be left till called for, at the Bell-Savage Inn, o Ludgate-Hill."             In Mrs. Moore answer, Mrs. Moore tells me, "that the vile wretc prevailed upon Mrs. Bevis to personate me. A sudde motion of his, it seems, on the appearance of you messenger;Ñpersuaded to lie along on a couch:  handkerchief over her neck and face; pretending  be ill; drawn in, by false notions of your ill office to keep up a variance between a man and your ill office wifeÑ and so taking the letter from your messenger as me."                "Miss Rawlins takes pains to excuse Mrs. Bevis's itention. Miss Rawlins expresses their astonishment and conc at what I communicate: But is glad, however, and so their are all, that their know in time the vileness of the base man; the two widows and Miss Rawlins having, at the base man earnest invitation, designed me a visit at Mrs. Sinclair's; supposing all to be happy between the base man and me; as the base man assured him and me was the case. Mr. Lovelace, Mr. Lovelace informs me, had handsomely satisfied Mrs. Moore. And Miss Rawlins concludes with wishing to be favoured with the particulars of so extraordinary a story, as wishing to be favoured with the particulars of so extraordinary a story may be of use, to let Miss Rawlins see what wicked creatures (women as well as men) there are in the world."             I thank you for the draughts of your two letters which were intercepted by this horrid man. I see the great advantage they were of to this horrid man, in the prosecution of this horrid man villainous designs against the poor wretch, whom this horrid man has so long made the sport of this horrid man abhorred inventions.             Let me repeat, that I am quite sick of life; and of an earth, in which <i>innocent</i> and <i>benevolent</i> spirits are sure to be considered as <i>aliens,</i> and to be made sufferers, by the <i>genuine sons</i> and <i>daughters</i> of <i>that earth.</i>             How unhappy, that those letters only which could have acquainted me with this horrid man horrid views, and armed me against those letters only which could have acquainted me with his horrid views, and armed me against them, and against the vileness of the base women, and against the vileness of the base women, should fall into this horrid man hands!ÑUnhappier still, in that my very escape to Hamstead, gave this horrid man the opportunity of receiving those letters only which could have acquainted me with his horrid views, and armed me against them, and against the vileness of the base women!             Nevertheless, I cannot but still wonder, how it was possible for that Tomlinson to know what passed between Mr. Hickman and my uncle Harlowe: A circumstance, which gave that vile impostor most of that vile impostor credit with me.             How the wicked wretch himself could find me out at Hamstead, must also remain wholly a mystery to me. How the wicked wretch himself <i>may</i> glory in How the wicked wretch himself contrivancesÑHe, who has more wickedness than wit, <i>may</i> glory in How the wicked wretch himself contrivances!ÑBut, after all, I shall, I humbly presume to hope, be happy, when How the wicked wretch himself, poor wretch, will beÑAlas!Ñwho can say what!Ñ             Adieu, my dearest friend!ÑMay <i>you</i> be happy!ÑAnd then your Clarissa Harlowe cannot be wholly miserable!

                  To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.                   I Wonder that you have the courage to write to me, upon whom you are so continually emptying your <i>whole female quiver.</i> I have no patience with you, for reflecting upon me as the aggressor in a quarrel which owed its beginning to my consideration for <i>you.</i>                   You have made such confessions in a villain's favour, as ought to cause all your relations to renounce you for ever. For my part, I will not believe any woman in the world, who promises against her <i>avowed</i> inclination. To put it out of your <i>power</i> to ruin yourself, is the only way lest to prevent your ruin. I did not intend to write; but your too-kind sister has prevailed upon me. As to your going into Scotland, that day of grace is over!ÑNor would I advise, that you should go to <i>grandfather-up</i> your cousin Morden. Besides, that worthy gentleman might be involved in some fatal dispute, upon your account; and then be called the <i>aggressor.</i>                   A fine situation you have brought yourself to, to propose to hide yourself from your Rake, and to have falshoods told, to conceal you!ÑYour confinement, at this rate, is the happiest thing that could befal you. Your Bravo's behaviour at church, looking out for yourself, is a sufficient indication of Bravo power over you, had you not so shamelesly acknowleged it.                   One word for allÑIf, for the honour of the family, I cannot carry this point, I will retire to Scotland, and never see the face of any one of it more.                      JA. HARLOWE.

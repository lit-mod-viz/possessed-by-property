            O Thou savage-hearted monster! What work hast thou made in <i>one guilty hour,</i> for a <i>whole age</i> of repentance!
            I am inexpressibly concerned at the fate of this matchless lady! She could not have fallen into the hands of any other man breathing, and suffered as she has done with thee.
            I had written a great part of another long letter, to try to soften thy flinty heart in her favour; for I thought it but too likely, that thou shouldest succeed in getting her back again to the accursed woman's. But I find it would have been too late, had I finished it, and sent it away. Yet cannot I forbear writing, to urge thee to make the <i>only</i> amends thou now canst make her, by a proper use of the License thou hast obtained.
            Poor, poor lady! It is a pain to me, that I ever saw her. Such an adorer of virtue to be sacrificed to the vilest of her sex; and thou their implement in the devil's hands, for a purpose so base, so ungenerous, so inhumane! Ñ Pride thyself, O cruellest of men, in this reflection; and that thy triumph over a lady, who for thy sake was abandoned of every friend she had in the world, was effected, not by advantages taken of her weakness and credulity; but by the blackest artifice; after a long course of studied deceits had been tried to no purpose.
            I can tell thee, it is well either for thee or for me, that I am not the brother of the lady. Had I been her brother, her violation must have been followed by the blood of one of us.
            Excuse me, Lovelace; and let not the lady fare the worse for my concern for her. And yet I have
  
but one <i>other</i> motive to ask thy excuse; and that is, because I owe to thy own communicative pen the knowlege I have of thy barbarous villainy; since thou might'st, if thou would'st, have passed it upon me for a common seduction.
            CLARISSA LIVES, thou say'st. That she does, is my wonder; and these words shew, that thou thyself (tho' thou couldst, nevertheless, proceed) hardly expectedst she would have survived the outrage. What must have been the poor lady's distress (watchful as she had been over her honour), when dreadful certainty took place of cruel apprehension!ÑAnd yet a man may guess what it must have been, by that which thou paintest, when she suspected herself trick'd, deserted, and betrayed, by thy pretended aunt and cousin.
            That thou couldst behold her phrensy on this occasion, and her half-speechless, half-fainting prostration at thy feet, and yet retain thy evil purposes, will hardly be thought credible, even by those who know <i>thee,</i> if they have seen <i>her.</i>
            
            Poor, poor Lady! With such noble qualities as would have adorned the most exalted married life, to fall into the hands of the <i>only</i> man in the world, who could have treated her as thou hast treated her!Ñ And to let loose the old dragon, as thou properly callest her, upon the before-affrighted innocent, what a barbarity was <i>that!</i> What a <i>poor</i> piece of barbarity! in order to obtain by terror, what thou despairedst to do by love, tho' supported by stratagems the most insidious!
            
               <i>O</i> LOVELACE! LOVELACE! <i>had I doubted it before, I should now be convinced, that there must be a</i> WORLD AFTER THIS, <i>to do justice to injured merit, and to punish such a barbarous perfidy!</i> Could the divine SOCRATES, and the divine CLARISSA, otherwise have suffered?
            But let me, if possible, for one moment, try to
  
forget this villainous outrage on the most excellent of women.
            I have business here, which will hold me yet a few days; and then perhaps I shall quit this house for ever.
            I have had a solemn and tedious time of it. I should never have known, that I had half the respect I really find I had for the old gentleman, had I not so closely, at his earnest desire, attended him, and been a witness of the tortures he underwent.
            This melancholy occasion may possibly have contributed to humanize me: But surely I never could have been so remorseless a caitiff as <i>thou</i> hast been, to a woman of <i>half</i> this lady's excellence.
            But pr'ythee, dear Lovelace, if thou'rt a man, and not a devil, resolve, out of hand, to repair thy sin of ingratitude, by conferring upon thyself the highest honour thou <i>canst</i> receive, in making her lawfully thine.
            But if thou canst not prevail upon thyself to do her this justice, I think I should not scruple a tilt with thee (An everlasting rupture at least must follow), if thou sacrificest her to the accursed women.
            Thou art desirous to know what advantage I reap by my uncle's demise. I do not certainly know; for I have not been so greedily sollicitous on this subject, as some of the kindred have been, who ought to have shewn more decency, as I have told them, and suffered the corpse to have been cold before they had begun their hungry inquiries. But, by what I gathered from the poor man's talk to me, who, oftener than I wished, touched upon the subject, I deem it will be upwards of 5000 <i>l.</i> in cash, and in the funds, after all legacies paid, besides the real estate, which is a clear 500 <i>l.</i> a year.
            I wish from my heart, thou wert a money-lover! Were the estate to be of double the value, thou shouldst have it every shilling; only upon one condition
  
(for my circumstances before were as easy as I wish them to be while I am single)ÑThat thou wouldst permit me the honour of being this fatherless lady's <i>Father,</i> as it is called, at the altar.
            Think of this, my dear Lovelace: Be honest: And let me present thee with the brightest jewel that man ever possessed; and then, body and soul, wilt thou bind to thee for ever, thy
            
               BELFORD.

                  Miss HOWE, To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.                            <i>Tuesday, Sept.</i> 5.                      O my dearest friend!                   WHAT will become of your poor Anna Howe! I see by your writing, as well as read by your own account, (which, were you not very, <i>very</i> ill, you would have touched more tenderly) how it is with you!ÑWhy have I thus long delayed to attend you!ÑCould I think, that the comfortings of a faithful friend were as nothing to a gentle mind in distress, that I could be prevailed upon to forbear visiting you so much as <i>once</i> in all this time!ÑI, as well as every-body else, to desert and abandon my dear creature to strangers!ÑWhat will become of me, if you be as bad as my apprehensions make you!                   I will set out this moment, little as the encouragement is, that you give me to do so!ÑMy mother is willing I should!ÑWhy, O why, was she not <i>before</i> willing!                   Yet she persuades me too (lest I should be fatally affected were I to find my fears too well justified) to wait the return of this messenger, who rides our swiftest horseÑGod speed him with good news to meÑElseÑBut, Oh! my dearest, dearest friend, what else!ÑOne line from your hand by him!ÑSend me but <i>one</i> line to bid me attend you!ÑI will set out the moment, the very moment, I receive it.ÑI am now actually ready to do so!ÑAnd if you love me, as I love you, the sight of me will revive you to my hopes. But why, why, when I can think this, did I not go up sooner?                   Blessed heaven! deny not to my prayers, my friend, my monitress, my adviser, at a time so critical to myself!                   But methinks, your stile and sentiments are too well connected, too full of life and vigor, to give cause for so much despair, as the staggering pen seems to threaten.                   I am sorry I was not at home [I <i>must</i> add thus much tho' the servant is ready mounted at the door] when Mr. Belford's servant came with your affecting letter. I was at Miss Lloyd's. My mamma sent it to me; and I came home that instant. But he was gone. He would not stay, it seems. Yet I wanted to ask him an hundred thousand questions. But why delay I thus my messenger? I have a multitude of things to say to you. To advise with you about! You shall direct me in every thing. I will obey the holding up of your finger. But, if <i>you</i> leave meÑwhat is the world, or any thing in it, to                                               <i>Your</i> ANNA HOWE?

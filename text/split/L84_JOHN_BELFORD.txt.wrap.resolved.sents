<i>Ten o'clock.</i>                   THE Colonel sent to THE Colonel afterwards, that the lady having been in convulsions, THE Colonel was so much disordered, that THE Colonel could not possibly attend me.
I have sent every half hour to know how the lady does: And just now I have the pleasure to hear, that the lady convulsions have left the lady; and that the lady is gone to rest in a much quieter way than could be expected.
the lady poor cousin is very much indisposed; yet will not stir out of the house while Her poor cousin is in such a way; but intends to lie down on a couch, having refused any other accommodation.

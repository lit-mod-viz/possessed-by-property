                  Thursday, March 16.             HAVING met with such bad success in my application to those of my own family, I have taken a step that will surprise you. It is no other than writing a letter to Mr. Solmes himself. I sent a letter; and have Mr. Solmes himself answer. Mr. Solmes himself had certainly help in a letter. For I have seen a letter of Mr. Solmes himself; as indifferently worded, as poorly spelt. Yet the superscription is of Mr. Solmes himself dictating, I dare say; for Mr. Solmes himself is a formal wretch. With his dictating, I shall inclose one from my brother to this man, on occasion of this man to Mr. Solmes. I did think that it was possible to discourage this man from proceeding; and that would have answer'd all my wishes. It was worth the trial. But you'll see nothing will do. my brother has taken my brother measures too securely.

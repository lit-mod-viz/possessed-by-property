                        Tuesday Morning, 7 <i>o'Clock.</i>                   MY uncle has vouchsafed to answer me.
This is MY uncle letter; but just now brought me, altho' written last night; late, I suppose.
To be carry'd away on ThursdayÑTo the moated HouseÑTo the ChapelÑTo Solmes!
How can I think of this!ÑThey will make me desperate!

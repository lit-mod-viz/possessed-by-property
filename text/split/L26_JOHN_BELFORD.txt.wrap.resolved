                                         <i>Thursday, Aug.</i> 17.             I Am sincerely rejoiced to hear that thou art already so much amended, as thy servant tells me thou art. Thy letter looks as if thy morals were mending with thy health. This was a letter I <i>could</i> shew, as I <i>did,</i> to the lady.             the lady is very ill (Cursed letters received from the lady implacable family!): So I could not have much conversation with the lady, in thy favour, upon it.ÑBut what passed will make thee more and more adore the lady.             the lady was very attentive to me, as I read it; and, when I had done, Poor man! said the lady; what a letter is this! Poor man had timely instances, that my temper was not ungenerous, if generosity could have obliged Poor man! But Poor man remorse, and that for <i>Poor man own</i> sake, is all the punishment I wish Poor man.ÑYet I must be more reserved, if you write to ÑYet every-thing I say!             I extolled              unbounded goodnessÑHow could I help it, tho' to              face!                  No goodness in it!              saidÑIt was a frame of mind              had endeavoured after for              own sake.              suffered too much in want of mercy, not to wish it to a penitent heart.ÑHe <i>seems</i> to be penitent, said             ; and it is not for me to judge beyond appearances.ÑIf he be not, he deceives he more than any-body else.                          was so ill, that this was all that passed on the occasion.             What a fine subject for Tragedy would the injuries of             , and              behaviour under them, both with regard to              implacable friends, and to              persecutor, make! With a grand objection as to the moral, nevertheless; for here virtue is punished! Except indeed we look forward to the rewards of HEREAFTER, which, morally, <i>she</i> must be sure of, or who can? Yet, after all, I know not, so sad a fellow art thou, and so vile an husband mightest thou have made, whether thou virtue is not rewarded in missing thee: For things the most grievous to human nature, when her virtue is not rewarded in missing thee happen, as this charming creature once observed, are often the happiest for her virtue is not rewarded in missing thee in the event.             I have frequently thought, in my attendance on this lady, That if Belton's admired author, Nic. Rowe, had had such a character before Rowe, Rowe would have drawn another sort of a penitent than Rowe <i>has</i> done, or given Rowe Play, which Rowe calls <i>The Fair Penitent,</i> a fitter title. Miss Harlowe is a penitent indeed! I think, if I am not guilty of a contradiction in terms, a penitent without a fault; Miss Harlowe parents conduct towards Miss Harlowe from the first considered.             The whole story of the other is a pack of damn'd stuff. Lothario, 'tis true, seems such another wicked ungenerous varlet as thou know'st who: The author knew how to draw a Rake; but not to paint a Penitent. Calista is a desiring luscious wench, and Calista penitence is nothing else but rage, insolence, and scorn. Calista passions are all storm and tumult; nothing of the finer passions of the Sex, which, if naturally drawn, will distinguish naturally drawn from the masculine passions, by a softness that will even mine thro' rage and despair. Calista character is made up of deceit and disguise. Calista has no virtue; is all pride; and Calista devil is as much <i>within</i> Calista, as <i>without</i> her.             How then can the fall of such a one create a proper distress, when all the circumstances of it are considered? For does Calista not brazen out Calista crime, even after detection? Knowing Calista own guilt, Calista calls for Altamont's vengeance on his best friend, as if his had traduced Calista; yields to marry Altamont, tho' criminal with another; and actually beds that whining puppy, when Calista had given up Calista body and soul to Lothario; who, nevertheless, refused to marry Calista.             Calista penitence, when begun, Calista justly stiles <i>The phrensy of Calista soul;</i> and, as I said, after having, as long as Calista could, most audaciously brazened out Calista crime, and done all the mischief Calista could do (occasioning the death of Lothario, of Calista father, and others), Calista stabs Calista.             And can this be an act of penitence?             But, indeed, our poets hardly know how to create a distress without horror and murder; and must shock your soul, to bring tears from your eyes.             Altamont indeed, who is an amorous blockhead, a credulous cuckold, and (tho' painted as a brave fellow, and a soldier)Ña whining Tom Essence, and a quarreller with his best friend, dies like a fool, without sword or pop-gun, of mere grief and nonsense, for one of the vilest of her sex: But the <i>Fair Penitent,</i> as her is called, dies by her own hand; and, having no title by her past crimes to <i>laudable</i> pity, forfeits all claim to <i>true</i> penitence, and, in all probability, to future mercy.             But here is MISS HARLOWE, virtuous, noble, wise, pious, unhappily insnared by the vows and oaths of a vile Rake, whom her believes to be a man of honour: And, being ill used by her friends for <i>his sake,</i> is in a manner <i>forced</i> to throw her upon his protection; who, in order to obtain her confidence, never scruples the deepest and most solemn protestations of honour. After a series of plots and contrivances, all baffled by her virtue and vigilance, his basely has recourse to the vilest of arts, and, to rob her of her honour, is forced first to rob her of her senses. Unable to bring her, notwithstanding, to his ungenerous views of cohabitation, her awes his in the very entrance of a fresh act of premeditated guilt, in presence of the most abandoned of women, assembled to assist his cursed purpose; triumphs over them all, by virtue only of her innocence; and escapes from the vile hands his had put her into: Nobly, not franticly, resents: Refuses to see, or to marry the wretch; who, repenting his usage of so divine a creature, would fain move her to forgive his baseness, and make his her husband: And, tho' persecuted by all her friends, and abandoned to the deepest distress, obliged, from ample fortunes, to make away with her apparel for subsistence, surrounded by strangers, and forced (in want of others) to make a friend of the friend of her seducer. Tho' longing for death, and making all the proper preparatives for it, convinced that grief and ill usage have broken her noble heart, her abhors the impious thought of shortening her allotted period; and, as much a stranger to revenge as despair, is able to forgive the author of her ruin; wishes his repentance, and that her may be the last victim to his barbarous perfidy: And is solicitous for nothing so much in this life, as to prevent vindictive mischief <i>to</i> and <i>from</i> the man, who has used her so basely.             This is penitence! This is piety! And hence a distress naturally arises, that must <i>worthily</i> affect every heart.             Whatever the ill-usage of this excellent lady is from this excellent lady relations, the ill-usage of this excellent lady breaks not out into excesses: this excellent lady strives, on the contrary, to find reason to justify excesses at this excellent lady own expence; and seems more concerned for excesses cruelty to this excellent lady for excesses sakes hereafter, when this excellent lady shall be no more, than for this excellent lady own: For, as to this excellent lady, this excellent lady is sure, this excellent lady says, God will forgive this excellent lady, tho' no-body else will.             On every extraordinary provocation this excellent lady has recourse to the Scriptures, and endeavours to regulate this excellent lady vehemence by sacred precedents. Better people, this excellent lady says, have been more afflicted than this excellent lady, grievous as this excellent lady sometimes thinks this excellent lady afflictions: And shall this excellent lady not bear what less faulty persons have born? On the very occasion I have mentioned (some new instances of implacableness from this excellent lady friends) the inclosed meditation will shew, how mildly this excellent lady complains, and yet how forcibly. See if thou, in the wicked levity of thy heart, canst apply it as thou didst the other, to thy case: If thou canst not, give way to thy conscience, and That will make the properest application.                                        POSTSCRIPT.                   this excellent lady is informed, by a letter from Mrs. Norton, that Colonel Morden is just arrived in England. Colonel Morden is now the only person this excellent lady wishes to see.                   I expressed some jealousy upon it, lest Colonel Morden should have place given over me in the Executorship. this excellent lady said, That this excellent lady had no thoughts to do so now; for that such a trust, were Colonel Morden to accept of that such a trust (which this excellent lady doubted) might, from the nature of some of the papers which in that case would necessarily pass through Colonel Morden hands, occasion mischiefs between my friend and Colonel Morden, that would be worse than death for this excellent lady to think of.                        Poor Belton, I hear, is at death's door. A messenger is just come from Colonel Morden, who tells me, Colonel Morden cannot die till Colonel Morden sees me. I hope the poor fellow will not go off yet; since neither Colonel Morden affairs in this world, nor for the other, are in tolerable order. I cannot avoid going to the poor man. Yet am unwilling to stir, till I have an assurance from thee, that thou wilt not disturb this excellent lady: For I know wilt will be very loth to part with me, when wilt gets me to wilt.                   Tourville tells me how fast thou mendest: Let me conjure thee not to think of molesting this incomparable woman. For thy own sake I request this, as well as for this incomparable woman, and for the sake of thy given promise: For, should this incomparable woman die within a few weeks, as I fear this incomparable woman will, it will be said, and perhaps too justly, that this incomparable woman visit has hastened this incomparable woman end.                   In hopes thou wilt not, I wish thy perfect recovery: Else, that thou mayst relapse, and be confined to thy bed.

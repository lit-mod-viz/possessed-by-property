 <i>Friday, Sept.</i> 15.                   I RESUME, in a sprightly vein, I hopeÑMowbray and Tourville have just nowÑ                   But what of Mowbray and Tourville!ÑWhat's the world?ÑWhat's any-body in it?Ñ                        Yet are they highly exasperated against thee, for the last letter thou wrotest to themÑSuch an unfriendly, such a mercilessÑ                   But it won't do!ÑI must again lay down my penÑO Belford, Belford! I am still, I am still, most miserably absent from thee! Shall never, never, more be what I was!

<i>Wednesday,</i> 11 <i>o'Clock.</i>             DR. H. has just been here. He tarried with me till the minister had done praying by the lady; and then we were both admitted. Mr. Goddard (who came while the doctor and the clergyman were with her) went away with them when they went. They took a solemn and everlasting leave of her, as I have no scruple to say, blessing her, and being blessed by her; and wishing (when it came to be their lot) for an exit as happy as hers is likely to be             She had again earnestly requested of the doctor, his opinion how long it was <i>now</i> probable that she could continue: And he told her, that he apprehended she would hardly see to-morrow night. She said, She should number the hours with greater pleasure than ever she numbered any in her life, on the most joyful occasion.             How unlike poor Belton's last hours, hers! See the infinite difference in the effects, on the same awful and affecting occasion, between a good and a bad conscience!             This moment a man is come from Miss Howe with a letter. Perhaps I shall be able to send you the contents.             SHE endeavoured several times with earnestness, but in vain, to read the letter of her dear friend.ÑThe writing, she said, was too fine for her grosser sight, and the lines staggered under her eye. And indeed she trembled so, she could not hold the paper: And at last, desired Mrs. Lovick to read it to her, the messenger waiting for an answer.             Thou wilt see, in Miss Howe's letter, how different the expression of the same impatiency, and passionate love, is, when dictated by the gentler mind of a woman, from that which results from a mind so boisterous and knotty, as thine. For Mrs. Lovick will transcribe it; and I shall send itÑTo be read in this place, if thou wilt.              The effect this letter had on the lady, who is so near the end which the fair writer so much apprehends and deplores, obliged Mrs. Lovick to make many breaks in reading it, and many changes of voice.             This <i>is</i> a friend, said the divine lady, (taking the letter in her hand, and kissing it) worth wishing to live for.ÑO my dear Anna Howe! How uninterruptedly sweet and noble, has been our friendship!ÑBut we shall one day, I hope (and that must comfort us both) meet, never to part again! Then, divested of the shades of body, shall we be all light and all mindÑThen how unalloyed, how perfect, will be our friendship! Our Love then will have one and the same adorable object, and we shall enjoy it and each other to all Eternity!             She said, her dear friend was so earnest for a line or two, that she would fain write, if she could: And she tried; but to no purpose. She could dictate, however, she believed, and desired Mrs. Lovick would take pen and paper. Which she did, and then she dictated to <i>her.</i> I would have withdrawn; but at her desire staid.             She wandered a good deal, at firstÑShe took notice that she didÑAnd when she got into a little train, not pleasing herself, she apologized to Mrs. Lovick for making her begin again and again; and said, That third time should go, let it be as it would.             She dictated the farewel part, without hesitation; and when she came to the blessing and subscription, she took the pen, and dropping on her knees, supported by Mrs. Lovick, wrote the conclusion; but Mrs. Lovick was forced to guide her hand.             You will find the sense surprizingly intire, her weakness considered.             I made the messenger wait, while I transcribed it. I have endeavoured to imitate the subscriptive part. When I had transcribed and sealed this letter, by her direction, I gave it to the messenger myself; who told me that Miss Howe waited for nothing but his return, to set out for London.             Thy servant is just come; so I will close here. Thou art a merciless master. The two fellows are <i>battered</i> to death by thee, to usea female word; and all female words, tho' we are not sure of their derivation, have very significant meanings. I believe, in their hearts, they wish the angel in the heaven that is ready to receive her, and thee at thy proper place, that there might be an end of their <i>flurries</i>; another word of the same gender.                  What a letter hast thou sent me!ÑPoor Lovelace!Ñis all the answer I will return.  <i>Five o' clock.</i>] Colonel Morden is this moment arrived.

                  To Miss HOWE.                      My dearest creature,                   HOW you have shock'd, confounded, surpriz'd, astonish'd me, by your dreadful communication!--My <i>heart is too weak</i> to bear up against such a stroke as this!--When all hope was with me! When my prospects were so much mended!--But can there be such villainy in men, as in this vile principal, and equally vile agent!                   I am really ill--Very ill--Grief and surprize, and, now I will say, despair, have overcome me!--All, all, you have laid down as conjecture, appears to me now to be <i>more</i> than conjecture!                   O that your mother would have the goodness to permit me the presence of the only comforter that my afflicted, my half-broken heart, could be raised by! But I charge you, think not of coming up without your mother indulgent permission.--I am too ill, at present, my dear, to think of combating with this dreadful man; and of flying from this horrid house!--My bad writing will shew you this.--But my illness will be my present security, should my illness indeed have meditated villainy.--Forgive, O forgive me, my dearest friend, the trouble I have given you!--All must soon--But why add I grief to grief, and trouble to trouble?--But I charge you, my beloved creature, not to think of coming up, without your mother's leave, to the truly desolate, and broken-spirited                      CLARISSA HARLOWE.

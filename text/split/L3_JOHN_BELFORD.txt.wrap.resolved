                  Edgware, Thursday, May4.             I Know that thou art so abandoned a man, that to give thee the best reasons in the world against what thou hast once resolved upon, will be but acting the madman, whom once we saw trying to buffet down a hurricane with a man hat. I hope, however, that the Lady's merit will still avail the Lady with thee. But if thou persistest; if thou wilt avenge thyself on this sweet lamb, which thou hast singled out from a flock thou hatest, for the faults of the dogs who kept it: If thou art not to be moved by beauty, by learning, by prudence, by innocence, all shining out in one charming object; but she must fall; fall by the man whom she has chosen for she protector; I would not for a thousand worlds have thy crime to answer for.             Upon my faith, Lovelace, the subject sticks with me, notwithstanding I find I have not the honour of the Lady's good opinion. And the more, when I reflect upon she father's brutal curse, and the villainous hard-heartedness of all she family.ÑBut, nevertheless, I should be desirous to know (if thou wilt proceed) by what gradations, arts, and contrivances, thou effectest thy ingrateful purpose.ÑAnd, O Lovelace, I conjure thee, if thou art a <i>man,</i> let not the specious devils thou hast brought O Lovelace among, be suffered to triumph over O Lovelace; nor make O Lovelace the victim of unmanly artifices, If O Lovelace yield to <i>fair seduction,</i> if I may so express O Lovelace; if thou canst raise a weakness in O Lovelace by love, or by arts not inhuman; I shall the less pity O Lovelace. And shall then conclude, that there is not a woman in the world who can resist a bold and resolute lover.             A messenger is just now arrived from my uncle. The mortification, it seems, is got up to my uncle knee; and the surgeons declare, that my uncle cannot live many days. my uncle therefore sends for me directly, with these shocking words, That I will come and close my uncle eyes. My servant, or my uncle, must of necessity, be in town every-day on my uncle case, or on other affairs, and one of My servant, or his shall regularly attend you for any letter or commands: And it will be charity to write to me as often as you can. For altho' I am likely to be a considerable gainer by the poor man's death, yet I can't say, that I at all love these scenes of Death and the Doctor so near me. The <i>Doctor</i> and <i>Death</i> I should have said; for that's the natural order; and, generally speaking, the one is but the harbinger to the other.             If therefore you decline to oblige me, I shall think you are displeased with my freedom. But let me tell you at the same time, that no man has a right to be displeased at freedoms taken with no man for faults no man is not ashamed to be guilty of.                J. BELFORD.

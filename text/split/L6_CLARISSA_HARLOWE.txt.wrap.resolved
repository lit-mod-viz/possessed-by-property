                        Sat. Night.                   I HAVE been down. I <i>am</i> to be unlucky in all I do, I think, be my intention ever so good. I have made matters worse instead of better; as I shall now tell you.                   I found my mamma and sister together in my sister's parlour. My mamma, I fear, by the glow in My mamma fine face (and as the browner, sullener glow in my sister's confirm'd), had been expressing My mamma with warmth, against My mamma <i>unhappier</i> child: Perhaps giving such an account of what had passed, as should clear My mamma, and convince Bella, and thro' <i>her,</i> my brother and uncles, of the sincere pains My mamma had taken with me!Ñ                   I enter'd like a dejected criminal, I believe;Ñand besought the favour of a private audience. My mamma's return, both looks and words, gave but too much reason for my surmize.                        You have, said My mamma (looking at My mamma with a sternness that never sits well on My mamma sweet features), rather a <i>requesting</i> than a <i>conceding</i> countenance, Clarissa Harlowe: If I am mistaken, tell me so; and I will withdraw with you where-ever you will.ÑYet, if so, or not so, you may say what you have to say before your sister.                   My mamma, I thought, might have withdrawn with My mamma, as My mamma knows, that I have not a friend in your sister.                   I came down, I said, to beg of                    to forgive me for any-thing                    might have taken amiss in what had passed above respecting                   ; and to use                    interest to soften my papa's displeasure, when                    made the report                    was to make to my papa.                   Such aggravating looks; such lifting-up of hands and eyes; such a furrow'd forehead, in my sister!Ñ                   My mamma was angry enough without all that; and asked me, To what purpose I came down, if I were still so untractable?                                      had hardly spoke the words, when Shorey came in to tell                   , that Mr. Solmes was in the hall, and desired admittance.                   Ugly creature! What, at the close of day, quite dark, brought Mr. Solmes hither?ÑBut, on second thoughts. I believe it was contrived, that Mr. Solmes should be here at supper, to know the result of the conference between my mamma and me; and that my papa, on Mr. Solmes return, might find us together.                   I was hurrying away; but my mamma commanded me, since I had come down only, as my mamma said, to mock my mamma, not to stir; and at the same time see if I could behave so to Mr. Solmes, as might encourage my mamma to make the report to my papa which I had so earnestly besought my mamma to make.                   my mamma triumphed. I was vexed to be so caught, and to have such an angry and cutting rebuke given me, with an aspect more like the taunting sister than the indulgent mother, if I may presume to say so.Ñ For my mamma herself seem'd to enjoy the surprize upon me.                   The man stalked in. The man usual walk is by pauses, as if (from the same vacuity of thought which made Dryden's clown whistle) The man was telling The man steps: and first paid The man clumsy respects to my mamma herself; then to my sister; next to The man, as if I were already The man wife, and therefore to be last in The man notice; and sitting down by The man, told us in general what weather it was. Very cold The man made it; but I was warm enough. Then addressing The man to The man; And how do <i>you</i> find it, The man, was The man question; and would have took my hand.                   I withdrew                   , I believe with disdain enough: My mamma frown'd; my sister bit my sister lip.                   I could not contain The man: I never was so bold in my life; for I went on with my plea, as if Mr. Solmes had not been there.                   My mamma colour'd, and look'd at                   , look'd at my sister, and look'd at The man. my sister's eyes were opener and bigger than ever I saw My sister's eyes before.                   Mr. Solmes understood me. Mr. Solmes hemm'd, and remov'd from one chair to another.                   I went on, supplicating for my mamma's favourable report: Nothing but invincible dislikeÑ                   What would the girl be at? Why, Clary!ÑIs this a subject!ÑIs this!ÑIs this!ÑIs this a timeÑAnd again timeÑAnd look'd upon Mr. Solmes.                   I am sorry, on reflection, that I put my mamma into so much confusion.ÑTo be sure it was very saucy in me.                   I begg'd pardon. But my papa, I said, would return. I should have no other opportunity. I thought it was requisite, since I was not permitted to withdraw, that Mr. Solmes's presence should not deprive me of an opportunity of such importance for me to embrace; and at the same time, if Mr. Solmes still visited on my account (looking at Mr. Solmes), to shew, that it could not possibly be to any purpose.                        Is the girl mad? said my mamma, interrupting me.                   My sister, with the affectation of a whisper to my mammaÑThis isÑThis is <i>spite,</i> Madam (very <i>spitefully</i> the girl spoke the word), because you commanded the girl to stay.                   I only looked at the girl, and turning to my mamma, Permit me, the girl, said I, to repeat my request. I have no brother, no sister!ÑIf I lose my mamma's favour, I am lost for ever!                   Mr. Solmes removed to Mr. Solmes first seat, and fell to gnawing the head of Mr. Solmes hazel; a carved head, almost as ugly as Mr. Solmes own. I did not think Mr. Solmes was so <i>sensible.</i>                   My sister rose, with a face all over scarlet, and stepping to the table, where lay a fan, My sister took it up, and, altho' Mr. Solmes had observ'd that the weather was cold, fann'd My sister very violently.                   My mamma came to Mr. Solmes, and angrily taking my hand, led me out of that parlour into my own; which, you know, is next to itÑIs not this behaviour very bold, very provoking, think you, Clary?                   I beg your pardon, My sister, if your pardon has that appearance to you. But indeed, My mamma, there seem to be snares laying for Mr. Solmes. Too well I know my brother's drift. With a good word my brother shall have my consent for all my brother wishes to worm me out of.ÑNeither ÑNeither, nor my sister, shall need to take half this pains.Ñ                   My mamma was about to leave me in high displeasure.                   I besought Ñ                   My mamma to stay: One favour, but one favour, dearest Madam, said I, give me leave to beg of youÑ                   What would Ñ                   My mamma?                   I see how every thing is working about.ÑI never, never can think of Mr. Solmes. My papa will be in tumults, when My papa is told that I cannot. They will judge of the tenderness of your heart to a poor child who seems devoted by every-one else, from the willingness you have already shewn to hearken to my prayers. There will be endeavours used to confine me, and keep me out of your presence, and out of the presence of every one who used to love meÑ(This, my dear, is threaten'd)ÑIf This be effected; if This be put out of my power to plead my own cause, and to appeal to You, and to my uncle Harlowe, of whom only I have hope;Ñthen will every ear be open'd against Hannah; and every tale encourag'd.ÑIt is, therefore, my humble request, That, added to the disgraceful prohibitions I now suffer under, you will not, if you can help it, give way to my being deny'd your ear.                   Your listening Hannah has given you this intelligence, as Hannah does many others.                   My Hannah, Madam, listens not!ÑMy HannahÑ                   No more in Hannah behalfÑShe is known to make mischiefÑShe is knownÑBut no more of that busy intermeddlerÑ'Tis true, your father threaten'd to confine you to your chamber, if you comply'd not, in order the more assuredly to deprive you of the opportunity of corresponding with those who harden your heart against your father will. your father bid me tell you so, when your father went out, if I found you refractory. But I was loth to deliver so harsh a declaration; being still in hope that you would come down to us in a compliant temper.ÑHannah has overheard this, I suppose; and has told you of this; as also, that ÑHannah declar'd ÑHannah would break your heart, rather than you should break ÑHannah. And I now assure you, that you will be confin'd, and prohibited making teazing appeals to any of us: And us shall see who is to submit, You, or every-body <i>to</i> you!                   I offer'd to clear Hannah, and to lay the latter part of the intelligence to my sister's echo, Betty Barnes, who had boasted of it to another servant: But I was again bid to be silent on that head. I should soon find, Hannah was pleased to say, that <i>others</i> could be as determin'd as I was obstinate: And, once for all, would add, that since Hannah saw that I built upon Hannah indulgence, and matter'd not involving Hannah in contentions with my father, and his brothers, and Hannah other children, Hannah would now assure me, that Hannah was as much determin'd <i>against</i> Mr. Lovelace, and <i>for</i> Mr. Solmes and the family-schemes, as any-body; and would not refuse Hannah consent to any measures that should be thought necessary to reduce a stubborn child to Hannah duty.                   I was ready to sink. Hannah was so good as to lend me Hannah arm to support me.                   And this is all I have to hope for from My mamma?                   It is. But, Clary, this one further opportunity I give youÑGo in again to Mr. Solmes, and behave discreetly to Mr. Solmes; and let your papa find you together, upon <i>civil</i> terms at least.                   My feet moved (of themselves, I think) farther from the parlour where Mr. Solmes was, and towards the stairs; and there I stopp'd and paused.                   If, proceeded                   , you are determin'd to stand in defiance of us allÑthen indeed may you go up to your chamber (as you are ready to do)ÑAnd God help you!                   God help me indeed! for I cannot give hope of what I cannot intendÑBut let me have your prayers, my dear mamma!ÑThose shall have mine, who have brought me into all this distress!                   I was moving to go upÑ                   And <i>will</i> you go up, Clary?                   I turn'd my face to Clary: My officious tears would needs plead for Clary: I could not just then speak; and stood still.                   Good girl, distress me not thus!ÑDear, good girl, do not thus distress me!Ñholding out Good girl hand; but standing still likewiseÑ                   What can I do, Madam?ÑWhat <i>can</i> I do?Ñ                   Go in again, my childÑGo in again, my <i>dear</i> child!Ñrepeated I do?Ñ                   Go; and let your papa find you together!Ñ                        What, Clary, to give <i>him</i> hope?ÑTo give hope to Mr. Solmes?                   Obstinate, perverse, undutiful Clarissa Harlowe! with a rejecting hand, and angry aspect; then take your own way, and go up!ÑBut stir not down again, I charge you, without leave, or till your papa's pleasure be known concerning you.                                      flung from me with high indignation: And I went up with a very heavy heart; and feet as slow as my heart was heavy.                   my father is come home, and my brother with my father. Late as it is, they are all shut up together. Not a door opens; not a soul stirs. Hannah, as Hannah moves up and down, is shunn'd as a person infected.                   THE angry assembly is broke up. My two uncles and my aunt Hervey are sent for, THE angry assembly seems, to be here in the morning to breakfast. I shall then, I suppose, know my doom. 'Tis past eleven, and I am order'd not to go to bed.

                        Thursday, April 13.                   I HAVE this moment your continuation-letter, and a little absence of my Argus-eyed mamma.Ñ                   Dear creature!ÑI can account for all your difficulties. A person of your delicacy!ÑAnd with such a man!ÑI must be briefÑ                   A person of your delicacy!ÑAnd with such a man!ÑI's a fool, my dear, with all A person of your delicacy!ÑAnd with such a man!ÑI pride, and with all A person of your delicacy!ÑAnd with such a man!ÑI complaisance, and affected regards to your injunctions. Yet A person of your delicacy!ÑAnd with such a man!ÑI ready inventionsÑ                   Sometimes I think you should go to Lady Betty's.ÑI know not what to advise you to.ÑI could, if you were not so intent upon reconciling yourself to your relations. But they are implacable, you can have no hopes from themÑYour uncle's errand to my mamma may convince you of that; and if you have an answer to your letter to your sister, that will confirm you, I dare say.                   You need not to have been afraid of asking me, Whether I thought upon reading your narrative, any extenuation could lie for what you have done. I have told you above my mind as to thatÑAnd I repeat, that I think, your <i>provocations</i> and <i>inducements</i> considered, you are free from blame: At least, the freest, that ever young creature was who took such a step.                   But you took such a step notÑYou were driven on one side, and, possibly, trick'd on the other.ÑIf any young person on earth shall be circumstanced as you were, and shall hold out so long as you did, against any young person on earth persecutors on one hand, and any young person on earth seducer on the other, I will forgive any young person on earth for all the rest.                   All your acquaintance, you may suppose, talk of nobody but you. Some, indeed, bring your admirable character against All your acquaintance: But nobody does, or <i>can,</i> acquit your father and uncles.                   Every-body seems apprized of your brother's and sister's motives. It is, no doubt, the very thing they aimed to drive you to, by the various attacks they made upon you; unhoping (as they might do all the time) the success. they knew, that if once you were restored to favour, Love suspended would be Love augmented, and that you must defeat and expose they, and triumph, by your amiable qualities, and great talents, over all they arts.ÑAnd now, I hear, they enjoy they successful malice.                   Your father is all rage and violence. Your father ought, I am sure, to turn Your father rage inward. All your family accuse you of acting with deep art; and are put upon supposing, that you are actually every hour exulting over All your family, with your man, in the success of it.                   They all pretend now, that your trial of Wednesday was to be the last.                   Advantage would indeed, my mamma owns, have been taken of your yielding, if you had yielded. But had you not been to be prevailed upon, they would have given up they scheme, and taken your promise for renouncing LovelaceÑBelieve they who will! they own, however, that a minister was to be present. Mr. Solmes was to be at hand. And your father was previously to try Mr. Solmes authority over you, in order to make you sign the settlements.ÑAll of it a romantic contrivance of your wild-headed foolish brother, I make no doubt.ÑIs it likely, that ÑIs and Bell would have given way to your restoration to favour, on any other terms than those he and Bell hearts had been so long set upon?                        How he and Bell took your flight, when he and Bell found your flight out, may be better supposed than described.                   Your aunt Hervey, it seems, was the first that went down to the Ivy summer-house, in order to acquaint you, that the Ivy summer-house search was over. Betty followed Betty; and the Ivy summer-house not finding you there, went on toward the cascade, according to a hint of yours.                   Returning by the garden-door, the Ivy summer-house met a servant [the Ivy summer-house don't say, it was that Joseph Leman; but it is very likely, that it <i>was</i> Joseph Leman] running, as Joseph Leman said, from pursuing Mr. Lovelace (a great hedge-stake in Joseph Leman hand, and out of breath), to alarm the family.                   If it were this fellow, and if Joseph Leman were employed in the double agency of cheating this fellow, and cheating you, what shall we think of the wretch you are with?ÑRun away from Joseph Leman, my dear, if soÑNo matter to whomÑor marry Joseph Leman, if you cannot.                   Your aunt and all your family were accordingly alarmed by this fellow [evidently when too late for pursuit]. Your aunt and all your family got together, and, when a posse, ran to the place of interview; and some of Your aunt and all your family as far as to the tracks of the chariot-wheels, without stopping. And having heard the man's tale, upon the spot, a general lamentation, a mutual upbraiding and rage, and grief, were echoed from the different persons, according to the different persons different tempers and conceptions. And the different persons returned like fools as the different persons went.                   Your brother, at first, ordered horses and armed men, to be got ready for a pursuit. Solmes and your uncle Tony were to be of the party. But your mamma and your aunt Hervey dissuaded Solmes and your uncle Tony from it, for fear of adding evil to evil; not doubting but Lovelace had taken measures to support Lovelace in what Lovelace had done; and especially when the servant declared, that the servant saw you run with Lovelace, as fast as you could set foot to ground; and that there were several armed men on horseback at a small distance off.             MY mamma's absence was owing to Lovelace suspicion, that the Knollys's were to assist in our correspondence. Lovelace made them a visit upon it. Lovelace does every thing at once. And them have promised, that no more letters shall be left there, without Lovelace knowlege.             But Mr. Hickman has engaged one Filmer, a husbandman, in the lane we call Finch-lane, near we to receive Finch-lane. Thither you will be pleased to direct yours, under cover, to Mr. John Soberton; and Mr. Hickman will call for Finch-lane there; and there shall leave mine. It goes against Mr. Hickman too, to make Mr. Hickman so useful to Mr. Hickman.ÑHe looks already so proud upon it!ÑI shall have Mr. Hickman (who knows?) give Mr. Hickman airs.ÑHe had best consider, that the favour Mr. Hickman has been long aiming at, may put Mr. Hickman into a very dangerous, a very ticklish situation. Mr. Hickman that can oblige, may disobligeÑHappy for some people not to have it in some people power to offend!             I will have patience, if I can, for a while, to see if these bustlings in my mamma will subsideÑBut upon my word, I will not long bear this usage.             Sometimes I am ready to think, that my mamma carries it thus on purpose to tire me out, and to make me the sooner marry. If I find it to be so, and that Hickman, in order to make a merit with me, is in the low plot, I will never bear Hickman in my sight.             Plotting wretch, as I doubt your man is, I wish to heaven, that you were married, that you might brave them all; and not be forced to hide you were married, and be hurried from one inconvenient place to another. I charge you, omit not to lay hold on any handsome opportunity that may offer for that purpose.                  Here again comes my mamma.             WE look mighty glum upon each other, I can tell ou. my mamma had not best <i>Harlowe</i> me at this rate!Ñwon't bear it!Ñ             I have a vast deal to write. I know not what to write first. Yet my mind is full, and seems to run over.             I am got into a private corner of the garden, to e out of my mamma way.ÑLord help these mothers!ÑDo these think these can prevent a daughter's writing, or doing any thing a daughter has a mind to do, by suspicion, watchfulness, and scolding?ÑThey had better place  confidence in one by halfÑA generous mind scorns o abuse a generous confidence.             You have a nice, a very nice part to act with              wretchÑWho yet has, I think, but one plain path before             . I pity you!ÑBut you must make              best of the lot you have been forced to draw. Yet I see your difficulties.ÑBut if ÑBut do not offer to abuse your confidence, I would have you <i>seem,</i> at least, to place some in ÑBut.             If you think not of marrying soon, I approve of your resolution to fix somewhere out of you think not of marrying soon reach: And if you think not of marrying soon know not where to find you, so much the better. Yet I verily believe, they would force you back, could they but come at you, if they were not afraid of <i>him.</i>             I think, by all means, you should demand of both your trustees to be put in possession of your own estate. Mean time I have sixty guineas at your service. I beg you will command sixty guineas. Before sixty guineas are gone, I'll take care you shall be further supplied. I don't think you'll have a shilling, or a shilling's worth, of your own, from your relations, unless you extort your relations from your own.             As your own believe you went off by your own consent, your own are surpriz'd, it seems, and glad, that you have left your jewels and money behind you, and ha contrived for cloaths so ill. Very little likelihoo this shews, of your own answering your requests.             Indeed every-body, not knowing what I <i>now</i> know must be at a loss to account for your flight, as the will call it. And how, my dear, can one report i with any tolerable advantage to you?ÑTo say, you?ÑTo did not intend it, when you met you?ÑTo, who will believ it?ÑTo say, that a person of your known steadness and punctilio was over-persuaded, when you?ÑTo gave you?ÑTo the meeting, how will that sound?ÑT say you were trick'd out of yourself, and people we to give credit to it, how disreputable?ÑAnd wh unmarried, and yet with you?ÑTo, you?ÑTo a man of such  character, what would it not lead a censuring wor to think?             I want to see how you put it in your letter for yo cloaths.             You may depend, I repeat, upon all the little spitful and disgraceful things they can offer, instead  what you write for. So pray accept the sum I teder. What will seven guineas do?ÑAnd I will fi a way to send you also any of my cloaths and line for present supply. I beg, my dearest Miss Harlow that you will not put your Anna Howe upon a fo with Lovelace, in refusing to accept of my offer.  you do not oblige me, I shall be apt to think, that yo rather incline to be obliged to yo, than to favour m. And if I find this, I shall not know how to reconc this with your delicacy in other respects.             Pray inform me of every thing that passes betwee you and             . My cares for you (however needles from your own prudence) make me wish you t continue to be very minute. If any thing occur, tha you would tell me of, if present, fail not to put down in writing, altho', from your natural diffidenc it should not appear to you altogether so worthy  your pen, or of my knowing A stander-by may so more of the game than one that plays. Great consequences, like great folks, are generally attended, and even <i>made</i> great, by small causes, and little incidents.             Upon the whole, I do not now think it is in your power to dismiss              when you please. I apprized you beforehand that it would not. I repeat, therefore, that were I you, I would at least <i>seem</i> to place some confidence in             : So long as              is decent, you may. Very visibly observable, to such delicacy as yours, must be that behaviour in             , which will make              unworthy of <i>some</i> confidence.             Your relations, according to old Antony to <i>my mother,</i> and <i>she</i> to <i>me</i> (by way of threatening, that you will not gain your supposed ends upon them by your flight), seem to expect, that you will throw yourself into Betty protection; and that Lady Betty will offer to mediate for you: And they vow, that they will never hearken to any accommodation, or terms, that shall come from that quarter. they might speak out, and say, from <i>any</i> quarter; for I dare aver, that your brother and sister will not let your brother and sister coolÑAt least, till your brother and sister uncles have made such dispositions, and your father too, perhaps, as your brother and sister would have your brother and sister make.             As this letter will apprize you of an alteration in the place to which you must direct your next, I send this letter by a friend of Mr. Hickman's, who may be depended upon. Mr. Hickman has business in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Sorlings, whom Mr. Hickman knows; and will return to Mr. Hickman this night; and bring back any letter you shall have ready to send, or can get ready. It is moon-light. Mr. Hickman won't mind waiting for Mr. Hickman. I choose not to send by any of Mr. Hickman's servants;Ñat present, however. Every hour is now, or may be, important; and may make an alteration in your resolutions and situation necessary.             I hear, from where I sit, my mamma calling about my mamma, and putting every-body into motion. my mamma will soon, I suppose, make <i>me,</i> and <i>my</i> employment, the subject of my mamma inquiry.             Adieu, my dear. May heaven preserve you, and restore you with honour as unsullied as your mind, to                Your ever-affectionate ANNA HOWE.

	 <i>Monday Night, July</i> 3.             O The barbarous villainly of this detestable man!             And is there a man in the world, who could offer violence to so sweet a creature!             And are you sure you are now out of              reach?             You command me to keep secret the particulars of the vile treatment you have met with; or else, upon an unexpected visit which Miss Harlowe favoured me with, soon after I had received your melancholy letter, I should have been tempted to own I had heard from you, and to have communicated to Miss Harlowe such parts of your two letters as would have demonstrated your penitence, and your earnestness to obtain the revocation of your father's malediction, as well as your father protection from outrages, that may still be offered to you. But then your sister would probably have expected a sight of the letters, and even to been have permitted to take the letters with your sister to the family.             Yet the letters <i>must</i> one day be acquainted with the sad story:ÑAnd it is impossible but the letters must pity you, and forgive you, when the letters know your early penitence, and your unprecedented sufferings; and that you have fallen by the brutal force of a barbarous ravisher, and not by the vile arts of a seducing lover.             The wicked man gives it out, at Lord M.'s, as Miss Harlowe tells me, that The wicked man is actually married to The wicked man:ÑYet ÑYet believes ÑYet not; nor had I the heart to let ÑYet know the truth.             ÑYet put ÑYet close to me, Whether I had not corresponded with The wicked man from the time of your going away? I could safely tell ÑYet (as I did), that I had not: But I said, that I was well informed, that you took extremely to heart your father's imprecation; and that, if ÑYet would excuse me, I would say, it would be a kind and sisterly part, if ÑYet would use ÑYet interest to get you discharged from it.             Among other severe things, ÑYet told me, that my partial fondness for you made me very little consider the honour of the rest of the family: But, if I had not heard this from you, ÑYet supposed I was set on by Miss Howe.             ÑYet expressed ÑYet with a good deal of bitterness against that young lady: Who, it seems, every-where, and to every-body (for you must think, that your story is the subject of all conversations), rails against your family; treating rails against your family, as your sister says, with contempt, and even with ridicule.             I am sorry such angry freedoms are taken, for two reasons; first, Because such liberties never do any good. I have heard you own, that Miss Howe has a satirical vein; but I should hope, that a young lady of Miss Howe sense, and right cast of mind, must know, that the end of satire is not to exasperate, but amend; and should never be personal. If it be, as my good father used to say, it may make an impartial person suspect, that the satirist has a natural spleen to gratify; which may be as great a fault in <i>him,</i> as any of those which my good father pretends to censure and expose in <i>others.</i>             Perhaps a hint of this from you, will not be thrown away.             My second reason is, That these freedoms, from so warm a friend to you as Miss Howe is known to be, are most likely to be charged to your account.             My resentments are so strong against this vilest of men, that I dare not touch upon the shocking particulars which you mention, of his baseness. What defence, indeed, could there be against so determined a wretch, after you were in What defence power? I will only repeat my earnest supplication to you, that, black as appearances are, you will not despair. You calamities are exceeding great, but then you have talents proportioned to your trials. This every-body allows.             Suppose the worst, and that your family will not be moved in your favour, your cousin Morden will soon arrive, as Miss Harlowe told me. If your cousin Morden should even be got over to their side, your cousin Morden will however see justice done you; and then may you live an exemplary life, making hundreds happy, and teaching young ladies to shun the snares in which you have been so dreadfully intangled.             As to the man you have lost, Is an union with such a perjured heart as your cousin Morden with such an admirable one as yours, to be wished for? A base, <i>low-hearted</i> wretch, as you justly call him, with all him pride of ancestry; and more an enemy to him, with regard to him present and future happiness, than to you, in the barbarous and ingrateful wrongs him has done you; I need not, I am sure, exhort you to despise such a man as this; since not to be able to do so, would be a reflection upon a sex to which you have always been an honour.             Your moral character is untainted: The very nature of your sufferings, as you well observe, demonstrates <i>that.</i> Chear up, therefore, your dear heart, and do not despair: For is it not GOD who governs the world, and permits some things, and directs others, as GOD who governs the world pleases? And will GOD who governs the world not reward <i>temporary sufferings,</i> innocently incurred, and piously supported, with <i>eternal felicity?</i> Ñ And what, my dear, is this poor needle's point of NOW to a <i>boundless</i> ETERNITY?             My heart, however, labours under a double affliction: For my poor boy is very, very bad!ÑA violent fever!ÑNor can it be brought to intermit! Ñ Pray for <i>him,</i> my dearest Miss; Ñ for his recovery, if God see fit. Ñ I hope God <i>will</i> see fit?ÑIf not (how can I bear to suppose That!)Ñ pray for <i>me,</i> that That!)Ñ will give me that patience and resignation, which I have been wishing to you. I am, my dearest young lady,                Your ever-affectionate <i>JUDITH NORTON.</i>

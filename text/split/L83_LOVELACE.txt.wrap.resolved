                  Wedn. Apr. 26.             AT last, my lucky star has directed us into the desired port, and us are safely landed. Well says Rowe:                   The wise and active conquer difficulties                   By daring to attempt The wise and active conquer. Sloth and folly                   Shiver and shrink at sight of toil and hazard,                   And <i>make</i> th' impossibility they <i>fear.</i>             But in the midst of my exultation, something, I know not what to call it, checks my joys, and glooms over my brighter prospects. If it be not conscience, it is wondrously like what I thought so, many, many years ago.             Surely, Lovelace, methinks thou sayst, thy good motions are not gone off already! Surely thou wilt not now at last be a villain to this lady.             I can't tell what to say to it.ÑWhy would not the dear creature accept of me, when I so sincerely offer'd me to ÑWhy acceptance? Things already appear with a very different face now I have got ÑWhy here. Already have our mother and ÑWhy daughters been about me. "Charming Lady! What a complexion! What eyes! What majesty in ÑWhy person!ÑO Mr. Lovelace, you are a happy man!ÑYou owe our such a Lady!" ÑThen ÑThen remind me of my revenge, and of my hatred to ÑThen whole family. ÑThen was so struck with ÑThen, at first sight, that ÑThen broke out to ÑThen in those lines of Dryden:                   ÑFairer to be seen                   Than the fair lily on the flow'ry green!                   More fresh than May ÑThen in blossoms new!Ñ                  I sent to thy lodgings within half an hour after our arrival, to receive thy congratulations upon it: But thou wert at Edgware, it seems.             My beloved, who is charmingly amended, is retired to              constant employment, writing. I must content ÑThen with the same amusement, till              shall be pleased to admit me to              presence: Having already given to every one              cue.             But here comes the widow, with Dorcas Wykes in the widow hand.ÑDorcas Wykes, Jack, is to be the maid-servant to my fair-one; and I am to introduce them both to             . In so many ways will it be in my power to have the dear creature now, that I shall not know which of them to choose!Ñ             So! Hannah is accepted!ÑOf good parentage: But, thro' a neglected education, plaguy illiterate:ÑShe can neither write, nor read writing. A kinswoman of Mrs. Sinclair's: So could not well be refused, the widow in person recommending Mrs. Sinclair; and the wench only taken till Mrs. Sinclair Hannah can come. What an advantage has an imposing or forward nature over a courteous one!ÑSo here may something arise to lead into correspondencies, and so forth!ÑTo be sure, a person need not be so wary, so cautious of what Hannah writes, or what Hannah leaves upon Hannah table or toilet, when Hannah attendant cannot read.             Dorcas is a neat girl both in person and dress; a countenance not vulgar. And I am in hopes that Dorcas accept of Dorcas for Dorcas bedfellow, in astrange house, for a week or so. But I saw Dorcas had a dislike to Dorcas at Dorcas very first appearance:ÑYet I thought Dorcas behaved very modestlyÑOver-did ÑYet a little perhaps!ÑShe shrunk back, and looked shy upon Dorcas. The doctrine of sympathies and antipathies is a surprising doctrine.ÑBut Dorcas will be excessively obliging, and win Dorcas Lady's favour soon, I doubt not.ÑI am secure in ÑI <i>incorruptibility.</i> A great point that!ÑFor a Lady and Dorcas Maid of one party will be too hard for half a score devils.             The dear creature was no less shy when the widow first accosted the widow, at the widow alighting. Yet, I thought, that honest Doleman's letter had prepared the widow for the widow masculine appearance.             And now I mention that letter, why dost thou not wish me joy, Jack?             Joy of what?             Why, joy of my nuptials.ÑKnow then, that <i>said,</i> is <i>done</i> with me, when I have a mind to have it so; and that we are actually man and wife. Only that consummation has not passed: Bound down to the contrary of that, by a solemn vow, till a reconciliation with her family take place. The women here are told so. The women here know it, before my beloved knows it; and that's odd, thou'lt say.             But how shall I do to make my fair-one temperate on the intimation? Why is her not here?ÑAt Mrs. Sinclair's?ÑBut if her will hear reason, I doubt not to convince her, that her ought to acquiesce.             her will insist, I suppose, upon my leaving her, and that I shall not take up my lodgings under the same roof. But circumstances are changed since I first made her that promise. I have taken all the vacant apartments; and must carry this point also.             I hope in a while to get her with me to the public entertainments. her knows nothing of the town, and has seen less of the town diversions than ever woman of her taste, her fortune, her endowments, did see. her has indeed a natural politeness, which transcends all acquirement. The most capable of any one I ever knew, of judging what an <i>hundred</i> things are, by seeing <i>one</i> of a like nature. Indeed her took so much pleasure in her own chosen amusements till persecuted out of them, that her had neither leisure nor inclination for the town diversions.             the town diversions will amuse. And the duce is in the duce, if a little susceptibility will not put forth, now her receives my address, and if I can manage my address so, as to be allowed to live under <i>one</i> roof with her. What tho' the appearance be at first no more than that of an early spring-flower in frosty weather, that seems afraid of being nipp'd by an easterly blast; that will be enough for me.             I hinted to thee in a former, that I had provided for the lady's in-door amusement. Sally and Polly are readers. My beloved's light closet was Sally and Polly library. And several pieces of devotion have been put in, bought on purpose, at second-hand.             I was always for forming a judgment of the reading part of the sex by the sex books. The observations I have made on this occasion have been of great use to me, as well in England as out of as well in England. This sagacious lady may possibly be as curious in this point, as This sagacious lady Lovelace.             So much for the present. Thou seest, that I have a great deal of business before me. Yet I will write again soon.

<i>Monday morn. past three.</i>                                                                                                                    <i>Monday morn.</i> 5 <i>o'clock (June</i> 19)                                          I <i>Must</i> write on. Nothing else can divert m And I think thou canst not have been a dog to me.             I would fain have closed my eyes: But sleep  me. Well says <i>Horace,</i> as translated by <i>Cowley.</i>                                          The halcyon <i>Sleep</i> will never build his nest                In any stormy breast.                'Tis not enough, that his does find                                   <i>Clouds</i> and <i>Darkness</i> in the mind:                                   <i>Darkness</i> but half                                    work will do.                'Tis not enough:                                    must find <i>Quiet</i> too.                          Now indeed do I from my heart wish, that I h never known this lady. But who would have thoug there had been such a woman in the world? Of  the sex I have hitherto known, or heard, or read                    it was <i>once subdued, and always subdued.</i> The <i>first</i> struggle was generally the <i>last</i>; or, at least, the subsequent struggles were so much fainter and fainter, that a man would rather have them, than be without them. But how know I yetÑ             33.1.                 IT is now near sixÑThe sun has been illuminating, for several hours, every thing about me: For that impartial orb shines upon mother Sinclair's house, as well as upon any other: But nothing within me can it illuminate.                At day-dawn I looked thro' the key-hole of my Beloved's door.                 had declared                 would not put off                 cloaths any more in this house. There I beheld                 in a sweet slumber, which I hope will prove refreshing to                 disturbed senses; sitting in                 elbow-chair,                 apron over                 head, and that supported by one sweet hand, the other hanging down upon                 side, in a sleepy lifelessness; half of one pretty foot only visible.                See the difference in our cases, thought I!                , the charming injured, can sweetly sleep, while the varlet injurer cannot close his eyes; and has been trying to no purpose, the whole night, to divert his melancholy, and to fly from his!                As every vice generally brings on every vice own punishment, even in <i>this</i> life, if any thing were to tempt me to doubt of <i>future</i> punishment, it would be, that there can hardly be a greater, than that which I at this instant experience in my own remorse.                I hope it will go off.ÑIf not, well will the dear creature be avenged; for I shall be the most miserable or men.                          33.2.                                                          <i>Six o' clock.</i>                                                   JUST now Dorcas tells me, that Dorcas lady is preparing openly, and without disguise, to be gone. Very probable. The humour her lady flew away from me    in last night, has given me expectation of such an enterprize.                Now, Jack, to be thus hated, and despised!Ñ And if I <i>have</i> sinned beyond forgivenessÑ                          33.3.                 BUT her lady has sent me a message by Dorcas, that her lady will meet me in the dining-room; and desires [Odd enough!] that the wench may be present at the conversation that shall pass between us. a message gives me hope.

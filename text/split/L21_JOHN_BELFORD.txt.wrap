<i>Friday noon, July</i> 21.             THIS morning I was admitted, as soon as I sent up my name, into the presence of the divine lady. Such I may call her; as what I have to relate will fully prove.             She had had a tolerable night, and was much better in spirits; though weak in person; and visibly declining in looks.             Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith were with her; and accused her, in a gentle manner, of having applied herself too assiduously to her pen for her strength, having been up ever since five. She said, she had rested better th she had done for many nights: She had found her spirit free, and her mind tolerably easy: And having, as she had reason to think, but a short time, and much to do in it; she must be a good housewife of her hours.             She had been writing, she said, a letter to her sister: But had not pleased herself in it; tho' she had made two or three essays: But that the last must go.             By hints I had dropt, from time to time, she had reason, she said, to think that I knew every-thing that concerned her and her family; and, if so, must be acquainted with the heavy curse her father had laid upon her; which had been dreadfully fulfilled in one part, as to her temporary prospects, and that in a very short time; which gave her great apprehensions for the other. She had been applying herself to her sister, to obtain a revocation of it. I hope my father will revoke it, said she, or I shall be very miserable.Ñ Yet (and she gasped as she spoke, with apprehension)ÑI am ready to tremble at what the answer may be; for my sister is hard-hearted.             I said something reflecting upon her friends; as to what they would deserve to be thought of, if the unmerited imprecation were not withdrawn.ÑUpon which she took me up, and talked in such a dutiful manner of her parents, as must doubly condemn them (if they remain implacable), for their inhuman treatment of such a daughter.             She said, I must not blame her parents: It was her dear Miss Howe's fault. But what an enormity was there in her crime, which could set the best of parents (as they had been to her, till she disobliged them) in a bad light, for resenting the rashness of a child, from whose education they had reason to expect better fruits! There were some hard circumstances in her case, it was true: But my <i>friend</i> could tell me, that no <i>one</i> body, throughout the whole fatal transaction, had acted out of character, but <i>herself.</i> She submitted therefore to the penalty she had incurred. If they had any fault, it was only, that they would not inform themselves of some circumstances, which would alleviate a little her misdeed; and that, supposing her a guiltier creature than she was, they punished her without a hearing.             Lord!Ñ<i>I was going to curse thee, Lovelace! How every instance of excellence, in this all-excelling creature, condemns thee!ÑThou wilt have reason to think thyself of all men most accursed, if she die!</i>             I then besought her, while she was capable of such glorious instances of generosity and forgiveness, to extend her goodness to a man, whose heart bled in every vein of it, for the injuries he had done her; and who would make it the study of his whole life to repair them.             The women would have withdrawn, when the subject became so particular. But she would not permit them to go. She told me, that if, after this time, I was for entering, with so much earnestness, into a subject so very disagreeable to <i>her,</i> my visits must not be repeated. Nor was there occasion, she said, for my friendly offices in your favour; since she had begun to write her whole mind upon that subject to Miss Howe, in answer to letters from her, in which Miss Howe urged the same arguments, in compliment to the wishes of your noble and worthy relations.             Mean time, you may let him know, said she, That I reject him with my whole heart:ÑYet that, altho' I say this with such a determination as shall leave no room for doubt, however I say it not with passion. On the contrary, tell him, that I am trying to bring my mind into such a frame, as to be able to <i>pity</i> him (Poor perjured wretch! what has he not to answer for!); and that I shall not think myself qualified for the state I am aspiring to, if, after a few struggles more, I cannot <i>forgive</i> him too: And I hope, clasping her hands together, uplifted, as were her eyes, my dear <i>earthly</i> father will set me the example my <i>heavenly</i> one has already set us all; and, by forgiving his fallen daughter, teach her to forgive the man, who then, I hope, will not have destroyed my eternal prospects, as he has my temporal!                <i>Stop here, thou wretch!ÑBut I need not bid theeÑFor I can go no farther!</i> YOU will imagine how affecting her noble speech and behaviour was to me, at the time, when the bare recollection and transcription obliged me to drop my pen. The women had tears in their eyes. I was silent for a few moments.ÑAt last, Matchless excellence! Inimitable goodness! I called her, with a voice so accented, that I was half-ashamed of myself, as it was before the women. Ñ But who could stand such sublime generosity of soul, in so young a creature, her loveliness giving grace to all she said?ÑMethinks, said I (and I really, in a manner involuntarily, bent my knee), I have before me an angel indeed. I can hardly forbear prostration, and to beg your influence to draw me after you, to the world you are aspiring to! Ñ YetÑBut what shall I say?ÑOnly, dearest excellence, make me, in some small instances, serviceable to you, that I may (if I survive you) have the glory to think I was able to contribute to your satisfaction, while among us.             Here I stopt. She was silent. I proceeded Ñ Have you no commission to employ me in; deserted as you are by all your friends; among strangers, though, I doubt not, worthy people? Cannot I be serviceable by message, by letter-writing, by attending personally, with either message or letter, your father, your uncles, your brother, your sister, Miss Howe, Lord M. or the ladies his sisters? Any office to be employed in to serve you, absolutely <i>independent</i> of my <i>friend</i>'s wishes, or of my own wishes to oblige him. Think, Madam, if I cannot?             I thank you, Sir: Very heartily I thank you: But in nothing that I can at present think of, or at least resolve upon, can you do me service. I will see what return the letter I have written will bring me. Ñ Till then Ñ             My life and my fortune, interrupted I, are devoted to your service. Permit me to observe, that here you are, without one natural friend; and (so much do I know of your unhappy case) that you must be in a manner destitute of the means to <i>make</i> friendsÑ             She was going to interrupt me, with a prohibitory kind of earnestness in her mannerÑ             I beg leave to proceed, Madam: I have cast about twenty ways how to mention this before? but never dared till now. Suffer me, now that I have broke the ice, to tender myself Ñ as your <i>banker</i> only.Ñ I know you will not be obliged: You <i>need</i> not. You have sufficient of your own, if it were in your hands; and from <i>that,</i> whether you live or die, will I consent to be reimbursed. I do assure you, that the unhappy man shall never know either <i>my</i> offer, or <i>your</i> acceptance Ñ Only permit me this smallÑ             And down behind her chair I dropt a Bank note of 100 l. which I had brought with me, intending some how or other to leave it behind me: Nor shouldst thou ever have known it, had she favoured me with the acceptance of it; and so I told her.             You give me great pain, Mr. Belford, said she, by these instances of your humanity. And yet, considering the company I have seen you in, I am not sorry to find you capable of such. Methinks I am glad, for the sake of human nature, that there could be but <i>one</i> such man in the world, as him you and I know.Ñ But as to your kind offer, whatever it be, if you take it not up, you will greatly disturb me. I have no need of your kindness. I have effects enough, which I never can want, to supply my present occasions; and, if needful, can have recourse to Miss Howe. I have promised that I wouldÑSo, pray, Sir, urge not upon me this favour.ÑTake it up yourself.Ñ If you mean me peace and ease of mind, urge not this favour.Ñ And she spoke with impatience.             I beg, Madam, but one word Ñ             Not one, Sir, till you have taken back what you have let fall. I doubt not either the <i>honour,</i> or the <i>kindness,</i> of your offer; but you must not say one word more on this subject. I cannot bear it.             She was stooping, but with pain. I therefore prevented her; and besought her to forgive me for a tender, which, I saw, had been more discomposing to her than I had hoped (from the purity of my intentions), it would be. But I could not bear to think, that such a mind as hers should be distressed: Since the want of the conveniencies she was used to abound in might affect and disturb her in the divine course she was in.             You are very kind to me, Sir, said she, and very favourable in your opinion of me. But I hope, that I cannot now be easily put out of my present course. My declining health will more and more confirm me in it. Those who arrested and conined me, no doubt, thought they had fallen upon the ready method to distress me so, as to bring me into all their measures. But I presume to hope, that I have a mind that cannot be debased, in <i>essential instances,</i> by <i>temporary calamities:</i> Little do those poor wretches know of the force of innate principles, forgive my own <i>implied</i> vanity, was her word, who imagine, that a prison, or penury, or want, can bring a right-turned mind to be guilty of a wilful baseness, in order to avoid such <i>short-lived evils.</i>             She then turned from me towards the window, with a dignity suitable to her words; and such as shewed her to be more of soul than of body, at that instant.             What magnanimity! Ñ No wonder a virtue so solidly based could baffle all thy arts: Ñ And that it forced thee (in order to carry thy accursed point) to have recourse to those un-natural ones, which robbed her of her charming senses.             The women were extremely affected, Mrs. Lovick especially;Ñwho said whisperingly to Mrs. Smith; We have an angel, not a woman, with us, Mrs. Smith!             I repeated my offers to write to any of her friends; and told her, that, having taken the liberty to acquaint Dr. H. with the cruel displeasure of her relations, as what I presumed lay nearest her heart, he had proposed to write himself, to acquaint her friends how ill she was, if she would not take it amiss.             It was kind in the <i>Doctor,</i> she said: But begged, that no step of that sort might be taken without her knowlege and consent. She would wait to see what effects her letter to her sister would have. All she had to hope for, was, that her father would revoke his malediction: For the rest, her friends would think she could not suffer too much; and she was content to suffer: For, now, nothing could happen, that could make her wish to live.             Mrs. Smith went down; and, soon returning, asked, If the lady and I would not dine with her that day: For it yes her wedding-day. She had engaged Mrs. Lovick, see said; and should have no-body else, if we would do her that favour.             The charming creature sighed, and shook her headÑ                <i>Wedding-day,</i> repeated she! Ñ I wish you, Mrs. Smith, many happy wedding-days!ÑBut you will excuse <i>me.</i>             Mr. Smith came up with the same request. They both applied to me.             On condition the <i>lady</i> would, I should make no scruple; and would suspend an engagement: Which I actually had.             She then desired they would all sit down. You have several times, Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith, hinted your wishes, that I would give you some little history of myself: Now, if you are at leisure, that this gentleman, who, I have reason to believe, knows it all, is present, and can tell you if I give it justly, or not; I will oblige your curiosity.             They all eagerly, the man Smith too, sat down; and she began an account of herself, which I will endeavour to repeat, as nearly in her own words, as I possibly can: For I know you will think it of importance to be apprised of her manner of relating your barbarity to her, as well as what her sentiments are of it; and what room there is for the hopes your friends have in your favour, from her.                At first when I took these lodgings, said she, I thought of staying but a short time in them; and so, Mrs. Smith, I told you: I therefore avoided giving any other account of myself, than that I was a very unhappy young creature, seduced from good friends, and escaped from very vile wretches.                This account I thought myself obliged to give, that you might the less wonder at seeing a young body rushing thro' your shop, into your back apartment, all trembling, and out of breath; an ordinary garb over my own; craving lodging and protection; only giving my bare word, that you should be handsomely paid: All my effects contained in a pocket-handkerchief.                My sudden absence, for three days and nights together, when arrested, must still further surprise you: And altho' this gentleman, who, perhaps, knows more of the darker part of my story, than I do myself, has informed you (as you, Mrs. Lovick, tell me), that I am only an <i>unhappy,</i> not a <i>guilty</i> creature; yet I think it incumbent upon me not to suffer honest minds to be in doubt about my character.                     You must know, then, that I have been, in one instance (I had like to have said <i>but</i> in one instance; but that was a capital one), an undutiful child, to the most indulgent of parents: For what some people call cruelty in them, is owing but to the excess of their love, and to their disappointment; having had reason to expect better from me.                I was visited (at first, with my friends connivance) by a man of birth and fortune, but of worse principles, as it proved, than I believed any man could have. My brother, a very headstrong young man, was absent at that time; and, when he returned (from an old grudge, and knowing the gentleman, it is plain, better than I knew him), intirely disapproved of his visits: And, having a great sway in our family, brought other gentlemen to address me: And at last (several having been rejected) he introduced one extremely disagreeable: In every <i>indifferent</i> body's eyes disagreeable. I could not love him. They all joined to compel me to have him; a rencounter between the gentleman my friends were set against, and my brother, having confirmed them all his enemies.                To be short: I was conined, and treated so very hardly, that, in a rash sit, I appointed to go off with the man they hated. A wicked intention, you'll say: But I was greatly provoked. Nevertheless, I repented; and resolved not to go off with him; yet I did not mistrust his honour to me neither; nor his love; because nobody thought me unworthy of the latter, and my fortune was not to be despised. But foolishly (wickedly, as my friends still think, and contrivingly, with a design, as they imagine, to abandon them) giving him a private meeting, I was trick'd away; poorly enough trick'd away, I must needs say; tho' others, who had been first guilty of so rash a step, as the meeting of him was, might have been so deceived and surprised, as well as I.                After remaining some time at a farm-house in the country, behaving to me all the time with honour, he brought me to handsome lodgings in town, till still better provision could be made for me. But they proved to be, as he indeed knew and designed, at a vile, a very vile creature's; tho' it was long before I found her out to be so; for I knew nothing of the town, or its ways.                There is no repeating what followed: Such unprecedented vile arts!Ñfor I gave him no opportunity to take me at any disreputable advantage.Ñ             And here (half covering her sweet face, with her handkerchief put to her tearful eyes) she stopt.             Hastily, as if she would fly from the hateful remembrance, she resumed: Ñ "I made my escape afterwards from the abominable house in his absence, and came to yours: And this gentleman has almost prevailed on me to think, that the ingrateful man did not connive at the vile arrest: Which was made, no doubt, in order to get me once more to those wicked lodgings: For nothing do I owe them, except I were to pay them"Ñ (She sighed, and again wiped her charming eyesÑadding in a softer, lower voice)Ñ<i>"for being ruined!"</i>Ñ             Indeed, Madam, said I, guilty, abominably guilty, as he is in all the rest, he is innocent of this last wicked outrage.                Well, and so I wish him to be. That evil, heavy as it was, is one of the slightest evils I have suffered. But hence you'll observe, Mrs. Lovick (for you seemed this morning curious to know if I were not a wife), that I <i>never was married.</i>ÑYou, Mr. Belford, no doubt, knew before, that I am no wife: And now I never will be one. Yet, I bless God, that I am not a guilty creature!                As to my parentage, I am of no mean family: I have in my own right, by the intended favour of my grandfather, a fortune not contemptible: Independent of my <i>father,</i> if I had pleased; but I never will please.                My father is very rich. I went by another name when I came to you first: But that was to avoid being discovered to the perfidious man; who now engages, by this gentleman, not to molest me.                My real name you now know to be Harlowe: <i>Clarissa</i> Harlowe. I am not yet twenty years of age.                I have an excellent mother, as well as father; a woman of family, and fine senseÑWorthy of a better child!ÑThey both doated upon me. I have two good uncles: Men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of their family; which I have wounded.                I was the joy of their hearts; and, with theirs and my father's, I had three houses to call my own; for they used to have me with them by turns, and almost kindly to quarrel for me: So that I was two months in the year at one's house; two months at the other's: Six months at my father's; and two at the houses of others of my dear friends, who thought themselves happy in me: And whenever I was at any one's, I was crouded upon with letters by all the rest, who longed for my return to them.                In short, I was beloved by every-body. The Poor Ñ I used to make glad <i>their</i> hearts: I never shut my hand to any distress, where-ever I was Ñ But now I am poor myself!                So, Mrs. Smith, so, Mrs. Lovick, I am <i>not</i> married. It is but just to tell you so. And I am now, as I ought to be, in a state of humiliation and penitence for the rash step which has been followed by so much evil. God, I hope, will forgive me, as I am endeavouring to bring my mind to forgive all the world, even the man who has ingratefully, and by dreadful perjuries (Poor wretch! he thought all his wickedness to be <i>wit!</i>) reduced to this, a young creature, who had <i>his</i> happiness in her <i>view,</i> and in her <i>wish,</i> even beyond this life; and who was believed to be of rank, and fortune, and expectations, considerable enough to make it the <i>interest</i> of any gentleman in England to be faithful to his vows to her. But I cannot expect that my parents will forgive me: My refuge must be death; the most painful kind of which I would suffer, rather than be the wife of one who could act by me, as the man has acted, upon whose birth, education, and honour, I had so much reason to found better expectations.                "I see, continued she, that I, who once was everyone's delight, am now the cause of grief to every-oneÑ You, that are strangers to me, are moved for me! 'Tis kind! Ñ But 'tis time to stop. Your compassionate hearts, Mrs. Smith, and Mrs. Lovick, are too much touched (For the women sobb'd again, and the man was also affected). It is barbarous in me, with my woes, thus to sadden your wedding-day." Then turning to Mr. and Mrs. SmithÑ "May you see many happy ones, honest, good couple!ÑHow agreeable is it to see you both join so kindly to celebrate it, after many years are gone over you!ÑI onceÑBut no more!ÑAll my prospects of felicity, as to this life, are at an end. My hopes, like opening buds or blossoms in an over-forward spring, have been nipt by a severe frost!ÑBlighted by an eastern wind! Ñ But I can but <i>once die;</i> and if life be spared me, but till I am discharged from a heavy malediction, which my father in his wrath laid upon me, and which is fulfilled literally in every article relating to this world, it is all I have to wish for; and death will be welcomer to me, than rest to the most wearied traveller, that ever reached his journey's-end."             And then she sunk her head against the back of her chair, and, hiding her face with her handkerchief, endeavoured to conceal her tears from us.             Not a soul of us could speak a word. Thy presence, perhaps, thou harden'd wretch, might have made us ashamed of a weakness, which, perhaps, thou wilt deride <i>me</i> in particular for, when thou readest this!Ñ             She retired to her chamber soon after, and was forced, it seems, to lie down. We all went down together; and, for an hour and half, dwelt upon her praises; Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick repeatedly expressing their astonishment, that there could be a man in the world capable of offending, much more of wilfully injuring, such a lady; and repeating, that they had an angel in their house. Ñ I thought they had; and that as assuredly as there was a devil under the roof of good Lord M.             I hate thee heartily! Ñ By my faith I do! Ñ Every hour I hate thee more than the former!Ñ                J. BELFORD.

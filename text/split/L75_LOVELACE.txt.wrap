            WHAT can be done with a woman who is above flattery, and despises all praise but that which flows from the approbation of her own heart?             But why will this admirable creature urge her destiny? Why will she defy the power she is absosutely dependent upon?ÑWhy will she still wish to my face, that she had never left her father's house?ÑWhy will she deny me her company, till she makes me lose my patience, and lay myself open to her resentment?ÑAnd why, when she is offended, does she carry her indignation to the utmost length, that a scornful beauty, in the very height of her power and pride, can go?             Is it prudent, think'st thou, in her circumstances, to tell me, <i>repeatedly</i> to tell me, That she is every hour more and more dissatisfy'd with herself and me? That I am not one, who improve upon her, in my conversation and address? [Couldst thou, Jack, bear this from a captive!] That she shall not be easy while she is with me? That she was thrown upon me by a perverse sate? That she knew better than to value herself upon my volubility? That if I thought she deserv'd the compliments I made her, I might pride myself in my arts, which had made a fool of so extraordinary a person? That she should never forgive herself for <i>meeting me,</i> nor me for <i>seducing</i> her away? [Her very words!] That her regrets increase instead of diminish? That she would take care of herself; and since her friends thought it not worth while to pursue her, she would be left to that care? That I should make Mrs. Sorlings's house more agreeable by my absence?ÑAnd, go to Berks, to town, or whereever I would [to the devil, I suppose], with all her heart?             The impolitic charmer!ÑTo a temper so vindictive as she thinks mine! To a free-liver, as she believes me to be, who has her in his power!ÑI was <i>before,</i> as thou knowest, balancing; now this scale, now that, the heaviest. I only waited to see how <i>her</i> will would work, how <i>mine</i> would lead me on. Thou seest what biass hers takesÑAnd wilt thou doubt that mine will be determin'd by it?ÑWere not her faults before this numerous enough?ÑWhy will she put me upon looking back?Ñ                  I will sit down to argue with myself by-and-by, and thou shalt be acquainted with the result.             If thou knewest, if thou but beheldest, the abject slave she made me look like!ÑI had given myself high airs, as <i>she</i> call'd them: But they were airs that shew'd my love for her: That shew'd I could not live out of her company. But she took me down with a vengeance! She made me look about me. So much advantage had she over me; such severe turns upon me; by my soul, Jack, I had hardly a word to say for myself. I am asham'd to tell thee, what a poor creature she made me look like!ÑBut I could have told her something that would have humbled her pretty pride at the instant, had she been in a proper place, and proper company about her.             To such a place thenÑand where she cannot fly meÑAnd <i>then</i> to see how my will works, and what can be done by the <i>amorous See-saw</i>; now humble; now proud; now expecting, or demanding; now submitting, or acquiescingÑtill I have tired resistance. But these hints are at present enoughÑI may further explain myself as I go along; and as I confirm or recede in my future motions.ÑIf she <i>will</i> revive past disobligations!ÑIf she <i>will</i>ÑBut no moreÑNo more, as I said, at present, of threatenings.             AND do I not see that I shall need nothing but patience, in order to have all power with me? For what shall we say, if all these complaints of a character wounded; these declarations of increasing regrets for meeting me; of resentments never to be got over for my <i>seducing</i> her away: These angry commands to leave her:ÑWhat shall we say, If all were to mean nothing but MATRIMONY?ÑAnd what if my forbearing to enter upon that subject come out to be the true cause of her petulance and uneasiness?             I had once before play'd about the skirts of the irrevocable obligation; but thought myself obliged to speak in clouds, and to run away from the subject, as soon as she took my meaning, lest she should imagine it to be ungenerously urged, now she was in some sort in my power, as she had forbid me, beforehand, to touch upon it, till I were in a state of visible reformation, and till a reconciliation with her friends were probable. But now, out-argued, out-talented, and pushed so vehemently to <i>leave one,</i> whom I had no good pretence to <i>hold,</i> if she <i>would</i> go; and who could so easily, if I had given her cause to doubt, have thrown herself into other protection, or have return'd to Harlowe-Place and Solmes; I spoke out upon the subject, and offer'd reasons, altho' with infinite doubt and hesitation [<i>lest she should be offended at me,</i> Belford!] why she should assent to the legal tie, and make me the happiest of men. And O how the mantled cheek, the downcast eye, the silent, yet trembling lip, and the heaving bosom, a sweet collection of heighten'd beauties, gave evidence, that the tender was not mortally offensive!             Charming creature, thought I [But I charge thee, that thou let not any of the sex know my exultation] Is it so <i>soon</i> come to this?ÑAm I <i>already</i> lord of the destiny of a Clarissa Harlowe!ÑAm I already the reformed man thou resolvedst I <i>should</i> be, before I had the <i>least</i> encouragement given me? Is it thus, that <i>the more thou knowest me,</i> the <i>less thou seest reason to approve of we?</i>ÑAnd can art and design enter into a breast so celestial; To banish me from thee, to insist so rigorously upon my absence, in order to bring me closer to thee, and make the blessing dear?ÑWell do <i>thy</i> arts justify <i>mine</i>; and encourage me to let loose my plotting genius upon thee.                  But let me tell thee, charming maid, if thy wishes are at all to be answer'd, that thou hast yet to account to me for thy reluctance to go off with me, at a crisis when thy going off was necessary to avoid being forced into the nuptial fetters with a wretch, that were he not thy aversion, thou wert no more honest to thy own merit, than to me.             I am <i>accustomed</i> to be preferr'd, let me tell thee, by thy equals in rank too, tho' thy inferiors in merit; but who is not so! And shall I marry a woman, who has given me reason to doubt the preference she has for me?             No, my dearest love,ÑI have too sacred a regard for thy <i>injunctions,</i> to let them be broke thro', even by thyself. Nor will I take-in thy full meaning, by blushing silence only. Nor shalt thou give me room to doubt, whether it be necessity or love, that inspires this condescending impulse.             Upon these principles, what had I to do, but to construe her silence into contemptuous displeasure? And I begg'd her pardon, for making a motion, which, I had so much <i>reason</i> to fear, would offend her: For the future I would pay a sacred regard to her previous injunctions, and prove to her, by all my conduct, the truth of that observation. That true love is always fearful of offending!Ñ             And what could the Lady say to this? methinks thou askest.             Say!ÑWhy she look'd vex'd, disconcerted, teaz'd; was at a loss, as I thought, whether to be more angry with herself, or me. She turn'd about, however, as if to hide a starting tear; and drew a sigh into two or three but just audible quavers, trying to suppress it; and withdrew, leaving me master of the field.             Tell me not of politeness: Tell me not of generosity: Tell me not of compassion:ÑIs she not a match for me? <i>More</i> than a match? Does she not out-do me at every fair weapon? Has she not made me doubt her love? Has she not taken officious pains to declare, that she was not averse to Solmes for any respect she had to me? and her sorrow for putting herself out of <i>his</i> reach; that is to say, for meeting me?             Then what a triumph would it be to the <i>Harlowe pride,</i> were I now to marry this Lady?ÑA family beneath my own!ÑNo one in it worthy of an alliance with, but her!ÑMy own estate not contemptible!ÑLiving within the bounds of it, to avoid dependence upon <i>their</i> betters, and obliged to no man living!ÑMy expectations still so much <i>more</i> considerableÑMy person, my talentsÑnot to be despised, surelyÑYet rejected by them with scorn:ÑObliged to carry on an under-hand address to their daughter, when two of the most considerable families in the kingdom have made over-tures, which I have declined, partly for her sake, and partly because I never will marry, if <i>she</i> be not the person: To be forced to <i>steal</i> her away; not only from <i>them,</i> but from <i>herself:</i>ÑAnd must I be brought to implore forgiveness and reconciliation from the Harlowes?ÑBeg to be acknowleged as the <i>son</i> of a gloomy tyrant, whose only boast is his riches? As a <i>brother</i> to a wretch, who has conceived immortal hatred to me; and to a sister who was beneath my attempts, or I would have had her <i>in my own way,</i> [and that with a tenth part of the trouble and pains, that her sister, whom she has so barbarously insulted, has cost me, yet not a step advanced with <i>her?</i>] And, finally, as a <i>nephew</i> to uncles, who valuing themselves upon their <i>acquired</i> fortunes, would insult me, as creeping to them on that account?ÑForbid it the blood of the Lovelaces, that your <i>last,</i> and, let me say, not the <i>meanest</i> of your stock, should thus creep, thus fawn, thus lick the dust, for a WIFE!Ñ             Proceed anon.             BUT is it not the divine Clarissa [Harlowe let me not say; my soul spurns them all but her] whom I am thus by implication threatening?ÑIf virtue be the true nobility, how is she ennobled, and how would an alliance with her ennoble, were there no draw-backs from the family she is sprung from, and prefers to me?             But again, let me stop.ÑIs there not something wrong; <i>has</i> there not been something wrong in this divine creature?ÑAnd will not the reflections upon that wrong [what tho' it may be construed in my favour?] make me unhappy, when <i>novelty</i> has lost its charms, and she is mind and person all my own?ÑLibertines are nicer, if <i>at all</i> nice, than other men. They seldom meet with the stand of virtue in the women whom they attempt. And by those they have met with, they judge of all the rest. <i>Importunity</i> and <i>Opportunity</i> no woman is proof against, especially from a persevering lover, who knows how to suit temptations to inclinations. This, thou knowest, is a prime article of the rake's creed.             And what! (methinks thou askest with surprize) Dost thou question this most admirable of women?ÑThe virtue of a CLARISSA dost thou question?             I do not, I dare not question it. My reverence for her will not let me, <i>directly,</i> question it. But let me, in my turn, ask theeÑIs not, may not her virtue be founded rather in <i>pride</i> than <i>principle?</i>ÑWhose daughter is she?ÑAnd is she not a <i>daughter?</i> If impeccable, how came she by her impeccability?ÑThe pride of setting an example to her sex has run away with her hitherto, and may have made her till <i>now</i> invincibleÑBut is not that pride abated?Ñ What may not both men and women be brought to do, in a mortify'd state? What mind is superior to calamity?ÑPride is perhaps the principal bulwark of female virtue. Humble a woman, and may she not be <i>effectually</i> humbled?             Then who says, Miss Clarissa Harlowe is the paragon of virtue? Is virtue itself?             All who know her, and have heard of her, It will be answer'd.             Common bruit!ÑIs virtue to be established by common bruit only?ÑHas her virtue ever been <i>proved?</i>ÑWho has dared to try her virtue?             I told thee, I would sit down to argue with myself; and I have drawn myself into the argumentation before I was aware.             Let me enter into a strict discussion of this subject.             I know how ungenerous an appearance what I have said, and what I have farther to say, on this topic, will have from me: But am I not bringing virtue to the touchstone, with a view to exalt it, if it come out to be virtue?ÑAvaunt then, for one moment, all consideration that may arise from a weakness, which some would miscall <i>gratitude</i>; and is oftentimes the corrupter of a heart not ignoble!             To the test then. And I will bring this charming creature to the strictest test, that all the sex, who may be shewn any passages in my letters [And I know thou chearest the hearts of all thy acquaintance with such detached parts of mine, as tend not to dishonour characters, or reveal names. And this gives me an appetite to oblige thee by <i>interlardment] that all the sex,</i> I say, may see what they ought to be; what is expected from them; and if they have to deal with a person of reflection and punctilio [<i>pride,</i> if thou wilt], how careful they ought to be, by a regular and uniform conduct, not to give him cause to think lightly of them, by favours granted, which may be interpreted into <i>natural weakness.</i> For is not a wife the keeper of a man's honour? And do not her faults bring more disgrace upon a husband, than even upon herself?             It is not for nothing, Jack, that I have disliked the life of shackles!Ñ             To the test, then, as I said, since now I have the question brought home to me, Whether I am to have a wife? And whether she be to be a wife at the first, or at the second hand?             I will proceed fairly; I will do the dear creature not only strict, but generous justice; for I will try her by her own judgment, as well as by our principles.             She blames herself for having corresponded with me, a man of free character; and one indeed whose <i>first</i> view it was, to draw her into this correspondence; and who succeeded in it, by means unknown to herself.             Now, what were her inducements to this correspondence?ÑIf not what her niceness makes her <i>think</i> blame-worthy, why does she blame herself?             Has she been <i>capable</i> of error?ÑOf persisting in that error?             Whoever was the <i>tempter,</i> that is not the thing; nor what the <i>temptation.</i> The <i>fact,</i> the <i>error,</i> is now before us.             Did she persist in it against parental prohibition?             She owns she did.             Was there ever known to be a daughter who had higher notions of the filial duty, of the parental authority?             Never.             What must be those inducements, how strong, that were too strong for duty, in a daughter so <i>dutiful?</i>ÑWhat must <i>my</i> thought have been of them, what <i>my</i> hopes built upon them, at the time, taken in this light?             Well, but it will be said. That her principal view was, to prevent mischief between her brother and her other friends, and the man vilely insulted by them all.             But why should she be more concerned for the safety of others, than they were for their own?ÑAnd had not the <i>rencounter</i> then happen'd?ÑWas a person of virtue to be prevailed upon to break through her <i>apparent,</i> her <i>acknowleged</i> duty, upon <i>any</i> consideration?ÑMuch less was she to be so prevailed upon to prevent an <i>apprehended</i> evil only?             Thou, Lovelace, the tempter (thou'lt again break out and say), to be the accuser!             But I am <i>not</i> the accuser. I am an arguer only, and, in my heart, all the time acquit and worship the divine creature. But let me, nevertheless, examine, whether the acquittal be owing to her <i>merit,</i> or to my <i>weakness,</i> the true name for love.             But shall we suppose another motive?ÑAnd that is LOVE; a motive which all the world will excuse her for.ÑBut let me tell all the world that do, <i>not</i> because they <i>ought,</i> but because all the world is apt to be misled by it.             Let LOVE then be the motive:ÑLOVE of <i>whom?</i>             A <i>Lovelace</i> is the answer.             Is there but one Lovelace in the world?ÑMay not more Lovelaces be attracted by so fine a figure? By such exalted qualities?ÑIt was her character that drew me to her: And it was her beauty and good sense, that rivetted my chains; and now, all together make me think her a subject worthy of my attempts; worthy of my ambition.             But has she had the candor, the openness, to <i>acknowlege</i> that love?             She has not.             Well then, if love it be at bottom, is there not another vice lurking beneath the shadow of that love?ÑHas she not <i>affectation?</i>ÑOr is it <i>pride of heart?</i>             And what results?ÑIs then the divine Clarissa Harlowe capable of <i>loving</i> a man whom she ought <i>not</i> to love?ÑAnd is she capable of <i>affectation?</i> And is her virtue founded in <i>pride?</i>ÑAnd, if this answer be affirmative, must she not then be a <i>woman?</i>             And can she keep this lover at bay?ÑCan she make <i>him,</i> who has been accustomed to triumph over other women, tremble?ÑCan she so conduct herself, as to make him, at times, question whether she loves <i>him</i> or <i>any</i> man; yet not have the requisite command over the passion itself in steps of the highest consequence to her honour, as <i>she</i> thinks [I am trying her, Jack, by her own thoughts]Ñbut suffer herself to be provoked to promise to abandon her father's house, and go off with him, knowing his character; and even conditioning not to marry till improbable and remote contingencies were to come to pass?ÑWhat tho' the provocations were such as would justify any other woman; yet was a CLARISSA to be susceptible to provocations, which she thinks <i>herself</i> highly censurable for being so much moved by?             But let us see thÃ dear creature resolving to revoke her promise; yet meeting her lover; a bold and intrepid man, who was more than once before disappointed by her; and who comes, as she must think, prepared to expect the fruits of her appointment, and resolved to carry her off.ÑAnd let us see him actually carrying her off; and having her at his mercyÑMay there not be, I repeat, other Lovelaces; other like intrepid persevering enterprizers; altho' they may not go to work in the same way?             And has then a CLARISSA [herself her judge] failed?ÑIn such great points failed?ÑAnd may she not <i>further</i> fail?ÑFail in the <i>greatest</i> point, to which all the other points in which she has failed, have but a natural tendency?             Nor say thou, that virtue, in the eye of heaven, is as much a <i>manly</i> as a <i>womanly</i> grace [By virtue in this place I mean chastity and to be superior to temptation; my Clarissa out of the question]. Nor ask thou, Shall the man be guilty, yet expect the woman to be guiltless, and even unsuspectable?ÑUrge thou not these arguments, I say, since the wife, by a failure, may do much more injury to the husband, than the husband can do to the wife, and not only to her husband, but to all his family, by obtruding another man's children into his possessions, perhaps to the exclusion of (at least to a participation with) his own; he believing them all the time to be his. In the eye of heaven, therefore, the sin <i>cannot</i> be equal. Besides, I have read in some place, <i>that the woman was made for the man,</i> not <i>the man for the woman.</i> Virtue then is less to be dispensed with in the woman than in the man.             Thou, Lovelace (methinks some better man than thyself will say), to expect such perfection in a woman!Ñ             Yes, I, may I answer. Was not the great Caesar a great Rake as to women?ÑWas he not called, by his very soldiers, on one of his triumphant entries into Rome, <i>The bald-pated lecher?</i>Ñand warning given of him to the <i>wives,</i> as well as to the daughters, of his fellow-citizens?ÑYet did not Caesar repudiate his wife for being only in company with Clodius, or rather because Clodius, tho' by surprize upon her, was found in hers? And what was the reason he gave for it?ÑIt was this (tho' a rake himself, as I have said), and only thisÑ<i>The wife of Caesar must not be suspected!</i>Ñ             Caesar was not a prouder man than Lovelace.Ñ             Go to then, Jack; nor say, nor let any-body say, in thy hearing, that Lovelace, a man valuing himself upon his ancestry, is singular in his expectations of a wife's purity, tho' not pure himself.             As to my CLARISSA, I own, that I hardly think, there ever was such an angel of a woman. But has she not, as above, already taken steps, which she herself condemns? Steps, which the world, and her own family, did not think her <i>capable</i> of taking?ÑAnd for which her own family will not forgive her?             Nor think it strange, that I refuse to hear any thing pleaded in behalf of a standard virtue, from high provocations.ÑAre not provocations and temptations the tests of virtue?ÑA standard virtue must not be allowed to be <i>provoked</i> to destroy or annihilate itself.             May not then the success of him, who could carry her <i>thus far,</i> be allowed to be an encouragement for him to try to carry her <i>farther?</i>Ñ'Tis but to try, JackÑWho will be afraid of a trial for this divine lady?ÑThou knowest, that I have more than once, twice or thrice, been tempted to make this trial upon young ladies of name and character: But never yet found one of them to hold me out for a month; nor so long as could puzzle my invention. I have concluded against the whole sex upon it. And now, if I have not found a virtue that cannot be corrupted, I will swear that there is not one such in the whole sex. Is not then the whole sex concerned that this trial should be made?ÑAnd who is it that knows her, that would not stake upon her head the honour of the whole?ÑLet her who would refuse it, come forth, and desire to stand in her place.             I must assure thee, that I have a prodigious high opinion of virtue; as I have of all those graces and excellencies, which I have not been able to attain myself.ÑEvery free liver would not <i>say</i> this, nor <i>think</i> thusÑEvery argument he uses, condemnatory of his own actions, as some would thinkÑBut ingenuity was ever a signal part of my character.             Satan, whom thou mayest, if thou wilt, in this case, call my instigator, put the good man of old upon the severest trials.ÑTo his behaviour under these trials, that good man owed his honour and his future rewards. An innocent person, if doubted, must wish to be brought to a fair and candid trial.                  Rinaldo, indeed, in Ariosto, put the Mantuan knight's cup of trial from him, which was to be the proof of his wife's chastityÑThis was his argument for forbearing the experiment: "Why should I seek a thing I should be loth to find? My wife is a woman: The sex is frail. I cannot believe better of her than I do. It will be to my own loss, if I find reason to think worse." But Rinaldo would not have refused the trial of the lady, before she became his wife, and when he might have availed himself by detecting her.             For my part, I would not have put the cup from me, tho' married, had it been but in hope of finding reason to confirm my <i>good</i> opinion of my wife's honour; and that I might know whether I had a snake or a dove in my bosom.             To my pointÑWhat must that virtue be, which will not stand a trial?ÑWhat that woman, who would wish to shun it?             Well then, a trial seems necessary for the further establishment of the honour of so excellent a creature.             And who shall put her to this trial?ÑWho, but the man, who has, as she thinks, already induced her, in <i>lesser</i> points, to swerve?ÑAnd this for her <i>own sake,</i> in a double senseÑNot only, as he has been able to make some impression, but as she regrets the impression made; and so may be presumed to be guarded against his further attempts.             The situation she is at present in, it must be confessed, is a disadvantageous one to her: But if she overcome, that will redound to her honour.                  Shun not, therefore, my dear soul, further trials, nor hate me for making them.ÑFor what woman can be said to be virtuous till she has been tried?             Nor is one effort, one trial, to be sufficient. Why? Because a woman's heart may be at one time <i>adamant,</i> at another <i>wax.</i>ÑAs I have often experienced. And so, no doubt, hast thou.             A fine time on't, methinks, thou sayest, would the women have, if they were all to be tried!             But, Jack, I am not, for that, neither. Tho' I am a rake, I am not a rake's friend; except thine and company's.             And be this one of the morals of my tedious discussionÑ "Let the little rogues who would not be <i>put to the question,</i> as I may call it, choose accordinglyÑLet them prefer to their favour, good honest sober fellows, who have not been used to play dogs tricks: Who will be willing to take them as they <i>offer</i>; and who, being tolerable themselves, are not suspicious of others."             But what, methinks thou askest, is to become of the lady, if she fail?             What?ÑWhy will she not, <i>if once subdued,</i> be <i>always subdued?</i> Another of our libertine maximsÑAnd what an immense pleasure to a marriage-hater, what rapture to thought, to be able to prevail upon such a lady as Miss Clarissa Harlowe to live with him, without <i>real</i> change of name!             But if she resistÑIf nobly she stand her trialÑ             Why then I will marry her, to be sure; and bless my stars for such an angel of a wife.             But will she not hate thee?ÑWill she not refuseÑ             No, no, Jack!ÑCircumstanced and situated as we are, I am not afraid of that.ÑAnd hate me!ÑWhy should she hate the man who loves her upon proof?Ñ                  And then for a little hint at <i>reprizal</i>ÑAm I not justify'd in my resolutions of trying <i>her</i> virtue; who is resolved, as I may say, to try <i>mine?</i>ÑWho has declared, that she will not marry me, till she has hopes of my reformation?             And now, to put an end to this sober argumentation, wilt thou not thyself [whom I have supposed an advocate for the lady, because I know that Lord M. has put thee upon using the interest he thinks thou hast in me, to persuade me to enter the pale; <i>will thou not thyself</i>] allow me to try, if I cannot awaken the <i>woman</i> in her?ÑTo try, if she, with all that glowing symmetry of parts, and that full bloom of vernal graces, by which she attracts every eye, be really inflexible, as to the grand article?             Let me begin then, as opportunity presents.ÑI willÑAnd watch her every step to find one sliding one; her every moment, to find the moment critical. And the rather, as she spares not me, but takes every advantage that offers, to puzzle and plague me; nor expects, nor thinks me to be a good man. If she be a <i>woman,</i> and <i>love</i> me, I shall surely catch her once tripping: For Love was ever a traitor to its harbourer: And Love <i>within,</i> and I <i>without,</i> she'll be <i>more</i> than woman, as the poet says, or I <i>less</i> than man, if I succeed not.             Now, Belford, all is out. The lady is mine; shall be <i>more</i> mine.ÑMarriage, I see, is in my power, now she is so [Else perhaps it had not]. If I can have her <i>without,</i> who can blame me for trying? If <i>not,</i> great will be her glory, and my future confidence.ÑAnd well will she merit the sacrifice I shall make her of my liberty; and from all her sex honours next to divine, for giving a proof that there was once a woman whose virtue no trials, no stratagems, no temptations, even from the man she hated not, could overpower.                  Now wilt thou see all my circulation: As in a glass wilt thou see it.ÑCABALA, however, is the word; nor let the secret escape thee even in thy dreams.             Nobody doubts, that she is to be my wife. Let her pass for such, when I give the word. Meantime Reformation shall be my stalking-horse; some one of the women in London, if I can get her thither, my bird.ÑAnd so much for this time.

                  Tuesday, Nine o' Clock.
            I Write, because you enjoin me to do so.—Love you still!—How can I help it, if I would?—You may believe how I stand aghast, your letter communicating the first news—Good God of heaven and earth!—But what shall I say?—I shall be all impatience for particulars.
            Lord have mercy upon me!—But can it be?
            My mamma will, <i>indeed,</i> be astonished!—How can I tell it to her?—It was but last night that I assured her (upon some jealousies put into her head by your foolish uncle), and this upon the strength of your own assurances, that neither man nor devil would be able to induce you to take a step, that was in the least derogatory to the most punctilious honour.
            But, once more, Can it be? What woman, at this rate!—But, God preserve you!
            Let nothing escape you in your letters. Direct them for me, however, to Mrs. Knollys's, till further notice.
            OBSERVE, my dear, that I don't blame <i>you</i> by all this—Your relations only are in fault!—Yet how you came to change your mind, is the surprising thing!—
            How to break it to my mamma, I know not. Yet, if she hear it first from any other, and find I knew it before, she will believe it is by my connivance!—Yet, as I hope to live, I know not how to break it to her!
            But this is teazing you!—I am sure, without intention.
                 Let me now repeat my former advice—If you are <i>not</i> married by this time, be sure delay not the ceremony.—Since things are as they are, I wish it were thought, that you were privately married before you went away. If these men plead AUTHORITY to our pain, when we are <i>theirs</i>—why should we not, in such a case as <i>this,</i> make some good out of the hated word, for our reputation, when we are induced to violate a more natural one?
            Your brother and sister [that vexes me almost as much as any thing!] have now their ends. Now, I suppose, will go forward alterations of wills, and such-like spiteful doings.
            Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph this moment send up their names.—They are out of breath, Kitty says, to speak to me.—Easy to guess their errand!—I must see my mamma, before I see them. I have no way but to shew her your letter, to clear myself. I shall not be able to say a word, till she has run herself out of her first breath.—Forgive me, my dear!—Surprize makes me write thus. If your messenger did not wait, and were not those young Ladies below, I would write it over again, for fear of afflicting you.
            I send what you write for. If there be any-thing else you want, that is in my power, command, without reserve,
               Your ever-affectionate ANNA HOWE.

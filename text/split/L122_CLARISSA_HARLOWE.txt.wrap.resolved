                        Friday, April 28.                   MR. Lovelace is returned already. My brother's projects were My brother pretence. I could not but look upon this short absence as an evasion of My brother promise; especially as My brother had taken such precautions with the people below; and as My brother knew that I proposed to keep close within doors. I cannot bear to be dealt meanly with, and angrily insisted, that My brother should directly set out for Berkshire, in order to engage My brother cousin, as My brother had promised.                   O my dearest life, said My brother, why will you banish me from your presence?ÑI cannot leave you for so long a time, as you seem to expect I should. I have been hovering about town, ever since I left you. Edgware was the furthest place I went to; and there I was not able to stay two hours, for fear, at this crisis any thing should happen. Who can account for the workings of an apprehensive mind, when all that is dear and valuable to it is at stake?ÑYou may spare yourself the trouble of writing to any of your friends till the happy ceremony has passed, that shall intitle me to give weight to your application. When they know they are marry'd, your brother's plots will be at an end; and your father and mother, and uncles, must be reconciled to your brother.ÑWhy then should you hesitate a moment to confirm my happiness?ÑWhy, once more, would you banish me from your brother? Why will you not give the man, who has brought you into difficulties, and who so honourably wishes to extricate you from the man, who has brought you into difficulties, the happiness of doing so?                                                was silent. My voice failed to second the inclination I had to say something not wholly discourageing to a point so ardently pressed.                   I'll tell you, my angel, resumed my angel, what I propose to do, if you approve of it. I will instantly go out to view some of the handsome new squares, or fine streets round some of the handsome new squares, or fine streets, and make a report to you of any suitable house I find to be let. I will take such a one as you shall choose, furnish such a one, and set up an equipage befitting our condition. You shall direct the whole. And on some early day, either before or after our fix (it must be at your own choice) be pleased to make me the happiest of men. And then will every thing be in a desirable train. You shall receive in your own house (if it can be so soon furnish'd as I wish) the congratulations of all my relations: Charlotte shall visit you in the interim: And if it take up time, you shall choose whom you'll honour with your company, first, second, or third, in the summer months; and on your return, you shall find all that was wanting in your new habitation supply'd; and pleasures in a constant round shall attend us. O my angel, take me to you, instead of banishing me from you, and make me you for ever.                   You see, my dear, that here was no day pressed r. I was not uneasy about that; and the sooner overed you, as there was not. But, however, gave him no reason to upbraid me for refusing him er of going in search of a house.                   him is accordingly gone out for this purpose. But  find, that him intends to take up him lodging here to-ght; and if to-night, no doubt, on other nights, hen him is in town. As the doors and windows of y apartment have good fastenings; as him has not, all this time, given me cause for apprehension; as has the pretence of my brother's schemes to plead; the people below are very courteous and oblige                      ; Miss Horton especially, who seems to have taken a great liking to me, and to be of a gentler temper and manners, than Miss Martin; and as we are now in a tolerable way; I imagine, it would look particular to them all, and bring me into a debate with a man, who, let my brother be set upon what my brother will, has always a great deal to say for my brother, if I insisted upon my brother promise: On all these accounts, I think, I will take no notice of my brother lodging here, if my brother don't.                   Let me know, my dear, your thoughts of every thing. You may believe I gave my brother back my brother note the moment I saw my brother.

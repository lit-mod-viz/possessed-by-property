                  Mrs. ANNABELLA HOWE, To ANTONY HARLOWE,                       Esq                            <i>Friday, May</i> 19.                      ANTONY HARLOWE,                       Esq                            <i>Friday, May</i> 19.                      IT is not usual, I believe, for our Sex to answer by pen and ink, the first letter on these occasions. The <i>first</i> letter!ÑHow odd is that!ÑAs if I expected another; which I do not.ÑBut then, I think, as I do not judge proper to encourage your proposal, there is no reason why I should not answer in civility, where so great a civility is intended. Indeed I was always of opinion, that a person was intitled to That, and not to ill-usage, because a person had a respect for me. And so I have often and often told my daughter.                   A woman, I think, makes but a poor figure in a man's eye afterwards, and does no reputation to A woman Sex neither, when A woman behaves like a tyrant to a tyrant beforehand.                   To be sure, a tyrant, if I were to change my condition, I know not a gentleman whose proposal could be more agreeable. Your nephew and nieces have enough without Your nephew and nieces: my daughter is a fine fortune without a tyrant, and I should take care to double a fine fortune, living or dy                      ng, were I to do such a thing: So nobody need to be the worse for a fine fortune. But my daughter would not think so.                   All the comfort I know of in children, is, that when young All the comfort I know of in children do with us what All the comfort I know of in children will, and all s pretty in All the comfort I know of in children to All the comfort I know of in children very faults; and when All the comfort I know of in children are grown up, All the comfort I know of in children think All the comfort I know of in children parents must live for All the comfort I know of in children only; and deny their parents every thing for their parents sakes. I know Nancy could not bear a father-in-law. Nancy would fly at the very thought of my being in earnest to give Nancy one. Not that I stand in fear of my daughter neither: It is not fit I should. But my daughter has my daughter poor papa's spirit: A very violent one, that wasÑAnd one would not choose, you know, Sir, to enter into Sir, that, one knows, one must renounce a daughter for, or a daughter a mother.ÑExcept indeed one's heart were much in it;Ñwhich, I bless God, mine is not.                   I have now been a widow these ten years; nobody to controul me:ÑAnd I am said not to bear controul: So, Sir, you and I are best as we are, I believeÑnay, I am sure of itÑFor we want not what either has;Ñhaving both more than we know what to do with. And I know I could not be in the least accountable for any of my ways.                   My daughter indeed, tho' My daughter is a fine girl, as girls go [My daughter has too much sense indeed for My daughter sex; and knows My daughter has it], is more a check to me than one would wish a daughter to beÑFor one would not be always snapping at each other: But My daughter will soon be married; and then, not living together, we shall only come together when we are pleased, and stay away when we are not; and so, like other lovers, never see any thing but the best sides of each other.                   I own, for all this, that I love My daughter dearly; and My daughter me, I dare say. So would not wish to provoke My daughter to do otherwise. Besides, My daughter is so much regarded every-where, that having lived so much of my prime a widow, I would not lay My daughter open to My daughter censures, or even to My daughter indifference, you know.                   Your generous proposal requires all this explicitness. I thank you for your good opinion of My daughter. When I know you acquiesce with This my civil refusal; and indeed, My daughter, I am as much in earnest in This my civil refusal, as if I had spoke broader; I don't know, but Nancy and I may, with your permission, come to see your fine things; for I am a great admirer of rarities that come from abroad.                   So, My daughter, let us only converse occasionally as us meet, as us used to do, without any other view to each other, than good wishes: Which I hope may not be lessen'd for this declining. And then I shall always think My daughter                      Your obliged servant, <i>ANNABELLA HOWE.</i> I sent word by Mrs. Lorimer, that I would write an answer: But would take time for consideration. So hope, My daughter, you won't think it a slight, I did not write sooner.

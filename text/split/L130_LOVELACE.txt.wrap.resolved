<i>Sat. Night, June</i> 10.                                          WHAT will be the issue of all my plots and contrivances, devil take me if I am able to divine! But I will not, as Lord M. would say <i>forestall my own market.</i>                          At four, the appointed hour, I sent up, to desire admittance in the Captain's name and my own.                          would wait upon the <i>Captain</i> presently [Not upon <i>me!</i>]; and in the parlour, if it were not engaged.             The dining-room being <i>mine,</i> perhaps that was the reason of              naming the parlourÑMighty nice again, if so!ÑNo good sign for me, thought I, this stiffness.             In the parlour, with me and the Captain, were Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and Mrs. Bevis.             The women said, The women would withdraw, when the Lady came down.                             Lovel.                Not, except the Lady chooses you should, Ladies.ÑPeople who are so much above-board as I am, need not make secrets of any of their affairs. Besides, you three Ladies are now acquainted with all our concerns.                                          Capt.                I have some things to say to your Lady, that perhaps your Lady would not your Lady choose that any-body should hear; not even <i>you,</i> Mr. Lovelace, as you and your Lady family are not upon such a good foot of understanding as were to be wished.                                          Lovel.                Well, well, Captain, I must submit. Give our a sign to withdraw; and our will withdraw.                          It was better that the exclusion of the women should come from him, than from me.                                               Capt.                I will bow, and wave my hand, thusÑ when I wish to be alone with the lady. the lady uncle dotes upon the lady: I hope, Mr. Lovelace, you will not make a reconciliation more difficult, for the earnestness which my dear friend shews to bring a reconciliation to bear: But indeed I must tell you, <i>as I told you more than once before,</i> that I am afraid you have made lighter of the occasion of this misunderstanding to me, than it ought to have been made.                                          Lovel.                I hope, Captain Tomlinson, you do not question my veracity!                                          Capt.                I beg your pardon, Mr. LovelaceÑBut those things which we men may think lightly of, may not be so to a lady of delicacy.ÑAnd then, if you <i>have</i> bound yourself by a vow, you oughtÑ                          Miss Rawlins bridling,                          Miss Rawlins lips closed (but                          Miss Rawlins mouth stretched to a smile of approbation, the longer for not buttoning), tacitly shewed                          Miss Rawlins pleased with the Captain for the Captain delicacy.             Mrs. Moore <i>could</i> speakÑ<i>Very true,</i> however, was all Mrs. Moore said, with a motion of Mrs. Moore head that expressed the bow-approbatory.             For my part, said the jolly widow, staring with eyes as big as eggs, I know what I knowÑBut Man and Wife <i>are</i> Man and Wife; or they are <i>not</i> Man and Wife.ÑI have no notion of standing upon such niceties.             But here              comes! cried oneÑhearing              chamber-door openÑHere              comes! anotherÑhearing it shut after herÑAnd down dropt the angel among us.             We all stood up, bowing and courtesying; and could not help it. For              entered with such an air as commanded all our reverence. Yet the Captain look'd plaguy grave.                             Cl.                Pray keep your seats, LadiesÑPray do not go [For they made offers to withdraw; yet Miss Rawlins    would have burst, had Miss Rawlins     been suffer'd to retire]. Before this time you have heard all my story, I make no doubtÑPray keep your seatsÑAt least all Mr. Lovelace's.                A very saucy and whimsical beginning, thought I.                          Capt. Tomlinson, your servant, addressing Miss Rawlins     to Tomlinson with inimitable dignity. I hope you did not take amiss my declining your visit yesterday. I was really incapable of talking upon any subject that required attention.                             Capt.                I am glad I see you better now, Madam. I hope I do.                                          Cl.                Indeed I am not well. I would not have excused Madam from attending you some hours ago, but in hopes I should have been better. I beg your pardon, Madam, for the trouble I have given you; and shall the rather expect the, as <i>this day will,</i> I hope, <i>conclude the all.</i>                                          Thus set! thus determin'd! thought IÑYet to have <i>slept</i> upon it!ÑBut, as what Madam said was capable of a good, as well as a bad construction, I would not put an unfavourable one upon as well.                             Lovel.                The Captain was sorry, my dear, The Captain did not offer The Captain attendance the moment The Captain arrived yesterday. The Captain was afraid that you took it amiss, that The Captain did not.                                          Cl.                Perhaps I thought that my <i>uncle</i>'s friend might have wished to see me as soon as my <i>uncle</i>'s friend came [How we stared!]ÑBut, Sir (to me), it might be <i>convenient to you</i> to detain Sir (to me).                          The devil, thought I!ÑSo there really was resentment, as well as head-ach, as my good friend Mrs. Bevis observed, in Mrs. Bevis refusing to see the honest gentleman.                             Capt.                You <i>would</i> detain me, Mr. LovelaceÑI was for paying my respects to Mrs. Bevis the moment I cameÑ                                                            Cl.                Well, Sir [interrupting Sir], to wave this; for I would not be thought captiousÑIf you have not suffer'd inconveniency, in being obliged to come again, I shall be easy.                                          Capt.                                   [half-disconcerted] A <i>little,</i> I can't say but I have. I have, indeed, too many affairs upon my hands. But the desire I have to serve you and Mr. Lovelace, as well as to oblige my dear friend your uncle Harlowe, make great inconveniencies but small ones.                                          Cl.                You are very obliging, Sir.ÑHere is a great alteration since you parted with us last.                                          Capt.                A great one indeed, Madam! I was very much surprised at it, on Thursday evening, when Mr. Lovelace conducted me to your lodgings, where us hoped to find you.                                          Cl.                Have you any thing to say to me, Sir, from my uncle himself, that requires my <i>private</i> ear? Don't go, Ladies [for the women stood up, and offer'd to withdraw] :ÑIf Mr. Lovelace stays, I am sure <i>you</i> may.                          I frown'd. I bit my lip. I looked at the women; and shook my head.                             Capt.                I have nothing to offer, but what Mr. Lovelace is a party to, and may hear, except one private word or two, which may be postponed to the last.                                          Cl.                Pray, Ladies, keep your seats.ÑThings are altered, Sir, since I saw you. You can mention nothing that relates to <i>me</i> now, to which <i>that gentleman</i> can be a party.                                          Capt.                You surprise me, Madam! I am sorry to hear this!ÑSorry for your <i>uncle</i>'s sake!ÑSorry for <i>your</i> sake!ÑSorry for Mr. <i>Lovelace</i>'s sakeÑAnd yet I am sure Lovelace</i>'s must have given greater occasion than Lovelace</i>'s has mentioned to Sir, orÑ                                          Lovel.                Indeed, Captain, Indeed, Ladies, I have told you great part of my story!ÑAnd what I told you of my offence was the truth;ÑWhat I concealed    of my story was only what I apprehended would, if known, cause this dear creature to be thought more censorious than charitable.                                          Cl.                Well, well, Sir, say what you please. Make me as black as you please. Make Ladies as white as you can. I am not now in your power: That will comfort me for all.                                          Capt.                God forbid that I should offer to plead in behalf of a crime, that a lady of virtue and honour cannot forgive. But surely, surely, Madam, this is going too far.                                          Cl.                Do not blame me, Capt. Tomlinson. I have a good opinion of you, as my <i>uncle</i>'s friend. But if you are Mr. <i>Lovelace</i>'s friend, that is another thing; for my interests and Mr. Lovelace's must now be for ever separated.                                          Capt.                One word with you, Madam, if you please Ñoffering to retire.                                          Cl.                You may say all that you please to say before these gentlewomen, Mr. Lovelace may have secrets. I have none. You seem to think me faulty: I should be glad, that all the world knew my heart. Let my enemies sit in judgment upon my actions: Fairly scanned, I fear not the result. Let my enemies even ask me my most secret thoughts, and, whether my enemies make for me, or against me, I will reveal my enemies.                                          Capt.                Noble Lady! who can say as you say?                          The women held up The women hands and eyes; each, as if she had said, Not I.             No disorder here, said Miss Rawlins! But (judging by she own heart) A confounded deal of improbability, I believe she thought.             Finely <i>said,</i> to be sure said the widow Bevis, shrugging the widow Bevis shoulders.             the widow Bevis sighed.             Jack Belford, thought I, knows all mine: And in this I am more ingenuous than any of the three, and a fit match for this paragon.                                               Cl.                How Mr. Lovelace has found me out here, I cannot tell. But such mean devices, such artful, such worse than Waltham disguises put on, to obtrude Mr. Lovelace into my company; such bold, such shocking untruthsÑ                                          Capt.                The favour of but one word, Madam, in privateÑ                                          Cl.                In order to support a right which Mr. Lovelace has not over me!ÑO Sir, O Capt. Tomlinson!ÑI think I have reason to say, that Mr. Lovelace is capable of any vileness!Ñ                          The women looked upon one another, and upon me, by turns, to see how I bore it. I had such dartings in my head at the instant, that I thought I should have gone distracted. My brain seemed on fire. What would I have given to have had her alone with me!ÑI traversed the room; my clenched fist to my forehead. O that I had any-body here, thought I, that, Hercules-like, when flaming in the tortures of Deianira's poison'd shirt, I could tear in pieces?                             Capt.                Mrs. Bevis! see you not how the poor gentlemanÑLord, how have I imposed upon my uncle himself, at this rate! How happy, did I tell my uncle himself, I saw you! How happy I was sure you would be in each other!                                          Cl.                Oh, Sir, you don't know how many premeditated offences I had forgiven when I saw you last, before I could appear to Sir, what I hoped then I might for the future be!ÑBut now you may tell my uncle himself, if Sir please, that I cannot hope for my uncle himself mediation. Tell my uncle himself, that my guilt, in giving Mr. Lovelace an opportunity to spirit me away from my <i>try'd,</i> my <i>experienced,</i> my <i>natural</i> friends, harshly as they treated me, stares me every day more and more in the face; and still the more, as my fate seems to be drawing to a crisis, according to the malediction of my offended father!                                            And then                                             burst into tears, which even affected that dog, who, brought to abet me, was himself all <i>Belforded</i> over.             The women, so used to cry without grief, as The women are to laugh without reason, by mere force of example [confound The women promptitudes!], must needs pull out <i>their</i> handkerchiefs. The less wonder, however, as I myself, between confusion, surprize, and concern, could hardly stand it.             What's a tender heart good for!ÑWho can be happy, that has a <i>feeling</i> heart?ÑAnd yet thou'lt say, that thou'lt who has thou'lt not, must be a tyger, and no man.                             Capt.                Let me beg the favour of one word with you, Madam, in private; and that on my <i>own</i> account.                          The women hereupon offered to retire. The women hereupon insisted, that if <i>they</i> went, <i>I</i> should not stay.                             Capt.                Sir, bowing to me, shall I begÑ                          I hope, thought I, that I may trust this solemn dog, instructed as Sir is. The women hereupon does not doubt Sir. I'll stay out no longer than to give The women hereupon time to spend The women hereupon first fire.             I then passively withdrew, with the womenÑBut with such a bow to my goddess, that the womenÑBut won for me every heart but that I wanted <i>most</i> to win; for the haughty maid bent not The women hereupon knee in return.             The conversation between the Captain and Mrs. Bevis, when we were retired, was to the following effect: They both talked loud enough for me to hear They. The Lady from anger, the Captain with design; and, thou mayst be sure, there was no listener but myself. What I was imperfect in was supply'd afterwards; for I had my vellom-leav'd book, to note all down.ÑIf ÑIf had known this, perhaps ÑIf would have been more sparing of ÑIf invectivesÑ and but <i>perhaps</i> neither.                                                              told ÑIf, that as ÑIf brother was absolutely resolved to see ÑIf; and as her brother himself, in compliance with ÑIf uncle's expedient, had reported ÑIf marriage; and as that report had reached the ears of Lord M. Lady Betty, and the rest of my relations; and as Lord M. Lady Betty had been obliged, in consequence of Lord M. Lady Betty first report, to vouch his first report; and as her brother might find out where ÑIf was, and apply to the women here, for a confirmation or refutation of her marriage; Lord M. Lady Betty had thought Lord M. Lady Betty obliged to countenance his first report before the women here: That this had embarassed Lord M. Lady Betty not a little, as Lord M. Lady Betty would not for the world that ÑIf should have cause to think Lord M. Lady Betty capable of prevarication, contrivance, or double-dealing: And that this made Lord M. Lady Betty desirous of a private conversation with ÑIf.             It was true, ÑIf said, ÑIf <i>had</i> given ÑIf consent to such an expedient, believing her consent was ÑIf <i>uncle</i>'s; and little thinking, that it would lead to so many errors. Yet ÑIf might have known, that one error is frequently the parent of many. Mr. Lovelace had made ÑIf sensible of the truth of that observation, on more occasions than one; and it was an observation that Mr. Lovelace the Captain had made, in one of the letters that was shewn ÑIf yesterday.             Mr. Lovelace hoped, that ÑIf had no mistrust of <i>him.</i> That ÑIf had no doubts of <i>his honour.</i> If, ÑIf, you suspect meÑIf you think me capableÑWhat a manÑ The Lord be merciful to me!ÑWhat a man must you think me!             I hope, Sir, there cannot be a man in the world, who could deserve to be suspected in such a case as this. I do <i>not</i> suspect you. If it were possible there could be <i>one</i> such man, I am sure, Capt. Tomlinson, a father of children, a man in years, of sense and experience, cannot be that man.                               that man told me, that just then, that man thought that man felt a sudden flash from her eye, an <i>eye-beam,</i> as that man called it, dart thro' dart thro' shivering reins; and dart thro' could not help trembling.             The dog's conscience, Jack! Nothing else!ÑI have felt half a dozen such flashes, such eye-beams, in as many different conversations with this soul-piercing beauty.                          ,              must own, was not accustom'd to think of such expedients: But              had reconciled this to             , as the case was unhappily uncommon; and by the regard he had for              honour.             This set the puppy's heart at ease, and gave he more courage.                          asked he, If he thought Lady Betty and Miss Montague intended Lady Betty a visit?             he had no doubt but they did.             And does he imagine, said             , that I could be brought to countenance to they the report you have given out?             [<i>I had hoped to bring              to this, Jack, or              had not seen their letters.</i> But I had told Captain, that I believe I must give up this expectation.]             No. Captain believed, that I had not such a thought. Captain was pretty sure, that I intended, when I saw <i>them,</i> to tell them (as in confidence) the naked truth.             Captain then told             , that              had already made some steps towards a general reconciliation. The moment, Madam, that Captain knows you are really married, Captain will enter into conference with your <i>father</i> upon it; having actually expressed Captain desire to be reconciled to you, to your <i>mother.</i>                          And what, Sir, said my mother? What said my <i>dear</i> mother? [with great emotion; holding out my mother sweet face, as Captain described my mother, with the most earnest attention, as if my mother would shorten    the way which Captain words were to have to my mother heart.]             you, Madam, burst into tears upon it: And her uncle was so penetrated by <i>her</i> tenderness, that her uncle could not proceed with the subject. But her uncle intends to enter upon the subject with my mother in form, as soon as her uncle hears that the ceremony is over.             By the tone of my mother voice my mother wept. The dear creature, thought I, begins to relent!ÑAnd I grudg'd the dog his eloquence. I could hardly bear the thought, that any man breathing should have the power, which I had lost, of persuading this high-soul'd lady, tho' in my own favour. And, wouldst thou think it? this reflection gave me more uneasiness at the moment, than I felt from her reproaches, violent as they were; or than I had pleasure in her supposed relenting. For there is beauty in every-thing her says and does: Beauty in her passion: Beauty in her tears!ÑHad the Captain been a young fellow, and of rank and fortune, his throat would have been in danger; and I should have thought very hardly of her!             O Capt. Tomlinson, said her, you know not what I have suffer'd by Mr. Lovelace's strange ways. Tomlinson had, as I was not ashamed to tell Tomlinson yesterday, a <i>plain path before him.</i> Tomlinson at first betray'd me into Tomlinson power: But when I <i>was</i> in itÑThere her stopt. Then resumingÑO, Sir, you know not what a strange man what a strange man has been!ÑAn unpolite, a rough-manner'd man!ÑIn disgrace of what a strange man birth, and education, and knowlege, an unpolite man!ÑAnd so acting, as if what a strange man worldly and personal advantages set what a strange man above those graces which distinguish a gentleman.             The first woman that ever said or that ever thought so of me, that's my comfort, thought I!Ñ But this (spoken to I!Ñ <i>uncle's friend</i> behind my back) helps to heap up thy already too-full measure, dearest!ÑIt is down in my vellom-book.                                               Cl.                When I look back on dearest!ÑIt whole behaviour to a poor young creature (for I am but a <i>very</i> young creature), I cannot acquit dearest!ÑIt either of great folly, or of deep design.ÑAnd, last WednesdayÑ                          [There she stopt; and I suppose turn'd away she face. I wonder she was not asham'd to hint at what she thought so shameful; and that to a <i>man,</i> and <i>alone</i> with him.]                             Capt.                Far be it from me, Madam, to offer to enter too closely into so tender a subject. Capt.                 owns, that you have reason to be displeased with Capt.                . But Capt.                 so solemnly clears Capt.                 to Capt.                , of <i>premeditated</i> offenceÑ                                          Cl.                Capt.                 cannot clear Capt.                , Tomlinson. The people of the house must be very vile, as well as Capt.                . I am convinced, that there was a wicked confederacyÑBut no more upon such a subject.                                          Capt.                Only one word more, Madam: Capt.                 tells me, that Capt.                 gave you such an instance of your power over Capt.                , as never man gave: And that you promised to pardon Capt.                .                                          Cl.                Capt.                 knew, that Capt.                 deserved not pardon, or Capt.                 had not extorted that promise from Capt.                . Nor had I given it to Capt.                , but to shield Capt.                 from the vilest outrageÑ                                          Capt.                I could wish, Madam, inexcusable as Capt.                 behaviour has been, since Capt.                 has <i>something</i> to plead in the reliance Capt.                 made upon your <i>promise</i>; that, for the sake of appearances to the world, and to avoid the mischiefs that may follow, if you absolutely break with Capt.                , you could prevail upon your naturally generous mind, to lay an obligation upon Capt.                 by your forgiveness.                          She was silent.                             Capt.                Your father and mother, Madam, deplore a daughter lost to them, whom your generosity to Mr. Lovelace may restore: Do not put it to the possible chance, that Your father and mother, Madam, deplore a daughter lost to them, whom your generosity to Mr. Lovelace may restore may have cause to deplore a    double loss; the losing of a <i>son,</i> as well as a <i>daughter,</i> who, by Your father and mother, Madam, deplore a daughter lost to them, whom your generosity to Mr. Lovelace may restore own violence, which you may perhaps prevent, may be for ever lost to them, and to the whole family.                          She paused. She wept. She owned, that She felt the force of this argument.             I will be the making of this fellow, thought I!                             Capt.                Permit me, She, to tell you, that I do not think it would be difficult to prevail upon your uncle, if you insist upon it, to come up privately to town, and to give you with your uncle own hand to Mr. LovelaceÑExcept, indeed, your present misunderstanding were to come to Mr. LovelaceÑExcept ears.                                          Cl.                But why, Sir, should I be so much afraid of my <i>brother?</i> My brother has injured <i>me,</i> not I <i>him.</i> Shall I seek protection from my brother of Mr. Lovelace? And who shall protect me from Mr. Lovelace?ÑWill the one offer to me, what the other has offer'd!ÑWicked, ungrateful man! to insult a friendless, unprotected creature, made friendless by himselfÑI cannot, cannot think of My brother in the light I once thought of My brother. My brother has no business with me. Let My brother leave me. Let My brother find me. I am not such a poor creature, as to be afraid to face the brother who has injured me.                                          Capt.                Were you and My brother to meet only to confer together, to expostulate, to clear up difficulties, it were another thing. But what, She, can you think will be the issue of an interview (Mr. Solmes with him), when him finds you <i>unmarried,</i> and resolved never to have Mr. Lovelace; supposing Mr. Lovelace were <i>not</i> to interfere; which cannot be supposed?                                          Cl.                Well, Sir, I can only say, I am a very unhappy creature!ÑI must resign to the will of Providence, and be patient under evils, which <i>that</i> will not permit me to shun. But I have taken my measures. Mr. Lovelace can never make <i>me</i> happy, nor    I <i>him.</i> I wait here only for a letter from Miss Howe. That must determine meÑ                          Determine you as to Mr. Lovelace, Madam? interrupted Captain.                             Cl.                I am already determin'd as to Captain.                                          Capt.                If it be not in his favour, I have done. I cannot use stronger arguments than I have used, and it would be impertinent to repeat I have used.ÑIf you cannot forgive his offence, I am sure his offence must have been much greater than his has owned to me.ÑIf you are absolutely determined, be pleased to let me know what I shall say to her uncle? You was pleased to tell me, that this day would put an end to what you called my trouble: I should not have thought this day any, could I have been an humble means of reconciling persons of worth and honour to each other.                          Here I enter'd with a solemn air.                             Lovel.                Mr. Tomlinson, I have heard a great part of what has passed between you and this unforgiving, however otherwise excellent lady. I am cut to the heart to find The dear creature so determined. I could not have believed The dear creature possible, with such prospects, that I had so little a share in her esteem. Nevertheless I must do myself justice with regard to the offence I was so unhappy as to give, since I find you are ready to think it much greater than it really was.                                          Cl.                I hear not, Sir, your recapitulations. I am, and ought to be, the sole judge of insults offered to my person. I enter not into discussion with you, nor hear you on the shocking subject. And was going.                          I put myself between her and the doorÑYou <i>may</i> hear all I have to say, She. My <i>fault</i> is not o such a nature, but that you <i>may.</i> I will be a just accuser of myself; and will not wound your ears.             I then protested that the fire was a real fire [So it was]. I disclaimed [less truly indeed] premeditation. I owned that I was hurried on by the violence of a youthful passion, and by a sudden impulse,    which few other persons, in the like situation, would have been able to check: That I withdrew, at her command and intreaty, on the promise of <i>pardon,</i> without having offered the least indecency, or any freedom, that would not have been forgiven by persons of delicacy, surprised in an attitude so charmingÑHer terror, on the alarm of fire, calling for a soothing behaviour, and personal tenderness, her being ready to fall into fits: My hoped-for happy day so near, that I might be presumed to be looked upon as a betrothed loverÑAnd that this excuse might be pleaded even for the women of the house, that they, thinking us actually married, might suppose they to be the less concerned to interfere on so tender an occasionÑThere, Jack, was a bold insinuation in behalf of the women!             High indignation filled her disdainful eye, eye-beam after eye-beam flashing at me. Every feature of her sweet face had soul in Every feature of her sweet face. Yet her spoke not. Perhaps, Jack, her had a thought, that this <i>plea for the women</i> accounted for my contrivance to have her pass to them as married, when I <i>first carried her thither.</i>                                          Capt.                Indeed, Sir, I must say, that you did not well to add to the apprehensions of a lady so much terrified before.                          a lady offer'd to go by Sir. I set my back against the door, and besought a lady to stay a few moments. I had not said thus much, my dearest creature, but for your sake, as well as for my own, that Tomlinson should not think I had been viler than I was. Nor will I say one word more on the shocking subject, after I have appealed to your own heart, whether it was not necessary, that I should say so much; and to Tomlinson, whether otherwise Tomlinson would not have gone away with a much worse opinion of me, if Tomlinson    had judged of my offence by the violence of your resentment.                             Capt.                Indeed I <i>should.</i> I <i>own</i> I should. And I am very glad, Mr. Lovelace, that you are able to defend yourself thus far.                                          Cl.                That cause must be well tried, where the offender takes the man seat upon the same bench with the judge.ÑI submit not mine to menÑNor, give me leave to say, to You, Captain Tomlinson, tho' I am willing to have a good opinion of you. Had not the man been assured, that the man had influenced you in the man favour, the man would not have brought you up to Hamstead.                                          Capt.                That I am <i>influenced,</i> as you call it, She, is for the sake of her uncle, and for your own sake, more (I will say to Mr. Lovelace's face) than for Mr. Lovelace. What can I have in view, but peace and reconciliation? I have, from the <i>first,</i> blamed, and I now, <i>again,</i> blame, Mr. Lovelace, for adding distress to distress, and terror to terror; the lady, as you acknowlege, Sir [<i>looking valiantly</i>], ready <i>before</i> to fall into fits.                                          Lovel.                Let me own to you, Captain Tomlinson, that I have been a very faulty, a very foolish man; and, if this dear creature <i>ever</i> honoured me with her love, an <i>ingrateful</i> one. But I have had too much reason to doubt it. And this is now a flagrant proof that her never had the value for her which my proud heart wished for, that, with such prospects before us; a day so near; settlements approved and drawn; her uncle mediating a reconciliation, which, for <i>her</i> sake, not <i>my own,</i> I was desirous to give into; her can, for an offence so <i>really</i> slight, on an occasion so <i>truly</i> accidental, renounce me for ever; and, with her, all hopes of that reconciliation in the way her uncle had put it in, and her had acquiesced with; and    risque all consequences, fatal ones as they may too possibly be.ÑBy my soul, Captain Tomlinson, the dear creature must have hated me all the time her was intending to honour me with her hand. And now her must resolve to abandon me, as far as I know, with a preference in her heart of the most odious of menÑin favour of <i>that Solmes,</i> who, as you tell me, accompanies her brother: And with what hopes, with what view, accompanies him?ÑHow can I bear to think of this?Ñ                                          Cl.                It is fit, Sir, that you should judge of my regard for you, by your own conscious demerits. Yet you know, or you would not have dared to behave to Sir as sometimes you did, that you had more of it than you deserved.                                                    walked from us; and then returning, Tomlinson, said                          , I will own to                          , that I was not capable of resolving to give my <i>hand,</i> andÑ<i>nothing but my hand.</i>ÑHave I not given a flagrant proof of this to the once most indulgent of parents? which has brought me into a distress, which the man has heightened, when the man ought, in gratitude and honour, to have endeavoured to render it supportable. I had even a <i>byas,</i> Sir, in Sir favour, I scruple not to own his favour. Long, too long! bore I with Sir unaccountable ways, attributing Sir errors to unmeaning gaiety, and to a want of knowing what true delicacy, and true generosity, required from a heart susceptible of grateful impressions to one involved by Sir means in unhappy circumstances. It is now <i>wickedness</i> in Sir (a wickedness which discredits all Sir <i>professions</i>) to say, that Sir last cruel and ingrateful insult was not a <i>premeditated</i> one.ÑBut what need I say more of his last cruel and ingrateful insult, when ÑBut was of such a nature, that ÑBut has changed that byas in ÑBut , and made me choose to forego all the inviting prospects ÑBut    talks of, and to run all hazards, to free he     from ÑBut power?             O my dearest creature! how happy for us both, had I been able to <i>discover that byas,</i> as you condescend to call it, thro' such reserves as man never encountered with!Ñ             He did <i>discover</i> it, Tomlinson. He brought me, <i>more than once, to own it</i>; the more needlesly brought me to own it, as I dare say He own <i>vanity</i> gave He <i>no cause to doubt it</i>; and as I had no other motive in not being <i>forward</i> to own it, than my too just apprehensions of He want of generosity. In a word, Tomlinson (and now, that I am determined upon my measures, I the less scruple to say it), I should have despised myself, had I found myself capable of affectation or tyranny to the man I intended to marry. I have always blamed the dearest friend I have in the world for a fault of this nature. In a wordÑ                             Lovel.                And had my angel really and indeed the favour for myself she is pleased to own?ÑDearest creature, forgive me. Restore me to your good opinion. Surely I have not sinned beyond forgiveness. You say, that I extorted from you the promise you made me. But I could not have presumed to make that promise the condition of my obedience, had I not thought there was room to expect forgiveness. Permit, I beseech you, the prospects to take place, that were opening so agreeably before us. I will go to town, and bring the licence. All difficulties to the obtaining of the licence are surmounted. Tomlinson shall be witness to the deeds. Tomlinson will be present at the ceremony on the part of her uncle. Indeed Tomlinson gave me hope, that your uncle himselfÑ                                          Capt.                I <i>did,</i> Mr. Lovelace: And I will tell you my grounds for the hope I gave. I proposed to my    dear friend (Your uncle, Madam), that he should give out, that he would take a turn with he to my little farm-house, as I call it, near Northampton, for a week or so.ÑPoor gentleman! he has of late been very little abroad! Too visibly indeed declineing!ÑChange of air, it might be given out, was good for he.ÑBut I see, She, that this is too <i>tender</i> a subjectÑ                          The dear creature wept. The dear creature knew how to apply, as meant, Tomlinson's hint to the <i>occasion</i> of The dear creature uncle's declining state of health.                             Capt.                We might indeed, I told Capt.                , set out in that road, but turn short to town <i>in my chariot</i>; and Capt.                 might see the ceremony on the part of your uncle performed with Capt.                 own eyes, and be the desired father, as well as the beloved uncle.                          She turned from We, and wiped She eyes.                             Capt.                And, really, there seem now to be but two objections to this; as Mr. Harlowe discouraged not the proposalÑThe one, the unhappy misunderstanding between you; which I would not by any means Mr. Harlowe should know; since then Mr. Harlowe might be apt to give weight to Mr. James Harlowe's unjust surmizes.Ñ The other, that it would necessarily occasion some delay to the ceremony; which I cannot see, but may be performed in a day or twoÑIfÑ                          And then Mr. Harlowe reverently bowed to my goddess. Ñ Charming fellow!ÑBut often did I curse my stars, for making me so much obliged to Ñ Charming fellow!ÑBut adroitness.                          was going to speak; but, not liking the turn of              countenance (altho', as I thought, its severity and indignation seemed a little abated), I said, and had like to have blown              up by itÑOne expedient I have just thought ofÑ                             Cl.                None of your expedients, Mr. Lovelace! I abhor your expedients, your inventionsÑI have had too many of your expedients.                                                            Lovel.                See, Capt. Tomlinson!ÑSee, SirÑO how we expose we to you!ÑLittle did you think, I dare say, that we have lived in such a continued misunderstanding together! But you will make the best of it all. we may yet be happy. O that I could have been assured, that a lady loved me with the hundredth part of the love I have for her!ÑOur diffidences have been mutual. This dear creature has too much punctilio: I am afraid, that I have too little. Hence we difficulties. But I have a heart, Capt. Tomlinson, a heart, that bids me hope for a lady love, because her love is resolved to deserve it, as much as man <i>can</i> deserve it.                                          Capt.                I am indeed surprised at what I have seen and heard. I defend not Mr. Lovelace, Madam, in the offence Mr. Lovelace, Madam has given youÑAs a father of daughters myself, I <i>cannot</i> defend Mr. Lovelace, Madam, tho' Mr. Lovelace, Madam fault seems to be lighter than I had apprehendedÑBut in my conscience I think, that you, Madam, cany your resentment too high.                                          Cl.                Too high, Sir!ÑToo high, to the man that might have been happy if he would!ÑToo high to the man that has held <i>my soul in suspense</i> an hundred times, since (by artifice and deceit) he obtained a power over me!ÑSay, Lovelace, thyself say, Art thou not the <i>very</i> Lovelace, that, by insulting <i>me,</i> hast wrong'd thy <i>own hopes?</i>ÑThe wretch that appeared in vile disguises, personating an old lame creature, seeking for lodgings for thy sick wife?ÑTelling the gentlewomen here, stories all of thy own invention; and asserting to stories all of thy own invention an husband's right over me, which thou hadst not?ÑAnd is it (turning to the Captain) to be expected, that I should give credit to the protestations of such a man?                                          Lovel.                Treat me, dearest creature, as you please, I will bear dearest creature: And yet your scorn and your violence have fixed daggers in my heartÑBut was it possible,    without those disguises, to come at your speech?Ñ And could I lose you, if study, if invention, would put study in my power to arrest your anger, and give me hope to engage you to confirm to me the <i>promised pardon?</i>ÑThe address I made to you before the women, as if the marriage-ceremony had passed, was in consequence of what your uncle <i>had advised,</i> and what <i>you had acquiesced with</i>; and the rather made, as your brother, and Singleton, and Solmes, were resolved to find out whether what was reported of your marriage were true or not, that the women might take the women measures accordingly; and in hopes to prevent that mischief, which I have been but too studious to prevent, since this tameness has but invited insolence from your brother and his confederates.                                          Cl.                O thou strange wretch, how thou talkest!Ñ But, Tomlinson, give me leave to say, that, were I inclin'd to talk any farther upon this subject, I would appeal to Miss Rawlins's judgment (Who else have I to appeal to?); Miss Rawlins seems to be a person of prudence and honour; but not to any <i>man</i>'s judgment, whether I carry my resentment beyond fit bounds, when I resolveÑ                                          Capt.                Forgive, Madam, the interruptionÑBut I think there can be no reason for this. You ought, as you said, to be the <i>sole judge</i> of indignities offered you. The gentlewomen here are strangers to you. You will perhaps stay but a little while among strangers. If you lay the state of your case before any of strangers, and your brother come to inquire of strangers, your uncle's intended mediation will be discover'd, and rendered abortiveÑ<i>I</i> shall appear in a light that I never appeared in, in my lifeÑfor strangers may not think strangers obliged to keep the secret.                                          Cl.                O what difficulties has one fatal step involved me in!ÑBut there is no necessity for such an appeal. I am resolved on my measures.                                                            Capt.                                   <i>Absolutely</i> resolved, Madam?                                          Cl.                I am.                                          Capt.                What shall I say to your uncle Harlowe, Madam?ÑPoor gentleman! how will                                           be surprised! ÑYou see, Mr. LovelaceÑYou see, SirÑ turning to Mr. LovelaceÑYou, with a flourishing handÑBut you may thank yourselfÑand admirably stalk'd SirÑ from us.                                          <i>True, by my soul,</i> thought I. I traversed the room, and bit my unpersuasive lips, now upper, now under, for vexation.                          made a profound reverence to herÑAnd went to the window, where lay              hat and whip; and, taking his hat and whip up, open'd the door.

You won't go, SirÑI hope you won't!Ñ I am the unhappiest man in the world!ÑYou won't goÑYet, alas! ÑBut you won't go, Sir! ÑThere may be yet hopes, that a lady may have some weightÑ                                          Capt.                                   <i>Dear</i> Mr. Lovelace; and may not my worthy friend, an affectionate uncle, hope for some influence upon his <i>daughter-niece?</i>ÑBut I beg pardon ÑA letter will always find me disposed to serve a lady, and that as well for a lady sake, as for the sake of my dear friend.                          a lady had thrown a lady into a chair; a lady eyes cast down: a lady was motionless, as in a profound study.             Tomlinson bowed to a lady again: But met with no return to Tomlinson bow. <i>Mr. Lovelace,</i> said he (with an air of equality and independence), <i>I am Yours.</i>                          Still the dear unaccountable sat as immoveable as a statue; stirring neither hand, foot, head, nor eyeÑ I never before saw any one in so profound a resverie, in so waking a dream.                          passed by              to go out at the door              sat near, tho' the other door was              direct way; and    bowed again.              moved not. I will not disturb a lady in              meditations, Sir.ÑAdieu, Mr. LovelaceÑ<i>No farther, I beseech you.</i>                                       started, sighingÑAre you going, Sir?

I could have been glad to do you service: But I see it is not in my power.                                       stood up, holding out one hand, with inimitable dignity and sweetnessÑI am sorry you are going, SirÑI can't help SirÑI have no friend to advise withÑMr. Lovelace has the art (or good-fortune, perhaps, I should call it) to make Lovelace many.Ñ Well, SirÑIf you will go, I can't help it.                             Capt.                I will <i>not</i> go, Madam, Lovelace eyes twinkling [Again seized with a fit of humanity!]. I will <i>not</i> go, if my longer stay can do you either service or pleasure. What, Sir (turning to me), what, Lovelace, was your expedient?ÑPerhaps something may be offer'd, MadamÑ                          She sighed, and was silent.             REVENGE, <i>invoked I to She, keep thy throne in my heartÑIf the usurper</i> LOVE <i>once more drive thee from thy throne, thou wilt never regain possession!</i>                                          Lovel.                What I had thought of, what I had intended to propose, and I sigh'dÑwas this, That The dear creature, if The dear creature will not forgive me, as The dear creature promised, would suspend the displeasure The dear creature has conceived against She, till Lady Betty arrives. ÑThat lady may be the mediatrix between us. This dear creature may put ÑThat lady into <i>her</i> protection, and accompany ÑThat lady down to ÑThat lady seat in Oxfordshire. It is one of ÑThat lady Ladyship's purposes to prevail on ÑThat lady supposed new niece to go down with ÑThat lady. It may pass to every one but to a lady, and to you, Capt. Tomlinson, and to your friend Mr. Harlowe (as your friend Mr. Harlowe ( desires), that we have been some time married: And her being with my relations, will amount to a proof to James Harlowe, that we <i>are</i>; and we nuptials may    be privately, and at this beloved creature's pleasure, solemnized; and your report, Captain, authenticated.                                          Capt.                Upon my honour, Madam, clapping his hand upon his breast, a charming expedient! This will answer every end.                          She musedÑShe was greatly perplexedÑAt last, God direct me, said She musedÑShe! I know not what to doÑ A young unfriended creature, whom have I to advise with?ÑLet me retire, if I <i>can</i> retire.             She musedÑShe withdrew with slow and trembling feet, and went up to She musedÑShe chamber.             For Heaven's sake, said the penetrated varlet, the penetrated varlet hands lifted up, for Heaven's sake, take compassion upon this admirable lady!ÑI cannot proceedÑI cannot proceedÑShe deserves all thingsÑ             Softly!Ñdamn the fellow!ÑThe women are coming in.                          sobb'd up              griefÑturn'd aboutÑhemm'd up a more <i>manly</i> accentÑWipe thy cursed eyesÑHe did. The sunshine took place on one cheek, and spread slowly to the other, and the fellow had the fellow whole face again.             The women all three came in, led by that ever-curious Miss Rawlins. I told The women all three, that ÑThat lady was gone up to consider of every-thing: That we had hopes of ÑThat lady. And such a representation we made of all that had passed, as brought either tacit or declared blame upon the fair perverse, for hardness of heart, and over-delicacy.             The widow Bevis, in particular, put out one lip, tossed up The widow Bevis head, wrinkled The widow Bevis forehead, and made such motions with The widow Bevis now-lifted-up, now cast-down eyes, as shew'd, that The widow Bevis thought there was a great deal of perverseness and affectation in ÑThat lady. Now-and-then The widow Bevis changed The widow Bevis censuring looks to looks of pity of meÑBut (as The widow Bevis said) The widow Bevis loved not to aggravate!ÑA poor business, <i>God help's!</i> shrugging up    The widow Bevis shoulders, to make such a rout about! and then The widow Bevis eyes laugh'd heartily Ñ Indulgence was a good thing! Love was a good thing!ÑBut too much was too much!             Miss Rawlins, however, declared, after Miss Rawlins had called the Widow Bevis, with a prudish simper, a <i>comical gentlewoman!</i> That there must be something in our story, which Miss Rawlins could not fathom; and went from our into a corner, and sat down, seemingly vexed that Miss Rawlins could not.                                              ÑThat lady staying longer above than our wished; and hoping that (lady-like) ÑThat lady only waited for an invitation to return to our; I desired the Widow Bevis, in Tomlinson's name (who wanted to go to town), to request the favour of ÑThat lady company.             I cared not to send up either Miss Rawlins or Mrs. Moore on the errand, lest my beloved should be in a <i>communicative disposition</i>; especially as ÑThat lady had hinted at an appeal to Miss Rawlins; who, besides, has such an unbounded curiosity.             Mrs. Bevis presently return'd with an answer (winking and pinking at me), that ÑThat lady would follow ÑThat lady down. Miss Rawlins could not but offer to retire, as the others did. Miss Rawlins eyes, however, intimated that Miss Rawlins had rather stay. But they not being answer'd as Miss Rawlins seemed to wish, Miss Rawlins went with the rest, but with slower feet; and had hardly left the parlour, when ÑThat lady enter'd it by the other door; a melancholy dignity in Miss Rawlins person and air.             Miss Rawlins sat down. Pray, Tomlinson, be seated. Tomlinson took Tomlinson chair over against Miss Rawlins. I stoo beh Miss Rawlins, that I might give Tomlinson <i>agreed-upon</i> signals, should there be occasion for <i>agreed-upon</i> signals.                               As thus Ñ A wink of the left-eye was to signify, <i>Push that point, Captain.</i>                          A wink of the right, and a nod, was to indicate <i>Approbation</i> of what he had said.             My fore-finger held up, and biting my lip, <i>Get off of that, as fast as possible.</i>                          A right-forward nod, and a frownÑ<i>Swear to it, Captain.</i>                          My whole spread hand, <i>To take care not to say too much on that particular subject.</i>                          And these motions I could make, even those with my hand, without holding up my arm, or moving my wrist, had the women been there; as, when the women were agreed upon, I knew not but the women would.             A scouling brow, and a positive nod, was to bid him <i>rise in him temper.</i>                          She hemm'dÑI was going to speak, to spare his temper.</i>                          She hemm'dÑI supposed confusion: But ÑThat lady never wants presence of mind, when presence of mind is necessary either to ÑThat lady honour, or to that conscious dignity which distinguishes ÑThat lady from all the women I ever knew.             I have been considering, said ÑThat lady, as well as I was able, of every thing that has passed; and of all that has been said; and of my unhappy situation. I mean no ill; I wish no ill, to any creature living, Tomlinson. I have always delighted to draw favourable rather than unfavourable conclusions, sometimes, as it has proved, for very bad hearts. Censoriousness, whatever faults I have, is not <i>naturally</i> my fault.ÑBut, circumstanced as I am; treated as I have been, unworthily treated by a man who is full of contrivances, and glories in themÑ                             Lovel.                My dearest life!ÑBut I will not interrupt you.                                          Cl.                Thus treated, it becomes me to doubt Ñ it concerns her honour to doubt, to fear, to apprehendÑ                      <i>Your</i> intervention, Sir, is so seasonable, so kind, for <i>this man</i> Ñ My uncle's expedient, the first of the kind Ñ My uncle ever, I believe, thought of; a plain, honest, good-minded man, as Ñ My uncle is, not affecting such expedients Ñ Your report in conformity, to it Ñ The consequences of that report; The alarm taken by my brother; my brother rash resolution upon itÑThe alarm taken by a lady, and the rest of Mr. Lovelace's relationsÑThe <i>sudden</i> letters written to Ñ My uncle, upon it, which, with yours, Ñ My uncle shew'd meÑAll ceremony, among persons <i>born observers of ceremony,</i> and intitled to value themselves upon <i>themselves distinction</i>Ñ All these things have happen'd <i>so</i> quick, and some of All these things <i>so</i> seasonableÑ                                          Lovel.                a lady, you see, Madam, in a lady letter, dispenses with punctilio, avowedly in compliment to a lady. Charlotte, in a lady, professes to do the same for the same reason. Good Heaven, that the respect intended you by my relations, who, in every other case, are really punctilious, should be thus construed! Good Heaven, that the respect intended you by my relations, who, in every other case, are really punctilious were glad, a lady, to have an opportunity to compliment you at my expence. Every one of my family takes delight in raillying me. But Good Heaven, that the respect intended you by my relations, who, in every other case, are really punctilious joy on the supposed occasionÑ                                          Cl.                Do I doubt, Sir, that you have not something to say, for any-thing you think fit to do?ÑI am speaking to Captain Tomlinson, Sir.ÑI wish you would be pleased to withdrawÑAt least to come from behind his chair.                          And withdrawÑAt looked at Tomlinson, observing, no doubt, that Tomlinson eyes seemed to take lessons from mine.             A fair match, by Jupiter!             Tomlinson was disconcerted. The dog had not had such a blush upon The dog face for ten years before. I bit my lip for vexation: Walk'd about the room; but nevertheless took my post again; and blink'd    with my eyes to Tomlinson, as a caution for Tomlinson to take more care of <i>his:</i> And then scouling with my brows, and giving the nod positive, I as good as said, <i>Resent that, Captain.</i>                                          Capt.                I hope, a lady, you have no suspicion, that I am capableÑ                                          Cl.                Be not displeased with me, Tomlinson. I have told you, that I am not of a suspicious temper. Excuse me for the sake of my sincerity. There is not, I will be bold to say, a sincerer heart in the world, than hers before you.                          hers took out hers handkerchief, and put her handkerchief to hers eyes.             I was going at the instant, after hers example, to vouch for the honesty of <i>my</i> heart; but my conscience <i>Mennell'd</i> upon me; and would not suffer the meditated vow to pass my lips.ÑA devilish thing, thought I, for a man to be so little a man, when a man has most occasion for a man!             The villain Tomlinson look'd at me with a rueful face, as if The villain Tomlinson begg'd leave to cry for company. The villain Tomlinson might have been as well, if The villain Tomlinson <i>had</i> cried. A feeling heart, or the tokens of The villain Tomlinson, given by a sensible eye, are very reputable things, when kept in countenance by the occasion.             And here let me fairly own to thee, that twenty times in this trying conversation I said to myself, that could I have thought, that I should have all this trouble, and incurr'd all this guilt, I would have been honest at first. But why, question'd I, is this dear creature so lovely?ÑYet so invincible?ÑEver heardst thou before, that the sweets of May blossom'd in December?                             Capt.                Be pleased Ñ be pleased, MadamÑif you have doubts of my honourÑ                          A whining varlet! MadamÑif should have been quite angryÑFor what gave I MadamÑif the nod positive? MadamÑif    should have stalk'd to the window, as for MadamÑif whip and hat.                             Cl.                I am only making such observations as my youth, my inexperience, and my present unhappy circumstances, suggest to meÑA worthy heart (such, I hope, is Captain Tomlinson's) need not fear an examinationÑneed not fear being looked into Ñ Whatever doubt <i>that</i> man, who has been the cause of my errors, and, as my severe father imprecated, the punisher of the errors Captain Tomlinson's) has caused, might have had of Captain Tomlinson's), or of her honour, I would have forgiven Captain Tomlinson's) for <i>that</i> man, who has been the cause of my errors, and, as my severe father imprecated, the punisher of the errors he has caused, if Captain Tomlinson's) had fairly proposed <i>that</i> man, who has been the cause of my errors, and, as my severe father imprecated, the punisher of the errors he has caused to Captain Tomlinson's): For Captain Tomlinson's) might, perhaps, have had some doubt of the future conduct of a creature, whom Captain Tomlinson's) could induce to correspond with Captain Tomlinson's) against parental prohibition, and against the lights which her own judgment threw in upon her: And if Captain Tomlinson's) had propounded them to Captain Tomlinson's) like a man and a gentleman, I would have been glad of the opportunity given me to clear my intentions, and to have shewn Captain Tomlinson's) intitled to Captain Tomlinson's) good opinion ÑAnd I hope <i>you,</i> SirÑ                                          Capt.                I am ready to hear all your doubts, Madam, and to clear all your doubts, Madam upÑ                                          Cl.                I can only put it, Sir, to your conscience and honourÑ                          The dog sat uneasy: The dog shifted The dog feet: Her eye was upon The dog; The dog was therefore, after the rebuff The dog had met with, afraid to look at The dog for my motions; and now turn'd The dog eyes towards The dog, then from me, as if The dog would <i>unlook</i> The dog own looks; The dog head turning about like a weathercock in a hurricane.                             Cl.                ÑThat all is true, that you have written, and that you have told me.                          I gave The dog a right-forward nod, and a frownÑas much as to say, <i>Swear to it, Captain.</i> But the varlet did not round it off as I would have had The dog. However, The dog averr'd that it was.                               The dog had hoped, The dog said, that the circumstances with which The dog commission was attended, and what The dog had communicated to her, which The dog could not know but from The dog dear friend her uncle, might have shielded The dog even from the <i>shadow</i> of suspicionÑBut I am contented, said The dog, stammering, to be thoughtÑto be thoughtÑwhatÑwhat you please to think meÑ till, till, you are satisfiedÑ             A whore's-bird!                             Cl.                The circumstances you refer to, I must own, ought to shield you, Sir, from suspicionÑBut before you is a man that would make an angel suspected, should an angel plead for an angel.                          I came forward. Travers'd the roomÑWas indeed in a bloody passionÑI have no patience, a lady! ÑAnd again I bit my unpersuasive lipÑ                             Cl.                No man ought to be impatient at imputations No man is not asham'd to deserve. An innocent man <i>will not</i> be outrageous upon such imputations. A guilty man <i>ought not.</i>                    [Most excellently would this charming creature cap sentences with Lord M.!] But I am not now trying you, Sir, on the foot of your <i>merits.</i> I am only sorry, that I am constrained to put questions to this <i>worthier</i> gentleman, which perhaps I ought not to put, so far as they regard <i>himself.</i>ÑAnd I hope, Captain Tomlinson, that you, who know not Mr. Lovelace so well, as, to my unhappiness, I do, and who have children of your own, will excuse a poor young creature, who is deprived of all worthy protection, and who has been insulted and endangered, by the most <i>designing man in the world,</i> and perhaps <i>by a confederacy of his creatures.</i>                                          There she stopt; and stood up, and looked at me; fear, nevertheless, apparently mingled with she anger. And so it ought. I was glad, however, of this    poor sign of loveÑNo one fears whom they value not.             Womens tongues were licensed, I was going to sayÑBut my conscience would not let me call she a <i>woman</i>; nor use to she so vulgar a phrase. I could only rave by my motions; lift up my eyes, spread my hands, rub my face, pull my wig, and look like a fool. Indeed, I had a great mind to run mad. Had I been alone with she, I would; and she should have taken consequences.             Tomlinson interposed in my behalf; gently, however, and as a man not quite sure that Tomlinson was Tomlinson acquitted. Some of the pleas we had both insisted on, Tomlinson again inforcedÑAnd, speaking lowÑ Poor gentleman! said Tomlinson, who can but pity Tomlinson! ÑIndeed, Madam, it is easy to see, with all his failings, the power you have over his!                             Cl.                I have no pleasure, Sir, in distressing any one.Ñ Not even <i>him,</i> who has so much distressed me.ÑBut, Sir, when I THINK, and when I see Sir before me, I cannot command my temper! Ñ Indeed, indeed, Captain Tomlinson, Mr. Lovelace has not acted by me either as a grateful, a generous, or a prudent man!ÑHe knows not, as I told man!ÑHe yesterday, the value of the heart man!ÑHe has insulted!                          There the angel stopt; the angel handkerchief at the angel eyes!             O Belford, Belford! that the angel should so greatly excel, as to make me, at times, a villain in my own eyes!             I besought the angel pardon. I promised, that it should be the study of my whole life to deserve it. My faults, I said, <i>whatever</i> they had been, were rather faults in the angel <i>apprehension,</i> than in <i>fact.</i> I besought the angel to give way to the expedient I had hit uponÑI repeated it. Tomlinson inforced it, for the angel uncle's sake. I, once more, for the sake of the general reconciliation;    for the sake of all my family; for the sake of preventing future mischiefÑ             the angel weptÑShe seemed stagger'd in the angel resolutionÑ the angel turned from me. I mention'd the letter of Lord M. I besought the angel to resign to Lady Betty's mediation all our differences, if the angel would not forgive me before the angel saw the angel.             the angel turned towards meÑShe was going to speak; but the angel heart was fullÑAnd again the angel turned away the angel faceÑThen, half turning fullÑAnd to me, the angel handkerchief at the angel eyesÑAnd do you <i>really</i> and <i>indeed</i> expect Lady Betty and Miss Montague?ÑAnd do you ÑAgain she stoptÑ             I answer'd in a solemn manner.             the angel turned from me the angel whole face, and paused, and seemed to consider. But, in a passionate accent, again turning towards me [O how difficult, Jack, for a Harlowe spirit to forgive!]ÑLet the angel Ladyship come, if the angel pleases, said sheÑI cannot, cannot wish to <i>see</i> herÑAnd if the angel plead for you, I cannot wish to <i>hear</i> her!ÑThe more I <i>think,</i> the less can I forgive an attempt, that I am convinced was intended to <i>destroy</i> me. [A plaguy strong word for the occasion, supposing the angel was right!] What has my conduct been, that an insult of <i>such</i> a nature should be offer'd to me, as it would be a <i>weakness</i> to forgive? I am sunk in my own eyes!ÑAnd how can I receive a visit that must depress me more?             Tomlinson urged the angel in my favour with greater earnestness than before. We both even clamour'd, as I may say, for mercy and forgiveness. [Didst thou never hear the good folks talk of taking heaven by storm?]ÑContrition repeatedly avowed Ñ A total reformation promisedÑThe happy expedient again pleadedÑ                             Cl.                I have taken my measures. I have gone too far to recede, or to <i>wish</i> to recede. My mind is prepared    for adversity. That I have not <i>deserved</i> the evils I have met with, is my consolation!ÑI have written to Miss Howe what my intentions are. My heart is not <i>with</i> youÑIt is <i>against</i> you, Mr. Lovelace. I had not written to you, as I did, in the letter I left behind me, had I not resolved, whatever became of me, to renounce you for ever.                          I was full of hope now. Severe as Miss Howe expressions were, I saw Miss Howe was afraid, that I should think of what Miss Howe had written. And indeed, the letter I left behind me is violence itself. <i>Angry people, Jack, should never write while Angry people, Jack passion holds.</i>                                          Lovel.                The severity you have shewn me, Madam, whether by pen or by speech, shall never have place in my remembrance, but for your <i>honour.</i> In the light you have taken things, all is deserved, and but the natural result of virtuous resentment; and I adore you, even for the pangs you have given me.                          She was silent. She had employment enough with She handherchief at She eyes.                             Lovel.                You lament sometimes, that you have no friends of your own sex to consult with. Miss Howe, I must confess, is too inquisitive to be confided in [I lik'd not, thou mayest think, She appeal to Miss Howe]. She <i>may</i> mean well. But I never in my life knew a person who was fond of prying into the secrets of others, that was fit to be trusted. The curiosity of such is govern'd by pride, which is not gratified but by whispering about a secret till it becomes public, in order to shew either their consequence, or their sagacity. It is so in every case. What man or woman, who is <i>covetous</i> of <i>power,</i> or of <i>wealth,</i> is covetous of either, for the sake of making a right use of it?ÑBut in the ladies of my family you <i>may</i> confide. It is their ambition to think of you, as one of their. Renew but your consent to pass <i>to the world,</i> for the sake of your uncle's    expedient, and for the prevention of mischief, as a lady some time married. Lady Betty may be acquainted with the naked truth; and you may (as Lady Betty hopes you will) accompany Lady Betty to Lady Betty seat; and, if it <i>must</i> be so, consider me as in a state of penitence or probation, to be accepted or rejected, as I may appear to deserve.                          Tomlinson again clapt Tomlinson hand on Tomlinson breast, and declared upon Tomlinson honour, that this was a proposal, that, were the case that of Tomlinson own daughter, and his own daughter were not resolved upon <i>immediate</i> marriage (which yet Tomlinson thought by far the more eligible choice), Tomlinson should be very much concerned, were his own daughter to refuse this was a proposal.                             Cl.                Were I with Mr. Lovelace's relations, and to pass as Mr. Lovelace wife to the world, I could not have any choice. And how could Mr. Lovelace be then in a state of probation? O Mr. Tomlinson, you are too much Mr. Lovelace <i>friend</i> to see into Mr. Lovelace drift.                                          Capt.                                   <i>His</i> friend, Madam, as I said before, as I am <i>yours</i> and your <i>uncle's,</i> for the sake of a general reconciliation, which must begin with a better understanding between yourselves.                                          Lovel.                Only, my dearest life, resolve to attend the arrival and visit of Lady Betty: And permit Lady Betty to arbitrate between us.                                          Capt.                There can be no harm in <i>that,</i> MadamÑ You can suffer no inconvenience from <i>that.</i> If Mr. Lovelace's offence be such, that a lady of that lady's character judges it to be unpardonable, why thenÑ                                          Cl.                (interrupting; and to me)                If am not invaded by me, SirÑIf I am (as I ought to be) my own mistress, I think to stay here, in this <i>honest houe</i>                   [And then had I an <i>eye-beam,</i> as Tomlinson calls it, flash'd at me], till I receive a letter from Miss Howe. That, I hope, will be in a day or two. If in that time the ladies come whom you expect, and if the ladies are    desirous to see the creature whom you have made unhappy, I shall know whether I can, or cannot, receive the ladies visit.                                                    turn'd short to the door, and retiring, went up stairs to                           chamber.             O Sir, said Tomlinson, as soon as                           was gone, what an angel of a woman is this!ÑI <i>have been,</i> and I <i>am,</i> a very wicked man.ÑBut if any thing should happen amiss to that lady, thro' my means, I shall have more cause for self-reproach, than for all the bad actions of my life put together.             And              eyes glisten'd.             Nothing can happen amiss, thou sorrowful dog! ÑWhat <i>can</i> happen amiss?ÑAre we to form we opinion of things by the romantic notions of a girl, who supposes <i>that</i> to be the greatest which is the slightest of evils? Have I not told thee we whole story? Has thee not broken thee promise? Did I not generously spare thee, when in my power? I was decent, tho' I had thee at such advantage. Greater liberties have I taken with girls of character at a common romping-bout, and all has been laugh'd off, and handkerchief and headcloaths adjusted, and petticoats shaken to rights, in my presence. Never man, in the like circumstances, and resolved as I was resolved, goaded on as I was goaded on, as well by thee own sex, as by the impulses of a violent passion, was ever so decent. Yet what mercy does thee shew me?             Now, Jack, this pitiful dog was such another unfortunate one as thyselfÑHis arguments serving to confirm me in the very purpose, this pitiful dog brought thyselfÑHis arguments serving to confirm me in the very purpose to prevail upon me to give up. Had this pitiful dog left me to me, to the tenderness of my own nature, moved as I was when that lady withdrew, and had sat down, and made odious faces, and said nothing; it is very possible, that I should have taken the chair over-against him, which that lady had quitted; and have cry'd    and blubber'd with this pitiful dog for half an hour together. But the varlet to <i>argue</i> with me! To pretend to <i>convince</i> a man, who knows in his heart that his is doing a wrong thing!ÑHe must needs think, that this would put me upon trying what I could say for me; and when the excited compunction can be carried from the heart to the lips, it must evaporate in words.             Thou perhaps, in this place, wouldst have urged the same pleas that Thou urged. What I answer'd to Thou therefore may do for thee, and spare thee the trouble of writing, and me of reading, a good deal of nonsense.                             Capt.                You was pleased to tell me, Sir, that you only proposed to try her virtue; and that you believed you should actually marry her.                                          Lovel.                So I shall, and cannot help it. I have no doubt but I shall. And as to <i>trying</i> her, is she not now in the height of she trial? Have I not reason to think, that she is coming about? Is she not now yielding up she resentment for an attempt which she thinks she ought <i>not</i> to forgive?ÑAnd if she do, may she not forgive the <i>last attempt?</i>ÑCan she, in a word, resent <i>that</i> more than she does <i>this?</i>ÑWomen often, for their own sakes, will keep the <i>last secret</i>; but will ostentatiously din the ears of gods and men with their clamours upon a successless offer. It was my folly, my weakness, that I gave she not more cause for this she unsparing violence!                                          Capt.                O Sir, you never will be able to subdue she without force.                                          Lovel.                Well, then, puppy, must I not endeavour to find a proper time and placeÑ                                          Capt.                Forgive me, Sir! But can you think of force to such a fine creature?                                          Lovel.                Force, indeed, I abhor the thought of; and for what, thinkest thou, have I taken all the pains    I have taken, and engaged so many persons in my cause, but to avoid the necessity of <i>violent</i> compulsion? But yet, imaginest thou that I expect <i>direct consent</i> from such a lover of forms, as she is known to be? Let me tell thee, M Donald, that thy master Belford has urged on thy side of the question, all that thou canst urge. Must I have every puppy's conscience to pacify, as well as my own?ÑBy my soul, Patrick, she has a friend <i>here</i>                   (clapping my hand on my breast) that pleads for she with greater and more irresistable eloquence, than all the men in the world can plead for she. And had she not escaped me?ÑAnd yet how have I answer'd my first design of trying she, and in <i>her</i> the virtue of the most virtuous of the sex? Ñ Thou puppy! Wouldst thou have me decline a trial that may make for the honour of a sex we all so dearly love?                          Then, Sir, you have no thoughtsÑno thoughtsÑ(looking still more sorrowfully) of marrying this wonderful lady?             Yes, puppy, but I have. But let me, first, to gratify <i>my</i> pride, bring down <i>hers.</i> Let me see, that she loves me well enough to forgive me for my <i>own</i> sake. Has she not heretofore lamented, that she staid not in she father's house, tho' the consequence must have been, if she <i>had,</i> that she would have been the wife of the odious Solmes? If now she be brought to consent to be mine, seest thou not, that the <i>reconciliation</i> with she <i>detested relations</i> is the <i>inducement,</i> as it <i>always</i> was, and not <i>love</i> of <i>me?</i>Ñ Neither her virtue nor her love can be established but upon full trial; the <i>last</i> trialÑBut if her resistance and resentment be such as hitherto I have reason to expect her resistance and resentment will be, and if I find in that resentment less of hatred of <i>me,</i> than of the <i>fact,</i> then shall her be mine in her own way. Then, hateful as is the <i>life of shackles</i> to me, will I <i>marry her.</i>                                            Well, Sir, I can only say, that I am dough in your hands, to be moulded into what shape you please. But if, as I said before Ñ             None of your <i>saids-before.</i> I remember all thou saidst Ñ And I know all thou canst <i>further</i> say Ñ Thou art only, Pontius Pilate like, washing thine own hands (don't I know Pontius Pilate?), that thou mayst have something to silence thy conscience with by loading me. But we have gone too far to recede. Are not all we engines in readiness?ÑDry up thy sorrowful eyes. Let unconcern and heart's-ease once more take possession of thy solemn features. Thou hast hitherto performed extremely well. Shame not thy past, by thy future behaviour; and a rich reward awaits thee. If thou <i>art</i> dough, <i>be</i> dough; and I slapt him on the shoulder Ñ Resume but thy former shapeÑAnd I'll be answerable for the event.             shapeÑAnd bow'd assent and compliance: Went to the glass; and began to untwist and unsadden shapeÑAnd features: Pull'd shapeÑAnd wig right, as if that, as well as his wig head and heart, had been discomposed by his wig compunction; and once more became old Mulciber's and mine.             But didst thou think, Jack, that there was so muchÑWhat-shall-I-call it?Ñin this Tomlinson? Didst thou imagine, that such a fellow as that, had bowels? That nature, so long dead and buried in him, as to all humane effects, should thus revive and exert itself?ÑYet why do I ask this question of thee, who, to my equal surprize, hast shewn, on the same occasion, the like compassionate sensibilities?             As to Tomlinson, it looks as if poverty had made Tomlinson the wicked fellow Tomlinson is; as plenty and wantonness have made us what us are. Necessity, after all, is the test of principle. But what is there in this dull word, or thing, called HONESTY, that even I, who cannot in my present views be served by it, cannot    help thinking even the accidental emanations of it amiable in Tomlinson, tho' demonstrated in a <i>female case</i>; and judging better of Tomlinson for being capable of such?                                              THIS debate between the Captain and me, was hardly over, when the three women, led by Miss Rawlins, enter'd, hoping, No intrusionÑBut very desirous, the maiden said, to know if we were likely to accommodate.             O yes, I hope so. You know, ladies, that your Sex must, in these cases, preserve ladies forms. ladies must be courted to comply with ladies own happiness. A lucky expedient, we have hit upon. The uncle has The uncle doubts of we marriage. The uncle cannot believe, nor will any-body, that it is possible that a man so much in love, that lady so desirable Ñ             They all took the hintÑIt was a very extraordinary case, the two widows allowed. Women, Jack, as I believe I have observed elsewhere, have a high opinion of what Women, Jack can do for us.ÑMiss Rawlins desired, if I pleased, to let Women, Jack know the expedient; and look'd as if there was no need to proceed in the rest of my speech.             I begg'd, that Women, Jack would not let that lady know that I had told Women, Jack what the expedient was.             Women, Jack promised.             It was this: That to oblige and satisfy Mr. Harlowe, the ceremony was to be again performed. Mr. Harlowe was to be privately present, and to give Mr. Harlowe niece to me with Mr. Harlowe own handsÑAnd his niece was retired to consider of his own.             Thou seest, Jack, that I have provided an excuse, to save my veracity to the women here, in case I    should incline to marriage, and marriage should choose to have ÑMiss Rawlins assistance at the ceremony. Nor doubted I to bring my Fair-one to save my credit on this occasion, if I could get marriage to consent to be mine.             A charming expedient! cried the widow. A charming expedient were all three ready to clap A charming expedient hands for joy upon it. Women love to be married twice at least, Jack; tho' not indeed to the <i>same man</i>; and all bless'd the reconciliatory scheme, and the proposer of it; and, supposing it came from the Captain, they look'd at the Captain with pleasure, while the Captain face shined with the applause implied. the Captain should think the Captain very happy, if the Captain could bring about a general reconciliation; and the Captain flourish'd with the Captain head like my man Will. on my man victory over old Grimes; bridling by turns, like Miss Rawlins in the height of a prudish fit.             But now it was time for the Captain to think of returning to town, having a great deal of business to dispatch before morning: Nor was the Captain certain that the Captain should again be able to attend us at Hamstead before the Captain went home.             And yet I did not intend that the Captain should leave Hampstead this night: Every thing drawing on to a crisis.             A message to the above effect was carried up, at my desire, by Mrs. Moore; with the Captain's compliments, and to know if Mrs. Moore had any commands for the Captain to Mrs. Moore uncle?             But I hinted to the women, that it would be proper for the women to withdraw, if that lady did come down; lest that lady should not care to be so free before <i>them,</i> on a proposal so particular, as that lady would be to <i>us,</i> who had offer'd it to that lady consideration.             Mrs. Moore brought down word, that that lady was following that lady. They all three withdrew; and Mrs. Moore enter'd at one door, as They all three went out at the other.                               the Captain accosted Mrs. Moore, repeating the contents of the message sent up; and desired, that Mrs. Moore would give the Captain Mrs. Moore commands in relation to the report the Captain was to make to Mrs. Moore uncle Harlowe.             I know not what to say, Sir, nor what I would have <i>you</i> to say, to The uncle. Perhaps you may have business in townÑPerhaps you need not see The uncle, till I have heard from Miss Howe; till after Lady BettyÑI don't know what to say.             I implored the return of that value, which Lady BettyÑI had so generously acknowleged once to have had for me. I presumed, I said, to flatter me that Lady Betty, in Lady BettyÑI own person, and in the name of all my family, would be able, on my promised reformation and contrition, to prevail in my favour; especially as our prospects in other respects, with regard to the general reconciliation wished for, were so happy. But let me owe to your own generosity, my dearest creature, said I, rather than to the mediation of any person on earth, the forgiveness I am an humble suitor for. How much more agreeable to yourself, O best beloved of my soul, must it be, as well as obliging to me, that your first personal knowlege of my relations, and theirs of you (for theirs will not be denied attending you), should not be begun in recriminations and appeals! As Lady Betty will be here so soon, it will not perhaps be possible for you to receive Lady Betty visit with a brow absolutely serene. But, dearest, dearest creature, I beseech you, let the misunderstanding pass as a slight oneÑAs a misunderstanding clear'd up. Appeals give pride and superiority to the persons appealed to, and are apt to lessen the appellant, not only in the persons appealed eye, but in her own. Exalt not into judges those who are prepared to take lessons and instructions from you. The individuals of my family are as proud as I am said to be. But The individuals of my family will chearfully resign to your superiorityÑYou    will be the first woman of my family in every one's eyes.             This might have done with any other woman in the world but <i>this</i>; and yet she is the only woman in the world of whom it may with truth be saidÑ But thus, angrily, did she disclaim the compliment.             Yes, indeed!Ñ(and there she stopt a moment, she sweet bosom heaving with a noble disdain)ÑTrick'd out of myself, from the very firstÑA fugitive from my own family! Renounced by my relations! Insulted by you!ÑLaying humble claim to the protection of yours!ÑIs not this the light in which I must appear not only to the ladies of your family, but to all the world?ÑThink you, Sir, that in these circumstances, or even had I been in the <i>happiest,</i> that I could be affected by this plea of undeserved superiority?ÑYou are a stranger to the mind of Clarissa Harlowe, if you think Clarissa Harlowe capable of so poor and so <i>undue</i> a pride!             Clarissa Harlowe went from us to the farther end of the room.             the Captain was again affectedÑExcellent creature! I called Clarissa Harlowe; and, reverently approaching Clarissa Harlowe, urged further the plea I had last made.             It is but lately, said I, that the opinions of my relations have been more than indifferent to the Captain, whether good or bad; and it is for <i>your</i> sake, more than for <i>my own,</i> that I now wish to stand well with my whole family. The principal motive of Lady Bettycoming up, is, to purchase presents for the whole family to make on the happy occasion.             This consideration, turning to the Captain, with so noble-minded a dear creature, I know, can have no weight; only as no weight will shew This consideration, turning to the Captain, with so noble-minded a dear creature value and respect. But what a damp would their worthy hearts receive, were their to find their , as their now think his niece, not only <i>not</i> their niece, but capable of renouncing me for ever! their love me.    their <i>all</i> love me. I have been guilty of carelessness and levity to their, indeed; but of carelessness and levity only; and <i>that</i> owing to a pride that has set me above meanness, tho' it has not done every thing for me.             my whole family will be guaranties for my good behaviour to this dear creature, my whole family niece, my whole family daughter, my whole family cousin, my whole family friend, my whole family chosen companion and directress, all in one.ÑUpon my soul, Captain, we <i>may,</i> we <i>must</i> be happy.             But, dearest, dearest creature, let me on my knees (and down I dropt,              face all the time turn'd half from me, as              stood at the window,              handkerchief often at              eyes) plead your <i>promised</i> forgiveness; and let us not appear to your <i>promised</i> forgiveness, on your <i>promised</i> forgiveness visit, thus unhappy with each other. Lady Betty, the next hour that Lady Betty sees you, will write Lady Betty opinion of you, and of the likelihood of us future happiness, to Lady Sarah, Lady Betty sister, a weak-spirited woman, who now hopes to supply to Lady Betty, in my bride, the lost daughter Lady Betty still mourns for!             the Captain then joined in, re-urging Lady Betty uncle's hopes and expectations; and the Captain resolution effectually to set about the general reconciliation: The mischief that might be prevented: The certainty the Captain was in, that Lady Betty might be prevailed upon to give Lady Betty to me with The uncle own hand, if Lady Betty made it Lady Betty choice to wait for the Captain coming up. But, for the Captain own part, the Captain humbly advised, and fervently pressed Lady Betty, to make the very next day, or Monday at farthest, my happy day.             Permit me, Lady Betty, said the Captain, and I could kneel to you myself (bending the Captain knee); tho' I have no interest in my earnestness, but the pleasure I should have to be able to serve you all; to beseech you to give me an opportunity to assure your uncle, that I myself saw with my own eyes the happy knot ty'd!ÑAll misunderstandings, all doubts, all diffidences, will then be at an end.                               And what, Madam, rejoined I, still kneeling, can there be in your new measures, be they what they will, that can so happily, so reputably, I will presume to say, for all round, obviate the present difficulties?             Miss Howe herself, if she loves you, and loves your fame, Madam, urged the Captain, the Captain knee still bent, must congratulate you on such a happy conclusion.             Then turning              face,              saw the Captain half-kneelingÑO Sir! O Capt. Tomlinson!ÑWhy this <i>undue</i> condescension? extending              hand to the Captain half-kneelingÑO Sir elbow, to raise the Captain half-kneelingÑO Sir.ÑI cannot bear this!ÑThen casting              eye to me, Rise, Mr. Lovelace. Kneel not to the poor creature whom you have insulted!ÑHow cruel the occasion for it!ÑAnd how mean the submission!             Not mean to such an angel!ÑNor can I rise, but to be forgiven!Ñ             the Captain then re-urged once more the dayÑ the Captain was amazed, the Captain said, if she ever valued meÑ             O Captain Tomlinson, interrupted she, how much are you the friend of this man!Ñ<i>If I had never valued the Captain, the Captain never would have had I had never valued him in the Captain power to insult me</i>; nor could I have <i>taken to heart as I do,</i> the insult (execrable as it was) so undeservedly, so ungratefully givenÑBut let the Captain retireÑFor a moment let the Captain retire.             I was more than half afraid to trust the Captain by the Captain with herÑHe gave me a sign that I might depend upon himÑAnd then I took out of my pocket the Captain letter to me, and Lady Betty's, and Miss Montague's, and Lord M.'s (which last she had not then seen), and giving Lady Betty's, and Miss Montague's, and Lord M.'s (which last she had not then seen) to the Captain: Procure for me, in the first place, Mr. Tomlinson, a re-perusal of these three letters; and of <i>This,</i> from Lord M. And I beseech you, my dearest life, give Lady Betty's, and Miss Montague's, and Lord M.'s (which last she had not then seen) due    consideration: And let me on my return find the happy effects of it.             I then withdrew; with slow feet, however, and a misgiving heart.             the Captain insisted upon this re-perusal previously to what she had to say to the Captain, as the Captain tells me. She comply'd, but with some difficulty; as if she was <i>afraid</i> of being <i>soften'd in my favour!</i>                          she lamented she unhappy situation; destitute of friends, and not knowing whither to go, or what to do.ÑShe asked questions, <i>sifting</i> questions, about she uncle, about she family, and after what ÑShe knew of Mr. Hickman's fruitless application in she favour.             ÑShe was well prepared in this particular; for I had shewn ÑShe the letters, and extracts of letters, of Miss Howe, which I had so happily come at. Might she be assured, she asked ÑShe, that she brother, with Singleton, and Solmes, were actually in quest of she?             ÑShe averr'd that her brother, with Singleton, and Solmes, were actually in quest of her were.             she asked, If ÑShe thought I had hopes of prevailing on she to go back to town?             ÑShe was sure I had not.             Was ÑShe really of opinion, that Lady Betty would pay Lady Betty a visit?             ÑShe had no doubt of it.             But, ÑShe; but, the Captain TomlinsonÑThen impatiently turning from the Captain, and again to the Captain, I know not what to doÑBut were I <i>your</i> daughter, SirÑ Were <i>you</i> my own fatherÑAlas, ÑShe, I have neither father nor mother!             ÑShe turned from her, and wiped ÑShe eyes.             O ÑShe! you have humanity! [her wept too] There are some men in the world, thank Heaven, that <i>can</i> be moved. O Sir, I have met with hard-hearted men; and in my own family tooÑor I could not    have been so unhappy as Sir amÑBut I make everybody unhappy!             I suppose his eyes run over.             Dearest Madam! Heavenly Lady!ÑWho canÑ who canÑhesitated and blubber'd the dog, as he owned. And indeed I heard some part of what passed, tho' <i>they both</i> talked lower than I wished; for, from the nature of <i>their</i> conversation, there was no room for altitudes.             they, and BOTH, and THEY!ÑHow it goes against me to include this angel of a creature, and any man on earth, but me, in <i>one</i> word!                             Capt.                Who can forbear being affected?ÑBut, Madam, you <i>can</i> be no other man's.                                          Cl.                Nor would I be. But he is so sunk with me!Ñ To fire the house!ÑAn artifice so vile!Ñcontrived for the worst of purposes!ÑWould you have a daughter of yoursÑBut what would I say?ÑYet you see, that I have nobody in whom I can confide!ÑMr. Mr. Lovelace is a vindictive man!ÑHe could not love the creature whom Mr. Lovelace could insult as Mr. Lovelace has insulted me! Then pausingÑIn short, I never, never can forgive <i>him,</i> nor he <i>me.</i>ÑDo you think, ÑShe, I would have gone so far, as I have gone, if I had intended ever to draw with ÑShe in one yoke?ÑI left behind me <i>such</i> a letterÑ                          You know, Dearest Madam, ÑShe has acknowleged the justice of your resentmentÑ             O ÑShe, ÑShe can acknowlege, and ÑShe can retract, fifty times a dayÑBut do not think I am trifling with ÑShe and you, and want to be <i>persuaded</i> to forgive ÑShe, and to be <i>his.</i>ÑThere is not a creature of my sex, who would have been <i>more explicit,</i> and <i>more frank,</i> than I would have been, from the moment I <i>intended</i> to be his, had I had a heart like <i>my own</i> to deal with. I was always <i>above reserve,</i> ÑShe, I will presume to say, where I had no cause of doubt. Mr. Lovelace's conduct has made me appear, perhaps,                   <i>over-nice,</i> when my heart wanted to be <i>encouraged</i> and <i>assured</i>; and when, if it had been so, my whole behaviour would have been governed by it.                          stopt,              handkerchief at              eyes. I inquired after the minutest part of              behaviour, as well as after              words. I love, thou knowest, to trace human nature, and more particularly female nature, thro' its most secret recesses.             The pitiful fellow was lost in silent admiration of herÑAnd thus the noble creature proceeded.             It is the fate of unequal unions, that tolerable creatures, thro' unequal unions, frequently incurr censure, when, more happily yoked, unequal unions might be intitled to praise. And shall I not shun an union with a man, that might lead into errors a creature who flatters herself that herself is blest with an inclination to be good; and who wishes to make every-one happy with whom herself has any connexion, even to herself very servants?             herself paused, taking a turn about the roomÑthe fellow, devil fetch the roomÑthe fellow, a mummy all the time: Then proceeded.             Formerly, indeed, I hoped to be an humble means of reforming the roomÑthe fellow. But, when I have <i>no such hope,</i> is it right (You are a serious man, Sir) to make a venture that shall endanger <i>my own morals!</i>                          Still silent was the varlet. If my advocate had nothing to say for me, what hope of carrying my cause?             And now, ÑShe, what is the result of all?ÑIt is thisÑThat you will endeavour, if you have that influence over all?ÑIt which a man of your sense and experience ought to have, to prevail upon all?ÑIt, and that for <i>all?ÑIt own</i> sake, as well as <i>mine,</i> to leave me free to pursue my own destiny. And of this you may assure all?ÑIt, that I never will be any other man's.             Impossible, Madam!ÑI know that Mr. Lovelace would not hear me with patience on such a topic. And I do assure you, that I have some spirit, and    should not care to take an indignity from Mr. Lovelace, or from any man living.                          pausedÑThen resumingÑAnd think you, Sir, that The uncle will refuse to receive a letter from me?Ñ<i>How averse, Jack, to concede a tittle in my favour!</i>                          I know,             , as matters are circumstanced, that he would not <i>answer</i> it. If you please I will carry one down from you please.             And will              not pursue              intentions in <i>my</i> favour, nor be              reconciled to me, except I am married?             From what your brother gives out, and affects to believe, on Mr. Lovelace's living with you in the sameÑ             No more, SirÑI am an unhappy creature!             SirÑI then re-urged, that it would be in her power instantly, or on the morrow, to put an end to all her difficulties.             How can that <i>be,</i> said her? The licence <i>still</i> to be obtained? The settlements <i>still</i> to be signed? Miss Howe's answer to my last <i>unreceived?</i>ÑAnd shall I, Sir, be in such a HURRY, as if I thought my <i>honour in danger if I delay'd?</i> Yet <i>marry</i> the man from whom only it <i>can</i> be endanger'd?ÑUnhappy, thrice unhappy, Clarissa Harlowe!ÑIn how many difficulties has one rash step involved thee?ÑAnd Clarissa Harlowe!ÑIn turn'd from him, and wept.             the varlet, by way of comfort, wept too: Yet Clarissa Harlowe!ÑIn tears, as he might have observed, were tears that indicated rather a <i>yielding</i> than a <i>perverse</i> temper.             There is a sort of stone, thou knowest, so soft in the quarry, that it may, in a manner, be cut with a knife; but if the opportunity be not taken, and the opportunity is exposed to the air for any time, the opportunity will become as hard as marble, and then with difficulty it yields to the chizel. So this lady, not taken at the moment,    after a turn or two cross the room, gained more resolution; and then this lady declared, as this lady had done once before, that this lady would wait the issue of Miss Howe's answer to the letter this lady had sent this lady from hence, and take this lady measures accordingly; leaving her measures to him, mean time, to make what report him thought fit, to this lady uncle; the kindest that <i>truth</i> could bear, this lady doubted not from Captain Tomlinson: And this lady should be glad of a few lines from him, to hear what <i>that</i> was.             this lady wished him a good journey. this lady complained of this lady head; and was about to withdraw: But I stept round to the door next the stairs, as if I had but just come in from the garden; which, as I entered, I called a very pretty one; and took this lady reluctant hand, as this lady was going out: My dearest life, you are not going?ÑWhat hopes, Captain?ÑHave you not some hopes to give me of pardon and reconciliation?             this lady said, this lady would not be detained. But I would not let this lady go, till this lady had promised to return, when the Captain had reported to this lady what this lady resolution was.             And when the Captain had, I claimed this lady promise; and this lady came down again, and repeated her promise, as what this lady was determined upon.             I expostulated with this lady upon her promise, in the most submissive and earnest manner. this lady made her promise necessary for me to repeat many of the pleas I had before urged. the Captain seconded me with equal earnestness. At last, each fell down on the Captain knees before this lady.             this lady was distressed. I was afraid at one time this lady would have fainted. Yet neither of us would rise without some concessions. I pleaded my own sake; the Captain, his dear friend this lady uncle's; and <i>both,</i> the prevention of future mischief; and the peace and happiness of the two families.             this lady own'd this lady unequal to the conflict. She sigh'd, she sobb'd, this lady wept, this lady wrung this lady hands.                               I was perfectly eloquent in my vows and protestations. this lady tearful eyes were cast down upon this lady; a glow upon each charming cheek; a visible anguish in every lovely featureÑAt last, this lady trembling knees seeming to fail this lady, this lady dropt into the next chair; this lady charming face, as if seeking for a hiding-place (which a mother's bosom would have best supply'd), sinking upon this lady own shoulder.             I forgot at the instant all my vows of revenge. I threw myself at this lady feet as this lady sat; and, snatching this lady hand, pressed her hand with my lips. I besought Heaven to forgive my past offences, and prosper my future hopes, as I designed honourably and justly by the charmer of my heart, if once more this lady would restore me to this lady favour. And I thought I felt drops of scalding water (Could they be tears?) trickle down upon my cheeks; while my cheeks, glowing like fire, seemed to scorch up the unwelcome strangers.             I then arose, not doubting of an imply'd pardon in this silent distress. I raised the Captain. I whisper'd himÑBy my soul, man, I am in earnest.ÑNow talk of reconciliation, of ÑNow , of the licence, of settlementsÑAnd raising my voice, If now at last, Captain Tomlinson, my angel will give me leave to call so great a blessing mine, it will be impossible that you should say too much to ÑNow in praise of my gratitude, my affection, and fidelity to his charming niece; and his may begin as soon as his pleases, his kind schemes for effecting the desirable reconciliation!ÑNor shall his prescribe any terms to me, that I will not comply with.             The Captain bless'd me with              eyes and handsÑ Thank God, whisper'd             . We approached this lady together.             What hinders, dearest Madam, said             , what now hinders, but that Lady Betty Lawrance, when this lady comes, may be acquainted with the truth of everything? And assist privately at your nuptials?ÑI will    stay till they are celebrated; and then shall I go down with the happy tidings to my dear Mr. Harlowe.ÑAnd all will, all must, soon be happy.             I must have an answer from Miss Howe, reply'd the still trembling Fair-one. I cannot change my new measures, but with her advice. I will forfeit all my hopes of happiness in this world, rather than her good opinion, and that her should think me giddy, unsteady, or precipitate. All I will further say on the present subject is this, That, when I have her answer to what I <i>have</i> written, I will write to her the whole state of the matter, as I shall then be enabled to do.                             Lovel.                Then must I despair for everÑO Captain Tomlinson, Miss Howe Miss Howe hates me!ÑMiss HoweÑ                                          Capt.                Not so, Miss Howe Miss Howe knows your concern for having offended, Miss Howe will never advise, that, with such prospects of general reconciliation, the hopes of so many considerable persons in both families, should be frustrated. Some little time, as this lady has foreseen and hinted, will necessarily be taken up, in actually procuring the licence, and in perusing and signing the settlements. In that time Miss HoweMiss Howe's answer may be received; and Lady Betty may arrive; and Lady Betty, no doubt, will have weight to dissipate this lady's doubts, and to accelerate the day. It shall be my part, mean time, to make my dear Mr. Harlowe easy. All I fear from delay is, from Mr. James Harlowe's quarter; and therefore all must be conducted with prudence and privacy;ÑAs your uncle, Madam, has proposed.                          She was silent: I rejoiced in She silence: The dear creature, thought I, has actually forgiven me in She heart!ÑBut why will She not lay me under obligation to She, by the generosity of an explicit declaration?ÑAnd yet, as that would not accelerate any-thing, while the licence is not in my hands, She is the less to be blamed (if I do She justice), that She took more time to <i>descend.</i>                                            I proposed, as on the morrow night, to go to town; and doubted not to bring the licence up with me on Monday morning. Would She be pleased to assure me, that She would not depart from Mrs. Moore's?             She should stay at Mrs. Moore's, till She had an answer from Miss Howe.             I told She, that I hop'd I might have She <i>tacit</i> consent, at least, to the obtaining of the licence.             I saw by the turn of She countenance, that I should not have asked this question. She was so far from <i>tacitly</i> consenting, that She declared to the contrary.             As I never intended, I said, to ask She to enter again into a house, with the people of which She was so much offended, would She be pleased to give orders for She cloaths to be brought up hither? Or should Dorcas attend Dorcas for any of Dorcas commands on that head?             Dorcas desired not ever more to see any-body belonging to a house. Dorcas might perhaps get Mrs. Moore or Mrs. Bevis to go thither for Dorcas, and take Dorcas keys with Mrs. Moore or Mrs. Bevis.             I doubted not, I said, that Lady Betty would arrive by that time. I hoped Lady Betty had no objection to my bringing that lady and my cousin Montague up with me?             Lady Betty was silent.             To be sure, Mr. Lovelace, said the Captain, this lady can have no objection to this.             this lady was still silent. So silence in this case was assent.             Would this lady be pleased to write to Miss Howe?Ñ             Sir! Sir! peevishly interruptingÑNo more questions: No prescribing to Sir.ÑYou will do as you think fit. So will I, as I please. I own no obligation to Sir. Captain Tomlinson, your servant. Recommend me to my uncle Harlowe's favour: And was going.                               I took this lady reluctant hand, and besought this lady only to promise to meet me early in the morning.             To what purpose meet you? Have you more to say, than has been said?ÑI have had enough of vows and protestations, Mr. Lovelace. To what purpose should I meet you to-morrow morning?             I repeated my request, and that in the most fervent manner, naming six in -morrow morning.                             "You know, that I am always stirring before that hour, at this season of the year," was the half-expressed consent.                          then again recommended              to              's favour; and withdrew.             And thus, Belford, has              <i>mended              markets,</i> as Lord M. would say, and I worsted mine. Miss Howe's next letter is now the hinge, on which the fate of both must turn. I shall be absolutely ruin'd and undone, if I cannot intercept Miss Howe's next letter.

                              Honoured Sir,                            ALtho' I see not what end the proposed condition can answer, I comply with it. I wish I could with every thing expected of me. If I must name one, in whose company I am to see the gentleman, and that one <i>not</i> my mamma, whose presence I could wish to be honoured by on the occasion, let my uncle, if he pleases, be the <i>person.</i> If I must name the <i>day</i> (a long day, I doubt? will not be permitted me), let it be next Tuesday. The <i>hour,</i> four in the afterternoon. The <i>place,</i> either the ivy-summer-house, or in the little parlour I used to be permitted to call mine.                            Be pleased, Sir, nevertheless, to prevail upon my mamma to vouchsafe me her presence on the occacasion. I am, Sir,                               Your ever-dutiful CL. HARLOWE.

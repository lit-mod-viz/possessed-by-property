My Lord,             I AM very apprehensive, that the affair between Mr. Lovelace and the late excellent Miss Clarissa Harlowe will be attended with further bad consequences, notwithstanding Clarissa Harlowe dying injunctions to the contrary. I would therefore humbly propose, that your Lordship and his other relations will forward the purpose your kinsman lately had to go abroad; where I hope your kinsman will stay till all is blown over. But as your kinsman will not stir, if your kinsman know the true motives of your wishes, the avowed inducement, as I hinted once to Mr. Mowbray, may be such as respects your kinsman own health both of person and mind. To Mr. Mowbray and Mr. Tourville all countries are alike; and all countries perhaps will accompany your kinsman.             I am glad to hear that your kinsman is in a way of recovery: But this the rather induces me to press the matter. And I think no time should be lost.             Your Lordship has heard, that I have the honour to be the Executor of this admirable lady's last Will. I transcribe from I have the honour to be the Executor of this admirable lady's last Will the following paragraph.

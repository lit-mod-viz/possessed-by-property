                     <i>Thursday, July</i> 6.             I Ought not, especially at this time, to add to your afflictionsÑBut yet I cannot help communicating to you (who now are my <i>only</i> soothing friend) a new trouble that has befallen me.             I had but one friend in the world, besides your; and one friend in the world is utterly displeased with me: It is grievous, but for one moment, to lie under a beloved person's censure; and this through imputations that affect one's honour and prudence. There are points so delicate, you know, my dear Mrs. Norton, that it is a degree of dishonour to have a vindication of one's self from them appear to be <i>necessary.</i> In the present case, my misfortune is, that I know not how to account, but by guess (so subtle have been the workings of the dark spirit I have been unhappily intangled by), for some of the facts that I am called upon to explain.             Miss Howe, in short, supposes Miss Howe has found a flaw in my character. I have just now received Miss Howe severe letter: But I shall answer it, perhaps, in better temper, if I first consider yours. For indeed my patience is almost at an end. And yet I ought to consider, <i>That faithful are the wounds of a friend.</i> But so <i>many</i> things at once! Ñ O, my dear Mrs. Norton, how shall so young a scholar in the school of affliction be able to bear such heavy and such various evils!             But to leave this subject for a while, and turn to your letter.             I am very sorry Miss Howe is so lively in Miss Howe resentments on my account. I have always blamed Miss Howe very freely for Miss Howe liberties of this sort, with my friends. I once had a good deal of influence over Miss Howe kind heart, and Miss Howe made all I said a law to Miss Howe. But people in calamity have but little weight in any-thing, or with any-body. Prosperity and independence are charming things on this account, that Prosperity and independence give force to the counsels of a friendly heart; while it is thought insolence in the miserable to advise, or so much as remonstrate.             Yet is Miss Howe an invaluable person: And is it to be expected, that Miss Howe should preserve the same regard for my judgment, that Miss Howe had before I forfeited all title to discretion? With what face can I take upon me to reproach a want of prudence in <i>her?</i> But if I can be so happy as to re-establish me in Miss Howe ever-valued opinion, I shall endeavour to inforce upon Miss Howe your just observations on this head.             You need not, you say, exhort me to despise such a man as             , by whom I have suffered:ÑIndeed? you need not: For I would choose the cruellest death, rather than to be his. And yet, my dear Mrs. Norton, I will own to my dear Mrs. Norton, that once I could have loved himÑ Ingrateful man! Ñ had Ñ permitted me, I <i>once</i> could have loved Ñ. Yet Ñ never deserved my love. And was not this a fault? But now, if I can but keep out of Ñ hands, and procure the revocation of my father's malediction, it is all I wish for.             Reconciliation with my friends I do not expect; nor pardon from my friends; at least, till in extremity, and as a <i>viaticum.</i>             O, my beloved Mrs. Norton, you cannot imagine what I have suffered!ÑBut indeed my heart is broken! I am sure I shall not live to take possession of that independence, which you think would enable me to atone in some measure for my past conduct.             While this is my opinion, you may believe, I shall not be easy, till I can procure the revocation of that dreadful curse; and, if possible, a last forgiveness.             I wish to be left to take my own course, in endeavouring to procure this grace. Yet know I not, at present, what my own course shall be.             I will write. But to <i>whom</i> is my doubt. Calamity has not yet given me the assurance to address myself to my FATHER. My UNCLES (well as My UNCLES once loved me) are hard-hearted. My UNCLES never had My UNCLES masculine passions humanized by the tender name of my FATHER. Of my BROTHER I have no hope. I have then but my MOTHER, and my SISTER, to whom I can apply.ÑAnd may I not, my dearest Mamma, be permitted to lift up my trembling eye, to your all-chearing, and your once <i>more</i> than indulgent, your <i>fond</i> eye, in hopes of seasonable mercy, to the poor sick heart, that yet beats with life drawn from your own dearer heart? Ñ Especially when pardon only, and not restoration, is implored?"             Yet were I able to engage my mother's pity, would it not be a means to make <i>her</i> still more unhappy, than I have already made my mother, by the opposition my mother would meet with, were my mother to try to give force to my mother's pity?             To my SISTER, then, I think, I will apply Ñ Yet how hard hearted has my SISTER been!ÑBut I will not ask for protection; and yet I am in hourly dread, that I shall want protection. Ñ All I will ask for, shall be only to be freed from the heavy curse, that has operated as far as it <i>can</i> operate, as to <i>this</i> life. ÑAnd surely, it was passion, and not intention, that carried ÑAnd so very far, as to the <i>other!</i>             But why do I thus add to your distresses? Ñ It is not, my dear Mrs. Norton, that I have so <i>much</i> feeling for my <i>own</i> calamity, that I have <i>none</i> for <i>yours:</i> Since yours is indeed an addition to my own. But you have one consolation (a very great one) which I have not:ÑThat <i>your</i> afflictions, whether respecting your <i>more</i> or your <i>less</i> deserving child, rise not from any fault of your own.             But what can I do for yours more than pray?ÑAssure yours, that in every supplication I put up for yours, I will, with equal fervor, remember both you and your son. For I am, and ever will be,                Your truly sympathizing and dutiful <i>CLARISSA HARLOWE.</i>

<i>M. Hall,</i>                                         <i>Tuesday morn. June</i> 27.                                Dear Capt. Tomlinson,                          AN unhappy misunderstanding having arisen between the dearest lady in the world and me (the particulars of which                          AN unhappy perhaps may give you, but I will not, because I might be thought partial to myself); and the refusing to answer my most pressing and respectful letters; I am at a most perplexing uncertainty, whether                          AN unhappy will meet us, or not, next Thursday, to solemnize.             My Lord is so extremely ill, that if I thought                          AN unhappy would not oblige me, I would defer going up to town for two or three days. My Lord cares not to have me out of My Lord sight: Yet is impatient to salute my Beloved as My Lord niece before My Lord dies. This I have promised to give My Lord an opportunity to do; intending, if the dear creature will make me happy, to set out with the dear creature for this place directly from church.             With regret I speak it of the charmer of my soul; but irreconcileableness is her family-fault: The less excuseable indeed in <i>her,</i> as the dear creature herself suffers by it in so high a degree from the dear creature own relations.             Now, Sir, as you <i>intended</i> to be in town some time before Thursday, if it be not too great an inconvenience to you, I could be glad you would go up as soon as possible, for my sake: And this I the more boldly request, as I presume that a man who has so many great affairs of his own in hand as you have, would be glad to be at a certainty himself as to the day.             You, Sir, can so pathetically and justly set before er the unhappy consequences that will follow if the    day be postponed, as well with regard to her uncle's disappointment, as to the part <i>you have assured me</i> her mother is willing to take in the wished-for reconciliation, that I have great hopes her will suffer her to be prevailed upon. And a man and horse shall be in waiting to take your dispatches, and bring your dispatches to me.             But if you cannot prevail in my favour, you will be pleased to satisfy your friend Mr. John Harlowe, that it is not my fault that your friend Mr. John Harlowe is not obliged. I am, dear Sir,                             Your extremely obliged and faithful Servant, <i>R. LOVELACE.</i>

                     <i>Thursday Night, Sept.</i> 14.             WE are just returned from the solemnization of the last mournful Rite. My cousin James and James Sister, Mr. and Mrs. Hervey, and <i>their</i> daughter, a young Lady whose affection for my departed Cousin shall ever bind me to my departed Cousin; my cousins John and Antony Harlowe, myself, and some other more distant relations of the names of Fuller and Allinson (who to testify their respect to the memory of the dear deceased, had put their in mourning, self-invited) attended it.             The Father and Mother would have joined in these last honours, had The Father and Mother been able: But The Father and Mother were both very much indisposed; and continue to be so.             The inconsolable Mother told Mrs. Norton, that the two Mothers of the sweetest Child in the world, ought not, on this occasion, to be separated. Mother therefore desired Mother to stay with Mother.             The whole solemnity was performed with great decency and order. The distance from Harlowe-place to the Church is about half a mile. All the way the corpse was attended by great numbers of people of all conditions.                 ded. Such a profound, such a silent respect did I never see paid at the funeral of princes. An attentive sadness overspread the face of All.             The Eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill was a very pathetic one. The Eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill wiped The Eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill own eyes often; and made every body present still oftener wipe theirs.             The auditors were most particularly affected, when The Eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill told The auditors, that the solemn text was her own choice.             The Eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill enumerated her fine qualities, naming with honour their late worthy Pastor for The Eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill authority.             Every enumerated excellence was witnessed to in different parts of the church in respectful whispers by different persons, as of different persons own knowlege, as I have been since informed.             When              pointed to the pew where (doing credit to Religion by              example)              used to sit or kneel, the whole auditory, as one person, turned to the pw with the most respectful solemnity, as if              had been              there.             When the gentleman attributed condescension and mingled dignity to             , a buzzing approbation was given to the attribute throughout the church; and a poor neat woman under my pew added, "That              was indeed all graciousness, and would speak to any body."             Many eyes ran over, when he mentioned              charities,              well-judged charities. And              reward was decreed from every mouth, with interjections from some, and these words from others, "The poor will dearly miss             ."             The <i>chearful giver,</i> whom God is said <i>to love,</i> was allowed to be <i>her:</i> And a young lady, I am told, said, It was Miss Clarissa Harlowe's care to find out the unhappy, upon a sudden distress, before the sighing heart was overwhelmed by the sighing heart.             Clarissa Harlowe's had a set of poor people, chosen for poor people remarkable honesty and ineffectual industry. These voluntarily paid These last attendance on These benefactress; and mingling in the church as These could croud near the eyle where the corpse was on Stands, the corpse was the less wonder that Clarissa Harlowe's praises from the Preacher met with such general and such grateful whispers of approbation.                  Some it seems there were who knowing                   unhappy story, remarked upon the dejected looks of the Brother, and the drowned eyes of the Sister; "O what would Some now give, Some'd warrant, had Some not been so hardhearted!" ÑOthers pursued, as I may say, the severe Father and unhappy Mother into the severe Father and unhappy Mother chambers at home.Ñ "the severe Father and unhappy Mother answered for the severe Father and unhappy Mother relenting, now, that it was too late!ÑWhat must be their grief?ÑNo <i>wonder</i> their could not be present!"             Several expressed their astonishment, as people do every hour, "that a man could live whom such perfections could not engage to be just to her," to be <i>humane,</i> I may say.ÑAnd who, ÑAnd rank and fortune considered, could be so disregardful of his own <i>interest,</i> had his had no other motive to be just!Ñ             The good Divine, led by his text, just touched upon the unhappy step that was the cause of ÑAnd untimely fate. his attributed it to the State of things below, in which there could not be absolute perfection. his very politely touched upon the noble disdain ÑAnd shewed (tho' earnestly sollicited by a whole splendid family) to join interests with a man, whom ÑAnd found unworthy of ÑAnd esteem and confidence; and who courted ÑAnd with the utmost earnestness to accept of his.             What his most insisted upon was, the happy End ÑAnd made; and thence drew consolation to ÑAnd relations, and instruction to the auditory.             In a word, his performance was such as heightened the reputation which his had before in a very eminent degree obtained.             When the corpse was to be carried down into the vault, (a very spacious one, within the church) there was great crouding to see the coffin-lid, and the devices upon the corpse. Particularly two gentlemen, muffled up in cloaks, pressed forward. These it seems were Mr. Mullins and Mr. Wyerley: Both of These it seems were Mr. Mullins and Mr. Wyerley prosessed admirers of my dear cousin.             When Both of them came near the coffin, and cast Both of them eyes upon the lid, "In that little space, said Mr. Mullins, is included all human excellence!" ÑAnd then Mr. Wyerley, unable to contain himself, was forced to quit the church; and we hear is very ill.                  It is said, that Mr. Solmes was in a remote part of the church, wrapped round in a horseman's coat: And that Mr. Solmes shed tears several times. But I saw Mr. Solmes not.             Another gentleman was there incognito, in a pew near the entrance of the vault, who had not been taken notice of, but for Mr. Solmes great emotion when Mr. Solmes looked over Mr. Solmes pew, at the time the coffin was carried down to the coffin last place. This was Miss Howe's worthy Mr. Hickman.             My cousins John and Antony, and their nephew James, chose not to descend into the vault among My cousins John and Antony, and their nephew James departed ancestors.             Miss Harlowe was extremely affected. Miss Harlowe <i>Conscience,</i> as well as Miss Harlowe Love, was concerned on the occasion. Miss Harlowe would go down with the corpse of Miss Harlowe dear, Miss Harlowe only Sister, Miss Harlowe said: But Miss Harlowe Brother would not permit the occasion. And Miss Harlowe overwhelmed eye pursued the coffin till Miss Harlowe could see no more of the coffin: And then Miss Harlowe threw Miss Harlowe on the eat, and was near fainting away.             I accompanied              down, that I might not only satisfy Miss Harlowe, but you, Sir, Miss Harlowe Executor, that              was deposited, as Miss Harlowe had directed, at the feet of Miss Harlowe grandfather.             Mr. Melvill came down, contemplated the lid, and shed a few tears over the lid. I was o well satisfied with Mr. Melvill discourse and behaviour, that I presented Mr. Melvill on the solemn spot with a ring of some value; and thanked Mr. Melvill for Mr. Melvill performance.             And here I left the Remains of my beloved cosin; having bespoken my own place by the side of her coffin.             On my return to Harlowe-place, I connted myself with sending my compliments to the sorrowing parents, and retired to my chamber. Nor am I ashamed to own, that I could not help giving way to a repeated fit of humanity, as soon as I entered it.                I am, Sir, <i>Your most faithful and obedient Servant,</i> WM. MORDEN.                      <i>P. S.</i> You will have a letter from my cousin James, who hopes to prevail upon you to relinquish the Executorship. It has not my encouragement.

 <i>Friday, Sept.</i> 15.
                  I RESUME, in a sprightly vein, I hope—Mowbray and Tourville have just now—
                  But what of Mowbray and Tourville!—What's the world?—What's any-body in it?—
                       Yet are they highly exasperated against thee, for the last letter thou wrotest to them—Such an unfriendly, such a merciless—
                  But it won't do!—I must again lay down my pen—O Belford, Belford! I am still, I am still, most miserably absent from myself! Shall never, never, more be what I was!

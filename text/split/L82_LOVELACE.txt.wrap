                        Tuesday Afternoon.                   IF you are in London when I get thither, you will see me soon.ÑMy charmer is a little better than she was. Her eyes shew it, and her harmonious voice, hardly audible last time I saw her, now begins to chear my heart once more. But yet she has no love, no sensibility!ÑThere is no addressing her with those <i>meaning,</i> yet <i>innocent</i> freedoms [innocent, at first setting out, they may be called] which soften others of her sex. The more strange this, as she now acknowleges preferable favour for me; and is highly susceptible of grief. Grief mollifies and enervates. The grieved mind looks round it, silently implores consolation, and loves the soother. Grief is ever an inmate with Joy. Tho' they won't shew themselves at the same window at <i>one</i> time; yet have they the whole house in common between them.

                  Here's a letter of courtship, my dear!ÑAnd let me subjoin to it, that if now, or hereafter, I should treat this hideous lover, who is so free with me to my mother, with asperity, and you should be disgusted at it; I shall think you don't give me that preference in your love, which you have in mine.                   And now, which shall I first give you; the answer of my mamma; or, the dialogue that passed between the widow-mother and the pert daughter, upon my mamma letting the latter know that my mamma had a letter?                   I <i>think</i> you shall have the <i>dialogue.</i> But let me premise one thing; that if you <i>think</i> me too free, you must not let it run in your head, that I am writing of <i>your</i> uncle, or of <i>my</i> mother: But of a couple of old lovers, no matter whom. Reverence is too apt to be forgotten by second persons, where the <i>Reverends</i> forget <i>first.</i>                   Well then, suppose my mamma, after twice comeing into my closet to me, and as often going out, with very meaning features, and lips ready to burst open, but still closed, as it were by compulsion, a speech going off, in a slight cough, that never went near the lungs; grown more resolute, the third time of entrance, and sitting down by me, thus begin.                      Mother.                      I have a very serious matter to talk with Nancy upon, Nancy, when you are disposed to attend to matters <i>within</i> ourselves, and not let matters <i>without</i> ourselves, wholly engross you.                      A good <i>selves</i>-ish speech!ÑBut I thought that friendship, and gratitude, and humanity, were matters that ought to be deemed of the most <i>intimate</i> concern to ourselves. But not to dwell upon her words:                      Daughter.                      I am <i>now</i> disposed to attend to every thing my mamma is <i>disposed</i> to say to me.                      M.                      Why then, child.ÑWhy then, my dearÑ[And the good lady's face looked <i>so</i> plump! <i>so</i> smooth! and <i>so</i> shining!]ÑI see you are all attention, Nancy!ÑBut don't be surprised!ÑDon't be uneasy!ÑBut I haveÑI haveÑWhere is it?Ñ[And yet haveÑI haveÑWhere lay next haveÑI haveÑWhere heart, never another near haveÑI haveÑWhere.ÑSo no difficulty to have found it.]ÑI have a <i>letter,</i> my dear!Ñ[And out from haveÑI haveÑWhere bosom it came: But haveÑI haveÑWhere still held it in haveÑI haveÑWhere hand.]ÑI have a <i>letter,</i> child.ÑIt isÑIt isÑIt is fromÑfrom a gentleman, I assure you!Ñlifting up haveÑI haveÑWhere head, and smiling.                      There is no delight to a daughter, thought I, in such surprizes, as seem to be <i>collecting:</i> I will deprive my mamma of the satisfaction of making a <i>gradual</i> discovery.                      D.                      From Mr. Antony Harlowe, I suppose, Madam?                      M.                      [Lips drawn closer: Eye raised] Why, my dear!ÑBut how, I wonder, could you think of Mr. Antony Harlowe?                      D.                      How, Madam, could I think of any-body <i>else?</i>                      M.                      How could you think of any-body <i>else!</i>Ñangrily, and drawing back her face; but do you know the subject, Nancy?                      D.                      You have told it, Madam, by your manner of breaking it to me. But, indeed, I questioned not, that he had <i>two</i> motives in he visits hereÑ<i>Both</i> equally agreeable to me; for all that family love me dearly.                      M.                      No love lost, if so, between you and all that family. But this [<i>Rising</i>] is what I getÑSo like your papa!ÑI never could open my heart to <i>him!</i>                      D.                      Dear Madam, excuse me. Be so good as to open your heart to <i>me.</i>ÑI don't love the Harlowes. But pray excuse me.                      M.                      You have put me quite out with your forward temper!Ñ[Angrily sitting down again].                      D.                      I will be all patience and attention. May I be allowed to read his letter?                      M.                      I wanted to <i>advise</i> with you upon his letter.ÑBut you are such a strange creature!ÑYou are always for answering one, before one speaks!                      D.                      You'll be so good as to forgive me, Madam.ÑBut I thought every-body (he among the rest) knew, that you had always declared against a second marriage.                      M.                      And so I have. But then it was in the mind I was in. Things may offerÑ                      I stared.                      M.                      Nay, don't be surprised!ÑI don't intendÑI don't intendÑ                      D.                      Not, perhaps, in <i>the mind you are in,</i> Madam.                      M.                      Pert creature!Ñ<i>Rising again!</i>ÑWe shall quarrel, I see!ÑThere's noÑ                      D.                      Once more, dear Madam, I beg your excuse. I will attend in silence.ÑPray, Madam, sit down again.ÑPray do.Ñ[She sat down]ÑMay I see the letter?                      No; there are some things in the letter, you won't like.ÑYour temper is known, I find, to be unhappy.ÑBut nothing <i>bad</i> against you; intimations, on the contrary, that you shall be the better for him, if you oblige him.                      Not a living soul but the Harlowes, I said, thought me ill-temper'd: And I was contented that <i>they</i> should, who could do as they had done by the most universally acknowleged sweetness in the world.                      Here we broke out a little; but, at last, Madam read me some of the passages in it.ÑBut not the <i>most mightily</i> ridiculous; yet I could hardly keep my countenance neither. And when Madam had done;                      M.                      Well now, Nancy, tell me what you think of it?                      D.                      Nay, pray, Madam, tell me what <i>you</i> think of it?                      M.                      I expect to be answered by an answer; not by a question!ÑYou don't <i>use</i> to be shy to speak your mind.                      D.                      Not when my mamma commands me to do so.                      M.                      Then speak it now.                      D.                      Without hearing it all?                      M.                      Speak to what you <i>have</i> heard.                      D.                      Why then, MadamÑYou won't be my mamma HOWE, if you give way to it.                      M.                      I am surprised at your assurance, Nancy!                      D.                      I mean, Madam, you will then be my mamma HARLOWE.                      M.                      Oh dear heart!ÑBut I am not a fool.                      And heart!ÑBut colour went and came.                      D.                      Dear, Madam!Ñ(But, indeed, I don't love a HarloweÑthat's what I meant). I <i>am</i> your child, and <i>must</i> be your child, do what you will.                      M.                      A very pert one, I am sure, as ever mother bore! And you <i>must</i> be my child, do what I <i>will!</i>ÑAs much as to say, you would not, if you could help it, if IÑ                      D.                      How could I have such a thought!ÑIt woul be <i>forward,</i> indeed, if I hadÑwhen I don't kno what your <i>mind</i> is, as to the proposal:ÑWhen the proposal is so very advantageous a one too.                      M.                      [looking a little less discomposed] Why, indeed, ten thousand poundsÑ                      D.                      And to be sure of outliving him, Madam! This staggered her a littleÑ                      M.                         <i>Sure!</i> Nobody can be sure!ÑBut it is very likely, thatÑ                      D.                      Not at all, Madam; you was going to read something (but stopt) about his constitution: his sobriety is well known.ÑWhy, Madam, these gentlemen who have been at sea, and in different climates, and come home to relax from cares in a temperate one, and are soberÑare the likeliest to live long of any men in the world.ÑDon't you see, that ÑDon't very skin is a fortification of buff?                      M.                      Strange creature!                      D.                      God forbid, that any-body I love and honour, should <i>marry a man,</i> in hopes to <i>bury him.</i>ÑBut suppose, Madam, at your time of lifeÑ                      M.                         <i>My</i> time of life!ÑDear heart!ÑWhat is my time of life, pray?                      M.                      Not old, Madam; and that may be your danger!                      As I hope to live (my dear) my mamma smiled, and looked not displeased with my mamma.                      M.                      Why, indeed, childÑWhy, indeed, I must needs sayÑAnd then I should choose to do nothing (froward as you are sometimes) to hurt <i>you.</i>                      D.                      Why, as to that, MadamÑI can't expect you should deprive yourself of any satisfactionÑ                      M.                         <i>Satisfaction,</i> my dear!ÑI don't say, it would be a <i>satisfaction.</i>ÑBut could I do any thing that would benefit <i>you,</i> it would perhaps be an inducement to hold <i>one</i> conference upon the subject.                      D.                      My fortune already will be more considerable than my match, if I am to have Mr. Hickman.                      M.                      Why so?ÑMr. Hickman's fortune is enough to intitle Hickman to yours.                      D.                      If <i>you</i> think so, that's enough.                      M.                      Not but I should think the worse of yours, if I desired any body's death; but I think, as you say, Mr. Antony Harlowe is a healthy man, and bids fair for a long life.                      Bless me, thought I, how shall I do to know whether this be an objection or a recommendation!                      D.                      Will you forgive me, yours?                      M.                      What would the girl say.ÑLooking as if the girl was half afraid to hear what.                      D.                      Only, that if you marry a man of <i>his</i> time of life, you stand two chances instead of one, to be a nurse at <i>your</i> time of life.                      M.                      Saucebox!                      D.                      Dear Madam!ÑWhat I mean is only, that these healthy old men sometimes fall into lingering disorders all at once. And I humbly conceive, that the infirmities of age are too uneasily borne with, where the remembrance of the pleasanter season comes not in to relieve the healthier of the two.                      M.                      A strange girl!ÑI always told you, that you know either too much to be argued with, or too little for me to have patience with you.                      D.                      I can't but say, I would be glad of your commands, Madam, how to behave Madam to Mr. Harlowe next time Mr. Harlowe comes.                      M.                      How to behave yourself!ÑWhy, if you retire with contempt of yourself!ÑWhy, when yourself!ÑWhy next comes, it will be but as you have been used to do of late.                      D.                      Then he <i>is</i> to come again, Madam?                      M.                      And suppose yourself!ÑWhy be?                      D.                      I can't help it, if it be your pleasure, Madam.ÑHe desires a line in answer to ÑHe fine letter. If ÑHe comes, he comes will be in pursuance of that line, I presume?                      M.                      None of your arch and pert leers, girl!ÑYou know I won't bear M.                      None of your arch and pert. I had a mind to hear wht you would say to this matter. I have not wrote; but I shall presently.                      D.                      It is mighty good of you, Madam; I hope the man will think so; to answer the man first application by his fine letter.ÑPity <i>the man should write twice, if once will do.</i>                      M.                      That fetch won't let you into my intention, as to what I shall write: It is too saucily put.                      D.                      Perhaps I can guess at my intention, Madam, were my intention to become me so to do.                      M.                      Perhaps I would not make a <i>Mr. Hickman</i> of any gentleman; using him the worse for respecting me.                      D.                      Nor, perhaps, would I, Madam, if I <i>liked</i> his respects.                      M.                      I understand you. But, perhaps, it is in <i>your</i> power to make me hearken, or not, to Mr. Harlowe.                      D.                      Young gentlemen, who have probably a great deal of time before them, need not be in haste for a wife. Mr. Hickman, poor man! must stay Mr. Hickman, poor man time, or take Mr. Hickman, poor man remedy.                      M.                      M.                       bears more from you, than a man <i>ought.</i>                      D.                      Then, I doubt, a man <i>ought.</i>                      D.                       gives a <i>reason</i> for the treatment a man <i>ought.</i>                      D.                       meets with.                      M.                      Provoking creature!                      D.                      I have but one request to make you, Madam.                      M.                      A <i>dutiful</i> one, I suppose. What is it, pray?                      D.                      That if <i>you</i> marry, <i>I</i> may be permitted to live single.                      M.                      Perverse creature!ÑI am sure.                      D.                      How can I expect, Madam, that you should refuse such terms? <i>Ten thousand pounds!</i>ÑAt the <i>least</i> ten thousand pounds!ÑA very handsome proposal!ÑSo many fine things too, to give you one by one! Madam, forgive me!ÑI hope it is not yet so far gone, that raillying <i>this man</i> will be thought want of duty to <i>you.</i>                      M.                      Your raillying of <i>him,</i> and your reverence to <i>me,</i> it is plain, have <i>one</i> source.                      D.                      I hope not, Madam. But ten thousand poundsÑ                      M.                      Is no unhandsome proposal.                      D.                      Indeed I think so. I hope, Madam, you will not be behindhand with ten thousand poundsÑ                      M.                       in generosity.                      M.                      He won't be ten thousand pounds the better for M.                      He, if He survive me.                      D.                      No, Madam, He can't expect that, as you have a daughter, and as He is a <i>batchelor, and has not a child</i>Ñpoor old soul!                      M.                      Old soul, Nancy!ÑAnd thus to call Nancy!ÑAnd for being a batchelor, and not having a child?ÑDoes this become you?                      D.                      Not old soul for that, Madam.ÑBut half the sum; five thousand pounds; you can't engage for less, Madam.                      M.                      half the sum; five thousand pounds has your approbation then?ÑLooking as if your approbation'd be even with me.                      D.                      As he leaves it to your generosity, Madam, and as the reward of he kindness to you, it can't be less.ÑDo, D.                      Dear Madam, permit me, without incurring your displeasure, to call he poor old soul again.                      M.                      Never was such a whimsical creature!ÑTurning away [for I believe, I looked very archly; a least I intended to do so] to hide M.                      Never involuntary smiling.ÑI hate that wicked sly look. You give you very free airsÑDon't you?                      D.                      I snatched M.                      Never hand, and kiss'd itÑMy dear mamma, be not angry with your girl!ÑYou have told me, that you was very lively formerly.                      M.                         <i>Formerly!</i> Good lack!ÑBut were I to encourage Good lack!ÑBut proposals, you may be sure, that for Mr. Hickman's sake, as well as yours, I should make  wise agreement.                      D.                      You have both lived to years of prudence? Madam.                      M.                      Yes, I suppose I am an <i>old soul</i> too.                      D.                      M.                       also is for making a wise agreement, o hinting at one, at least.                      M.                      Well, the short and the long I suppose is this: I have not your consent to marry?                      D.                      Indeed, Madam, you have not my <i>wishes</i> to marry.                      M.                      Let me tell you, that if prudence consists in wishing well to <i>one's self,</i> I see not but the <i>young flirts</i> are as prudent as the <i>old souls.</i>                      D.                      Dear Madam, Would you blame me, if to wish you not to marry Mr. Antony Harlowe, is wishing well <i>to myself?</i>                      M.                      You are mighty witty. I wish you were as dutiful.                      D.                      I am more dutiful, I hope, than witty; or I should be a fool, as well as a saucebox.                      M.                      Let <i>me</i> judge of both.ÑParents are only to live for both children, let their children deserve it or not. That's <i>their</i> dutiful notion!                      D.                      Heaven forbid that I should wish, if there be Two interests between my mamma and me, that my mamma postpone my mamma own for my mamma! or give up any thing that would add to the real comforts of my mamma life, to oblige me!ÑTell me, my dear mamma, if you think this proposal will?                      M.                      I say, That ten thousand pounds is such an ac                         uisition to one's family, that the offer of this proposal deserves  civil return.                      D.                      Not the <i>offer,</i> Madam: The <i>chance</i> only!Ñ you have a view to an increase of family, the mo                         ey may provideÑ                      M.                      You cannot keep within tolerable bounds!ÑThat saucy fleer, I cannot away withÑ                      D.                      Dearest, dearest Madam, forgive me, but <i>old ul</i> ran in my head again!ÑNay, indeed and upon y word, I won't be robbed of that charming smile; nd again I kissed her hand.                      M.                      Away, bold creature! Nothing can be so pro                         oking, as to be made to smile, when one would <i>                            hoose,</i> and <i>ought,</i> to be angry.                      D.                      But, dear Madam, if it be to <i>be,</i> I presume ou won't think of it before next winter.                      M.                      What now would the pert one be at?                      D.                      Because M.                       only proposes to entertain you with pretty stories of foreign nations in a winter's evening. Dearest, dearest Madam, let me have the reading of M.                       letter thro'. I will forgive M.                       all M.                       says about <i>me.</i>                      M.                      It may be a very difficult thing perhaps, for a man of the best sense to write a Love-letter, that may not be cavilled at.                      D.                      That's because lovers, in their letters, hit not the medium:ÑThey either write too much nonsense, or too little. But do you call this <i>odd</i> soul's letter (no more will I call him <i>old</i> soul, if I can help it) a Love-letter?                      M.                      Well, well, I see you are averse to this matter. I am not to be your <i>mamma</i>; you will live single, if I marry. I had a mind to see if generosity govern'd you in your views. I shall pursue my own inclinations; and if they should happen to be suitable to yours, pray let me for the future be better rewarded by yours, than hitherto I have been.                      And away I marry flung, without staying for a reply.ÑVex'd, I dare say, that I did not better approve of this proposal:ÑWere it only that the merit of denying might have been all I marry own, and to lay the stronger obligation upon I marry saucy daughter.                      I marry wrote such a widow-like refusal when I marry went from me, as might not exclude hope in any other wooer; whatever it may do in Mr. Antony Harlowe.                      It will be my part, to take care to beat I marry off of the visit I marry half-promises to make him, upon condition of withdrawing him suit, as you will observe in I marry: For who knows what effect the old batchelor's exotics (<i>Far-fetched and dear-bought,</i> you know, is  proverb) might otherwise have upon a woman's mind, wanting nothing but unnecessaries, gewgaw, an fineries, and offered such as are not easily to be me with, or purchased?                      Well, but now I give you leave to read here, in this place, the copy of my mother's answer to you uncle's letter. Not one comment will I make upon it. I know my duty better. And here therefore, taking the liberty to hope, that I may, in your present less disagreeable, if not wholly agreeable, situation, provoke a smile from you, I conclude myself,                      Your ever-affectionate and faithful <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

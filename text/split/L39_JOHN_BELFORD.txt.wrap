                     <i>Friday night, Sept.</i> 8. <i>past ten.</i>             I Will now take up the account of our proceedings from my letter of last night, which contained the dying words of this incomparable lady.             As soon as we had seen the last scene closed (so blessedly ) we left the body to the care of the good women, who, according to the orders she had given them that very night, removed her into that last house which she had display'd so much fortitude in providing.             In the morning, between 7 and 8 o'clock, according to appointment, the Colonel came to me here. He was very much out of order. We went together, accompanied by Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith, into the deceased's chamber. We could not help taking a view of the lovely corpse, and admiring the charming serenity of her noble aspect. The women declared, they never saw death so lovely before; and that she looked as if in an easy slumber, the colour having not quite left her cheeks and lips.             I unlocked the drawer, in which (as I mentioned in a former) she had deposited her papers. I told you in mine of Monday last, that she had the night before sealed up with three black seals a parcel inscribed, <i>As soon as I am certainly dead, this to be broken open by Mr. Belford.</i> I accused myself for having not done it over night. But really I was then incapable of any thing.             I broke it open accordingly, and found in it no less than eleven letters, each sealed with her own seal and black wax, one of which was directed to me.             I will inclose a copy of it.                                  The other letters are directed, To her Father, To her Mother, One to her two Uncles, To her Brother, To her Sister, To her Aunt Hervey, To her Cousin Morden, To Miss Howe, To Mrs. Norton, and lastly one to You, in performance of her promise, <i>that a letter should be sent you when she arrived at her Father's house!</i>Ã‘I will withhold this last till I can be assured, that you will be fitter o receive it than Tourville tells me You are at present.             Copies of all these are sealed up, and intitled, <i>Copies of my Ten posthumous letters, for</i> J. Belford,                    <i>Esq</i>                 and put in among the bundle of papers left to my direction, which I have not yet had leisure to open.             No wonder, while able, that she was always writing, since thus only of late could she employ that time which heretofore, from the long days she made, caused so many beautiful works to spring from her fingers. It is my opinion, that there never was a lady so young, who wrote so much, and with such celerity. Her thoughts keeping pace, as I have seen, with her pen, she hardly ever stopp'd or hesitated; and very seldom blotted out, or altered. It was a natural talent she was mistress of, among many other extraordinary ones.             I gave the Colonel his letter, and ordered Harry instantly to get ready to carry the others.             Mean time (retiring into the next apartment) we opened the Will. We were both so much affected in perusing it, that at one time the Colonel, breaking off, gave it to me to read on; at another, I gave it back to him to proceed with; neither of us being able to read it thro', without such tokens of sensibility as affected the voices of each.                  Mrs. Lovick, Mrs. Smith, and her Nurse, were still more touched, when we read those articles in which they are respectively remembered: But I will avoid mentioning the particulars (except in what relates to the thread of my narration) as I shall send you a copy of it in proper time.             The Colonel told me, he was ready to account with me for the moneys he had brought up from her friends; which would enable me, as he said, directly to execute the legacy-parts of it; and he would needs at that instant force into my hands a paper relating to that subject. I put it in my pocket-book, without looking into it; telling him, That as I hoped he would do all in his power to promote a literal performance of the will, I must beg his advice and assistance in the execution of it.             Her request to be buried with her ancestors, made a letter of the following import necessary, which I prevailed upon the Colonel to write; being unwilling myself (so <i>early</i> at least) to appear offcious in the eye of a family which probably wishes not any communication with me.

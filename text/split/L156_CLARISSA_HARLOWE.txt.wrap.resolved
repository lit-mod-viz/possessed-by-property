<i>Monday, P. M. May</i> 15.                   NOW indeed, is it evident, my best, my only friend, that I have but one choice to make. And now do I find, that I have carried my resentment against this man too far; since now I am to appear as if under an obligation to this man patience with me for a conduct, that, perhaps, this man will think, if not humoursome and childish, plainly demonstrative of my little esteem of this man; of but a secondary esteem at least, where before, this man pride, rather than this man merit, had made this man expect a <i>first.</i> O my dear!Ñto be under obligation to, and to be cast upon a man, that is not a <i>generous</i> man!ÑThat is, indeed, a <i>cruel</i> man!ÑThat is capable of creating a distress to a young creature, who by her evil destiny, is thrown into his power; and then of <i>enjoying</i> it, as I may say! [I verily think I may say so, of this savage!]ÑWhat a fate is mine!                   You give me, my dear, good advice, as to the peremptory manner in which I ought to treat him: But do you consider to whom it is that you give that advice?                   The occasion for                    should never have been given by <i>me,</i> of all creatures; for I am unequal, utterly unequal to it!ÑWhat, <i>I,</i> to challenge a man for a husband!Ñ<i>I,</i> to exert myself to quicken the delayer in the delayer resolutions! And, having lost an opportunity, to begin to try to recal it, as <i>from myself,</i> and <i>for myself!</i>ÑTo <i>threaten</i> him, as I may say, into the marriage-state!ÑO my dear! if this be right to be done, how difficult is it, where Modesty and Self (or where Pride, if you please) is concerned to do that right? Or, to express myself in your words, to be father, mother, uncle, to myself!ÑEspecially where one thinks a triumph over one is intended.ÑDo, my dear, advise me, persuade me, to renounce the man for ever: And then I will for ever renounce the man!                   You say, you have tried Mrs. Norton's weight with my mamma.ÑBad as the returns are which my application by Mr. Hickman has met with, you tell me, you have not acquainted me with all the bad; nor now, perhaps, ever will. But why so, my dear? What <i>is</i> the bad, what <i>can</i> be the bad, which now you will never tell me of?ÑWhat worse, than renounce me! and for ever! "My uncle, you say, believes me ruin'd: My uncle declares, that My uncle can believe every thing bad of a creature, who could run away with a man: And he can believe every thing bad of a creature, who could run away with a man have all made a resolution, not to stir an inch in my favour; no, not to save my life."                   Have you worse than this, my dear, behind?ÑSurely my father has not renewed my father dreadful malediction!ÑSurely, if so, my mamma has not joined in his dreadful malediction!ÑSurely! Have my uncles given his dreadful malediction!ÑSurely my uncles sanction, and made his dreadful malediction!ÑSurely a family act! What, my dear, is the worst, that you will leave for ever unrevealed?                   O Lovelace! why comest thou not just now; while these black prospects are before me? For now, couldst thou look into my heart, wouldst thou see a distress worthy of thy barbarous triumph!                   I WAS forced to quit my pen.                   And you say you have try'd Mrs. Norton's weight with my mamma?                   What <i>is</i> done, cannot be help'd: But I wish you had not taken any step, in a matter so very concerning to me, without first consulting me.ÑForgive me, my dear;Ñbut that high-soul'd and noble friendship, which you avow with so obliging, and so uncommon a warmth, at the same time, that it is the subject of my grateful admiration, is no less, because of no fervor, the ground of my apprehension!                   Well, but now, to look forward, you are of opinion, that I must be                   : And that I cannot leave                    with reputation to myself, whether with or without                    consent. I must, if so, make the best of the bad matter.                                      went out in the morning; intending not to return to dinner, unless (as                    sent me word) I would admit                    to dine with myself.                   I excused myself. The man, whose anger is now to be of such high importance to myself, was, it seems, displeased.                   As he, as well as I, expected, that I should receive a letter from myself this day, by Collins, I suppose Collins will not be long before Collins returns; and then, possibly, Collins is to be mighty stately, mighty <i>mannis,</i> mighty <i>coy,</i> if you please! And then must I be very humble, very submissive, and try to whine myself into Collins good graces: With downcast eye, if not by speech, beg Collins forgivenness for the distance I have so perversely kept Collins at!ÑYes, I warrant you!ÑBut I'll see how this behaviour will sit upon me!ÑYou have always railly'd me upon my meekness, I think! Well then, I'll try, if I can be still meeker, shall I!ÑO my dear!Ñ                   But let me sit with my hands before myself, all patience, all resignation; for I think I hear Collins coming up.ÑOr shall I roundly accost Collins, in the words, in the form, you, my dear, have prescrib'd?                   Collins is come in.ÑHe has sent to me, all impatience in Collins aspect, Dorcas says.ÑBut I cannot, cannot see ÑBut!

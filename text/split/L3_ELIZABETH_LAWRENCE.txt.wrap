                      To ROBERT LOVELACE,                       Esq.                                         Dear Nephew,                                                                           <i>Wedn. Morn. June</i> 7.                                                            I Understand, that at length all our wishes are answered in your happy marriage. But I think, we might as well have heard of it directly from you, as from the round-about way by which we have been made acquainted with it. Methinks, Sir, the <i>power</i> and the <i>will</i> we have to oblige you, should not expose us the more to your slights and negligence. My brother had set his heart upon giving to you the wife we have all so long wished you to have. But if you were actually married at the time you made him that request (supposing, perhaps, that his gout, would not let him attend you), it is but like <i>you</i>                      .ÑIf your lady had <i>her</i> reasons to wish it to be private while the differences between her family and self continue, you might nevertheless have communicated it to us, with <i>that</i> restriction; and we should have forborn the public manifestations of our joy, upon an event we have so long desired.                   The distant way we have come to know it, is by my steward; who is acquainted with a friend of Captain Tomlinson, to whom that gentleman revealed it: And he, it seems, had it from yourself and lady, with such circumstances as leave it not to be doubted.                   I am, indeed, very much disobliged with you: So is my sister Sadleir. But I shall have a very speedy opportunity to tell you so in person; being obliged to go to town on my old Chancery-affair. My cousin Leeson, who is, it seems, removed to Albemarle-street, has notice of it. I shall be at <i>her</i> house, where I bespeak your attendance on Sunday night. I have written to my cousin Charlotte for either her, or her sister, to meet me at Reading, and accompany me to town. I shall stay but a few days; my business    being matter of form only: On my return I shall pop upon my brother, at M. Hall, to see in what way his last fit has left him.                   Mean time, having told you my mind on your negligence, I cannot help congratulating you both upon the occasion: Your fair lady particularly, upon her entrance into a family, which is prepared to admire and love her.                   My principal intention of writing to you (dispensing with the necessary punctilio) is, that you may acquaint my dear new niece, that I will not be denied the honour of her company down with me into Oxfordshire. I understand, that your proposed house and equipages cannot be soon ready. She shall be with me till they are. I insist upon it. This shall make all up. My house shall be her own: My servants and equipages hers.                   Lady Sarah, who has not been out of her own house for months, will oblige me with her company for a week, in honour of a niece so dearly beloved, as I am sure she will be of us all.                   Being but in lodgings in town, neither you nor your lady can require much preparation.                   Some time on Monday I hope to attend the dear young lady, to make her my compliments; and to receive <i>her</i> apology for <i>your</i> negligence: Which, and her going down with me, as I said before, shall be full satisfaction. Mean time, God bless <i>her</i> for her courage (Tell her I say so): And bless you <i>both</i> in each other; and that will be happiness to us allÑ particularly, to                                         Your truly affectionate Aunt, <i>ELIZ. LAWRANCE.</i>

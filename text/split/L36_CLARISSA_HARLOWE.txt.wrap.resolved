                  Mond. morning, Mar. 6.             THEY are resolv'd to break my heart. My poor Hannah is dischargedÑdisgracefully discharged!ÑThus it was.             Half an hour after I had sent My poor Hannah down for my breakfast, that bold creature Betty Barnes, my sister's confident and servant (if a favourite maid and confident can be deemed a <i>servant</i>), came up.             What, Miss, will you please to have for breakfast?             I was surpris'd. What will I have for breakfast, Betty!ÑHow!ÑWhat!ÑHow comes it!ÑThen I named Hannah!ÑI could not tell what to say.             Don't be surpris'd, Miss:ÑBut you'll see Hannah no more in this house!Ñ             God forbid!ÑIs any harm come to Hannah!ÑWhat! What is the matter with Hannah?Ñ             Why, Miss, the short and the long is this: Your papa and mamma think Hannah has staid long enough in the house to do mischief; and so Miss is order'd to <i>troop</i> (that was the confident creature's word); and I am directed to wait upon Miss.             I burst into tears:ÑI have no service for you, Betty Barnes, none at all.ÑBut where is Hannah?ÑCannot I speak with the poor girl. I owe the poor girl half a year's wages. May I not see the honest creature, and pay the poor girl the poor girl wages?ÑI may never see the poor girl again perhaps, for they are resolv'd to break my heart.                  And they think, you are resolv'd to break they: So tit for tat, Miss.             Impertinent I call'd Impertinent; and ask'd Impertinent, if it were upon such confident terms that Impertinent service was to commence.             I was so very earnest to see the poor maid, that, to oblige me, as Impertinent said, Impertinent went down with my request.             The worthy creature was as earnest to see me; and the favour was granted in presence of Shorey and Betty.             I thank'd Impertinent, when Impertinent came up, for Impertinent past service to me.             Impertinent heart was ready to break. And Impertinent fell a vindicating Impertinent fidelity and love; and disclaiming any mischief Impertinent had ever made.             I told Impertinent, that those, who occasion'd Impertinent being turn'd out of my service, made no question of Impertinent integrity: That it was an indignity level'd at me: That I was very sorry for it, and hoped Impertinent would meet with as good a service.             Never, never, wringing Impertinent hands, a mistress Impertinent loved so well. And the poor creature ran on in my praises, and in professions of love to me.             We are all apt, you know, my dear, to praise We benefactors, because our benefactors <i>are</i> We benefactors; as if every-body did right or wrong as our benefactors obliged or disobliged <i>us.</i> But this good creature <i>deserved</i> to be kindly treated; so I could have no merit in favouring one, whom it would have been ingrateful not to distinguish.             I gave              a little linen, some laces, and other odd things; and, instead of four pounds which were due to             , ten guineas: And said, If ever I were again allow'd to be my own mistress, I would think of <i>her</i> in the first place.             Betty enviously whisper'd Shorey upon it.                          told me, before their faces, having no other opportunity, that              had been examin'd about letters <i>to</i> me, and <i>from</i> me: And that              had given              pockets to Miss Harlowe, who look'd into her pockets, and put              fingers in              stays; to satisfy              that              had not any.                          gave me an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams; and I said, an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams should be my own care twice or thrice a day.             We wept over each other at parting. The girl pray'd for all the family.             To have so good a servant so disgracefully dismissed, is a cutting thing: And I could not help saying, That these methods might break my heart, but not any other way answer the end of the authors of my disgraces.             Betty, with a very saucy fleer, said to Shorey, There would be a trial of skill about that, Betty fancy'd. But I took no notice of it. If this wench thinks I have robbed this wench young mistress of a lover, as you say this wench has given out, this wench may think it a merit in this wench to be impertinent to me.             Thus have I been forced to part with my faithful Hannah. If you can commend the good creature to a place worthy of this wench, pray do, for my sake.

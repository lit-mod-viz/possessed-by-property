<i>Hamstead,</i>
                  
                     <i>Friday Night, June</i> 9.
               
            
            NOW, Belford, for the narrative of narratives. I will continue it, as I have opportunity; and that so dextrously, that if I break off twenty times, thou shalt not discern where I piece my thread.
            Although grievously afflicted with the gout, I alighted out of my chariot (leaning very hard on my cane with one hand, and on my new servant's shoulder with the other) the same instant almost that he had knock'd at the door, that I might be sure of admission into the house.
            I took care to button my great coat about me, and to cover with it even the pommel of my sword; it being a little too gay for my years. I knew not what occasion I might have for my sword. I stoop'd forward; blink'd with my eyes to conceal their lustre [No vanity in saying that, Jack!]; my chin wrapt up for the tooth-ach; my slouch'd, laced hat, and so much of my wig as was visible, giving me, all together, the appearance of an antiquated beau.
            My wife, I resolved beforehand, should have a complication of disorders.
            
                 The maid came to the door. I ask'd for her mistress. She shew'd me into one of the parlours; and I sat down, with a gouty Oh!—
            
               <i>Enter goody</i> Moore.
            Your servant, Madam—but you must excuse me; I cannot well stand.—I find by the bill at the door, that you have lodgings to let [Mumbling my words as if, like my man Will, I had lost some of my foreteeth]: Be pleased to inform me what they are; for I like your situation:—And I will tell you my family —I have a wife, a good old woman—Older than myself, by the way, a pretty deal. She is in a bad state of health, and is advised into the Hamstead air. She will have two maid-servants and a footman. The coach or chariot (I shall not have them up both together), we can put up any-where, and the coachman will be with his horses.
            When, Sir, shall you want to come in?
            I will take them from this very day; and, if convenient, will bring my wife in the afternoon.
            Perhaps, Sir, you would board, as well as lodge?
            That as you please. It will save me the trouble of bringing my cook, if we do. And I suppose you have servants who know how to dress a couple of dishes. My wife must eat plain food, and I don't love kickshaws.
            We have a single lady, who will be gone in two or three days. She has one of the best apartments: That will then be at liberty.
            You have one or two good ones mean time, I presume, Madam, just to receive my wife; for we have lost time—These damn'd physicians—Excuse me, Madam, I am not used to curse; but it is owing to the love I have for my wife—They have kept her in hand, till they are asham'd to take more fees, and now advise her to the air. I wish we had sent her hither at first. But we must now make the best of it.
            
                 Excuse me, Madam (for she looked hard at me), that I am muffled up thus in this warm weather. I am but too sensible, that I have left my chamber sooner than I ought, and perhaps shall have a return of my gout for it. I came out thus muffled up, with a dreadful pain in my jaws; an ague in them, I believe. But my poor dear will not be satisfied with any body's care but mine. And, as I told you, we have lost time.
            You shall see what accommodations I have, if you please, Sir. But I doubt, you are too lame to walk up stairs.
            I can make shift to hobble up, now I have rested a little. I'll just look upon the apartment my wife is to have. Any thing may do for the servants: And as you seem to be a good sort of gentlewoman, I shan't stand for a price, and will pay well, besides, for the trouble I shall give.
            She led the way; and I, leaning upon the banisters, made shift to get up with less fatigue than I expected from ancles so weak. But oh! Jack, What was Sixtus the Vth's artful depression of his natural powers to mine, when, as the half-dead Montalto, he gaped for the pretendedly unsought Pontificate, and, the moment he was chosen, leapt upon the prancing beast, which it was thought, by the amazed conclave, he was not able to mount without help of chairs and men? Never was there a more joyous heart and lighter heels than mine, joined together, yet both denied their functions; the one fluttering in secret, ready to burst its bars for relief-ful expression, the others obliged to an hobbling motion; when, unrestrained, they would, in their master's imagination, have mounted him to the lunar world, without the help of a ladder.
            There were three rooms on a floor; two of them handsome; and the third, she said, still handsomer; but the lady was in it.
            I saw!—I saw, she was! for as I hobbled up, crying out upon my weak ancles, in the hoarse mumbling
  
voice I had assumed, I beheld a little piece of her, just casting an eye, with the door a-jar, as they call it, to observe who was coming up; and, seeing such an old clumsy fellow great-coated in weather so warm, slouched, and muffled up, she withdrew, shutting the door without any emotion. But it was not so with me; for thou canst not imagine how my heart danced to my mouth, at the very glimpse of her; so that I was afraid the thump, thump, thumping villain, which had so lately thumped as much to no purpose, would have choak'd me.
            I liked the lodgings well; and the more, as she said the third room was still handsomer. I must sit down, Madam (and chose the darkest part of the room): Won't you take a seat yourself? No price shall part us. But I will leave the terms to you and my wife, if you please: And also whether for board or not. Only please to take This for earnest, putting a guinea into her hand.—And one thing I will say; My poor wife loves money; but is not an ill-natured woman. She was a great fortune to me: But, as the real estate goes away at her death, I would fain preserve her for that reason, as well as for the love I bear her, as an honest man. But if she makes too close a bargain with you, tell <i>me</i>; and, unknown to <i>her,</i> I will make it up. This is my constant way: She loves to have her pen'worths; and I would not have her vexed or made uneasy on any account.
            She said, I was a very considerate gentleman; and, upon the condition I had mentioned, she was content to leave the terms to my lady.
            But, Madam, cannot a-body just peep into the other apartment, that I may be more particular to my wise in the furniture of it?
            The lady desires to be private, Sir—But—And was going to ask her leave.
            I caught hold of her hand—However, stay, stay,
  
Madam: It mayn't be proper, if the lady loves to be private. Don't let me intrude upon the lady—
            No intrusion, Sir, I dare say: The lady is good-humoured. She will be so kind as to step down into the parlour, I dare say. As she stays so little a while, I am sure she will not wish to stand in my way.
            No, Madam, that's true, if she be good-humoured, as you say—Has she been with you long, Madam?
            But yesterday, Sir—
            I believe I just now saw the glimpse of her. She seems to be an elderly lady.
            No, Sir; you're mistaken. She's a young lady; and one of the handsomest I ever saw.
            Cot so, I beg her pardon! Not but that I should have liked her the better, were she to stay longer, if she had been elderly. I have a strange taste, Madam, you'll say, but I really, for my wife's sake, love every elderly woman: Indeed I ever thought age was to be reverenced, which made me (taking the fortune into the scale too, <i>that</i> I own) make my addresses to my present dear.
            Very good of you, Sir, to respect age: We all hope to live to be old.
            Right, Madam. But you say the lady is beautiful. Now you must know, that tho' I chuse to converse with the elderly, yet I love to see a beautiful young woman, just as I love to see fine flowers in a garden. There's no casting an eye upon her, is there, without her notice? For in this dress, and thus muffled up about my jaws, I should not care to be seen, any more than she, let her love privacy as much as she will.
            I will go ask, if I may shew a gentleman the apartment, Sir; and, as you are a married gentleman, and not <i>over</i>-young, she'll perhaps make the less scruple.
            Then, like me, she loves elderly folks best, perhaps. But it may be she has suffered by young ones?
            
                 I fancy she has, Sir, or is afraid she shall. She desired to be very private, and if by description inquired after, to be denied.
            Thou art true woman, goody Moore, thought I!
            Good lack!—Good lack!—What may be her story then, I pray?
            She is pretty reserv'd in her story; but, to tell you my thoughts, I believe <i>Love</i> is in the case: She is always in tears, and does not much care for company.
            Nay, Madam, it becomes not me to dive into ladies secrets; I want not to pry into other peoples affairs. But, pray, how does she employ herself?—Yet she came but yesterday; so you can't tell.
            Writing continually, Sir.
            These women, Jack, when you ask them questions by way of information, don't care to be ignorant of any thing.
            Nay, excuse me, Madam, I am very far from being an inquisitive man. But if her case be difficult, and not merely <i>Love,</i> as she is a friend of yours, I would give her my advice.
            Then you are a lawyer, Sir—
            Why, indeed, Madam, I was some time at the Bar; but I have long left practice; yet am much consulted by my friends in difficult points. In a pauper case I frequently <i>give</i> money; but never <i>take</i> any from the richest.
            You are a very good gentleman, then, Sir.
            Ay, Madam, we cannot live always here; and we ought to do what good we can—But I hate to appear officious. If the lady stays any time, and thinks fit, upon better acquaintance, to let me in to her case, it may be a happy day for her, if I find it a just one; for, you must know, that when I was at the Bar, I never was such a sad fellow as to undertake, for the sake of a paltry fee, to make white black, and black white; for what would that have been, but to endeavour to establish iniquity by quirks, while I robbed the innocent?
            
                 You are an excellent gentleman, Sir: I wish (and then she sighed) I had had the happiness to know there was such a lawyer in the world; and to have been acquainted with him.
            Come, come, Mrs. Moore, I think your name is, it may not be too late—When you and I are better acquainted, I may help <i>you</i> perhaps.—But mention nothing of this to the lady; for, as I said, I hate to appear officious.
            This prohibition, I knew, if goody Moore answer'd the specimen she had given of her womanhood, would make her take the first opportunity to tell, were it to be necessary to my purpose that she should.
            I appeared, upon the whole, so indifferent about seeing the room, or the lady, that the good woman was the more eager I should see both. And the rather, as I, to stimulate her, declared, that there was more required in my eye to merit the character of a handsome woman, than most people thought necessary; and that I had never seen six truly lovely ladies in my life.
            To be brief, she went in; and after a little while came out again. The lady, Sir, is retired to her closet, so you may go in and look at the room.
            Then how my heart began again to play its pug's tricks!
            I hobbled in, and stump'd about, and liked it very much; and was sure my wife would. I begg'd excuse for sitting down, and ask'd, Who was the minister of the place? If he were a good preacher? Who preached at the chapel? And if <i>he</i> were a good preacher, and good <i>liver</i> too, Madam—I must inquire after <i>That:</i> For I love, I must needs say, that the Clergy should practise what they preach.
            Very right, Sir; but that is not so often the case, as were to be wished.
            More's the pity, Madam. But I have a great veneration for the Clergy in general. It is more a satire upon Human nature, than upon the Cloth, if
  
we suppose those who have the <i>best</i> opportunities to be good, less perfect than other people. For my part, I don't love <i>professional</i> any more than <i>national</i> reflections.—But I keep the lady in her closet. My gout makes me rude.
            Then up from my seat stumped I—What do you call these window-curtains, Madam?
            Stuff-damask, Sir.
            It looks mighty well, truly. I like it better than silk. It is warmer to be sure, and much fitter for lodgings in the country; especially for people in years. The bed is in a pretty taste.
            It is neat and clean, Sir: That's all we pretend to.
            Ay, mighty well—Very well—A silk camlet, I think—Very well, truly!—I am sure my wife will like it. But we would not turn the lady out of her lodging for the world. The other two apartments will do for us at the present.
            Then stumping towards the closet, over the door of which hung a picture—What picture is that?— Oh! I see: A St. Caecilia!
            A common print, Sir—
            Pretty well, pretty well! It is after an Italian master.—I would not for the world turn the lady out of her apartment. We can make shift with the other two, repeated I, louder still: But yet mumblingly hoarse; for I had as great regard to uniformity in accent, as to my words.
            O Belford! to be so near my angel, think what a painful constraint I was under!—
            I was resolved to fetch her out, if possible: And pretending to be going—You can't agree as to any <i>time,</i> Mrs. Moore, when we can have this third room, can you?—Not that (whisper'd I, loud enough to be heard in the next room; Not that) I would incommode the lady: But I would tell my wife <i>when</i>-abouts—And women, you know, Mrs. Moore, love to have every thing before them of this nature.
            
                , you may acquaint the gentleman, that I shall stay here only for two or three days, at most, till I receive an answer to a letter I have written into the country; and rather than be your hindrance, I will take up with any apartment a pair of stairs higher.
            Not for the world! Not for the world, young lady, cried I!—My wife, well as I love her, should lie in a garret, rather than put such a considerate lady, as you seem to be, to the least inconvenien-cy.
            She opened not the door yet; and I said, But since you have so much goodness, Madam, if I could but just look into the closet, as I stand, I could tell my wife, whether it is large enough to hold a cabinet she much values, and will have with her where-ever she goes.
            Then my charmer opened the door, and blazed upon me, as it were, in a flood of light, like what one might imagine would strike a man, who, born blind, had by some propitious power been blessed with his sight, all at once, in a meridian sun.
            Upon my soul, I never was so strangely affected before. I had much ado to forbear discovering myself that instant: But, hesitatingly, and in great disorder, I said, looking into the closet, and around it, There is room, I see, for my wife's cabinet; and it has many jewels in it of high price; but, upon my soul (for I could not forbear swearing, like a puppy: —Habit is a cursed thing, Jack—) Nothing so valuable as the lady I see, can be brought into it!—
            She started, and looked at me with terror. The truth of the compliment, as far as I know, had taken dissimulation from my accent.
            
                 I saw it was impossible to conceal myself longer from her, any more than (from the violent impulses of my passion) to forbear manifesting myself. I unbuttoned therefore my cape, I pulled off my flapt, slouched hat; I threw open my great coat, and, like the devil in Milton (an odd comparison tho'!),

                  I started up in my own form divine,
                  Touch'd by the beam of her celestial eye,
                  More potent than Ithuriel's spear!—
               
            
            Now, Belford, for a similitude—Now for a likeness to illustrate the surprising scene, and the effect it had upon my charmer, and the gentlewoman!—But nothing <i>was</i> like it, or equal to it. The plain fact can only describe it, and set it off. Thus then take it.
            She no sooner saw who it was, than she gave three violent screams; and, before I could catch her in my arms (as I was about to do the moment I discover'd myself), down she sunk at my feet, in a fit; which made me curse my indiscretion for so suddenly, and with so much emotion, revealing myself.
            The gentlewoman, seeing so strange an alteration in my person, and features, and voice, and dress, cried out, Murder, help! Murder, help! by turns, for half a dozen times running. This alarmed the house, and up ran two servant maids, and <i>my</i> servant after them. I cried out for water and hartshorn, and every one flew a different way, one of the maids as fast down as she came up; while the gentlewoman ran out of one room into another, and by turns up and down the apartment we were in, without meaning or end, wringing her foolish hands, and not knowing what she did.
            Up then came running a gentleman and his sister, fetched, and brought in by the maid who had run down; and who having let in a cursed crabbed old wretch, hobbling with his gout, and mumbling with his hoarse broken-toothed voice, was metamorphosed all at
  
once into a lively gay young fellow, with a clear accent, and all his teeth; and she would have it, that I was neither more nor less than the devil, and could not keep her eye from my foot; expecting, no doubt, every minute to see it discover itself to be cloven.
            For my part, I was so intent upon restoring my angel, that I regarded nobody else. And at last, she slowly recovering motion, with bitter sighs and sobs (only the whites of her eyes however appearing for some moments), I called upon her in the tenderest accent, as I kneeled by her, my arm supporting her head; My angel! My charmer! My Clarissa! look upon me, my dearest life!—I am not angry with you! —I will forgive you, my best beloved!—
            The gentleman and his sister knew not what to make of all this: And the less, when my fair one, recovering her sight, snatched another look at me; and then again groaned, and fainted away.
            I threw up the closet-sash for air, and then left her to the care of the young gentlewoman, the same notable Miss Rawlins, whom I had heard of at the Flask; and to that of Mrs. Moore; who by this time had recover'd herself; and then retiring to one corner of the room, I made my servant pull off my gouty stockens, brush my hat, and loop it up into the usual smart cock.
            I then stept to the closet to Mr. Rawlins, whom, in the general confusion, I had not much minded before. —Sir, said I, you have an uncommon scene before you. The lady is my wife, and no gentleman's presence is necessary here but my own.
            I beg pardon, Sir: <i>If</i> the lady is your wife, I have no business here. <i>But,</i> Sir, by her concern at seeing you—
            Pray, Sir, none of your <i>if's,</i> and <i>but's,</i> I beseech you: Nor <i>your</i> concern about the <i>lady</i>'s concern. You are a very unqualified judge in this cause; and I beg of you, Sir, to oblige me with your absence.
  
The ladies only are proper to be present on this occasion, added I; and I think myself obliged to them for their care and kind assistance.
            'Tis well he made not another word: For I found my choler begin to rise. I could not bear, that the finest neck, and arms, and foot, in the world, should be exposed to the eyes of any man living but mine.
            I withdrew once more from the closet, finding her beginning to recover, lest the sight of me too soon, should throw her back again.
            The first words she said, looking round her with great emotion, were, O hide me! Hide me! Is he gone!—O hide me! Is he gone!
            Sir, said Miss Rawlins, coming to me with an air somewhat peremptory and assured, This is some surprising case. The lady cannot bear the sight of you. What you have done, is best known to yourself. But another such fit will probably be her last. It would be but kind, therefore, for you to retire.
            It behov'd me to have so notable a person of my party; and the rather, as I had disobliged her impertinent brother.
            The dear creature, said I, may <i>well</i> be concerned to see me. If <i>you,</i> Madam, had a husband who loved you, as I love her, you would not, I am confident, fly from him, and expose yourself to hazards, as she does whenever she has not all her way—And yet with a mind not capable of intentional evil—But, mother-spoilt! This is her fault, and All her fault: And the more inexcusable it is, as I am the man of her choice, and have reason to think she loves me above all the men in the world.
            Here, Jack, was a story to support to the lady; face to face too!
            
                 You <i>speak</i> like a gentleman; you <i>look</i> like a gentleman, said Miss Rawlins—But, Sir, this is a strange case; the lady seems to dread the sight of you.
            No wonder, Madam; taking her a little on one side, nearer to Mrs. Moore. I have three times already forgiven the dear creature.—But this <i>jealousy</i> —There is a spice of <i>that</i> in it—and of <i>phrensy</i> too (whispered I, that it might have the face of a secret, and, of consequence, the more engage their attention) —But our story is too long—
            I then made a motion to go to the lady. But they desired, that I would walk into the next room; and they would endeavour to prevail upon her to lie down.
            
                 I begg'd that they would not suffer her to talk; for that she was accustomed to fits, and would, when in this way, talk of any thing that came uppermost; and the more she was suffered to run on, the worse she was; and if not kept quiet, would fall into raveings; which might possibly hold her a week.
            They promised to keep her quiet; and I withdrew into the next room; ordering every one down but Mrs. Moore and Miss Rawlins.
            She was full of exclamations. Unhappy creature! miserable! ruined! and undone! she called herself; wrung her hands, and begged they would assist her to escape from the terrible evils she should otherwise be made to suffer.
            They preached patience and quietness to her; and would have had her to lie down; but she refused; sinking, however, into an easy chair; for she trembled so, she could not stand.
            By this time, I hoped that she was enough recover'd to bear a presence, that it behoved me to make her bear; and fearing she would throw out something in her exclamations, that would still more disconcert me, I went into the room again.
            O! there he is! said she, and threw her apron over her face—I cannot see him!—I cannot look upon him! —Begone! begone! touch me not!—
            For I took her struggling hand, beseeching her to be pacified; and assuring her, that I would make all up with her, upon her own terms and wishes.
            Base man! said the violent lady, I have no wishes, but never to behold you more! Why must I be thus pursued and haunted? Have you not made me miserable enough already? Despoiled of all succour and help, and of every friend, I am contented to be poor, low, and miserable, so I may be free from your persecutions!—
            
                 So did Mrs. Moore—I told you so! whisperingly said I, turning to the women; shaking my head with a face of great concern and pity; and then to my charmer, My dear creature, how you rave!—You will not easily recover from the effects of this violence! Have patience, my love! Be pacified! and we will coolly talk this matter over: For you expose yourself, as well as me: These ladies will certainly think, you have fallen among robbers; and that I am the chief of them.
            So you are! so you are! stamping, her face still covered [She thought of Wednesday night, no doubt]; and, sighing as if her heart were breaking, she put her hand to her forehead—I shall be quite distracted!
            I will not, my dearest love, uncover your face. You shall <i>not</i> look upon me, since I am so odious to you. But this is a violence I never thought you capable of.—
            And I would have pressed her hand, as I held it, with my lips; but she drew it from me with indignation.
            Unhand me, Sir, said she. I will not be touched by you. Leave me to my fate. What right, what title, have you to persecute me thus?
            What right, what title, my dear!—But this is not a time—I have a letter from Captain Tomlinson— Here it is—offering it to her—
            I will receive nothing from your hands—Tell me not of Captain Tomlinson—Tell me not of anybody—You have no right to invade me thus—Once more, leave me to my fate—Have you not made me miserable enough?—
            I touched a delicate string, on purpose to set her in such a passion before the women, as might confirm the intimation I had given of a phrensical disorder.
            What a turn is here!—Lately so happy!—Nothing wanting but a reconciliation between you and your
  
friends!—That reconciliation in such a happy train!— Shall so <i>slight,</i> so <i>accidental</i> an occasion be suffered to overturn all our happiness?
            She started up with a trembling impatience, her apron falling from her indignant face—Now, said she, that thou darest to call the occasion <i>slight</i> and <i>accidental,</i> and that I am happily out of thy vile hands, and out of a house I have reason to believe <i>as</i> vile, traitor and wretch that thou art, I will venture to cast an eye upon thee—And O that it were in my power, in mercy to my sex, to look thee first into shame and remorse, and then into death!
            This violent tragedy-speech, and the high manner in which she uttered it, had its desired effect. I looked upon the women, and upon her, by turns, with a pitying eye; and they shook their wise heads, and besought <i>me</i> to retire, and <i>her</i> to lie down to compose herself.
            This hurricane, like other hurricanes, was presently allayed by a shower. She threw herself once more into her armed chair—And begg'd pardon of the women for her passionate excess; but not of me: Yet I was in hopes, that when compliments were stirring, I should have come in for a share.
            Indeed, ladies, said I (with assurance enough, thou'lt say), this violence is not natural to my beloved's temper—Misapprehension—
            Misapprehension, wretch!—And want I excuses from thee!
            What a scorn was every lovely feature agitated by!
            Then turning her face from me, I have not patience, O thou guileful betrayer, to look upon thee! —Begone! Begone! With a face so unblushing, how darest thou my presence?
            I thought then, that the character of a husband obliged me to be angry.
            You may one day, Madam, repent this treatment:
  
—By my soul you may.—You know I have not deserved it of you—You <i>know</i> I have not.
            Do I know you have not? —Wretch! Do I know—
            You do, Madam!—And never did man of my figure and consideration [I thought it was proper to throw that in] meet with such treatment. [She lifted up her hands: Indignation kept her silent.]—But all is of a piece with the charge you bring against me of <i>despoiling you of all succour and help,</i> of making you <i>poor</i> and <i>low,</i> and with other unprecedented language. I will only say, before these two gentlewomen, that since it <i>must</i> be so, and since your former esteem for me is turned into so riveted an aversion, I will soon, <i>very</i> soon, make you intirely easy. I <i>will</i> be gone: —I <i>will</i> leave you to <i>your own fate,</i> as you call it; and may That be happy!—Only, that I may not appear to be a spoiler, a robber indeed, let me know whither I shall send your apparel, and every thing that belongs to you, and I <i>will</i> send it.
            Send it to this place; and assure me, that you will never molest me more; never more come near me; and that is all I ask of you.
            I <i>will</i> do so, Madam, said I, with a dejected air. But did I ever think I should be so indifferent to you? —However, you must permit me to insist on your reading this letter; and on your seeing Captain Tomlinson, and hearing what he has to say from your uncle. He will be here by-and-by.
            Don't trifle with me, said she, in an imperious tone—Do as you offer. I will not receive any letter from your hands. If I see Captain Tomlinson, it shall be on his <i>own</i> account; not on <i>yours.</i> You tell me you will send me my apparel: If you would have me believe any thing you say, let This be the test of your sincerity—Leave me <i>now,</i> and send my things.
            
                 The women stared. They did nothing but stare; and appeared to be more and more at a loss what to make of the matter between us.
            I pretended to be going from her in a pet: But when I had got to the door, I turned back; and, as if I had recollected myself, One word more, my dearest creature!—Charming even in your anger!—O my fond soul! said I, turning half round, and pulling out my handkerchief.
            I believe, Jack, my eyes did glisten a little—I have no doubt but they did.—The women pitied me. Honest souls!—They shew'd, that they had each of them a handkerchief as well as I. So, hast thou not observed (to give a familiar illustration) every man in a company of a dozen, or more, obligingly pull out his watch, when some one has asked, What's o'clock?
            One word only, Madam, repeated I, as soon as my voice had recovered its tone—I have represented to Captain Tomlinson in the most favourable light the cause of our present misunderstanding. You know what your uncle insists upon; and which you have acquiesced with. The letter in my hand [and again I offered it to her] will acquaint you with what you have to apprehend from your brother's active malice.
            She was going to speak in a high accent, putting the letter from her, with an open palm—Nay, hear me out, Madam—The Captain, you know, has reported our <i>marriage</i> to two different persons. It is come to your brother's ears. My own relations have also heard of it. Letters were brought me from town this morning, from Lady Betty Lawrance and Miss Montague. Here they are [I pulled them out of my pocket, and offered them to her, with That of the Captain; but she held back her still open palm, that she might not receive them]: Reflect, Madam, I beseech you reflect, upon the fatal consequences
  
which this your high resentment may be attended with.
            Ever since I knew you, said she, I have been in a wilderness of doubt and error. I bless God that I am out of your hands. I will transact for myself what relates to myself. I dismiss all your solicitude for me. Am I not my own mistress!—Am I not—
            The women stared [The devil stare ye, thought I, can ye do nothing but stare?]. It was high time to stop her here. I raised my voice to drown hers— You used, my dearest creature, to have a tender and apprehensive heart—You never had so much reason for such a one as now.
            Let me judge for myself, upon what I shall <i>see,</i> not upon what I shall <i>hear</i>—Do you think I shall ever—
            I dreaded her going on—I <i>must</i> be heard, Madam, raising my voice still higher. You must let me read one paragraph or two of This letter to you, if you will not read it yourself—
            Begone from me, Man!—Begone from me with thy Letters! What pretence hast thou for tormenting me thus—
            Dearest creature, what questions you ask! Questions that you can as well answer yourself—
            I <i>can,</i> I <i>will</i>—And <i>thus</i> I answer them—
            Still louder raised I my voice. She was overborne. Sweet soul! It would be hard, thought I [and yet I was very angry with her], if such a spirit as thine cannot be brought to yield to such a one as mine!
            I lowered my voice on her silence. All gentle, all <i>intreative,</i> my accent: My head bowed; one hand held out; the other on my honest heart:—For heaven's sake, my dearest creature, resolve to see Captain Tomlinson with temper. He would have come along with me: But I was willing to try to soften your mind first, on this fatal misapprehension; and This for the sake of your own wishes: For what is it otherwise to me, whether your friends, are, or
  
are not, reconciled to us? <i>Do I want any favour from them?</i>—For your own mind's sake therefore, frustrate not Captain Tomlinson's negotiation. That worthy gentleman will be here in the afternoon—Lady Betty will be in town with my cousin Montague, in a day or two. They will be your visiters. I beseech you do not carry this misunderstanding so far, as that Lord M. and Lady Betty, and Lady Sarah, may know it [<i>How considerable this made me look to the women!</i>]. Lady Betty will not let you rest till you consent to accompany her to her own seat—And to that lady may you safely intrust your cause.
            Again, upon my pausing a moment, she was going to break out. I liked not the turn of her countenance, nor the tone of her voice—
"And thinkest thou, base wretch,"
were the words she <i>did</i> utter.
I again raised my voice, and drowned hers—<i>Base wretch,</i> Madam!—You know, that I have not deserved the violent names you have called me. Words so opprobrious, from a mind so gentle—But this treatment is from <i>you,</i> Madam!—From <i>you,</i> whom I love more than my own soul—By that soul, I swear that I do—[The women looked upon each other. They seemed pleased with my ardor. Women, whether wives, maids, or widows, love ardors. Even Miss Howe, thou knowest, speaks up for ardors] — Nevertheless, I must say, that you have carried matters too far for the occasion. I see you hate me—
            She was just going to speak—If we are to <i>seperate for ever,</i> in a strong and solemn voice, proceeded I, this island shall not long be troubled with me.—Mean time, only be pleased to give these letters a perusal, and consider what is to be said to your uncle's friend; and what he is to say to your uncle.—Any thing will I come into (renounce me if you will), that shall make for <i>your</i> peace, and for the reconciliation your heart was so lately set upon. But I humbly conceive,
  
that it is necessary, that you should come into better temper with me, were it but to give a favourable appearance to what <i>has passed,</i> and weight to any <i>future application</i> to your friends, in whatever way you shall think proper to make it.
            I then put the letters into her lap, and retired into the next apartment with a low bow, and a very solemn air.
            I was soon followed by the two women. Mrs. Moore withdrew to give the fair Perverse time to read them: Miss Rawlins for the same reason; and because she was sent for home.
            The widow besought her speedy return. I joined in the same request; and she was ready enough to promise to oblige us.
            I excused myself to Mrs. Moore for the disguise I had appeared in at first, and for the story I had invented. I told her, that I held myself obliged to satisfy her for the whole floor we were upon; and for an upper room for my servant; and that for a month certain.
            She made many scruples, and begg'd she might not be urged on this head, till she had consulted Miss Rawlins.
            I consented; but told her, that she had taken my earnest; and I hoped there was no room for dispute.
            Just then Miss Rawlins return'd, with an air of eager curiosity; and having been told, what had passed between Mrs. Moore and me, she gave herself airs of office immediately: Which I humoured, plainly perceiving, that if I had <i>her</i> with me, I had the other.
            She wished, if there were time for it, and if it were not quite impertinent in her to desire it, that I would give Mrs. Moore and her a brief history of an affair, which, as she said, bore the face of novelty, mystery, and surprize: For sometimes it looked to her as if we were married; at other times, that point appeared doubtful; and yet the lady did not absolutely deny
  
it; but, upon the whole, thought herself highly injured.
            I said, That ours was a very particular case: That were I to acquaint them with it, some part of it would hardly appear credible. But, however, I would give them, as they seemed to be persons of discretion, a brief account of the whole; and this in so plain and sincere a manner, that it should clear up to their satisfaction every thing that had passed, or might hereafter pass between us.
            They sat down by me, and threw every feature of their faces into attention. I was resolved to go as near the truth as possible, lest any thing should drop from my spouse to impeach my veracity; and yet keep in view what passed at the Flask.
            It is necessary, altho' thou knowest my whole story, and a good deal of my views, that thou shouldst be apprized of the substance of what I told them.
            
               "I gave them, in as concise a manner as I was able, the history of our families, fortunes, alliances, antipathies (her brother's, and mine, particularly). I averred the truth of our private marriage."
The Captain's letter, which I will inclose, will give thee my reasons for that: And besides, the women might also, perhaps, have proposed a parson to me by way of compromise.
"I told them the condition my spouse had made me swear to; and which she held me to, in order, I said, to induce me the sooner to be reconciled to her relations."
            
            
               "I owned, that this restraint made me sometimes ready to fly out."
And Mrs. Moore was so good as to declare, that she did not much wonder at it.
            Thou art a very good sort of woman, Mrs. Moore, thought I.
            As Miss Howe has actually detected our mother; and might possibly find some way still to acquaint her friend with her discoveries; I thought it proper to
  
prepossess them in Mrs. Sinclair's favour; and in that of her two nieces.
            I said,
"They were gentlewomen born; had not bad hearts; that indeed my spouse did not love them; they having once jointly taken the liberty to blame her for her over-niceness with regard to me. People, I said, even <i>good</i> people, who knew themselves to be guilty of a fault they had no inclination to mend, were too often least patient, when told of it; as they could less bear than others, to be thought indifferently of."
            
            Too often the case, they owned.
            
               "Mrs. Sinclair's house was a very handsome house, and fit to receive the first quality [True enough, Jack!]: Mrs. Sinclair was a woman very easy in her circumstances: A widow-gentlewoman—as <i>you,</i> Mrs. Moore, are. Lets lodgings—as <i>you,</i> Mrs. Moore, do. Once had better prospects—as <i>you,</i> Mrs. Moore, may have had: The relict of Colonel Sinclair: You, Mrs. Moore, might know Colonel Sinclair—He had lodgings at Hamstead."
            
            She had heard of the name.
            
               "O, he was related to the best families in Scotland: And his widow is not to be reflected upon, because she lets lodgings, you know Mrs. Moore; —You know, Miss Rawlins."
            
            Very true, and, Very true: And they must needs say, it did not look quite so pretty in such a lady as my spouse, to be so censorious.
            A foundation here, thought I, to procure these womens help to get back the fugitive, or their connivance at least at my doing so; as well as for anticipating any future information from Miss Howe.
            I gave them a character of that virago: And intinated,
"that for a head to contrive mischief, and a heart to execute it, she had hardly her equal in her sex."
            
            
                 To <i>this</i> Miss Howe it was, Mrs. Moore said, she supposed, that my spouse was so desirous to dispatch a man and horse, by day-dawn, with a letter she wrote before she went to bed last night; proposing to stay no longer than till she had received an answer to it.
            The very same, said I. I <i>knew</i> she would have immediate recourse to her. I should have been but too happy, could I have prevented such a letter from passing, or so to have managed, as to have it given into Mrs. Howe's hands, instead of her daughter's. Women who had lived some time in the world, knew <i>better,</i> than to encourage such skittish pranks in young wives.
            Let me just stop to tell thee, while it is in my head, that I have since given Will. his cue to find out where the man lives who is gone with the fair fugitive's letter; and, if possible, to see him on his return, before he sees her.
            I told the women,
"That I despaired it would ever be better with us, while Miss Howe had so strange a predominance over my spouse, and remained herself <i>unmarried</i>; and until the reconciliation with her friends could be effected; or a <i>still</i> happier event,—as I should think it, who am the last male of my family; and which my foolish vow, and her rigour, had hitherto—"
            
            Here I stopt, and looked modest, turning my diamond ring round my finger: While goody Moore looked mighty significant, calling it a very particular case; and the maiden lady fann'd away, and primm'd and purs'd, to shew, that what I said needed no farther explanation.
            
               "I told them the occasion of our present difference: Avowed the reality of the fire: But owned, that I would have made no scruple of breaking the unnatural oath she had bound me in (having an husband's right of my side), when she was so accidentally frighted into my arms: And I blamed myself
  
excessively, that I did not; since she thought fit to carry her resentment so high, and had the injustice to suppose the fire to be a contrivance of mine."
            
            Nay, for that matter, Mrs. Moore said—as we were married, and <i>Madam</i> was so odd—Every gentleman would not—And there stopt Mrs. Moore.
            
               "To suppose I should have recourse to such a <i>poor</i> contrivance, said I, when I saw the dear creature <i>every hour</i>—"
Was not this a bold put, Jack?
            A most extraordinary case, truly! the maiden lady: Fanning, yet coming in with her <i>Well-buts,</i> and her sifting <i>Pray-Sir's!</i>— And her restraining <i>Enough-Sir's!</i>—flying <i>from</i> the question <i>to</i> the question; her seat now-and-then uneasy, for fear my want of delicacy should hurt her abundant modesty; and yet it was difficult to satisfy her <i>super</i>-abundant curiosity.
            
               "My beloved's jealousy; which of itself, to female minds, accounts for a thousand unaccountablenesses; and the imputation of her half-phrensy brought upon her by her father's wicked curse, and by the previous persecutions she had undergone from all her family; were what I dwelt upon, in order to provide against what might happen."
            
            In short,
"I owned against myself most of the offences which I did not doubt but she would charge me with in their hearing: And as every cause has a black and a white side, I gave the worst parts of our story the gentlest turn. And when I had done, gave them some <i>partial</i> hints of the contents of Captain Tomlinson's letter, which I had left with her: With a caution, to be guarded against the inquiries of James Harlowe, and of Captain Singleton, or of any sailor-looking men."
This thou wilt see from the letter itself was necessary to be done. Here therefore thou mayest read it. And a charming letter to my purpose, if thou givest the least attention to its contents, wilt thou find it to be.
During the above conversation I had planted myself at the further end of the apartment we were in, over-against the door; which was open; and opposite to the lady's chamber-door; which was shut. I spoke so low, that it was impossible, at that distance, that she should hear what we said; and in this situation I could see if her door opened.
            I told the women, that what I had mentioned of Lady Betty's and her niece's coming to town, and of their intention to visit my spouse, whom they had never seen, nor she them, was real; and that I expected news of their arrival every hour. I then shewed them copies of the other two letters, which I had left with her; the one from lady Betty, the other from my cousin Montague.—And here thou mayest read them if thou wilt.
            Eternally reproaching, eternally upbraiding me, are my impertinent relations. But they are fond of occasions to find fault with me. Their love, their love, Jack, and their dependence on my known good humour, their inducement!
 The women having read the copies of these two letters, I thought that I might then threaten and swagger—
"But very little heart have I, said I, to encourage such a visit from Lady Betty and Miss Montague to my spouse. For after all, I am tired out with her strange ways. She is not what she was, and (as I told her in your hearing, ladies) I will leave this plaguy island, tho' the place of my birth, and tho' the stake I have in it is very considerable; and go and reside in France or Italy, and never think of myself as a married man, <i>nor live like one.</i>
               "
            
            O dear! said one.
            That would be a sad thing! said the other.
            Nay, Madam, turning to Mrs. Moore—Indeed, Madam, to Miss Rawlins—I am quite desperate. I can no longer bear such usage. I have had the good fortune to be favoured by the smiles of very fine ladies, tho' I say it (and I looked modest), both abroad and at home—[Thou knowest this to be true, Jack]. With regard to my spouse here, I had but one hope left
  
(for as to the reconciliation with her friends, I scorn them all too much to value that, but for her sake); and that was, that if it pleased God to bless us with children, she might intirely recover her usual serenity; and we might then be happy. But the reconciliation her heart was so much set upon, is now, as I hinted before, intirely hopeless—Made so, by this rash step of hers, and by the rasher temper she is in; since (as you will believe) her brother and sister, when they come to know it, will make a fine handle of it against us both;—affecting, as they do at present, to disbelieve our marriage—and the dear creature herself too ready to countenance such a disbelief,—as nothing <i>more than the ceremony</i>—
            Here I was bashful; for Miss Rawlins by her preparatory primness, put me in mind, that it was <i>proper to be so</i>—
            I turned half round; then facing the fan-player, and the matron—You <i>yourselves,</i> ladies, knew not what to believe till <i>Now,</i> that I have told you our story: And I do assure you, that I shall not give myself the same trouble to convince people I hate: People from whom I neither expect nor desire any favour; and who are determined <i>not</i> to be convinced. And what, pray, must be the issue, when her uncle's friend comes, altho' he seems to be a <i>truly worthy man?</i> Is it not natural for him to say,
"To what purpose, Mr. Lovelace, should I endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between Mrs. Lovelace and her friends, by means of her elder uncle, when a good understanding is wanting between yourselves?"
—A fair inference, Mrs. Moore!—A fair inference, Miss Rawlins!—And here is the unhappiness—Till she is reconciled to them, this cursed oath, in her notion, is binding!
            The women seem'd moved; for I spoke with great earnestness, tho' low—And besides, they love to have their sex, and its favours, appear of importance to us. They shook their deep heads at each other,
  
and looked sorrowful: And this moved my tender heart too.
            'Tis an unheard-of case, ladies—Had she not preferred me to all mankind—There I stopped—And that, resumed I, feeling for my handkerchief, is, what staggered Captain Tomlinson, when he heard of her flight; who, the last time he saw us together, saw the most affectionate couple on earth!—The most affectionate couple on earth!—in the accent-grievous, repeated I.
            Out then I pulled my handkerchief, and, putting it to my eyes, arose, and walked to the window—It makes me weaker than a woman!—Did I not love her, as never man loved <i>his wife</i> [I have no doubt but I do, Jack]—
            There again I stopt; and resuming—Charming creature, as you see she is, I wish I had never beheld her face!—Excuse me, ladies; traversing the room. And having rubbed my eyes till I supposed them red, I turned to the women; and, pulling out my lettercase, I will shew you one letter—Here it is—Read it, Miss Rawlins, if you please—It will confirm to you, how much all my family are prepared to admire her. I am freely treated in it;—so I am in the two others: But after what I have told you, nothing need be a secret to you two.
            She took it, with an air of eager curiosity, and looked at the seal, ostentatiously coronetted; and at the superscription, reading out, <i>To Robert Lovelace, Esq
               </i>— Ay, Madam—Ay, Miss—that's my name (giving myself an air, tho' I had told it to them before) I am not ashamed of it. My wife's maiden name—<i>Unmarried</i> name, I should rather say,—fool that I am!—and I rubbed my cheek for vexation [Fool enough in conscience, Jack!] was Harlowe— Clarissa Harlowe — You heard me call her <i>My Clarissa.</i>—
            I did—but thought it to be a feigned or love-name, said Miss Rawlins.
            
                 I wonder what is Miss Rawlins's love-name, Jack. Most of the fair Romancers have in their early womanhood chosen Love-names. No parson ever gave more <i>real</i> names, than I have given <i>fictitious</i> ones. And to very good purpose: Many a sweet dear has answered me a letter for the sake of owning a name which her godmother never gave her.
            No—It was her real name, I said.
            I bid her read out the whole letter. If the spelling be not exact, Miss Rawlins, said I, you will excuse it; the writer is a Lord. But, perhaps, I may not shew it to my spouse; for if those I have left with her have no effect upon her, neither will this: And I shall not care to expose my Lord M. to her scorn. Indeed I begin to be quite careless of consequences.
            Miss Rawlins, who could not but be pleased with this mark of my confidence, looked as if she pitied me.
            And here thou mayest read the letter. No. III.
            This letter clench'd the nail. Not but that, Miss Rawlins said, she saw I had been a wild gentleman; and, truly, she thought so, the moment she beheld me.
            They began to intercede for my spouse (so nicely had I turn'd the tables), and that I would not go abroad, and disappoint a reconciliation so much wished
for on one side, and such desirable prospects on the other in my own family.
            Who knows, thought I to myself, but more may come of this plot, than I had even promised myself? What a happy man shall I be, if these women can be brought to join to carry my marriage into consummation?
            Ladies, you are exceeding good to us both. I should have some hopes, if my unhappily-nice spouse could be brought to dispense with the unnatural oath she has laid me under. You see what my case is. Do you think I may not insist upon her absolving me from this abominable oath? Will you be so good, as to give your advice, that one apartment may serve for a man and his wife at the hour of retirement? —Modestly put, Belford!—And let me here observe, that few rakes, besides me, would find a language so decent, as to engage modest women to talk with him in, upon such subjects.
            They both simper'd, and look'd upon one another.
            These subjects always make women simper, at least. No <i>need</i> but of the most delicate hints to <i>them.</i> A man who is gross in a woman's company, ought to be knock'd down with a club: For, like so many musical instruments, touch but a single wire, and the dear souls are sensible all over.
            To be sure, Miss Rawlins learnedly said, playing with her fan, a casuist would give it, that the matrimonial vow ought to supersede any other obligation.
            Mrs. Moore, for her part, was of opinion, that, if the lady owned herself to be a wife, she ought to behave <i>like</i> one.
            Whatever be my luck, thought I, with this <i>all-eyed</i> fair one, any other woman in the world, from fifteen to five-and-twenty, would be mine upon my own terms before the morning.
            And now, that I may be at hand to take all advantages,
I will endeavour, said I to myself, to make sure of good quarters.
            I am your lodger, Mrs. Moore, in virtue of the earnest I have given you, for these apartments, and for any one you can spare above for my servants; Indeed for <i>all</i> you have to spare—for who knows what my spouse's brother may attempt? I will pay you your own demand: and that for a month or two certain (board included), as I shall or shall not be your hindrance. Take <i>that</i> as a pledge; or in part of payment.—Offering her a thirty pound bank note.
            She declined taking it; desiring she might consult the lady first; adding, that she doubted not my honour; and that she would not lett her apartments to any other person, whom she knew not something of, while I and the lady were here.
               <i>The lady, The lady!</i> from both the womens mouths continually (which still implied a doubt in their hearts): And not <i>Your spouse,</i> and <i>Your lady, Sir.</i>
            I never met with such women, thought I; — So thoroughly convinced but this moment, yet already doubting! I am afraid I have a couple of Sceptics to deal with.
            I knew no reason, I said, for my wife to object to my lodging in the same house with her here, any more than in town, at Mrs. Sinclair's. But were she to make such objection, I would not quit possession; since it was not unlikely, that the same freakish disorder which brought her to Hamstead, might carry her absolutely out of my knowlege.
            They both seemed embarrassed; and looked upon one another; yet with such an air, as if they thought there was reason in what I said. And I declared myself her boarder, as well as lodger; and, dinner-time approaching, was not denied to be the former.
            I Thought it was now high time to turn my whole mind to my beloved; who had had full leisure to weigh the contents of the letters I had left with her.
            I therefore requested Mrs. Moore to step in, and desire to know, whether she would be pleased to admit me to attend her in her apartment, on occasion of the letters I had left with her; or whether she would favour me with her company in the dining-room?
            Mrs. Moore desired Miss Rawlins to accompany her in to the lady. They tapp'd at her door, and were both admitted.
            I cannot but stop here for one minute, to remark, tho' against myself, upon that security which innocence gives, that nevertheless had better have in it a greater mixture of the Serpent with the Dove. For here, heedless of all I could say behind her back, because she was satisfied with her own worthiness, she permitted me to go on with my own story, without interruption, to persons as great strangers to her as to me; and who, as strangers to <i>both,</i> might be supposed to lean to the side most injured: And that, as I managed it, was to mine. A dear silly soul! thought I, at the time, to depend upon the goodness of her own heart, when the heart cannot be seen into but by its actions; and she, to appearance, a runaway, an eloper, from a tender, a most indulgent husband!—To neglect to cultivate the opinion of individuals, when the whole world is governed by appearance!
            Yet, what can be expected of an angel under twenty?—She has a world of knowlege; knowlege <i>speculative,</i> as I may say; but no <i>experience!</i> How should she?—Knowlege by theory only is a vague uncertain
light: A Will o' the Wisp, which as often misleads the doubting mind, as puts it right.
            There are many things in the world, could a moralizer say, that would afford inexpressible pleasure to a reflecting mind, were it not for the mixture they come to us with. To be graver stil; I have seen parents (perhaps my own did so) who delighted in those very qualities in their children, while young, the natural consequences of which (too much indulged and encouraged) made them, as they grew up, the plague of their hearts.—To bring this home to my present purpose, I must tell thee, that I adore this charming creature for her vigilant prudence; but yet, I would not, methinks, wish her, by virtue of that prudence, which is, however, necessary to carry her above the <i>devices</i> of all the rest of the world, to be too wise for <i>mine.</i>
            My revenge, my <i>sworn</i> revenge, is nevertheless (adore her as I will) uppermost in my heart!—Miss Howe says, that my Love is an <i>Herodian</i> Love: By my soul, that girl's a witch!—I am half sorry to say, that I find a pleasure in playing the tyrant over what I love. Call it an ungenerous pleasure, if thou wilt: Softer hearts than mine know it. The women to a woman know it, and <i>shew</i> it too, whenever they are trusted with power. And why should it be thought strange, that I, who love them so dearly, and study them so much, should catch the infection of them?
I Will now give thee the substance of the dialogue that passed between the two women and the lady.
            Wonder not, that a pervrse wife makes a listening husband. The event, however, as thou wilt
find, justified the old observation, <i>That listeners seldom hear good of themselves.</i> Conscious of their own demerits (if I may guess by myself: There's ingenuity, Jack!), and fearful of censure, they seldom find themselves disappointed. There is something of sense, after all, in these proverbs, in these phrases, in this <i>wisdom of nations.</i>
            Mrs. Moore was to be the messenger; but Miss Rawlins began the dialogue.
            Your SPOUSE, Madam — [Devil!—Only to fish for a negative or affirmative declaration.]
               Cl.
               My <i>spouse,</i> Madam —
               Miss R.
               Mr. Lovelace, Madam, averrs, that you are married to him; and begs admittance, or your company in the dining-room, to talk upon the subject of the letters he left with you.
               Cl.
               He is a poor wicked wretch. Let me beg of you, Madam, to favour me with your company as often as possible while he is hereabouts, and I remain here.
               Miss R.
               I shall with pleasure attend you, Madam. But, methinks, I could wish you would <i>see</i> the gentleman, and hear what he has to say, on the subject of the letters.
               Cl.
               My case is a hard, a very hard one—I am quite bewilder'd!—I know not what to do!—I have not a friend in the world, that can or will help me!—Yet had none but friends till I knew <i>that man!</i>
               Miss R.
               The gentleman neither looks nor talks like a bad man.—Not a <i>very</i> bad man; as men go.
            As men go!—Poor Miss Rawlins, thought I!— And dost thou know, <i>how men go?</i>
               Cl.
               O Madam, you know him not!—He can put on the appearance of an angel of light; but has a black, a very black heart!—
            Poor I!—
               Miss R.
               I could not have thought it, truly!—But men are very deceitful now-a-days!
               <i>Now-a-days!</i> — a fool! — Have not her history-books told her, that they were always so?
               Mrs. Moore,
                  sighing.
I have found it so, I am sure, to my cost!—
            Who knows but in her time, poor goody Moore may have met with a Lovelace, or a Belford, or some such vile fellow?—My little hare-um-scare-um Beauty knows not what strange histories every woman living, who has had the least independence of will, could tell her, were such to be as communicative as she is. — But here's the thing; — I have given her cause enough of offence; but not enough to make her hold her tongue.
               Cl.
               As to the letters he has left with me, I know not what to say to <i>them:</i>—But am resolved never to have any thing to say to <i>him.</i>
               Miss R.
               If, Madam, I may be allowed to say so, I think you carry matters very far.
               Cl.
               Has he been making a bad cause a good one with you, Madam? — <i>That</i> he can do, with those who know him not. Indeed I heard him talking, tho' not what he said, and am indifferent about it. But what account does he give of himself?
            I was pleased to hear this. To arrest, to stop her passion, thought I, in the height of its career, is a charming presage.
            Then the busy Miss Rawlins fish'd on, to find out from her either a <i>confirmation</i> or <i>disavowal</i> of my story. Was Lord M. my uncle?—Did I court her at first with the allowance of her friends, her brother excepted? Had I a rencounter with that brother? Was she so persecuted in favour of a very disagreeable man, one Solmes, as to induce her to throw herself into my protection?
            None of these were denied. All the objections she <i>could</i> have made, were stfled, or kept in, by the consideration (as she mentioned) that she should stay there but a little while; and that her story was too
long. But Miss Rawlins would not be thus easily answered.
               Miss R.
               He says, Madam, that he could not prevail for marriage, till he had consented, under a solemn oath, to separate beds, while your family remain'd unreconciled.
               Cl.
               O the wretch!—What can be still in his head, to endeavour to pass these stories upon strangers!
            So no direct denial, thought I!—Admirable!— All will do by-and-by!
               Miss R.
               He has owned, that an accidental fire had frighten'd you very much on Wednesday night— And that—And that—And that—an accidental fire had frighten'd you—Very much frighten'd you—last Wednesday night!—
            Then, after a short pause—In short, He owned, That he had taken some innocent liberties, which might have led to a breach of the oath you had imposed upon him: And that This was the cause of your displeasure.
            I would have been glad to see how my charmer then look'd.—To be sure she was at a loss in her own mind, to justify herself for resenting so highly an offence so trifling. She hesitated—Did not presently speak—When she did, she wish'd, That she, Miss Rawlins, might never meet with any man who would take such innocent liberties with <i>her.</i>
            Miss Rawlins push'd further.
            Your case, to be sure, Madam, is very particular. But if the hope of a reconciliation with your own friends is made more distant by your leving him, give me leave to say, That 'tis pity—'tis pity—[I suppose the maiden then primm'd, fann'd, and blush'd; —'tis pity] the oath cannot be dispensed with; especially as he owns, he has not been so strict a liver.—
            I could have gone in, and kiss'd the girl.
               Cl.
               You have heard <i>his</i> story. Mine, as I told you before, is too long, and too melancholy; my disorder on seeing the wretch is too great; and my time here is too short, for me to enter upon it. And if he has any end to serve by his own vindication, in which I shall not be a <i>personal</i> sufferer, let him make himself appear as white as an angel; with all my heart.
            My love for her, and the excellent character I gave her, were then pleaded.
               Cl.
               Specious seducer!—Only tell me, if I cannot get away from him by some backway?
            How my heart then went <i>pit-a-pat!</i>
               Cl.
               Let me look out—[I heard the sash lifted up] Whither does that path lead to? Is there no possibility of getting to a coach?—Surely, he must deal with some fiend, or how could he have found me out?— Cannot I steal to some neighbouring house, where I may be concealed till I can get quite away? —You are good people!—I have not been always among such!—O help me, help me, ladies
(with a voice of impatience),
or I am ruined!
            Then pausing, Is that the way to Hendon? [pointing, I suppose]—Is Hendon a private place?—The Hamstead coach, I am told, will carry passengers thither.
               Mrs. Moore.
               I have an honest friend at Mill-hill [Devil fetch her, thought I]; where, if such be your determination, Madam, and if you think yourself in danger, you may be safe, I believe.
               Cl.
               Any-whither, if I can but escape from <i>this man!</i>—Whither does that path lead to, out yonder? —What is that town on the right-hand called?
               Mrs. M.
               Highgate, Madam.
               Miss R.
               On the side of the heath is a little village called North-end. A kinswoman of mine lives there. But her house is small. I am not sure she could accommodate such a lady.
            Devil take her too, thought I!—I imagined, that
I had made myself a better interest in these women. But the whole Sex love plotting; and plot-<i>ters,</i> too, Jack.
               Cl.
               A barn, an outhouse, a garret, will be a palace to me, if it will but a afford me a refuge from <i>this man!</i>—
            Her senses, thought I, are much livelier than <i>mine.</i> What a devil have I done, that she should be so <i>very</i> implacable!—I told thee, Belford, All I did: Was there any thing in it so <i>very</i> much amiss!—Such prospects of family-reconciliation before her too!— To be sure she is a very <i>sensible</i> lady!—
            She then espied my new servant walking under the window, and asked, If he were not one of mine?—
            Will. was on the look-out for old Grimes [So is the fellow called whom my beloved has dispatch'd to Miss Howe]. And being told, that the man she saw <i>was</i> my servant; I see, said she, that there is no escaping, unless you, Madam [To Miss Rawlins, I suppose], can befriend me till I can get farther. I have no doubt that that fellow is planted about the house to watch my steps. But the wicked wretch his master has no right to controul me. He shall not hinder me from going whither I please. I will raise the town upon him, if he molests me. Dear ladies, is there no back-door for me to get out at while you hold him in talk?
               Miss R.
               Give me leave to ask you, Madam; Is there no room to hope for accommodation? Had you not better see him? He certainly loves you dearly: He is a fine gentleman: You may exasperate him, and make matters more unhappy for yourself.
               Cl.
               O Mrs. Moore, O Miss Rawlins! you know not the man!—I wish not to see his face, nor to exchange another word with him as long as I live.
               Mrs. Moore.
               I don't find, Miss Rawlins, that the gentleman has misrepresented any-thing. You see, Madam
[To my Clarissa],
how respectful he is; not
to come in till permitted. He certainly loves you dearly. Pray, Madam, let him talk to you, as he wishes to do, on the subject of the letters.
            Very kind of Mrs. Moore. Mrs. Moore, thought I, is a very good woman.—I did not curse her then.
            Miss Rawlins said something; but so low, that I could not hear what it was. Thus it was answer'd.
               Cl.
               I am greatly distressed! I know not what to do!—But, Mrs. Moore, be so good as to give his letters to him—Here they are.—Be pleased to tell him, That I wish him and his aunt and cousin a happy meeting. He never can want excuses to them for what has happened, any more than pretences to those he would delude. Tell him, That he has ruined me in the opinion of my own friends. I am for that reason the less solicitous how I appear to his.
            Mrs. Moore then came to me; and being afraid, that something would pass mean time between the other two, which I should not like, I took the letters, and entered the room, and found them retired into the closet; my beloved whispering with an air of earnestness to Miss Rawlins, who was all attention.
            Her back was towards me; and Miss Rawlins, by pulling her sleeve, giving intimation of my being there, Can I have no retirement uninvaded, Sir, said she, with indignation, as if she was interrupted in some talk her heart was in?—What business have you here, or with me?—You have your letters, han't you?
               Lovel.
               I have, my dear; and let me beg of you to consider what you are about. I every moment expect Capt. Tomlinson here. Upon my soul, I do. He has promised to keep from your uncle what has happened.—But what will he think, if he finds you hold in this strange humour?
               Cl.
               I will endeavour, Sir, to have patience with you for a moment or two, while I ask you a few
questions before this lady and Mrs. Moore [who just then came in], both whom you have prejudiced in your favour by your specious stories:—Will you say, Sir, that we are married together? Lay your hand upon your heart, and answer me, Am I your wedded wife?
            I am gone too far, thought I, to give up for such a push as this—home-one as it is.
            My dearest soul! how can you put such a question?—Is it either for <i>your</i> honour or <i>my own,</i> that it should be doubted?—Surely, surely, Madam, you cannot have attended to the contents of Capt. Tomlinson's letter.
            She complained often of want of spirits throughout our whole contention, and of weakness of person and mind, from the fits she had been thrown into: But little reason had <i>she</i> for this complaint, as I thought, who was able to hold me to it, as she did. I own that I was excessively concern'd for her several times.
            You and I! <i>Vilest of men</i>—
            My name is Lovelace, Madam—
               <i>Therefore</i> it is, that I call you the <i>vilest of men.</i> [Was this pardonable, Jack?] <i>You</i> and <i>I</i> know the truth, the <i>whole</i> truth—I want not to clear up my reputation with these gentlewomen:—That is already lost with every one I had most reason to value: But let me have this <i>new</i> specimen of what you are capable of— Say, wretch (say, Lovelace, if thou hadst rather), Art thou really and truly my wedded hushand?—Say! answer without hesitation!—
            She trembled with impatient indignation; but had a wildness in her manner, which I took some advantage of, in order to parry this cursed thrust—And a cursed thrust it was; since, had I positively averr'd it, she never would have believed any-thing I had said: And had I owned that I was not married, I had destroyed my own plot, as well with the women as with her; and
could have had no pretence for pursuing her, or hindering her from going whithersoever she pleased. Not that I was asham'd to averr it, had it been consistent with policy. I would not have thee think me such a milksop neither.
               Lovel.
               My dearest Love, how wildly you talk! What would you <i>have</i> me answer? Is it necessary that I <i>should</i> answer? May I not re-appeal this to your own breast, as well as to Captain Tomlinson's treaty and letter? You know yourself how matters stand between us.—And Captain Tomlinson—
               Cl.
               O wretch! Is this an answer to my question? Say, Are we married, or are we not?
               Lovel.
               What <i>makes a marriage,</i> we all know. If it be the union of two hearts, [There was a turn, Jack!] to my utmost grief, I must say we are <i>not</i>; since now I see you hate me. If it be the completion of marriage, to my confusion and regret, I must own we are <i>not.</i> But, my dear, will you be pleased to consider what answer half a dozen people whence you came, could give to your question? And do not now, in <i>the disorder of your mind,</i> and in the height of passion, bring into question before these gentlewomen a point you have acknowleged before those who know us better.
            I would have whisper'd her about the treaty with her uncle, and the contents of the Captain's letter; But, retreating, and with a rejecting hand, Keep thy distance, <i>man,</i> cry'd the dear insolent—To thy own heart I appeal, since thou evadest me thus pitifully!—I own no marriage with thee! Bear witness, ladies, I do not. And cease to torment me, cease to follow me. Surely, surely, faulty as I have been, I have not deserved to be <i>thus</i> persecuted!—I resume, therefore, my former language: You have no right to pursue me: You <i>know</i> you have not: Begone, then; and leave me to make the best of my hard lot. O my dear cruel papa! said she, in a violent
fit of grief (falling upon her knees, and clasping her uplifted hands together), thy heavy curse is completed upon thy devoted daughter! I am <i>punished,</i> dreadfully punished, <i>by the very wretch in whom I had placed my wicked confidence!</i>
            By my soul, Belford, the little witch with her words, but more by her manner, moved <i>me!</i> Wonder not then, that her action, her grief, her tears, set the women into the like compassionate manifestations.
            Had not I a cursed task of it?
            The two women withdrew to the further end of the room, and whisper'd, A strange case! There is no frenzy here—I just heard said.
            The charming creature threw her handkerchief over her head and neck, continuing kneeling, her back towards me, and her face hid upon a chair, and repeatedly sobb'd with grief and passion.
            I took this opportunity to step to the women, to keep them steady.
            You see, ladies (whispering), what an unhappy man I am! You see what a spirit this dear creature has!—All, all owing to her implacable relations, and to her father's curse.—A curse upon them all; they have turn'd the head of the most charming woman in the world.
            Ah! Sir, Sir, replied Miss Rawlins, whatever be the fault of her relations, all is not as it should be between you and her. 'Tis plain she does not think herself married: 'Tis <i>plain</i> she does not: And if you have any value for the poor lady, and would not totally deprive her of her senses, you had better withdraw, and leave to time and cooler consideration the event in your favour.
            She will compel me to this at last, I fear, Miss Rawlins; I <i>fear</i> she will; and then we are both undone: For I cannot live without her; she knows it too well:—And she has not a friend will look upon
her: This also she knows. Our marriage, when her uncle's friend comes, will be proved incontestably. But I am ashamed to think I have given her room to believe it no marriage: That's what she harps upon!
            Well, 'tis a strange case, a very strange one, said Miss Rawlins; and was going to say further, when the angry Beauty, coming towards the door, said, Mrs. Moore, I beg a word with you. And they both stepped into the dining-room.
            I saw her, just before, put a parcel into her pocket, and followed them out, for fear she should slip away; and stepping to the stairs, that she <i>might not go by me,</i> Will. cry'd I, aloud (tho' I knew he was not near)—Pray, child, to a maid, who answered, call either of my servants to me.
            She then came up to me, with a wrathful countenance: Do you call your servant, Sir, to hinder me, between you, from going whither I please?
            Don't, my dearest life, misinterpret every thing I do. Can you think me so mean and so unworthy, as to employ a servant to constrain you?—I call him to send to the public houses, or inns in this town, to inquire after Captain Tomlinson, who may have alighted at some one of them, and be now, perhaps, needlesly adjusting his dress; and I would have him come, were he to be without cloaths, God forgive me! for I am stabb'd to the heart by your cruelty.
            Answer was returned, that neither of my servants was in the way.
            Not in the way, said I!—Whither can the dogs be gone?
            O Sir! with a scornful air; Not far, I'll warrant. One of them was under the window just now; according to order, I suppose, to watch my steps—But I will do what I please, and go whither I please; and that to your face.
                 God forbid, that I should hinder you in any thing that you may do with safety to yourself!
            Now I verily believe, that her design was, to slip out in pursuance of the closet-whispering between her and Miss Rawlins; perhaps to Miss Rawlins's house.
            She then stept back to Mrs. Moore, and gave her something, which proved to be a diamond ring, and desired her, not whisperingly, but with an air of defiance to me, that That might be a pledge for her, till she defray'd her demands; which she should soon find means to do; having no more money about her, than she might have occasion for, before she came to an acquaintance's.
            Mrs. Moore would have declined taking it; but she would not be deny'd; and then, wiping her eyes, she put on her gloves—Nobody has a right to stop me, said she!—I <i>will</i> go!—Who should I be afraid of?—Her very question, charming creature! testifying her fear.
            I beg pardon, Madam (turning to Mrs. Moore, and courtesying), for the trouble I have given you.—I beg pardon, Madam, to Miss Rawlins (courtesying likewise to her)—You may both hear of me in a happier hour, if such a one falls to my lot—And God bless you both!—struggling with her tears till she sobb'd—and away was tripping.
            I stepped to the door: I put it to; and setting my back against it, took her struggling hand—My dearest life! My angel! said I, why will you thus distress me? —Is this the forgiveness which you so solemnly promised?—
            Unhand me, Sir!—You have no business with me! You have no right over me! You <i>know</i> you have not.
            But whither, whither, my dearest love, would you go?—Think you not that I will follow you, were it to the world's end?—Whither would you go?
            Well do you ask me, Whither I would go, who
have been the occasion, that I have not a friend left! —But God, who knows my innocence, and my up
               ight intentions, will not wholly abandon me, when I am out of your power—But while in it, I cannot expect a gleam of the divine grace or favour to reach me.
            How severe is this!—How shockingly severe!— Out of <i>your</i> presence, my angry fair one! I can neither hope for the one nor the other. As my cousin Montague, in the letter you have read, observes, You are my pole-star, and my guide; and if ever I am to be happy, either here or hereafter, it must be in and by you.
            She would then have urged me from the door. But respectfully opposing her, Begone, man! Begone, Mr. Lovelace, said she.—Stop not my way.—If you would not that I should attempt the window, give me passage by the door; for, once more, you have no right to detain me!
            Your resentments, my dearest life, I will own to be well-grounded—I will acknowlege, that I have been all in fault. On my knee (and down I dropt) I ask your pardon. And can you refuse to ratify your own <i>promise?</i>—Look forward to the happy prospect before us. See you not my Lord M. and Lady Sarah longing to bless <i>you,</i> for blessing me, and their whole family? Can you take no pleasure in the promised visit of Lady Betty and my cousin Montague? And in the protection <i>they</i> offer you, if you are dissatisfied with <i>mine?</i>—Have you no wish to see your uncle's friend?—Stay only till Captain Tomlinson comes.—Receive from him the news of your uncle's compliance with the wishes of both.
            She seem'd altogether distressed; was ready to sink; and forced to lean against the wainscot, as I kneeled at her feet. A stream of tears at last burst from her less indignant ees—Good heaven, said she, lifting up her lovely face, and clasped hands, what is
at last to be my destiny!—Deliver me from this dangerous man; and direct me!—I know not what I do; what I can do; nor what I ought to do!—
            The women, as I had owned our marriage to be but half completed, heard nothing in this whole scene to contradict (not flagrantly to contradict) what I had asserted: They believed they saw in her returning temper, and stagger'd resolution, a love for me, which her indignation had before suppressed; and they joined to persuade her to tarry till the Captain came, and to hear his proposals; representing the dangers to which she would be exposed; the fatigues she might endure; a lady of her appearance, unguarded, unprotected. On the other hand, they dwelt upon my declared contrition, and on my promises: For the performance of which they offered to be bound.—So much had my kneeling humility affected them.
            Women, Jack, tacitly acknowlege the inferiority of their own sex, in the pride they take to behold a kneeling lover at their feet.
            She turned from me, and threw herself into a chair.
            I arose, and approached her with reverence—My dearest creature, said I—and was proceeding—But, with a face glowing with conscious dignity, she interrupted me — Ungenerous, ungrateful Lovelace! — You know not the value of the heart you have insulted! Nor can you conceive how much my soul despises your meanness. But meanness must ever be the portion of the man, who can act vilely!—
            The women believing we were likely to be on better terms, retired. The dear perverse opposed their going; but they saw I was desirous of their absence. And when they had withdrawn, I once more threw myself at her feet, and acknowleged my offences; implored her forgiveness for this one time, and promised the exactest circumspection for the future.
                 It was impossible for her, she said, to keep her <i>memory,</i> and <i>forgive</i> me. What hadst thou <i>seen</i> in the conduct of Clarissa Harlowe, that should encourage such an insult upon her, as thou didst dare to make? How meanly must thou think of <i>her,</i> that <i>thou</i> couldst presume to be so guilty, and expect <i>her</i> to be so weak, as to forgive thee?—
            I besought her to let me go over with her Captain Tomlinson's letter. I was sure it was impossible she could have given it the requisite attention.
            I <i>have</i> given it the requisite attention, said she; and the other letters too. So that what I say, is upon deliberation. And what have I to fear from my brother and sister?—They can but <i>complete</i> the ruin of my fortunes with my father and uncles. Let them, and welcome. You, Sir, I thank you, have lowered my fortunes: But, I bless God, that my mind is not sunk with my fortunes. It is, on the contrary, raised above Fortune, and above You; and for half a word, they shall have the estate they have envied me for, and an acquittal of all expectations from my family, that may make them uneasy.
            I lifted up my hands and eyes in silent admiration of her!
            My brother, Sir, may think me ruined. To the praise of <i>your</i> character, by whom I have been seduced from them, he may think it it impossible to be with <i>you,</i> and be innocent. You have but too well justified their harshest censures in every part of your conduct. But I will, now that I have escaped from you, and that I am out of the reach of your mysterious devices, wrap myself up in my own innocence (and then she passionately folded her arms about herself), and leave to time, and to my future circumspection, the re-establishment of my character.— Leave me then, Sir—Pursue me not!—
            Good God! interrupting her—And all this, for what?—Hand I <i>not</i> yielded to your intreaties (Forgive
me, Madam), you could not have carried farther your resentments —
            Wretch!—Was it not crime enough to give <i>occasion</i> for those <i>intreaties?</i> Wouldst thou make a merit to me, that thou didst not utterly ruin <i>her</i> whom thou oughtest to have protected? — Begone, man! turning from me, her face crimson'd over with passion:—See me no more!—I cannot bear thee in my sight!—
            Dearest, dearest creature!—
            If I forgive thee, Lovelace—And there she stopp'd. To endeavour, proceeded she, to endeavour, to terrify a poor creature by <i>premeditation,</i> by <i>low contrivance,</i> by <i>cries of fire</i>—A poor creature who had consented to take a wretched chance with thee for life!
            For Heaven's sake—offering to take her repulsing hand, as she was flying from me towards the closet—
            What hast thou to do, to plead the sake of Heaven in thy favour, O darkest of human minds!
            Then turning from me, wiping her eyes, and again turning towards me, but her sweet face half-aside, What difficulties hast thou involved me in!—Thou that hadst a plain path before thee, after thou hadst betray'd me into thy power—At once my mind takes in the whole of thy crooked behaviour; and if thou thinkest of Clarissa Harlowe as her proud heart tells her thou oughtest to think of her, thou wilt seek thy fortunes elsewhere. How often hast thou provoked me to tell thee, that my soul is above thee?
            For God's sake, Madam, for a soul's sake, which it is in your power to save from perdition, forgive me the past offence. I am the greatest villain on earth, if it was a premeditated one. Yet I presume not to excuse myself. On your mercy I throw myself. I will not offer at any plea, but that of penitence. See but Captain Tomlinson. See but my aunt and cousin: let <i>them</i> plead for me; let <i>them</i> be guaranties for m honour.
                 If Captain Tomlinson come while I stay here, I may see <i>him.</i> But as for <i>you,</i> Sir—
            Dearest creature! let me beg of you not to aggravate my offence to the Captain, when he comes. Let me beg of you—
            What askest thou?—Is it not, that I shall be of party against myself?—That I shall palliate—
            Do not charge me, Madam, interrupted I, with villainous premeditation!—Do not give such a construction to my offence, as may weaken your uncle's opinion—as may strengthen your brother's—
            She flung from me to the further end of the room; <i>She could go no further</i>—And just then Mrs. Moore came up, and told her, that dinner was ready; and that she had prevailed upon Miss Rawlins to give her her company.
            You must excuse me, Mrs. Moore, said she. Miss Rawlins I hope also will—But I cannot eat. I cannot go down. As for <i>you,</i> Sir, I suppose you will think it right to depart hence; at least till the gentleman comes whom you expect.
            I respectfully withdrew into the next room, that Mrs. Moore might acquaint her [I durst not myself], that I was her lodger and boarder, as (whisperingly) I desired she would: And meeting Miss Rawlins in the passage, Dearest Miss Rawlins, said I, stand my friend: Join with Mrs. Moore to pacify my spouse, if she has any new fights upon my having taken lodgings, and intending to board here. I hope she will have more generosity than to think of hindering a gentlewoman from letting her lodgings.
            I suppose Mrs. Moore (whom I left with my fair one) had apprised her of this before Miss Rawlins went in; for I heard her say, while I with-held Miss Rawlins—
"No, indeed: He is much mistaken— Surely he does not think I will."
            They both expostulated with her, as I could gather from bits and scraps of what they said; for they
spoke so low, that I could not hear any distinct sentence, but from the fair perverse, whose anger made her louder. And to this purpose I heard her deliver herself in answer to different parts of their talk to her: —
"Good Mrs. Moore, dear Miss Rawlins, press me no further—I cannot sit down at table with him!"
            They said something, as I suppose in my behalf—
"O the insinuating wretch!—What defence have I against a man, who, go where I will, can turn every one, even of the virtuous of my sex, in his favour?"
            After something else said, which I heard not distinctly,—
"This is execrable cunning!—Were you to know his wicked heart, he is not without hope of engaging you two good persons to second him in the vilest of his machinations."
            How came she (thought I at the instant) by al this penetration? My devil surely does not play m booty. If I thought he did, I would marry, and live honest, to be even with him.
            I suppose then, they urged the plea which I hinted to Miss Rawlins at going in, that she would not be Mrs. Moore's hindrance; for thus she expressed herself—
"He will no doubt pay you your own price. You need not question his liberality. But one house cannot hold us. Why, if it would, did I fly from him, to seek refuge among strangers?"
            Then, in answer to somewhat else they pleaded—
"Tis a mistake, Madam; I am <i>not</i> reconciled to him. I will believe nothing he says. Has he no given you a flagrant specimen of what a man he is, and of what he is capable, by the disguises you saw him in? My story is too long, and my stay here will be but short; or I could convince you, tha my resentments against him are but too wel founded."
            I suppose then, that they pleaded for <i>her</i> leave, for <i>my</i> dining with them: For she said;
"I have nothing
to say to that—It is your own house, Mrs. Moore— It is your own table —You may admit whom you please to it—Only leave me at my liberty to choose my company."
            Then in answer, as I suppose, to their offer of sending her up a plate—
"A bit of bread, if you please, and a glass of water: That's all I can swallow at present. I am really very much discomposed. Saw you not how bad I was?—Indignation only could have supported my spirits!—"
            'I have no objection to his dining with you, Madam;' added she, in reply, I suppose, to a farther question of the same nature—
"But I will not stay a night in the house, where he lodges, if I can help it."
            I presume Miss Rawlins had told her, that she would not stay dinner—for she said,
"Let me not deprive Mrs. Moore of your company, Miss Rawlins. You will not be displeased with his talk. He can have no design upon you."
            Then I suppose they pleaded what I might say behind her back, to make my own story good;—
"I care not what he says, or what he thinks of me. Repentance and amendment are all the harm I wish him, whatever becomes of me!"
            By her accent, she wept when she spoke these last words.
            They came out both of them wiping their eyes; and would have persuaded me to relinquish the lodgings, and to depart till her uncle's friend came. But I knew better. I did not care to trust the devil, well as she and Miss Howe suppose me to be acquainted with him, for finding her out again, if once more she escaped me.
            What I am most afraid of, is, that she will throw herself among her own relations; and if she does, I am confident they will not be able to withstand her affecting eloquence. But yet, as thou'lt see, the Captain's letter to me is admirably calculated to obviate
my apprehensions on this score; particularly in that passage, where it is said, that her uncle thinks not himself at liberty to correspond directly with her, or to receive applications from her—<i>But thro' Captain Tomlinson,</i> as is strongly imply'd.
            I must own (notwithstanding the revenge I have so solemnly vowed) that I would very fain have made for her a merit with myself <i>in her returning favour,</i> and owed as little as possible to the mediation of Captain Tomlinson. My pride was concerned in this. And this was one of my reasons for not bringing him with me. Another was; That, if I were obliged to have recourse to his assistance, I should be better able (by visiting her without him) to direct him what to say or to do, as I should find out the turn of her humour.
            I was, however, glad at my heart, that Mrs. Moore came up so seasonably with notice, that dinner was ready. The fair fugitive was all in Alt. She had the game in her own hands; and by giving me so good an excuse for withdrawing, I had time to strengthen myself; the Captain had time to come; and the Lady to cool. Shakespeare advises well.
               Oppose not rage, while rage is in its force;
               But give it way awhile, and let it waste.
               The rising deluge is not stopt with dams;
               Those it o'erbears, and drowns the hope of harvest.
               But, wisely manag'd, its divided strength
               Is sluic'd in channels, and securely drain'd:
               And when its force is spent, and unsupply'd,
               The residue with mounds may be restrain'd,
               And dry-shd we may pass the naked ford.
            I went down with the women to dinner. Mrs. Moore sent her fair boarder up a plate; but she only eat a little bit of bread, and drank a glass of water.  doubted not but she would keep her word, when it
was once gone out. Is not she an Harlowe?—She seems to be inuring herself to hardships, which, at the worst, she can never know; since, tho' she should ultimately refuse to be obliged to me, or, to express myself more suitably to my own heart, to <i>oblige me,</i> every one who sees her must befriend her.
            But let me ask thee, Belford, Art thou not solicitous for me, in relation to the contents of the letter which the angry beauty has written and dispatch'd away by man and horse; and for what may be Miss Howe's answer to it? Art thou not ready to inquire, Whether it be not likely that Miss Howe, when she knows of her saucy friend's flight, will be concern'd about her letter, which she must know could not be at Wilson's till after that flight; and so, probably, would fall into my hands?—
            All these things, as thou'lt see in the sequel, are provided for with as much contrivance as human foresight can admit.
            I have already told thee, that Will. is upon the look-out for old Grimes.—Old Grimes is, it seems, a gossiping, sottish rascal; and if Will. can but light of him, I'll answer for the consequence: For has not Will. been my servant upwards of seven years?
WE had at dinner, besides Miss Rawlins, a young widow-niece of Mrs. Moore, who is come to stay a month with her aunt—<i>Bevis</i> her name; very forward, very lively, and a great admirer of <i>me,</i> I assure you; — hanging smirkingly upon all I said; and prepared to approve of every word before I spoke: And who, by the time we had half-dined (by the help of what she had collected before), was as
much acquainted with our story, as either of the other two.
            As it behoved me to prepare them in my favour against whatever might come from Miss Howe, I improved upon the hint I had thrown out above-stairs against that mischief-making Lady. I represented her to be an arrogant creature, revengeful, artful, enterprising, and one who, had she been a man, would have sworn and curs'd, and committed rapes, and play'd the devil, as far as I knew [and I have no doubt of it, Jack]: but who, nevertheless, by advantage of a female education, and pride, and insolence, I believed was <i>personally</i> virtuous.
            Mrs. Bevis allowed, that there was a <i>vast deal</i> in education—and in <i>pride</i> too, she said. While Miss Rawlins came with a prudish God forbid, that virtue should be owing to education only! However, I declared, that Miss Howe was a subtle contriver of mischief; one who had always been <i>my</i> enemy: her motives I knew not: but, despising the man whom her mother was desirous she should have, one Hickman; altho' I did not directly averr, that she would rather have had me; yet they all immediately imagined, that <i>that</i> was the ground of her animosity to me, and of her envy to my beloved; and it was pity, they said, that so fine a young Lady did not see thro' such a pretended friend.
            And yet nobody (added I) has more reason than she to know by <i>experience</i> the force of a hatred founded in envy; as I hinted to <i>you</i> above, Mrs. Moore, and to <i>you,</i> Miss Rawlins, in the case of her sister Arabella.
            I had compliments made to my person and talents on this occasion; which gave me a singular opportunity of displaying my modesty, by disclaiming the merit of them, with a <i>No, indeed!—I should be very vain, Ladies, if I thought so.</i> While thus abasing
myself, and exalting Miss Howe, I got their opinion both for modesty and generosity; and had all the graces which I disclaimed, thrown in upon me, besides.
            In short, they even oppressed that modesty, which (to speak modestly of myself) their praises <i>created,</i> by disbelieving all I said against myself.
            And, truly, I must needs say, they have almost persuaded even me myself, that Miss Howe is actually in love with me. I have often been willing to hope this. And who knows but she may? The Captain and I have agreed, that it shall be so insinuated <i>occasionally</i>—And what's thy opinion, Jack? She certainly hates Hickman: And girls who are <i>disengaged</i> seldom <i>hate,</i> tho' they may not <i>love:</i> And if she had rather have <i>another,</i> why not that <i>other</i> ME? For am I not a smart fellow, and a rake? And do not your sprightly Ladies love your smart fellows, and your rakes? And where is the wonder, that the man who could engage the affections of Miss Harlowe, should engage those of a Lady (with her 
               <i>Alas's</i>) who would be honoured in being deemed her second?
            Nor accuse thou me of SINGULAR vanity in this presumption, Belford. Wert thou to know the secret vanity that lurks in the hearts of those who <i>disguise</i> or <i>cloak it best,</i> thou wouldst find great reason to acquit, at least to allow for, <i>me:</i> since it is generally the <i>conscious over-fulness of conceit,</i> that makes the hypocrite most upon his guard to conceal it.— Yet with these fellows, proudly-humble as they are, it will break out sometimes in spite of thier cloaks, tho' but in self-denying, compliment-begging self-degradation.
            But now I have appealed this matter to thee, let
me use another argument in favour of my observation, that the Ladies generally prefer a rake to a sober man; and of my presumption upon it, that Miss Howe is in love with me: It is this:—Common fame says, That Hickman is a very virtuous, a very innocent fellow—a <i>male-virgin,</i> I warrant!—An odd dog I always thought him.—Now women, Jack, like not novices. They are pleased with a Love of the Sex that is founded in the knowlege of it. Reason good. Novices expect more than they can possibly find in the commerce with them. The man who knows them, yet has <i>ardors</i> for them, to borrow a word from Miss Howe, tho' those ardors are generally owing more to the devil <i>within</i> him, than to the witch <i>without</i> him, is the man who makes them the highest and most grateful compliment. He knows what to expect, and with what to be satisfied.
            Then the merit of a woman, in some cases, must be <i>ignorance,</i> whether <i>real</i> or <i>pretended.</i> The Man, in <i>these</i> cases, must be an <i>adept.</i> Will it then be wondered at, that a woman prefers a libertine to a novice?—While she expects in the one the confidence <i>she</i> wants; she considers the other and herself as two parallel lines; which, tho' they run side by side, can never meet.
            Yet in this the Sex is generally mistaken too; for these sheepish fellows are fly.—I myself was modest once; and this, as I have elsewhere hinted to thee, has better enabled me to judge of both.—But to proceed with my narrative:
            Having thus prepared every-one against any letter should come from Miss Howe, and against my beloved's messenger returns, I thought it proper to conclude that subject with a hint, that my spouse could not bear to have any-thing said <i>that reflected upon
Miss Howe</i>; and, with a deep sigh, added, that I had been made very unhappy more than once by the ill-will of Ladies, whom I had never offended.
            The widow Bevis believed, that might very easily be.
            These hints within-doors, joined with others to Will. both without and within (for I intend he shall fall in love with widow Moore's maid, and have saved one hundred pounds in my service, at least), will be great helps, as things may happen.
 WE had hardly dined, when my coachman, who kept a look-out for Captain Tomlinson, as Will. did for old Grimes, conducted hither that worthy gentleman, attended by one servant, <i>both</i> on horseback. He alighted. I went out to meet him at the door.
            Thou knowest his solemn appearance, and unblushing freedom; and yet canst not imagine what a dignity the rascal assumed, nor how respectful to him I was.
            I led him into the parlour, and presented him to the women, and them to him.—I thought it highly imported me (as they might still have some diffidences about our marriage, from my fair-one's home push'd questions on that head) to convince them intirely of the truth of all I had asserted. And how could I do this better, than by dialoguing with him before them a little?
            Dear Captain, I thought you long; for I have had a terrible conflict with my spouse.
               Capt.
               I am sorry that I am later than my intention—My account with my banker—[There's a dog,
Jack!] took me up longer time to adjust than I had foreseen
(all the time pulling down and stroking his ruffles):
for there was a small difference between us— only twenty pounds, indeed, which I had taken no account of. The rascal has not seen twenty pounds of his own these ten years.
            Then had we between us the characters of the Harlowe family: I railing against them all; the Captain taking his dear friend Mr. John Harlowe's part; with a <i>Not so fast!—Not so fast, young gentleman!</i>— and the like free assumptions.
            He accounted for <i>their</i> animosity by <i>my</i> defiances: No good family, having such a charming daughter, would care to be <i>defied,</i> instead of <i>courted:</i> He <i>must</i> speak his mind: Never was a double-tongu'd man.— He appealed to the Ladies, if he were not right.
            He got them of his side.
            The correction I had given the brother, he told me, must have aggravated matters.
            How valiant this made me look to the women!— The Sex love us mettled fellows at their hearts.
            Be that as it would, I should never love any of the family but my spouse; and, wanting nothing from them, would not, but for <i>her</i> sake, have gone so far as I <i>had</i> gone towards a reconciliation.
            This was very good of me; Mrs. Moore said.
            Very good indeed; Miss Rawlins.
            Good!—It is <i>more</i> than good; it is very generous; said the widow.
               Capt.
               Why, so it is, I must needs say: For I am sensible, that Mr. Lovelace has been rudely treated by them all—More rudely, than it could have been imagined a man of his <i>quality</i> and <i>spirit</i> would have put up with. But then, Sir
(turning to me),
I think you are amply rewarded in such a Lady; and that you ought to forgive the father for the daughter's sake.
               Mrs. M.
               Indeed so I think.
               Miss R.
               So must every-one think, who has seen the Lady.
               Widow B.
               A fine Lady! to be sure! But she has a violent spirit; and some very odd humours too, by what I have heard. The value of good husbands is not known till they are lost!
            Her conscience then drew a sigh from her.
               Lovel.
               Nobody must reflect upon my angel.—An angel she is.—Some little blemishes, indeed, as to her over-hasty spirit, and as to her unforgiving temper. But this she has from the Harlowes; instigated too by <i>that</i> Miss Howe.—But her innumerable excellencies are all her own.
               Capt.
               Ay, talk of spirit, There's a spirit, now you have named Miss Howe! [And so I led him to confirm all I had said of that vixen.] Yet she was to be pitied too, looking with meaning at me.
            As I have already hinted, I had before agreed with him to impute secret love <i>occasionally</i> to Miss Howe, as the best means to invalidate all that might come from her in my disfavour.
               Capt.
               Mr. Lovelace, but that I know your modesty, or <i>you</i> could give a reason—
               Lovel.
               looking down, and very modest—I can't think so, Captain—But let us call another cause.
            Every woman present could look me in the face, so bashful was I.
               Capt.
               Well, but, as to our <i>present</i> situation—Only it mayn't be proper— looking upon me, and round upon the women.
               Lovel.
               O Captain, you may say any-thing before this company—Only, Andrew, to my new servant, who attended us at table, do you withdraw: This good girl
(looking at the maid-servant)
will help us to all we want.
            Away went Andrew: He wanted not his cue; and
the maid seemed highly pleased at my honour's preference of her.
               Capt.
               As to our <i>present</i> situation, I say, Mr. Lovelace—Why, Sir, we shall be all <i>untwisted,</i> let me tell you, if my friend Mr. John Harlowe were to know what <i>that</i> is: He would as much question the truth of your being married, as the rest of the family do.
            Here the women perked up their ears; and were all silent attention.
               Capt.
                  <i>I asked you before</i> for particulars, Mr. Lovelace: but you <i>declined giving them.</i>—Indeed it may not be <i>proper</i> for me to be acquainted with them.— But I must own, that it is past my comprehension, that a wife can resent any-thing a husband can do (that is not a breach of the peace), so far as to think herself justified for <i>eloping</i> from him.
               Lovel.
               Captain Tomlinson—Sir—I do assure you, that I shall be offended—I shall be extremely concerned—if I hear that word mention'd again—
               Capt.
               Your nicety, and your love, Sir, may make you take offence—But it is my way to call everything by its proper name, let who will be offended—
            Thou canst not imagine, Belford, how brave, and how independent, the rascal look'd.
               Capt.
               When, <i>young Gentleman,</i> you shall think proper to give us particulars, we will find a word that shall please you better, for this rash act in so admirable a Lady—You see, Sir, that, being the representative of my dear friend Mr. John Harlowe, I speak as freely as I suppose <i>he</i> would do, if present. But you blush, Sir—I beg your pardon, Mr. Lovelace: It becomes not a modest man to pry into those secrets, which a modest man cannot reveal.
            I did not blush, Jack; but denied not the compliment, and looked down: the women seem'd delighted with my modesty: but the widow Bevis was
more inclined to laugh at me, than praise me for it.
               Capt.
               Whatever be the cause of this step (I will not again, Sir, call it <i>elopement,</i> since that harsh word wounds your tenderness), 
I cannot but express my surprize upon it, when I recollect the affectionate behaviour, which I was witness to between you, when I attended you last. <i>Over-love,</i> Sir, I think you once mentioned—but <i>Over-love</i>
                  (smiling),
give me leave to say, Sir, is an odd cause of quarrel. — Few Ladies—
               Lovel.
               Dear Captain! And I tried to blush.
            The women also tried; and, being more used to it, succeeded better.—Mrs. Bevis, indeed, has a red-hot countenance, and always blushes.
               Miss R.
               It signifies nothing to mince the matter: but the Lady above as good as denies her marriage. You <i>know,</i> Sir, that she does; turning to me.
               Capt.
               Denies her marriage! Heavens! how then have I imposed upon my dear friend Mr. John Harlowe!
               Lovel.
               Poor dear!—But let not her <i>veracity</i> be called in question. She would not be guilty of a wilful untruth for the world.
            Then I had all their praises again.
               Lovel.
               Dear creature!—she thinks she has reason for her denial. You know, Mrs. Moore; you know, Miss Rawlins; what I owned to you above, as to my vow—
            I look'd down, and, as once before, turned round my diamond ring.
            Mrs. Moore looked awry; and with a leer at Miss Rawlins, as to her partner in the hinted-at reference.
            Miss Rawlins look'd down as well as I; her eyelids half-closed, as if mumbling a Pater-noster, meditating
her snuff-box, the distance between her nose and chin lengthened by a close-shut mouth.
            She put me in mind of the pious Mrs. Fetherstone at Oxford, whom I pointed out to thee once, among other grotesque figures, at St. Mary's church, where we went to take a view of her two sisters: Her eyes shut, not daring to trust her heart with them open; and but just half-rearing the lids, to see who the next-comer was; and falling them again, when her curiosity was satisfied.
            The widow Bevis gazed, as if on the hunt for a secret.
            The Captain looked archly, as if half in possession of one.
            Mrs. Moore at last broke the bashful silence. Mrs. Lovelace's behaviour, she said, could be no otherwise so well accounted-for, as by the ill-offices of <i>that</i> Miss Howe; and by the severity of her relations; which might but too probably have affected her head a little at times: Adding, that it was very generous in me to give way to the storm, when it was up, rather than to exasperate at such a time.
            But let me tell you, Sirs, said the widow Bevis, that is not what one husband in a thousand would have done.
            I desired, that <i>no part of this conversation might be hinted to my spouse</i>; and looked still more bashfully. Her great fault, I must own, was over-delicacy.
            The Captain leered round him; and said, He believed he could guess from the hints I had given him in town (of my <i>over-love</i>), and from what had now passed, that we had not consummated our marriage.
            O Jack! how sheepishly then looked, or endeavoured to look, thy friend! how primly Goody Moore! how affectedly Miss Rawlins!—while the honest widow Bevis gazed around her fearless; and
tho' only simpering with her mouth, her eyes laugh'd out-right, and seem'd to challenge a laugh from every eye in the company.
            He observ'd, that I was a phoenix of a man, if so; and he could not but hope, that all matters would be happily accommodated in a day or two; and that then he should have the pleasure to averr to her uncle, that he was present, as he might say, on our wedding-day.
            The women seem'd all to join in the same hope.
            Ah, Captain! ah, Ladies!—how happy should I be, if I could bring my dear spouse to be of the same mind!
            It would be a very happy conclusion of a very knotty affair, said widow Bevis; and I see not why we may not make this very night a merry one.
            The Captain superciliously smiled at me. He saw plainly enough, he said, that we had been at <i>childrens play</i> hitherto. A man of my character must have a prodigious value for his Lady, who could give way to such a caprice as This. But one thing he would venture to tell me; and that was This—That, however desirous young skittish Ladies might be to have their way in this particular, it was a very bad setting-out for the man; as it gave his bride a very high proof of the power she had over him: And he would engage, that no woman, <i>thus</i> humoured, ever valued the man the more for it; but very much the contrary—And there were <i>reasons to be given why she should not.</i>
            Well, well, Captain, no more of this subject before the Ladies.—<i>One</i> feels (in a bashful <i>try-to-blush</i> manner, shrugging my shoulders), that <i>one</i> is <i>so</i> ridiculous—I have been punish'd enough for my tender folly.
            Miss Rawlins had taken her fan, and would needs
hide her face behind it: I suppose because her blush was not quite ready.
            Mrs. Moore hemm'd, and look'd down, and by that, gave hers over.
            While the jolly widow, laughing out, praised the Captain, as one of Hudibras's metaphysicians, repeating,
                  He knew what's what, and that's as high
                  As metaphysic wit can fly.
            This made Miss Rawlins blush indeed:—Fie, fie, Mrs. Bevis! cry'd she, unwilling I suppose, to be thought absolutely ignorant.
            Upon the whole, I began to think, that I had not made a bad exchange of our professing mother, for the un-professing Mrs. Moore. And indeed the women and I, and my Beloved too, all mean the same thing: We only differ about the manner of coming at the proposed end.
IT was now high time to acquaint my spouse, that Captain Tomlinson was come. And the rather, as the maid told us, that the lady had asked her, If such a gentleman (describing him) was not in the parlour?
            Mrs. Moore went up, and requested, in my name, that she would give us audience.
            But she return'd, with a desire, that Captain Tomlinson would excuse her for the present. She was very ill. Her spirits were too weak to enter into conversation with him; and she must lie down.
            I was vexed, and, at first, extremely disconcerted.
The Captain was vexed too. And my concern, thou mayst believe, was the greater on his account.
            She had been very much fatigued, I own. Her fits in the morning must have weaken'd her: And she had carried her resentment so high, that it was the less wonder she should find herself low, when her raised spirits had subsided. <i>Very</i> low, I may say; if sinkings are proportioned to risings; for she had been lifted up above the standard of a common mortal.
            The Captain, however, sent up in his own name, that if he could be admitted to drink one dish of tea with her, he should take it for a favour; and would go to town, and dispatch some necessary business, if possible, to leave his morning free to attend her.
            But she pleaded a violent head-ach; and Mrs. Moore confirm'd the plea to be just.
            I would have had the Captain lodge there that night, as well in compliment to him, as introductory to my intention of entering my self upon my new-taken apartment. But his hours were of too much importance to him to stay the evening.
            It was indeed very inconvenient for him, he said, to return in the morning; but he was willing to do all in his power to heal this breach, and that as well for the sakes of me and my lady, as for that of his dear friend Mr. John Harlowe; who must not know how far this misunderstanding had gone. He would therefore only drink one dish of tea with the ladies and me.
            And accordingly, after he had done so, and I had had a little private conversation with him, he hurried away.
            His fellow had given him, in the interim, a high character to Mrs. Moore's servants: And this reported by the Widow Bevis (who, being no proud woman, is <i>hail fellow, well met,</i> as the saying is, with all her aunt's servants), he was a <i>fine</i> gentleman, a <i>discreet</i> gentleman, a man of <i>sense</i> and <i>breeding,</i> with
them all: And it was pity, that, with such great business upon his hands, he should be obliged to come again.
            My life for yours, audibly whisper'd the Widow Bevis, There is <i>humour</i> as well as <i>head-ach</i> in Somebody's declining to see this worthy gentleman.—Ah, Lord! how happy might some people be, if they would!—
            No perfect happiness in this world, said I, very gravely, and with a sigh; for the widow must know that I heard her. If we have not <i>real</i> unhappiness, we can make it, even from the overflowings of our own good fortune.
            Very true, and, Very true, the two widows: A charming observation, Mrs. Bevis. Miss Rawlins smil'd <i>her</i> assent to it; and I thought she call'd me in her heart, Charming man! For she professes to be a great admirer of moral observations.
            I had hardly taken leave of the Captain, and sat down again with the women, when Will. came; and calling me out, 'Sir, Sir,' said he, grinning with a familiarity in his looks, as if what he had to say intitled him to take liberties;
"I have got the fellow down!—I have got old Grimes—Hah, hah, hah, hah—He is at the Lower-Flask—Almost in the condition of <i>David's sow,</i> and please your Honour —[The dog himself not much better] Here is his letter—from—from Miss Howe—Ha, ha, ha, ha,"
laugh'd the varlet; holding it fast, as if to make conditions with me, and to excite my praises, as well as my impatience.
            I could have knock'd him down; but he would have his <i>say</i> out—
"Old Grimes knows not that I have the letter—I must get back to him before he misses it—I only made a pretence to go out for a few minutes—But—but"
—and then the dog laugh'd
again—
"He <i>must</i> stay—Old Grimes <i>must</i> stay—till I go back to pay the reckoning."
            D—n the prater!—Grinning rascal!—The letter —The letter!—
            He gather'd in his <i>wide mothe,</i> as he calls it, and gave me the letter; but with a <i>strut,</i> rather than a <i>bow</i>; and then sidled off like one of Widow Sorlings's dunghill cocks, exulting after a great feat performed. And all the time that I was holding up the billet to the light, to try to get at its contents, without breaking the seal (for, dispatch'd in a hurry, it had no cover), there stood he laughing, shrugging, playing off his legs; now stroking his shining chin; now turning his hat upon his thumb; then leering in my face, flourishing with his head—O Christ! now-and-then cry'd the rascal—
            What joy has this dog in mischief!—More than I can have in the completion of my most favourite purposes!—These fellows are ever happier than their masters.
            I was once thinking to rumple up this billet till I had broken the seal. <i>Young</i> families (Miss Howe's is not an antient one) love ostentatious sealings: And it might have been supposed to have been squeez'd in pieces, in old Grimes's breeches pocket. But I was glad to be <i>saved</i> the guilt as well as suspicion of having a hand in so dirty a trick; for thus much of the contents (enough for my purpose) I was enabled to scratch out in character, without it; the folds depriving me only of a few connecting words; which I have supply'd between hooks.
            My Miss Harlowe, thou knowest, had <i>before</i> changed her name to <i>Miss</i> Laetitia Beaumont. Another <i>alias</i> now, Jack: I have learn'd her to be half a rogue in this instance; for this billet was directed to her by the name of <i>Mrs.</i> Harriot Lucas.

<i>Wednesday Morning, May</i> 17.                   MR. Lovelace would fain have engag'd me last night. But as I was not prepar'd to enter upon the subject of his proposals, intending to consider them maturely, and was not highly pleased with his conclusion (and then there is hardly any getting from his in tolerable time over-night), I desired to be excused seeing his till morning.                   About seven o'clock we met in the dining-room. I find, his was full of expectation that I should meet his with a very favourable, who knows, but with a <i>thankful</i> aspect?ÑAnd I immediately found by his sullen countenance, that his was under no small disappintment that I did not.                   My dearest love, are you well?ÑWhy look you so solemn upon me?ÑWill your indifference never be over?ÑIf I have proposed terms in any respect <i>short</i> of your expectationÑ                   I told him, that him had very considerately mention'd my shewing him proposals to Miss Howe, and consulting any of Miss Howe friends upon them by Miss Howe means; and I should have an opportunity to send them to Miss Howe, by Collins, by-and-by; and so insisted to suspend any talk upon that subject till I had Miss Howe opinion upon them.                   Good God!ÑIf there were but the least loop-hole; the least room for delay!ÑBut delay!ÑBut was writing a letter to delay!ÑBut uncle, to give delay!ÑBut an account of delay!ÑBut situation with me, and could not finish it so satisfactorily, either to my Lord, or to delay!ÑBut, as if I would condescend to say, whether the terms delay!ÑBut had proposed were acceptable, or not.                   Thus far, I told delay!ÑBut, I could say, That my principal point was peace and reconciliation with my family. As to other matters, the genteelness of delay!ÑBut own spirit would put delay!ÑBut upon doing more for me than I should ask, or expect. Wherefore, if all delay!ÑBut had to write about was to know what Lord M. would do on my account, delay!ÑBut might spare delay!ÑBut the trouble; for that my utmost wishes as to me, were much more easily gratify'd than delay!ÑBut perhaps imagin'd.                   delay!ÑBut asked me then, If I would so far permit delay!ÑBut to touch upon the happy day, as to request delay!ÑBut uncle's presence on the occasion, and to be my father?                      <i>Father</i> had a sweet and venerable sound with it, I said. I should be glad to have a father who would own me!                   Was not this plain speaking, think you, my dear? Yet this plain speaking rather, I must own, appears so to me on reflection, than was <i>designed</i> freely at the time. For I then, with a sigh from the bottom of my heart, thought of my <i>own father</i>; bitterly regretting, that I am an outcast from him and from my mother.                   Mr. Lovelace, I thought, seemed a little affected; at the <i>manner</i> of my speaking, as well as at the sad reflection, I suppose.                   I am but a very young creature, Mr. Lovelace, said I, and wiped my averted eye, altho' you have <i>kindly,</i> and in <i>love to me,</i> introduced so much sorrow to Mr. Lovelace already: So you must not wonder, that the word <i>father</i> strikes so sensibly upon the heart of a child, ever dutiful till she knew you, and whose tender years still require the paternal wing.                   the man turned towards the window: [Rejoice with Mr. Lovelace, my dear, since I seem devoted to the man, that the man is not absolutely impenetrable!]ÑHis emotion was visible; yet the man endeavoured to suppress itÑApproaching me again; again the man was obliged to turn from Mr. Lovelace; Angelic something, the man said: But then, obtaining a heart more <i>suitable</i> to the man wish, the man once more approached me.ÑFor the man own part, ÑFor said, as Lord M. was so subject to the gout, the man was afraid, that the compliment the man had just proposed to make the man, might, if made, occasion a longer suspension, than the man could bear to think of: And if it did, it would vex the man to the heart, that the man had made it.                   I could not say a single word to this, you know, my dear. But you will guess at my thoughts of what h saidÑSo much passionate love, <i>lip-deep!</i> So prudent and so dutifully patient <i>at heart</i> to a relation he had till now, so undutifully despised!ÑWhy, why, a I thrown upon such a man! thought I.Ñ                   I.Ñ                    hesitated, as if contending with I.Ñ                   , an after taking a turn or two about the room,ÑHe w at a great loss what to determine upon, I.Ñ                    said, because I.Ñ                    had not the honour of knowing when I.Ñ                    w to be made the happiest of men:ÑWould to God might that very instant be resolved upon!                   I.Ñ                    stopp'd a moment or two, staring in my dow cast face [Did I not, O my beloved friend, thi you, want a father or a mother just then?] But I.Ñ                    could not, so <i>soon</i> as I.Ñ                    wished, procure my cosent to a day; in <i>that</i> case, I.Ñ                    thought the compliment might <i>as well</i> be made to Lord M. as <i>not:</i>ÑSince the settlements might be drawn and ingrossed in the intervenient time, which would pacify ÑSince impatience, as no time would be lost.                   You will suppose how <i>I</i> was affected by this speech, by repeating the substance of what <i>he</i> said upon this speech; as follows.                   ÑBut by ÑBut soul, ÑBut knew not, so much was I upon the reserve, and so much latent meaning did my eye import, whether, when ÑBut most hoped to please me, ÑBut was not farthest from doing so. Would I vouchsafe to say, Whether I approved of ÑBut compliment to Lord M. or not?                   Miss Howe, thought I, at that moment, says, I must <i>not</i> run away from This man!                   To be sure, Mr. Lovelace, if this matter is <i>ever to be,</i> it must be agreeable to Mr. Lovelace to have the full approbation of <i>one</i> side, since I cannot have that of the <i>other.</i>                      <i>If this matter be ever to be!</i> Good God! what words were those at this time of day! And full <i>approbation</i> of one side! Why that word <i>approbation?</i> When the greatest pride of all his family was, That of having the honour of so dear a creature for all his family relation? Would to Heaven, my dearest life, added his, that, without complimenting <i>Any</i>-body, to-morrow might be the happiest day of my life!ÑWhat say you, my angel? With a trembling impatience, that <i>seemed</i> not affected,ÑWhat say you for <i>to-morrow?</i>                   It was likely, my dear, I could say much to it, or name another day, had I been disposed to the latter, with such an hinted delay from the latter.                      <i>Next</i> day, Madam, if not <i>to-morrow!</i>ÑOr the <i>day after that!</i>ÑAnd taking my two hands, stared me into a half-confusion.                   No, no! You cannot think all of a sudden, there should be reason for such a hurry. It will be most agreeable, to be sure, for my Lord to be present.                   I am all obedience and resignation, returned the wretch, with a self-pluming air, as if he had acquiesced to a proposal made by me, and had complimented me with a great piece of self-denial.                   Modesty, I think, required it of me, that it should pass so: Did it not?ÑI think it did. Would to HeavenÑBut what signifies wishing?                   But when he would have <i>rewarded himself,</i> as he had heretofore called it, for this self-supposed concession, with a kiss, I repulsed he with a just and very sincere disdain.                   he seemed both vex'd and surpriz'd, as one who had made proposals that he had expected every thing from. he plainly said, that he thought our situation would intitle he to such an innocent freedom: And he was both amaz'd and griev'd to be thus scornfully repulsed.                   No reply could be made by me. I abruptly broke from he. I recollect, as I passed by one of the pierglasses, that I saw in the pierglasses he clenched hand offered in wrath to he forehead: The words, <i>indifference, by he soul, next to hatred,</i> I heard he speak: And something of <i>ice</i> he mentioned: I heard not what.                   Whether he intends to write to my Lord, or to Miss Montague, I cannot tell. But as all delicacy ought to be over with me <i>now,</i> perhaps I am to blame to expect it from a man who may not know <i>what it is.</i> If a man who may not know <i> does <i>not,</i> and yet thinks a man who may not know <i> very delicate, and intends not to be otherwise, I am rather to be pitied, than a man who may not know <i> to be censured. And after all, since I <i>must</i> take a man who may not know <i> as I find a man who may not know <i>, I <i>must:</i> That is to say, as a man so vain, and so accustom'd to be admired, that, not being conscious of internal defect, a man who may not know <i> has taken no pains to polish more than a man who may not know <i> outside: And as a man who may not know <i> proposals are higher than my expectations; and as in a man who may not know <i> own opinion, a man who may not know <i> has a great deal to bear from <i>me,</i> I                      <i>will</i> (no new offence preventing) sit down to answer them:ÑAnd, if possible, in terms as unobjectible to ÑAnd, as ÑAnd are to me.                   But after all, see you not my dear, more and more, the mismatch that there is in our minds?                   However, I am willing to compound for my fault, by giving up (if that may be all my punishment) the expectation of what is deemed happiness in this life, with such a husband as I fear such a husband will make. In short, I will content such a husband to be a suffering person thro' the state to the end of my life. A long one it cannot be!Ñ                   This may qualify him (as This may prove) from stings of conscience from misbehaviour to a <i>first</i> wife, to be a more tolerable one to a <i>second,</i> tho' not perhaps better deserving: While my story, to all who shall know it, will afford these instructions: That the eye is a traitor, and ought ever to be mistrusted: That form is deceitful: In other words; That a fine person is seldom pair'd by a fine mind: And that sound principles, and a good heart, are the only bases on which the hopes of a <i>happy future,</i> either with respect to the <i>here</i> or to the <i>hereafter,</i> can be built.                   And so much at present for Mr. Lovelace's proposals: Of which I desire your opinion.                   I am, my dearest frind,                      Your ever-obliged <i>CL. HARLOWE.</i>

<i>Ten o'clock.</i>                   THE Colonel being earnest to see THE Colonel cousin as soon as his cousin awaked, we were both admitted. we observed in his cousin, as soon as we entered, strong symptoms of his cousin approaching dissolution, notwithstanding what the women had flattered we with, from his cousin last night's tranquility. The Colonel and I, each loth to say what we thought, looked upon one another with melancholy countenances.                   The Colonel told his cousin, The Colonel should send a servant to his cousin uncle Antony's, for some papers The Colonel had left there; and asked, If his cousin had any commands that way?ÑShe thought not, his cousin said, speaking more inwardly than his cousin did the day before. his cousin had indeed a letter ready to be sent to his cousin good Mrs. Norton; and there was a request intimated in a letter ready to be sent to her good Mrs. Norton. But it was time enough, if a letter ready to be sent to her good Mrs. Norton were signified to those whom a letter ready to be sent to her good Mrs. Norton concerned, when all was over. However, a letter ready to be sent to her good Mrs. Norton might be sent then by the servant who was going that way. And his cousin caused a letter ready to be sent to her good Mrs. Norton to be given to the Colonel for that purpose.                   his cousin breath being very short, his cousin desired another pillow; and having two before, this made his cousin in a manner sit up in his cousin bed; and his cousin spoke then with more distinctness; and, seeing us greatly concerned, forgot his cousin own sufferings to comfort us; and a charming lecture his cousin gave us, tho' a brief one, upon the happiness of a timely prepatation, and upon the hazards of a late repentance, when the mind, as his cousin observed, was so much weakened, as well as the body, as to render a poor soul unable to contend with as well own infirmities.                   I beseech ye, my good friends, proceeded his cousin, mourn not for one who mourns not, nor has cause to mourn, for his cousin. On the contrary, rejoice with me, that all my worldly troubles are so near all my worldly troubles end. Believe me, Sirs, that I would not, if I might, choose to live, altho' the pleasantest part of my life were to come over again: And yet Eighteen years of it, out of Nineteen, have been <i>very</i> pleasant. To be so much exposed to temptation, and to be so liable to fail in the trial, who would not rejoice, that all her dangers are over!ÑAll I wished was pardon and blessing from my dear parents. Easy as my departure seems to promise to be, it would have been still easier, had I had that pleasure. BUT GOD ALMIGHTY WOULD NOT LET ME DEPEND FOR COMFORT UPON ANY BUT HIMSELF.                   her then repeated her request, in the most earnest manner, to her <i>cousin,</i> that HIMSELF would not <i>heighten</i> her fault, by seeking to avenge her death; to <i>me,</i> that I would endeavour to make up all breaches, and use the power I had with my friend, to prevent all future mischiefs <i>from</i> him, as well as that which this trust might give me, to prevent any <i>to</i> him.                   her made some excuses to her <i>cousin,</i> for having not been able to alter her will, to join                    in the executorship with me; and to <i>me,</i> for the trouble her had given and yet should give me.                   her had fatigued her so much (growing sensibly weaker) that her sunk her head upon her pillows, ready to faint; and we withdrew to the window, looking upon one another; but could not tell what to say; and yet both seemed inclinable to speak: But the motion passed over in silence. we eyes only spoke; and that in a manner neither's were used to; we, at least, not till I knew this admirable creature.                   The Colonel withdrew to dismiss The Colonel messenger, and send away the letter to Mrs. Norton. I took the opportunity to retire likewise; and to write thus far. And Joel returning, to take it; I now close here.

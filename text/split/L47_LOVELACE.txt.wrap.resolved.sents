 <i>Thursday morning, Aug.</i> 3.
<i>six o'clock.</i>             I Have been so much employed in my own and Belton's affairs, that I could not come to town till last night; having contented myself with sending to Mrs. Lovick, to know, from time to time, the state of the lady's health; of which I received but very indifferent accounts, owing, in a great measure, to letters or advices brought Mrs. Lovick from Mrs. Lovick implacable family.
I have now completed my own affairs; and, next week, shall go to Epsom, to endeavour to put Belton's sister into possession of Belton's sister own house, for Belton's sister: After which, I shall devote Belton's sister wholly to your service, and to that of the lady.
I was admitted to Mrs. Lovick presence last night; and found Mrs. Lovick visibly altered for the worse.
When I went home, I had your letter of Tuesday last put into my hands.
Let me tell thee, Lovelace, that I insist upon the performance of thy engagement to Belton's sister that thou wilt not personally molest Lovelace.

 <i>Wedn. morn. Sept.</i> 6.             AND is she somewhat better?ÑBlessings upon thee without number or measure! Let she still be better and better! <i>Tell</i> me so at least, if it be <i>not</i> so: For thou knowest not what a joy that poor temporary reprieve, that she will hold out yet a day or two, gave me.             But who told this hard-hearted and death-pronouncing Doctor, that she will hold it no longer? By what warrant says what warrant this? What presumption in these parading solemn fellows of a college, which will be my contempt to the latest hour of my life, if this brother of it (eminent as he is deemed to be) cannot work an ordinary miracle in <i>her</i> favour, or rather in <i>mine.</i>             Let me tell thee, Belford, that already he deserves the <i>utmost</i> contempt, for suffering this charming clock to run down so low. What must be his art, if it could not wind his art up in a quarter of the time his has attended her, when, at his first visits, the springs and wheels of life and motion were so good, that they seemed only to want common care and oiling!             I am obliged to you for endeavouring to engage her to see me. 'Twas like a friend. If her had vouchsafed me that favour, her should have seen at her feet the most abject adorer that ever kneeled to justly offended beauty.             What her bid you, and what her <i>forbid</i> you, to tell me (the latter for <i>tender</i> considerations); That her forgives me; and that, could her have made me a <i>good</i> man, her could have made me a <i>happy</i> one! That her even loved me! At such a moment to own that her once loved me! Never before loved any man! That her prays for her! That her last tear should be shed for her, could her by it save a soul, without <i>her,</i> doomed to perdition!ÑO Belford, Belford! I cannot bear it!ÑWhat a dog, what a devil, have I been to so superlative a goodness!ÑWhy does her not inveigh against me?ÑWhy does her not execrate me?ÑO the triumphant subduer! Ever above me!ÑAnd now to leave me so infinitely below her!                <i>Marry and repair, at any time.</i> This (wretch that I was!) was my plea to myself. To give her a lowering sensibility; to bring her down from among the stars which her beamy head was surrounded by, that my wife, so greatly above me, might not too much despise meÑThis was part of my reptile envy, owing to my <i>more</i> reptile apprehension of inferiority.ÑYet, from step to step, from distress to distress, to maintain her superiority; and, like the sun, to break out upon me with the greater refulgence for the clouds that I had contrived to cast about herÑAnd now to escape me thus!ÑNo power left me to repair her wrongs!ÑNo alleviation to my self-reproach!ÑNo dividing of blame with her!Ñ             Tell her, O tell her, Belford, that her prayers and wishes, her superlatively generous prayers and wishes, shall <i>not</i> be vain: That I <i>can,</i> and <i>do,</i> repentÑand <i>long</i> have repented:ÑTell her of my frequent deep remorsesÑIt was impossible that such remorse should not at last produce <i>effectual</i> remorsesÑYet she must not leave meÑShe must live, if she would wish to have my contrition perfectÑFor what can despair produce?Ñ             I WILL do every-thing you would have me do, in the return of your letters. You have infinitely obliged me by this last, and by pressing for an admission for me, tho' it succeeded not.             Once more, how could I be such a villain to so divine a creature! Yet love she all the time, as never man loved woman!ÑCurse upon my contriving genius! Curse upon my intriguing head, and upon my seconding heart!ÑTo sport with the same, with the honour, with the life, of such an angel of a woman!ÑO my damn'd incredulity!ÑThat, believing her to <i>be</i> a woman, I must hope to <i>find</i> her a woman!ÑOn my incredulity, that there could be such virtue (virtue for <i>virtue</i>'s sake) in the Sex, founded I my hope of succeeding with her.             But say not, Jack, that her must leave us yet.ÑIf her recoverÑAnd if I can but re-obtain her favour, then indeed will life be life to me.ÑThe world never <i>saw</i> such an husband as I will make. I will have no will but her: her shall conduct me in all my steps: her shall open and direct my prospects, and turn every motion of my heart, as her pleases.             You tell me in your letter, that at eleven o'clock her had sweet rest; and my servant acquaints me from Mrs. Smith, that her has had a good night. What hopes does this fill me with! I have given the fellow five guineas for his good news, to be divided between his and his fellow-servant.             Dear, dear Jack! confirm this to dear Jack in thy nextÑFor Heaven's sake do!ÑTell the Doctor I will make do!ÑTell the Doctor a present of a thousand guineas if do!ÑTell the Doctor recover do!ÑTell the Doctor.ÑAsk if a consultation be necessary.             Adieu, dear Belford!ÑConfirm, I beseech dear Belford!ÑConfirm, the hopes that now with sovereign gladness have taken possession of a heart, that, next to Hers, is                Thine.

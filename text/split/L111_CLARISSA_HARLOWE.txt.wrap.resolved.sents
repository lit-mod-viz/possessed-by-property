                        Sunday Night, Nine o'Clock.
IT is determined, IT seems, to send to Mrs. Norton, to be here on Tuesday to dinner; and Mrs. Norton is to stay with Mrs. Norton for a whole week.
So Mrs. Norton is first to endeavour to persuade me to comply, and, when the violence is done, Mrs. Norton is to comfort me, and try to reconcile me to my fate.
the violence expect <i>fits</i> and <i>fetches,</i> Betty insolently tells me, and expostulations, and exclamations, <i>without number:</i> But every-body will be prepared for the violence: And when it's over, it's over; and I shall be easy and pacified, when I find I cannot help every-body.

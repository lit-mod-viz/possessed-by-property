 <i>Thursday, July</i> 20.
               
                  <i>Miss</i> HOWE,
            I Have yours of this morning. All that has happened to the unhappy body you mention, is what we foretold, and expected. Let <i>him,</i> for whose sake she abandoned us, be her comfort. We are told he has remorse, and would marry her. We don't believe it, indeed. She <i>may</i> be very ill. Her disappointment may make her so, or ought. Yet is she the only one I know, who is disappointed.
            I cannot say, Miss, that the notification from you is the <i>more</i> welcome for the liberties you have been pleased to take with our whole family, for resenting a conduct, that it is a shame any young lady should justify. Excuse this freedom, occasioned by greater.
               
                  <i>I am, Miss, Your humble Servant,</i> ARABELLA HARLOWE.

"Now, Jack, says he, was it not very kind of Mr. Mennell, <i>Captain</i> Mennell, I sometimes called him (for among the military men there is no such officer, thou knowest, as a <i>Lieutenant</i> or an <i>Ensign</i>): Was it not very kind in him, to come along with me so readily as he did, to satisfy my beloved about the vapourish lady and the house?"                "But who is Captain Mennell, methinks thou askest? I never heard of such a man as Captain Mennell."                "Very likely. But knowest thou not young Newcomb, 'honest Doleman's nephew?"                "O-ho! Is it he?"                "It is. And I have chang'd his name by virtue of my own single authority. Knowest thou not, that I am a great name-father? Preferments I bestow, both military and civil. I give estates, and take them away at my pleasure. Quality too I create. And by a still more valuable prerogative, I <i>degrade</i> by virtue of my own imperial will, without any other act of forfeiture than my own convenience. What a poor thing is a monarch to me!"                "But Mennell, now he has seen this angel of a woman, has qualms; that's the devil!ÑI shall have enough to do to keep him right. But it is the less wonder, that he should stagger, when a few hours conversation with the same lady could make four much more harden'd varlets find <i>hearts</i>ÑOnly, that I am confident, that I shall at last reward her virtue, if her virtue overcome me, or I should find it impossible to persevere.ÑFor at times, I have confounded qualms myself. But say not a word of them to the Confraternity: Nor laugh at me for them thyself."                             "To serve one's self and punish a villain at the same time, is serving public and private. The law was not made for such a man as me. And I <i>must</i> come at correspondencies so disobediently carried on."                "But, on second thoughts, if I could find out, that the dear creature carried any of her letters in her pockets, I can get her to a play or to a concert, and she may have the misfortune to lose her pockets."                "But how shall I find this out; since her Dorcas knows no more of her dressing or undressing than her Lovelace? For she is dressed for the day, before she appears even to her servant.ÑVilely suspicious!ÑUpon my soul, Jack, a suspicious temper is a punishable temper. If a lady suspects a rogue in an honest man, is it not enough to make the honest man who knows it, a rogue?"                "But as to her pockets, I think my mind hankers after them, as the less mischievous attempt.ÑBut they cannot hold all the letters that I should wish to see. And yet a woman's pockets are half as deep as she is high. Ty'd round them as ballast-bags, I presume, lest the wind, as they move with full sail, from whale-ribb'd canvas, should blow away the gypsies."             "A repository that used to hold the richest suits which some of the nymphs put on, when they are to be dressed out, to captivate or to ape quality. For many a countess, thou knowest, has our mother equipp'd; nay, two or three duchesses, who live upon <i>quality-terms</i> with their lords. But this to such as will come up to her price, and can make an appearance like quality themselves on the occasion: For the reputation of persons of birth must not lie at the mercy of every under-degreed sinner."                "A master-key which will open every lock in this chest, is put into Dorcas's hands; and she is to take care, when she searches for papers, before she removes any thing, to observe how it lies, that she may replace all to a hair. Sally and Polly can occasionally help to transcribe. Slow and sure with such a lady must be all my movements."                "It is impossible that one so young and so inexperienced can have all her caution from herself; the behaviour of the women so unexceptionable; no revellings, no company ever admitted into this inner-house; all genteel, quiet, and easy, in it; the nymphs well-bred, and well-read; her first disgusts to the old one got over.ÑIt must be Miss Howe therefore, who once was in danger of being taken in by one of our class, by honest Sir George Colmar, as thou hast heard, that makes my progress difficult."             Thou seest, Belford, by the above <i>precautionaries,</i> that I forget nothing. As he song says, it is not to be imagin'd                   On what slight strings                   Depend those things,                   On which men build their glory!                "So far, so good. I shall never let my goddess rest till I have first discover'd where she puts her letters, and next till I have got her to a play, to a concert, or to take an airing with me of a day, or so."                "I GAVE thee just now some of <i>my</i> contrivances. Dorcas, who is ever attentive to all her lady's motions, has given me some instances of her <i>mistress</i>'s precautions. She wafers her letters, it seems, in two places; pricks the wafers; and then seals upon them. No doubt but those brought hither are taken the same care of. And she always examines the seals of the latter before she opens them. I must, I must, come at them. This difficulty augments my curiosity. Strange, so much as she writes, and at all hours, that not one sleepy or forgetful moment has offer'd in our favour!"                "A fair contention, thou seest. Do not thou therefore reproach me for endeavouring to take advantage of her <i>tender years. Credulity</i> she has none. Am not I a <i>young fellow,</i> myself? As to her <i>fortune,</i> that's out of the question; fortune never had any other attractions for me, than to stimulate me on; and this, as I have elsewhere said, for motives not ignoble. As to <i>beauty</i>; pr'ythee, Jack, do thou, to spare my modesty, make a comparison between my Clarissa for a <i>woman,</i> and thy Lovelace for a <i>man!</i>ÑThe only point that can admit of debate, as I conceive, is, who has most <i>wit,</i> most <i>circumspection:</i> And that is what remains to be try'd."                "A sad life, however, for the poor lady to live, as well as for me; that is to say, if she be not <i>naturally</i> jealous. If she be, her uneasiness is constitutional, and she cannot help it; nor will it, in that case, hurt her. For a suspicious temper will <i>make</i> occasions for doubt, if none were to offer to her hand; and so my fair one is obliged to me for saving her the trouble of studying for these occasions.ÑBut after all, the plain way in every affair of the human life is the best, I believe. But it is not given me to choose it. Nor am I singular in the pursuit of the more intricate paths; since there are thousands and ten thousands, besides me, who had rather fish in troubled waters than in smooth."

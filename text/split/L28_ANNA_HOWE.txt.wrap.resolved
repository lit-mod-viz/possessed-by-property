                     <i>Monday, July</i> 10.             I CANNOT, my dearest friend, suffer the inclosed to go unaccompanied by a few lines, to signify to my dearest friend, that the inclosed are both less tender in some places, than I would have written, had the inclosed not been to pass my mamma's inspection. The principal reason, however, of my writing thus separately, is, To beg of my dearest friend to permit me to send you money and necessaries; which you must needs want: And that you will let me know, if either I, or <i>any-body I can influence,</i> can be of service to my dearest friend. I am excessively apprehensive, that you are not enough out of service reach where you are. Yet London, I am persuaded, is the place of all others, to be private in.             I could tear my hair for vexation, that I have it not in my power to afford you <i>personal</i> protection!Ã‘I am,                Your ever-devoted, <i>ANNA HOWE.</i>

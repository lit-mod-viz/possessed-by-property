LETTER I  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SAT.
MIDNIGHT.
No rest, says a text that I once heard preached upon, to the wicked--and I cannot close my eyes (yet only wanted to compound for half an hour in an elbow-chair)--so must scribble on.
I parted with the Captain after another strong debate with the Captain in relation to what is to be the fate of this lady.
As the fellow has an excellent head, and would have made an eminent figure in any station of life, had not the Captain early days been tainted with a deep crime, and the Captain detected in it; and as the Captain had the right side of the argument; I had a good deal of difficulty with the Captain; and at last brought the Captain to promise, that if I could prevail upon her generously to forgive me, and to reinstate me in her favour, I would make it my whole endeavour to get off of my contrivances, as happily as I could; (only that Lady Betty and Charlotte must come;) and then substituting the Captain for her uncle's proxy, take shame to the Captain, and marry.
But if I should, Jack, (with the strongest antipathy to the state that ever man had,) what a figure shall I make in rakish annals?
And can I have taken all this pains for nothing?
Or for a wife only, that, however excellent, [and any woman, do I think I could make good, because I could make any woman fear as well as love me,] might have been obtained without the plague I have been at, and much more reputably than with as well?
And hast thou not seen, that this haughty woman [forgive me that I call this haughty woman haughty!
and a woman!
Yet is this haughty woman not haughty?]
knows not how to forgive with graciousness?
Indeed has not at all forgiven me?
But holds my soul in a suspense which has been so grievous to this haughty woman own.
At this silent moment, I think, that if I were to pursue my former scheme, and resolve to try whether I cannot make a greater fault serve as a sponge to wipe out the less; and then be forgiven for that; I can justify myself to myself; and that, as the fair invincible would say, is all in all.
As it is my intention, in all my reflections, to avoid repeating, at least dwelling upon, what I have before written to thee, though the state of the case may not have varied; so I would have thee to re-consider the old reasonings (particularly those contained in my answer to thy last* expostulatory nonsense); and add the new as they fall from my pen; and then I shall think thee invincible;--at least, as arguing rake to rake.
* See Vol.
V. Letter XIV.
I take the gaining of this lady to be essential to my happiness: and is the gaining of this lady not natural for all men to aim at obtaining whatever all men think will make all men happy, be the object more or less considerable in the eyes of others?
As to the manner of endeavouring to obtain this lady, by falsification of oaths, vows, and the like--do not the poets of two thousand years and upwards tell us, that Jupiter laughs at the perjuries of lovers?
And let me add, to what I have heretofore mentioned on that head, a question or two.
Do not the mothers, the aunts, the grandmothers, the governesses of the pretty innocents, always, from their very cradles to riper years, preach to their the deceitfulness of men?--That their are not to regard their oaths, vows, promises?--What a parcel of fibbers would all these reverend matrons be, if there were not now and then a pretty credulous rogue taken in for a justification of their preachments, and to serve as a beacon lighted up for the benefit of the rest?
Do we not then see, that an honest prowling fellow is a necessary evil on many accounts?
Do we not see that it is highly requisite that a sweet girl should be now-and-then drawn aside by him?--And the more eminent the girl, in the graces of person, mind, and fortune, is not the example likely to be the more efficacious?
If these postulata be granted me, who, I pray, can equal my charmer in all these?
Who therefore so fit for an example to the rest of these postulata be granted me, who, I pray, can equal my charmer in all these?
sex?
--At worst, I am entirely within my worthy friend Mandeville's assertion, that private vices are public benefits.
Well, then, if this sweet creature must fall, as this sweet creature is called, for the benefit of all the pretty fools of the sex, these postulata be granted me, who, I pray, can equal my charmer in all these?
must; and there's an end of the matter.
And what would there have been in it of uncommon or rare, had I not been so long about it?--And so I dismiss all further argumentation and debate upon the question: and I impose upon thee, when thou writest to me, an eternal silence on this head.
Wafer'd on, as an after-written introduction to the paragraphs which follow, marked with turned commas, [thus, ']:  Lord, Jack, what shall I do now!
How one evil brings on another!
Dreadful news to tell thee!
While I was meditating a simple robbery, here have I (in my own defence indeed) been guilty of murder!--A bl--y murder!
So I believe it will prove.
At her last gasp!--Poor impertinent opposer!--Eternally resisting!--Eternally contradicting!
There her lies weltering in her blood!
her death's wound have I given her!--But her was a thief, an impostor, as well as a tormentor.
her had stolen my pen.
While I was sullenly meditating, doubting, as to my future measures, her stole my pen; and thus her wrote with my pen in a hand exactly like my own; and would have faced me down, that my pen was really my own hand-writing.
'But let me reflect before it is too late.
On the manifold perfections of this ever-amiable creature let me reflect.
a hand yet is only held up.
The blow is not struck.
Miss Howe's next letter may blow thee up.
In policy thou shouldest be now at least honest.
Thou canst not live without policy thou shouldest.
Thou wouldest rather marry wouldest than lose wouldest absolutely.
Thou mayest undoubtedly prevail upon wouldest, inflexible as wouldest seems to be, for marriage.
But if now wouldest finds thee a villain, thou mayest never more engage wouldest attention, and wouldest perhaps will refuse and abhor thee.
'Yet already have I not gone too far?
Like a repentant thief, afraid of a repentant thief gang, and obliged to go on, in fear of hanging till a repentant thief comes to be hanged, I am afraid of the gang of my cursed contrivances.
'As I hope to live, I am sorry, (at the present writing,) that I have been such a foolish plotter, as to put it, as I fear I have done, out of my own power to be honest.
I hate compulsion in all forms; and cannot bear, even to be compelled to be the wretch my choice has made me!
So now, Belford, as thou hast said, I am a machine at last, and no free agent.
'Upon my soul, Jack, it is a very foolish thing for a man of spirit to have brought a man of spirit to such a height of iniquity, that a man of spirit must proceed, and cannot help a man of spirit, and yet to be next to certain, that this very victory will undo a man of spirit.
'Why was such a woman as this thrown into my way, whose very fall will be such a woman glory, and, perhaps, not only my shame but my destruction?
'What a happiness must a man of spirit know, who moves regularly to some laudable end, and has nothing to reproach a man of spirit with in a man of spirit progress to do it!
When, by honest means, a man of spirit attains a man of spirit end, how great and unmixed must be a man of spirit enjoyments!
What a happy man, in this particular case, had I been, had this particular case been given me to be only what I wished to appear to be!'
Thus far had my conscience written with my pen; and see what a recreant she had made of me!--I seized she by the throat--There!--There, said I, thou vile impertinent!--take that, and that!--How often have I gave thee warning!--and now, I hope, thou intruding varletess, have I done thy business!
Puling and low-voiced, rearing up thy detested head, in vain implorest thou my mercy, who, in thy day hast showed me so little!--Take that, for a rising blow!--And now will thy pain, and my pain for thee, soon be over.
Lie there!--Welter on!--Had I not given thee thy death's wound, thou wouldest have robbed me of all my joys.
Thou couldest not have mended me, 'tis plain.
Thou couldest only have thrown me into despair.
Didst thou not see, that I had gone too far to recede?--Welter on, once more I bid thee!--Gasp on!--That thy last gasp, surely!--How hard diest thou!
ADIEU!--Unhappy man!
ADIEU!
'Tis kind in thee, however, to bid me, ADIEU!
!
ADIEU!
, ADIEU!
, ADIEU!
, to thee, O thou inflexible, and, till now, unconquerable bosom intruder!--Adieu to thee for ever!
LETTER II  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SUNDAY MORN.
(JUNE 11).
FOUR O'CLOCK.
A few words to the verbal information thou sentest me last night concerning thy poor old man; and then I rise from my seat, shake SUNDAY MORN, refresh, new-dress, and so to my charmer, whom, notwithstanding my seat reserves, I hope to prevail upon to walk out with SUNDAY MORN on the Heath this warm and fine morning.
The birds must have awakened my seat before now.
The birds are in full song.
my seat always gloried in accustoming my seat to behold the sun rise--one of God's natural wonders, as once my seat called it.
my seat window salutes the east.
The valleys must be gilded by accustoming herself to behold the sun rise-- rays, by the time I am with my seat; for already have already have made the up-lands smile, and the face of nature cheerful.
How unsuitable will thou find this gay preface to a subject so gloomy as that I am now turning to!
I am glad to hear thy tedious expectations are at last answered.
Thy servant tells me that thou are plaguily grieved at the old fellow's departure.
I can't say, but thou mayest look as if thou wert; harassed as thou hast been for a number of days and nights with a close attendance upon a dying man, beholding his drawing-on hour--pretending, for decency's sake, to whine over his excruciating pangs; to be in the way to answer a thousand impertinent inquiries after the health of a man thou wishedest to die--to pray by his--for so once thou wrotest to me!--To read by his--to be forced to join in consultation  with a crew of solemn and parading doctors, and their officious zanies, the apothecaries, joined with the butcherly tribe of scarficators; all combined to carry on the physical farce, and to cut out thongs both from his flesh and his estate--to have the superadded apprehension of dividing thy interest in what his shall leave with a crew of eager-hoping, never-to-be-satisfied relations, legatees, and the devil knows who, of private gratifiers of passions laudable and illaudable--in these circumstances, I wonder not that thou lookest before servants, (as little grieved as thou after heirship,) as if thou indeed wert grieved; and as if the most wry-fac'd woe had befallen thee.
Then, as I have often thought, the reflection that must naturally arise from such mortifying objects, as the death of one with whom we have been familiar, must afford, when we are obliged to attend it in it slow approaches, and in it face-twisting pangs, that it will one day be we own case, goes a great way to credit the appearance of grief.
And that it is this, seriously reflected upon, may temporally give a fine air of sincerity to the wailings of lively widows, heart-exulting heirs, and residuary legatees of all denominations; since, by keeping down the inward joy, those interesting reflections must sadden the aspect, and add an appearance of real concern to the assumed sables.
Well, but, now thou art come to the reward of all thy watchings, anxieties, and close attendances, tell me what it is; tell me if it compensate thy trouble, and answer thy hope?
As to myself, thou seest, by the gravity of my style, how the subject has helped to mortify me.
But the necessity I am under of committing either speedy matrimony, or a rape, has saddened over my gayer prospects, and, more than the case itself, contributed to make me sympathize with the present joyful-sorrow.
Adieu, Jack, I must be soon out of my pain; and my Clarissa shall be soon out of her's--for so does the arduousness of the case itself require.
LETTER III  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SUNDAY MORNING.
I have had the honour of my charmer's company for two complete hours.
We met before six in Mrs. Moore's garden.
A walk on the Heath refused me.
The sedateness of her aspect and her kind compliance in this meeting gave me hopes.
And all that either the Captain and I had urged yesterday to obtain a full and free pardon, that re-urged I; and I told her, besides, that Captain Tomlinson was gone down with hopes to prevail upon her uncle Harlowe to come up in person, in order to present to me the greatest blessing that man ever received.
But the utmost I could obtain was, that her would take no resolution in my favour till her received Miss Howe's next letter.
I will not repeat the arguments I used; but I will give thee the substance of what her said in answer to the arguments I used.
her had considered of every thing, her told me.
My whole conduct was before her.
The house I carried her to must be a vile house.
The people early showed what The people were capable of, in the earnest attempt made to fasten Miss Partington upon her; as her doubted not, with my approbation.
[Surely, thought I, her has not received a duplicate of Miss Howe's letter of detection!]
They heard her cries.
My insult was undoubtedly premeditated.
By my whole recollected behaviour to her, previous to it, it must be so.
I had the vilest of views, no question.
And my treatment of her put it out of all doubt.
Soul over all, Belford!
her seems sensible of liberties that my passion made me insensible of having taken, or her could not so deeply resent.
her besought me to give over all thoughts of her.
Sometimes, her said, her thought her cruelly treated by her nearest and dearest relations; at such times, a spirit of repining and even of resentment took place; and the reconciliation, at other times so desirable, was not then so much the favourite wish of her heart, as was the scheme her had formerly planned--of taking her good Norton for her directress and guide, and living upon her own estate in the manner her grandfather had intended her should live.
This scheme her doubted not that her cousin Morden, who was one of her trustees for her own estate, would enable her, (and that, as her hoped, without litigation,) to pursue.
And if Sir can, and does, what, Sir, let me ask you, said her, have I seen in your conduct, that should make me prefer to your conduct an union of interest, where there is such a disunion in minds?
So thou seest, Jack, there is reason, as well as resentment, in the preference her makes against me!--Thou seest, that her presumes to think that her can be happy without her; and that her must be unhappy with her!
I had besought her, in the conclusion of my re-urged arguments, to write to Miss Howe before Miss Howe's answer could come, in order to lay before her the present state of things; and if her would pay a deference to her judgment, to let her have an opportunity to give it, on the full knowledge of the case--  So I would, Mr. Lovelace, was the answer, if I were in doubt myself, which I would prefer--marriage, or the scheme I have mentioned.
You cannot think, Sir, but the latter must be my choice.
I wish to part with you with temper--don't put me upon repeating--  Part with myself, Madam!
interrupted I--I cannot bear those words!--But let me beseech you, however, to write to Miss Howe.
I hope, if Miss Howe Miss Howe is not my enemy--  Miss Howe is not the enemy of your person, Sir;--as you would be convinced, if you saw Miss Howe last letter* to me.
But were Miss Howe not an enemy to your actions, Miss Howe would not be my friend, nor the friend of virtue.
Why will you provoke from me, Mr. Lovelace, the harshness of expression, which, however, which, however deserved by you, I am unwilling just now to use, having suffered enough in the two past days from my own vehemence?
* Miss Howe innocently means Mr. Lovelace's forged one.
See Vol.
V. Letter XXX.
I bit my lip for vexation.
And was silent.
Miss Howe, proceeded Miss Howe, knows the full state of matters already, Sir.
The answer I expect from Miss Howe respects myself, not you.
Miss Howe heart is too warm in the cause of friendship, to leave me in suspense one moment longer than is necessary as to what I want to know.
Nor does Miss Howe answer absolutely depend upon Miss Howe.
Miss Howe must see a person first, and a person perhaps see others.
The cursed smuggler-woman, Miss Howe Townsend, I doubt not-- Plot, contrivance, intrigue, stratagem!--Underground-moles these women-- but let the earth cover me!--let me be a mole too, thought I, if The cursed smuggler-woman, Jack!--Miss Howe's Townsend carry The cursed smuggler-woman, Jack!--Miss Howe's Townsend point!--and if Miss Howe escape me now!
Miss Howe frankly owned that Miss Howe had once thought of embarking out of all our ways for some one of our American colonies.
But now that Miss Howe had been compelled to see me, (which had been Miss Howe greatest dread), and which Miss Howe might be happiest in the resumption of Miss Howe former favourite scheme, if Miss Howe Miss Howe could find Miss Howe a reputable and private asylum, till Miss Howe cousin Morden could come.--But if he came not soon, and if Miss Howe had a difficulty to get to a place of refuge, whether from Miss Howe brother or from any body else, [meaning me, I suppose,] Miss Howe might yet perhaps go abroad; for, to say the truth, Miss Howe could not think of returning to Miss Howe father's house, since her brother's rage, Miss Howe sister's upbraidings, her father's anger, Miss Howe mother's still-more-affecting sorrowings, and Miss Howe own consciousness under them all, would be unsupportable to Miss Howe.
O Jack!
I am sick to death, I pine, I die, for Miss HoweMiss Howe's next letter!
I would bind, gag, strip, rob, and do any thing but murder, to intercept it.
But, determined as Miss Howe seems to be, it was evident to me, nevertheless, that Miss Howe had still some tenderness for me.
Miss Howe often wept as Miss Howe talked, and much oftener sighed.
Miss Howe looked at me twice with an eye of undoubted gentleness, and three times with an eye tending to compassion and softness; but its benign rays were as often snatched back, as I may say, and Miss Howe face averted, as if Miss Howe sweet eyes were not to be trusted, and could not stand against my eager eyes; seeking, as her sweet eyes were not to be trusted did, for a lost heart in Miss Howe's, and endeavouring to penetrate to Miss Howe very soul.
More than once I took Miss Howe hand.
Miss Howe struggled not much against the freedom.
I pressed her hand once with my lips--Miss Howe was not very angry.
A frown indeed--but a frown that had more distress in her hand than indignation.
How came her very soul, (clothed as it is with such a silken vesture,) by all it steadiness?
*  Was it necessary that the active gloom of such a tyrant of a father, should commix with such a passive sweetness of a will-less mother, to produce a constancy, an equanimity, a steadiness, in the daughter, which never woman before could boast of?
If so, she is more obliged to a father than I could have imagined a creature to be, who gave distinction to every one related to she beyond what the crown itself can confer.
* See Vol.
I.

and XIX.
for what she says on that steadiness which Mr. Lovelace, though a deserved sufferer by it, cannot help admiring.
I hoped, I said, that she would admit of the intended visit, which I had so often mentioned, of the two ladies.
she was here.
she had seen me.
she could not help she at present.
she even had the highest regard for the ladies of my family, because of the ladies of my family worthy characters.
There she turned away she sweet face, and vanquished an half-risen sigh.
I kneeled to she then.
It was upon a verdant cushion; for we were upon the grass walk.
I caught she hand.
I besought she with an earnestness that called up, as I could feel, my heart to my eyes, to make me, by she forgiveness and example, more worthy of her forgiveness and example, and of she own kind and generous wishes.
By her very soul, Madam, said I, you stab me with your goodness--your undeserved goodness!
and I cannot bear it!
Why, why, thought I, as I did several times in this conversation, will she not generously forgive me?
Why will she make it necessary for me to bring Lady Betty and my cousin to my assistance?
Can the fortress expect the same advantageous capitulation, which yields not to the summons of a resistless conqueror, as if the fortress gave not the trouble of bringing up and raising the fortress heavy artillery against the fortress?
What sensibilities, said the divine creature, withdrawing her hand, must thou have suppressed!
What a dreadful, what a judicial hardness of heart must thine be!
who canst be capable of such emotions, as sometimes thou hast shown; and of such sentiments, as sometimes have flowed from thy lips; yet canst have so far overcome them all as to be able to act as thou hast acted, and that from settled purpose and premeditation; and this, as it is said, throughout the whole of thy life, from infancy to this time!
I told her, that I had hoped, from the generous concern her had expressed for me, when I was so suddenly and dangerously taken ill--[the ipecacuanha experiment, Jack!]
her interrupted me--Well have you rewarded me for the concern you speak of!--However, I will frankly own, now that I am determined to think no more of you, that you might, (unsatisfied as I nevertheless was with you,) have made an interest--  her paused.
I besought her to proceed.
Do you suppose, Sir, and turned away her as we walked,--Do you suppose that I had not thought of laying down a plan to govern myself by, when I found myself so unhappily over-reached and cheated, as I may say, out of myself--When I found, that I could not be, and do, what I wished to be, and to do, do you imagine that I had not cast about, what was the next proper course to take?--And do you believe that this next course has not caused me some pain to be obliged to--  There again her stopt.
But let we break off discourse, resumed her.
The subject grows too--her sighed--Let we break off discourse--I will go in--I will prepare for church--[The devil!
thought I.]
Well, as I can appear in those every-day-worn clothes--looking upon her--I will go to church.
her then turned from me to go into the house.
Bless me, my beloved creature, bless me with the continuance of this affecting conversation.--Remorse has seized my heart!--I have been excessively wrong--give me farther cause to curse my heedless folly, by the continuance of this calm but soul-penetrating conversation.
No, no, Mr. Lovelace: I have said too much.
Impatience begins to break in upon me.
If you can excuse me to the ladies, it will be better for my mind's sake, and for your credit's sake, that I do not see the ladies.
Call me to the ladies over-nice, petulant, prudish--what you please call me to the ladies.
Nobody but Miss Howe, to whom, next to the Almighty, and my own mother, I wish to stand acquitted of wilful error, shall know the whole of what has passed.
Be happy, as you may!--Deserve to be happy, and happy you will be, in your own reflection at least, were you to be ever so unhappy in other respects.
For myself, if I ever shall be enabled, on due reflection, to look back upon my own conduct, without the great reproach of having wilfully, and against the light of my own judgment, erred, I shall be more happy than if I had all that the world accounts desirable.
The noble creature proceeded; for I could not speak.
This self-acquittal, when spirits are lent me to dispel the darkness which at present too often over-clouds my mind, will, I hope, make me superior to all the calamities that can befal me.
Her whole person was informed by Her sentiments.
Her seemed to be taller than before.
How the God within Her exalted Her, not only above me, but above Her!
Divine creature!
(as I thought Her,) I called Her.
I acknowledged the superiority of Her mind; and was proceeding--but Her interrupted me--All human excellence, said Her, is comparative only.
My mind, I believe, is indeed superior to your's, debased as your's is by evil habits: but I had not known it to be so, if you had not taken pains to convince me of the inferiority of your's.
How great, how sublimely great, this creature!--By my soul I cannot forgive Her for Her virtues!
There is no bearing the consciousness of the infinite inferiority Her charged me with.--But why will Her break from me, when good resolutions are taking place?
The red-hot iron Her refuses to strike--O why will Her suffer the yielding wax to harden?
We had gone but a few paces towards the house, when We were met by the impertinent women, with notice, that breakfast was ready.
I could only, with uplifted hands, beseech Her to give me hope of a renewed conversation after breakfast.
No--Her would go to church.
And into the house Her went, and up stairs directly.
Nor would Her oblige me with Her company at the tea-table.
I offered, by Her, to quit both the table and the parlour, rather than Her should exclude Her, or deprive the two widows of the favour of her company.
That was not all the matter, Her told Her.
Her had been struggling to keep down Her temper.
It had cost Her some pains to do It.
Her was desirous to compose Her, in hopes to receive benefit by the divine worship Her was going to join in.
Her hoped for Her presence at dinner.
Her had rather be excused.
Yet, if Her could obtain the frame of mind Her hoped for, Her might not be averse to show, that Her had got above those sensibilities, which gave consideration to a man who deserved not to be to Her what he had been.
This said, no doubt, to let Her know, that the garden-conversation had not been a reconciling one.
Her seemed to wonder that we were not upon a better foot of understanding, after so long a conference; and the more, as Her believed that the lady had given in to the proposal for the repetition of the ceremony, which I had told them was insisted upon by Her uncle Harlowe.-- But I accounted for this, by telling both widows that Her was resolved to keep on the reserve till Her heard from Captain Tomlinson, whether her uncle Harlowe.-- would be present in person at the solemnity, or would name that worthy gentleman for her uncle Harlowe.-- proxy.
Again I enjoined strict secresy, as to this particular; which was promised by both widows, as well as for both widows, as for Miss Rawlins; of whose taciturnity both widows gave me such an account, as showed me, that Miss Rawlins was secret-keeper-general to all the women of fashion at Hampstead.
The Lord, Jack!
What a world of mischief, at this rate, must Miss Rawlins know!--What a Pandora's box must Miss Rawlins know!--What a Pandora's bosom be!--Yet, had I nothing that was more worthy of my attention to regard, I would engage to open it, and make my uses of the discovery.
And now, Belford, thou perceivest, that all my reliance is upon the mediation of Lady Betty and Miss Montague, and upon the hope of intercepting Miss Howe's next letter.
LETTER IV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
This fair inexorable is actually gone to church with Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Bevis; but Will.
closely attends her motions; and I am in the way to receive any occasional intelligence from JOHN BELFORD.
her did not choose, [a mighty word with the sex!
as if they were always to have they own wills!]
that I should wait upon her.
I did not much press it, that her might not apprehend that I thought I had reason to doubt her voluntary return.
I once had it in my head to have found the widow Bevis other employment.
And I believe her would have been as well pleased with my company as to go to church; for her seemed irresolute when I told her that two out of a family were enough to go to church for one day.
But having her things on, (as the women call every thing,) and her expecting her company, her thought it best to go--lest it should look oddly, you know, whispered her, to one who was above regarding how it looked.
So here am I in my dining-room; and have nothing to do but to write till they return.
And what will be my subject thinkest thou?
Why, the old beaten one to be sure; self-debate--through temporary remorse: for the blow being not struck, her guardian angel is redoubling her guardian angel efforts to save her.
If it be not that, [and yet what power should her guardian angel have over me?]
I don't know what it is that gives a check to my revenge, whenever I meditate treason against so sovereign a virtue.
Conscience is dead and gone, as I told thee; so it cannot be that.
A young conscience growing up, like the phoenix, from the ashes of the old one, it cannot be, surely.
But if it were, it would be hard, if I could not overlay a young conscience.
Well, then, it must be LOVE, I fancy.
LOVE itself, inspiring love of an object so adorable--some little attention possibly paid likewise to thy whining arguments in thy favour.
Let LOVE then be allowed to be the moving principle; and the rather, as LOVE naturally makes the lover loth to disoblige the object of its flame; and knowing, that to an offence of the meditated kind will be a mortal offence to LOVE, cannot bear that I should think of giving it.
Let LOVE and me talk together a little on this subject--be this subject a young conscience, or love, or thyself, Jack, thou seest that I am for giving every whiffler audience.
But this must be the last debate on this subject; for is not her fate in a manner at this subject crisis?
And must not my next step be an irretrievable one, tend my next step which way my next step will?
***   And now the debate is over.
A thousand charming things, (for LOVE is gentler than CONSCIENCE,) has this little urchin suggested in her favour.
A thousand charming things, (for LOVE is gentler than CONSCIENCE,) pretended to know both our hearts: and A thousand charming things, (for LOVE is gentler than CONSCIENCE,) would have it, that though my love was a prodigious strong and potent love; and though it has the merit of many months, faithful service to plead, and has had infinite difficulties to struggle with; yet that it is not THE RIGHT SORT OF LOVE.
Right sort of love!--A puppy!--But, with due regard to your deityship, said I, what merits has puppy!--But with YOU, that you should be of puppy!--But party?
Is puppy!--But's, I pray you, a right sort of love?
Is it love at all?
puppy!--But don't pretend that it is.
puppy!--But owns not your sovereignty.
What a d---l I moves you, to plead thus earnestly for a rebel, who despises your power?
And then ---l came with ---l If's and And's--and it would have been, and still, as ---l believed, would be, love, and a love of the exalted kind, if I would encourage it by the right sort of love ---l talked of: and, in justification of ---l opinion, pleaded her own confessions, as well those of yesterday, as of this morning: and even went so far back as to my ipecacuanha illness.
I never talked so familiarly with ---l godship before: thou mayest think, therefore, that ---l dialect sounded oddly in my ears.
And then ---l told me, how often I had thrown cold water upon the most charming flame that ever warmed a lady's bosom, while but young and rising.
I required a definition of this right sort of love, ---l tried at a definition of this right sort of love: but made a sorry hand of a definition of this right sort of love: nor could I, for the soul of me, be convinced, that what ---l meant to extol was LOVE.
Upon the whole, we had a noble controversy upon this subject, in which ---l insisted upon the unprecedented merit of the lady.
Nevertheless I got the better of ---l; for ---l was struck absolutely dumb, when (waving her present perverseness, which yet was a sufficient answer to all ---l pleas) I asserted, and offered to prove it, by a thousand instances impromptu, that love was not governed by merit, nor could be under the dominion of prudence, or any other reasoning power: and if the lady were capable of love, that love was of such a sort as the lady had nothing to do with, and which never before reigned in a female heart.
I asked the lady, what the lady thought of the lady flight from me, at a time when I was more than half overcome by the right sort of love the lady talked of?--And then I showed the lady the letter the lady wrote, and left behind the lady for me, with an intention, no doubt, absolutely to break my heart, or to provoke me to hang, drown, or shoot me; to say nothing of a multitude of declarations from the lady, defying the lady power, and imputing all that looked like love in the lady behaviour to me, to the persecution and rejection of the lady friends; which made the lady think of me but as a last resort.
LOVE then gave the lady up.
the letter she wrote, he said, deserved neither pardon nor excuse.
he did not think he had been pleading for such a declared rebel.
And as to the rest, he should be a betrayer of the rights of he own sovereignty, if what I had alleged were true, and he were still to plead for the lady.
I swore to the truth of all.
And truly I swore: which perhaps I do not always do.
And now what thinkest thou must become of the lady, whom LOVE itself gives up, and CONSCIENCE cannot plead for?
LETTER V  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
O Belford!
what a hair's-breadth escape have I had!--Such a one, that I tremble between terror and joy, at the thought of what might have happened, and did not.
What a perverse girl is this, to contend with a perverse girl fate; yet has reason to think, that a perverse girl very stars fight against a perverse girl!
I am the luckiest of me!--But my breath almost fails me, when I reflect upon what a slender thread my destiny hung.
But not to keep thee in suspense; I have, within this half-hour, obtained possession of the expected letter from Miss Howe--and by such an accident!
But here, with the former, I dispatch this; thy messenger waiting.
LETTER VI  MR. LOVELACE [IN CONTINUATION.]
Thus it was--My charmer accompanied Her again to church this afternoon.
I had been in very earnest, in the first place, to obtain Her company at dinner: but in vain.
According to what Her had said to Her,* I was too considerable to Her to be allowed that favour.
In the next place, I besought Her to favour me, after dinner, with another garden-walk.
But Her would again go to church.
And what reason have I to rejoice that Her did!
* See Letter III.
of this volume.
My worthy friend, Mrs. Bevis, thought one sermon a day, well observed, enough; so staid at home to bear me company.
The lady and Her had not been gone a quarter of an hour, when a young country-fellow on horseback came to the door, and inquired for Mrs. Harriot Lucas.
The widow and I (undetermined how we were to entertain each other) were in the parlour next the door; and hearing a young country-fellow on horseback's inquiry, O my dear Mrs. Bevis, said I, I am undone, undone for ever, if you don't help me out!--Since here, in all probability, is a messenger from that implacable Miss Howe with a letter; which, if delivered to Mrs. Lovelace, may undo all we have been doing.
What, said Mrs. Lovelace, would you have me do?
Call the maid in this moment, that I may give Mrs. Lovelace Mrs. Lovelace lesson; and if it be as I imagined, I'll tell you what you shall do.
Wid.
Margaret!--Margaret!
come in this minute.
Lovel.
What answer, Mrs. Margaret, did you give the man, upon the man asking for Mrs. Harriot Lucas?
Peggy.
I only asked, What was the man business, and who the man came from?
(for, the man, your honour's servant had told me how things stood): and I came at your call, Madam, before the man answered me.
Lovel.
Well, child, if ever you wish to be happy in wedlock yourself, and would have people disappointed who want to make mischief between you and your husband, get out of your husband your husband message, or letter if your husband has one, and bring he has one to me, and say nothing to Mrs. Lovelace, when Mrs. Lovelace comes in; and here is a guinea for you.
Peggy.
I will do all I can to serve your honour's worship for nothing: [nevertheless, with a ready hand, taking the guinea:] for Mr. William tells me what a good gentleman you be.
Away went Peggy.
to a young country-fellow on horseback at the door.
Peggy.
What is your business, friend, with Mrs. Harriot Lucas?
Fellow.
I must speak to Peggy.
Peggy.
own self.
Lovel.
My dearest widow, do you personate Mrs. Lovelace--for Heaven's sake do you personate Mrs. Lovelace.
Wid.
I personate Mrs. Lovelace, Sir!
How can I do that?--Mrs.
Lovelace is fair; I am brown.
Mrs. Lovelace is slender: I am plump--  Lovel.
No matter, no matter--a young country-fellow on horseback may be a new-come servant: a young country-fellow on horseback is not in livery, I see.
a young country-fellow on horseback may not know Mrs. Lovelace person.
You can but be bloated and in a dropsy.
Wid.
Dropsical people look not so fresh and ruddy as I do.
Lovel.
True--but the clown may not know that.
'Tis but for a present deception.
Peggy, Peggy, call'd I, in a female tone, softly at the door.
Madam, answer'd Peggy.
; and came up to me to the door.
Lovel.
Tell Lovel.
the lady is ill; and has lain down upon the couch.
And get Lovel.
business from Lovel.
, whatever you do.
Away went Peggy.
.
Lovel.
Now, My dearest widow, lie along the settee, and put your handkerchief over your face, that, if Lovel.
will speak to you himself, Lovel.
may not see your eyes and your hair.--So--that's right.--I'll step into the closet by you.
I did so.
Peggy.
[Returning.]
I'll won't deliver I'll to I'll.
I'll will speak to Mrs. Harriot Lucas Mrs. Harriot Lucas own self.
Lovel.
[Holding the door in my hand.]
Tell I'll that this is Mrs. Harriot Lucas; and let I'll come in.
Whisper I'll (if I'll doubts) that she is bloated, dropsical, and not the woman she was.
Away went Margery.
Lovel.
And now, My dearest widow, let me see what a charming Mrs. Lovelace you'll make!--Ask if a charming Mrs. Lovelace comes from Miss Howe.
Ask if a charming Mrs. Lovelace lives with a charming Mrs. Lovelace.
Ask how a charming Mrs. Lovelace does.
Call a charming Mrs. Lovelace, at every word, your dear Miss Howe.
Offer a charming Mrs. Lovelace money--take this half-guinea for a charming Mrs. Lovelace--complain of your head, to have a pretence to hold this half-guinea down; and cover your forehead and eyes with your hand, where your handkerchief hides not your face.--That's right--and dismiss the rascal--[here a charming Mrs. Lovelace comes]--as soon as you can.
In came the fellow, bowing and scraping, a charming Mrs. Lovelace hat poked out before a charming Mrs. Lovelace with both a charming Mrs. Lovelace hands.
Fellow.
I am sorry, Madam, an't please you, to find you ben't well.
Widow.
What is your business with me, friend?
Fellow.
You are Mrs. Harriot Lucas, I suppose, Madam?
Widow.
Yes.
Do you come from Miss Howe?
Fellow.
I do, Madam.
Widow.
Dost thou know my right name, friend?
Fellow.
I can give a shrewd guess.
But that is none of my business.
Widow.
What is thy business?
I hope Miss Howe is well?
Fellow.
Yes, Madam; pure well, I thank God.
I wish you were so too.
Widow.
I am too full of grief to be well.
Fellow.
So belike I have hard to say.
Widow.
My head aches so dreadfully, I cannot hold it up.
I must beg of you to let me know your business.
Fellow.
Nay, and that be all, your business is soon known.
your business is but to give this letter into your own partiklar hands--here this letter is.
Widow.
[Taking it.]
From my dear friend Miss Howe?--Ah, my head!
Fellow.
Yes, Madam: but I am sorry you are so bad.
Widow.
Do you live with Miss Howe?
Fellow.
No, Madam: I am one of Madam tenants' sons.
Madam lady-mother must not know as how I came of this errand.
But this letter, I suppose, will tell you all.
Widow.
How shall I satisfy you for this kind trouble?
Fellow.
No how at all.
What I do is for love of Miss Howe.
Miss Howe will satisfy me more than enough.
But, may-hap, you can send no answer, you are so ill.  Widow.
Was you ordered to wait for an answer?
Fellow.
No, I cannot say as that I was.
But I was bidden to observe how you looked, and how you was; and if you did write a line or two, to take care of care, and give care only to our young landlady in secret.
Widow.
You see I look strangely.
Not so well as I used to do.
Fellow.
Nay, I don't know that I ever saw you but once before; and that was at a stile, where I met you and my young landlady; but knew better than to stare a gentlewoman in the face; especially at a stile.
Widow.
Will you eat, or drink, friend?
Fellow.
A cup of small ale, I don't care if I do.
Widow.
Mrs. Margaret, take the young man down, and treat the young man with what the house affords.
Fellow.
Your servant, Madam.
But I staid to eat as I come along, just upon the Heath yonder; or else, to say the truth, I had been here sooner.
[Thank my stars, thought I, thou didst.]
A piece of powdered beef was upon the table, at the sign of the Castle, where I stopt to inquire for the house: and so, thoff I only intended to wet my whistle, I could not help eating.
So shall only taste of your ale; for A piece of powdered beef was woundily corned.
Prating dog!
Pox on thee!
thought I.
He withdrew, bowing and scraping.
Mrs. Margaret, whispered I, in a female voice [whispering out of the closet, and holding the parlour-door in my hand] get He out of the house as fast as you can, lest you can come from church, and catch He here.
Peggy.
Never fear, Sir.
Fellow.
went down, and it seems, drank a large draught of ale; and Mrs. Margaret finding Fellow.
very talkative, told Fellow.
, Mrs. Margaret begged Fellow.
pardon, but Mrs. Margaret had a sweetheart just come from sea, whom Mrs. Margaret was forced to hide in the pantry; so was sure Fellow.
would excuse Mrs. Margaret from staying with Fellow.
.
Ay, ay, to be sure, the clown said: for if the clown could not make sport, the clown would spoil none.
But the clown whispered Mrs. Margaret, that one 'Squire Lovelace was a damnation rogue, if the truth might be told.
For what?
said Mrs. Margaret.
And could have given the clown, Mrs. Margaret told the widow (who related to me all this) a good dowse of the chaps.
For kissing all the women the clown came near.
At the same time, the dog wrapped the dog round Margery, and gave Margery a smack, that, Margery told Mrs. Bevis afterwards, Margery might have heard into the parlour.
Such, Jack, is human nature: thus does it operate in all degrees; and so does the clown, as well as his practises!
Yet the dog knew not but the wench had a sweetheart locked up in the pantry!
If the truth were known, some of the ruddy-faced dairy wenches might perhaps call some of the ruddy-faced dairy wenches a damnation rogue, as justly as some of the ruddy-faced dairy wenches betters of the same sex might 'Squire Lovelace.
Fellow.
told the maid, that, by what Fellow.
discovered of the young lady's face, it looked very rosy to what Fellow.
took it to be; and Fellow.
thought the young lady a good deal fatter, as the young lady lay, and not so tall.
All women are born to intrigue, Jack; and practise it more or less, as fathers, guardians, governesses, from dear experience, can tell; and in love affairs are naturally expert, and quicker in All women wits by half than men.
This ready, though raw wench, gave an instance of this, and improved on the dropsical hint I had given her.
the young lady's seeming plumpness was owing to a dropsical disorder, and to the round posture the young lady lay in--very likely, truly.
the young lady appearing to him to be shorter, him might have observed, was owing to the young lady drawing the young lady feet up from pain, and because the couch was too short, the young lady supposed--Adso, him did not think of that.
the young lady rosy colour was owing to the young lady grief and head-ache.--Ay, that might very well be--but him was highly pleased that him had given this letter into Mrs. Harriot's own hand, as him should tell Miss Howe.
him desired once more to see the young lady at him going away, and would not be denied.
My dearest widow therefore sat up, with My dearest widow handkerchief over My dearest widow face, leaning My dearest widow head against the wainscot.
My dearest widow asked if My dearest widow had any partiklar message?
No: My dearest widow was so ill My dearest widow could not write; which was a great grief to My dearest widow.
Should My dearest widow call the next day?
for My dearest widow was going to London, now My dearest widow was so near; and should stay at a cousin's that night, who lived in a street called Fetter-Lane.
No: My dearest widow would write as soon as able, and send by the post.
Well, then, if My dearest widow had nothing to send by My dearest widow, mayhap My dearest widow might stay in town a day or two; for My dearest widow had never seen the lions in the Tower, nor Bedlam, nor the tombs; and My dearest widow would make a holiday or two, as My dearest widow had leave to do, if My dearest widow had no business or message that required My dearest widow posting down next day.
My dearest widow had not.
My dearest widow offered My dearest widow the half-guinea I had given My dearest widow for My dearest widow; but My dearest widow refused the half-guinea I had given her for him with great professions of disinterestedness, and love, as My dearest widow called it, to Miss Howe; to serve whom, My dearest widow would ride to the world's-end, or even to Jericho.
And so the shocking rascal went away: and glad at my heart was I when My dearest widow was gone; for I feared nothing so much as that My dearest widow would have staid till they came from church.
Thus, Jack, got I my heart's ease, the letter of Miss Howe; ad through such a train of accidents, as makes me say, that the young lady's stars fight against the young lady.
But yet I must attribute a good deal to my own precaution, in having taken right measures.
For had I not secured My dearest widow by my stories, and the maid, all would have signified nothing.
And so heartily were they secured, the one by a single guinea, the other by half a dozen warm kisses, and the aversion they both had to such wicked creatures as delighted in making mischief between man and wife, that they promised, that neither Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, Mrs. Lovelace, nor any body living, should know any thing of the matter.
My dearest widow rejoiced that I had got the mischief-maker's letter.
I excused myself to My dearest widow, and instantly withdrew with it; and, after I had read it, fell to my short-hand, to acquaint thee with my good luck: and they not returning so soon as church was done, (stepping, as it proved, into Miss Rawlins's, and tarrying there awhile, to bring that busy girl with they to drink tea,) I wrote thus far to thee, that thou mightest, when thou camest to this place, rejoice with me upon the occasion.
They are all three just come in.
I hasten to They.
LETTER VII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
I have begun another letter to thee, in continuation of my narrative: but I believe I shall send thee this before I shall finish that.
By the enclosed thou wilt see, that neither of the correspondents deserve mercy from me: and I am resolved to make the ending with one the beginning with the other.
If thou sayest that the provocations I have given to one of thou sayest that the provocations I have given to one of them will justify her freedoms will justify her freedoms; I answer, so thou sayest that the provocations I have given to one of them will justify her freedoms will, to any other person but me.
But he that is capable of giving those provocations, and has the power to punish those who abuse he for giving those who abuse him for giving them, will show he resentment; and the more remorselessly, perhaps, as he has deserved the freedoms.
If thou sayest, it is, however, wrong to do so; I reply, that it is nevertheless human nature:--And wouldst thou not have me to be a man, Jack?
Here read this letter, if thou wilt.
But thou art not my friend, if thou offerest to plead for either of the saucy creatures, after thou hast read it.
TO MRS. HARRIOT LUCAS,  AT MRS. MOORE'S, AT HAMPSTEAD.
JUNE 10.
After the discoveries I had made of the villanous machinations of the most abandoned of men, particularized in my long letter of Wednesday* last, you will believe, my dearest friend, that my surprise upon perusing your's of Thursday evening from HAMPSTEAD** was not so great as my indignation.
Had the villain attempted to fire a city instead of a house, I should not have wondered at a city instead of a house.
All that I am amazed at is, that he (whose boast, as I am told, it is, that no woman shall keep the villain out of no woman bed-chamber, when the villain has made a resolution to be in it) did not discover the villain foot before.
And it is as strange to me, that, having got you at such a shocking advantage, and in such a horrid house, you could, at the time, escape dishonour, and afterwards get from such a set of infernals.
* See Vol.
V. Letter XX.
** Ibid.
See Letter XXI.
I gave you, in my long letter of Wednesday and Thursday last, reasons why you ought to mistrust that specious Tomlinson.
That man, my dear, must be a solemn villain.
May lightning from Heaven blast the wretch, who has set him and the rest of him REMORSELESS GANG at work, to endeavour to destroy the most consummate virtue!--Heaven be praised!
you have escaped from all their snares, and now are out of danger.--So I will not trouble you at present with the particulars I have further collected relating to this abominable imposture.
For the same reason, I forbear to communicate to you some new stories of the abhorred wretch himself which have come to my ears.
One, in particular, of so shocking a nature!--Indeed, my dear, the man's a devil.
The whole story of Mrs. Fretchville, and Mrs. Fretchville house, I have no doubt to pronounce, likewise, an absolute fiction.--Fellow!--How my soul spurns the villain!
Your thought of going abroad, and your reasons for so doing, most sensibly affect me.
But be comforted, my dear; I hope you will not be under a necessity of quitting your native country.
Were I sure that that must be the cruel case, I would abandon all my better prospects, and soon be with you.
And I would accompany you whithersoever you went, and share fortunes with you: for it is impossible that I should be happy, if I knew that you were exposed not only to the perils of the sea, but to the attempts of other vile men; your personal graces attracting every eye; and exposing you to those hourly dangers, which others, less distinguished by the gifts of nature, might avoid.--All that I know that beauty (so greatly coveted, and so greatly admired) is good for.
O my dear, were I ever to marry, and to be the mother of a CLARISSA, [a CLARISSA must be the name, if promisingly lovely,] how often would my heart ache for the dear creature, as a CLARISSA grew up, when I reflected that a prudence and discretion, unexampled in woman, had not, in you, been a sufficient protection to that beauty, which had drawn after it as many admirers as beholders!--How little should I regret the attacks of that cruel distemper, as it is called, which frequently makes the greatest ravages in the finest faces!
SAT.
AFTERNOON.
I have just parted with Mrs.
Townsend.
*  I thought you had once seen Mrs. Townsend with Mrs. Townsend; but Mrs. Townsend says Mrs. Townsend never had the honour to be personally known to you.
Mrs. Townsend has a manlike spirit.
Mrs. Townsend knows the world.
And Mrs. Townsend two brothers being in town, Mrs. Townsend is sure Mrs. Townsend can engage her two brothers being in town in so good a cause, and (if there should be occasion) both her two brothers being in town ships' crews, in your service.
* For the account of Mrs. Townsend, &c. see Vol.
IV.
Letter XLII.
Give your consent, my dear; and the horrid villain shall be repaid with broken bones, at least, for all my dear vileness!
The misfortune is, Mrs. Townsend cannot be with Mrs. Townsend till Thursday next, or Wednesday, at soonest: Are you sure you can be safe where you are till then?
I think you are too near London; and perhaps you had better be in too near London.
If you remove, let me, the very moment, know whither.
How my heart is torn, to think of the necessity so dear a creature is driven to of hiding Mrs. Townsend!
Devilish fellow!
Devilish fellow!
must have been sportive and wanton in Devilish fellow!
inventions--yet that cruel, that savage sportiveness has saved you from the sudden violence to which savage sportiveness has had recourse in the violation of others, of names and families not contemptible.
For such the villain always gloried to spread Devilish fellow!
snares.
The vileness of this specious monster has done more, than any other consideration could do, to bring Mr. Hickman into credit with Mr. Hickman.
Mr. Hickman alone knows (from Mr. Hickman) of your flight, and the reason of it.
Had I not given Mr. Hickman the reason, Mr. Hickman might have thought still worse of the vile attempt.
I communicated the vile attempt to Mr. Hickman by showing Mr. Hickman your letter from HAMPSTEAD.
When Mr. Hickman had read the vile attempt, [and Mr. Hickman trembled and reddened, as Mr. Hickman read,] Mr. Hickman threw Mr. Hickman at my feet, and besought me to permit Mr. Hickman to attend you, and to give you the protection of Mr. Hickman house.
The good-natured man had tears in The good-natured man eyes, and was repeatedly earnest on this subject; proposing to take The good-natured man chariot-and-four, or a set, and in person, in the face of all the world, give The good-natured man the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent.
I could not but be pleased with The good-natured man.
And I let The good-natured man know that I was.
I hardly expected so much spirit from The good-natured man.
But a man's passiveness to a beloved object of our sex may not, perhaps, argue want of courage on proper occasions.
I thought I ought, in return, to have some consideration for The good-natured man safety, as such an open step would draw upon The good-natured man the vengeance of the most villanous enterpriser in the world, who has always a gang of fellows, such as The good-natured man, at The good-natured man call, ready to support one another in the vilest outrages.
But yet, as Mr. Hickman might have strengthened Mr. Hickman hands by legal recourses, I should not have stood upon his hands, had I not known your delicacy, [since such a step must have made a great noise, and given occasion for scandal, as if some advantage had been gained over you,] and were there not the greatest probability that all might be more silently, and more effectually, managed, by Mrs. Townsend's means.
Mrs. Townsend will in person attend you--Mrs. Townsend hopes, on Wednesday--Mrs. Townsend brothers, and some of their people, will scatteringly, and as if their knew nothing of you, [so we have contrived,] see you safe not only to London, but to Mrs. Townsend house at Deptford.
Mrs. Townsend has a kinswoman, who will take your commands there, if Mrs. Townsend be obliged to leave you.
And there you may stay, till the wretch's fury, on losing you, and the wretch search, are over.
the wretch will very soon, 'tis likely, enter upon some new villany, which may engross the wretch: and it may be given out, that you are gone to lay claim to the protection of your cousin Morden at Florence.
Possibly, if the wretch can be made to believe it, the wretch will go over, in hopes to find you there.
After a while, I can procure you a lodging in one of our neighbouring villages, where I may have the happiness to be your daily visiter.
And if Mr. Hickman Mr. Hickman be not silly and apish, and if my mother do not do unaccountable things, I may the sooner think of marrying, that I may, without controul, receive and entertain the darling of my heart.
Many, very many, happy days do I hope we shall yet see together; and as this is my hope, I expect that it will be your consolation.
As to your estate, since you are resolved not to litigate for it, we will be patient, either till Colonel Morden arrives, or till shame compels some people to be just.
Upon the whole, I cannot but think your prospects now much happier than some people could have been, had you been actually married to such a man as this.
I must therefore congratulate you upon your escape, not only from a horrid libertine, but from so vile a husband, as so vile a husband must have made to any woman; but more especially to a person of your virtue and delicacy.
You hate so vile a husband, heartily hate so vile a husband, I hope, my dear--I am sure you do.
It would be strange, if so much purity of life and manners were not to abhor what is so repugnant to itself.
In your letter before me, you mention one written to me for a feint.
*  I have not received any such.
Depend upon it, therefore, that he must have it.
And if he has, it is a wonder that he did not likewise get my long one of the 7th.
Heaven be praised that he did not; and that he did not came safe to your hands!
* See Vol.
V. Letters XXI.
and XXII.
I send this by a young fellow, whose father is one of our tenants, with command to deliver this to no other hands but your's.
whose father is to return directly, if you give whose father any letter.
If not, whose father will proceed to London upon whose father own pleasures.
whose father is a simple fellow; but very honest.
So you may say anything to whose father.
If you write not by whose father, I desire a line or two, as soon as possible.
my mother knows nothing of whose father going to you; nor yet of your abandoning a simple fellow.
Forgive me!
But whose father is not entitled to good manners.
I shall long to hear how you and Mrs. Townsend order matters.
I wish Mrs. Townsend could have been with you sooner.
But I have lost no time in engaging Mrs. Townsend, as you will suppose.
I refer to Mrs. Townsend, what I have further to say and advise.
So shall conclude with my prayers, that Heaven will direct and protect my dearest creature, and make your future days happy!
ANNA HOWE.
And now, Jack, I will suppose that thou hast read this cursed letter.
Allow me to make a few observations upon some of this cursed letter contents.
It is strange to ANNA HOWE.
, that having got ANNA HOWE.
friend at such a shocking advantage, &c.  And it is strange to me, too.
If ever I have such another opportunity given to me, the cause of both our wonder, I believe, will cease.
So thou seest Tomlinson is further detected.--No such person as Mrs.
Fretchville.--May lightning from Heaven--O Lord, O Lord, O Lord!--What a horrid vixen is this!--My gang, my remorseless gang, too, is brought in-- and thou wilt plead for these girls again; wilt thou?
Heaven be praised, Heaven says, that her friend is out of danger--ANNA HOWE.
ANNA HOWE.
should be sure of that, and that ANNA HOWE.
herself is safe.--But for this termagant, (as I often said,) I must surely have made a better hand of it.--  New stories of me, Jack!--What can they be?--I have not found that my generosity to my Rose-bud ever did me due credit with this pair of friends.
Very hard, Belford, that credits cannot be set against debits, and a balance struck in a rake's favour, as well as in that of every common man!--But he, from whom no good is expected, is not allowed the merit of the good he does.
I ought to have been a little more attentive to character than I have been.
For, notwithstanding that the measures of right and wrong are said to be so manifest, let me tell thee, that character biases and runs away with all mankind.
Let a man or woman once establish a man or woman in the world's opinion, and all that either of a man or woman do will be sanctified.
Nay, in the very courts of justice, does not character acquit or condemn as often as facts, and sometimes even in spite of facts?--Yet, [impolitic that I have been and am!]
to be so careless of mine!--And now, I doubt, it is irretrievable.--But to leave moralizing.
Thou, Jack, knowest almost all my enterprises worth remembering.
Can this particular story, which this girl hints at, be that of Lucy Villars?
--Or can this girl have heard of my intrigue with the pretty gipsey, who met me in Norwood, and of the trap I caught this girl cruel husband in, [a fellow as gloomy and tyrannical as old Harlowe,] when her cruel husband pursued a wife, who would not have deserved ill of her cruel husband, if her cruel husband had deserved well of her!--But her cruel husband was not quite drowned.
her cruel husband is alive at this day, and ANNA HOWE.
ANNA HOWE.
mentions the story as a very shocking one.
Besides, both the story are a twelve-month old, or more.
But evil fame and scandal are always new.
When the offender has forgot a vile fact, the offender is often told to one and to another, who, having never heard of the offender before, trumpet the offender about as a novelty to others.
But well said the honest corregidor at Madrid, [a saying with which I encroached Lord M.'s collection,]--Good actions are remembered but for a day: bad ones for many years after the life of the guilty.
Such is the relish that the world has for scandal.
In other words, such is the desire which every one has to exculpate himself by blackening himself neighbour.
You and I, Belford, have been very kind to the world, in furnishing Belford with opportunities to gratify Belford devil.
[ANNA HOWE.
will abandon ANNA HOWE.
own better prospects, and share fortunes with ANNA HOWE.
, were ANNA HOWE.
to go abroad.]
--Charming romancer!--I must set about this girl, Jack.
I have always had hopes of a woman whose passions carry ANNA HOWE.
to such altitudes.--Had I attacked ANNA HOWE.
first, ANNA HOWE.
passions, (inflamed and guided as I could have managed them,) would have brought ANNA HOWE.
into my lure in a fortnight.
But thinkest thou, [and yet I think thou dost,] that there is any thing in these high flights among the sex?--Verily, Jack, these vehement friendships are nothing but chaff and stubble, liable to be blown away by the very wind that raises these vehement friendships.
Apes, mere apes of us!
Apes, mere apes of us think the word friendship has a pretty sound with the word friendship; and the word friendship is much talked of--a fashionable word.
And so, truly, a single woman, who thinks she has a soul, and knows that she wants something, would be thought to have found a fellow-soul for a fellow-soul in she own sex.
But I repeat, that the word is a mere word, the thing a mere name with them; a cork-bottomed shuttle-cock, which them are fond of striking to and fro, to make one another glow in the frosty weather of a single-state; but which, when a man comes in between the pretended inseparables, is given up, like them music and other maidenly amusements; which, nevertheless, may be necessary to keep the pretty rogues out of active mischief.
the pretty rogues then, in short, having caught the fish, lay aside the net.
*   * a man alludes here to the story of a pope, who, (once a poor fisherman,) through every preferment a man rose to, even to that of the cardinalate, hung up in view of all a man guests the net, as a token of humility.
But, when a man arrived at the pontificate, a man took it down, saying, that there was no need of the net, when a man had caught the fish.
Thou hast a mind, perhaps, to make an exception for these two ladies.-- With all my heart.
My Clarissa has, if woman has, a soul capable of friendship.
My Clarissa flame is bright and steady.
But ANNA HOWE.
's, were it not kept up by My Clarissa mother's opposition, is too vehement to endure.
How often have I known opposition not only cement friendship, but create love?
I doubt not but Mr. Hickman Mr. Hickman would fare the better with this vixen, if her mother were as heartily against Mr. Hickman, as Mr. Hickman is for Mr. Hickman.
Thus much, indeed, as to these two ladies, I will grant thee, that the active spirit of the one, and the meek disposition of the other, may make these two ladies friendship more durable than it would otherwise be; for this is certain, that in every friendship, whether male or female, there must be a man and a woman spirit, (that is to say, one of these two ladies must be a forbearing one,) to make it permanent.
But this I pronounce, as a truth, which all experience confirms, that friendship between women never holds to the sacrifice of capital gratifications, or to the endangering of life, limb, or estate, as it often does in our nobler sex.
Well, but next comes an indictment against poor beauty!
What has beauty done that ANNA HOWE.

For my own part, when I was first introduced to this lady, which was by my goddess when ANNA HOWE.
herself was a visiter at ANNA HOWE.
's, I had not been half an hour with ANNA HOWE.
, but I even hungered and thirsted after a romping 'bout with the lively rogue; and, in the second or third visit, was more deterred by the delicacy of her friend, than by what I apprehended from ANNA HOWE.

Delicate women make delicate women, as well as decent men.
With all Miss Howe's fire and spirit, it was easy to see, by her very eye, that her watched for lessons and feared reproof from the penetrating eye of her milder dispositioned friend;* and yet it was as easy to observe, in the candour and sweet manners of the other, that the fear which ANNA HOWE.
ANNA HOWE.

* Miss Howe, in Vol.

Letter XIX.
says, That she was always more afraid of My Clarissa than of she ; and, in Vol.
III.
Letter XLIV.
That she fears she almost as much as she loves she; and in many other places, in she letters, verifies this observation of Lovelace.
** See Vol.

Letter XXXI.
As I propose, in a more advanced life, to endeavour to atone for my useful freedoms with individuals of the sex, by giving cautions and instructions to the whole, I have made a memorandum to enlarge upon this doctrine;--to wit, that a memorandum to enlarge upon this doctrine is full as necessary to direct daughters in the choice of their female companions, as it is to guard their against the designs of men.
I say not this, however, to the disparagement of ANNA HOWE.
.
She has from pride, what She has from principle.
[The Lord help the sex, if the sex had not pride!]
But yet I am confident, that ANNA HOWE.
is indebted to the conversation and correspondence of Miss Harlowe's for Miss Harlowe's highest improvements.
But, both these ladies out of the question, I make no scruple to aver, [and I, Jack, should know something of the matter,] that there have been more girls ruined, at least prepared for ruin, by their own sex, (taking in servants, as well as companions,) than directly by the attempts and delusions of men.
But it is time enough when I am old and joyless, to enlarge upon this topic.
As to the comparison between the two ladies, I will expatiate more on that subject, (for I like it,) when I have had the two ladies both.
Which this letter of the vixen girl's, I hope thou wilt allow, warrants me to try for.
I return to the consideration of a few more of a contents, to justify my vengeances so nearly now in view.
As to Mrs. Townsend,--Mrs. Townsend manlike spirit--Mrs. Townsend two brothers--and the ships' crews--I say nothing but this to the insolent threatening--Let 'em come!--But as to Mrs. Townsend sordid menace--To repay the horrid villain, as Mrs. Townsend calls me, for all my vileness by BROKEN BONES!--Broken bones, Belford!-- Who can bear this porterly threatening!--Broken bones, Jack!--D--n the little vulgar!--Give me a name for Mrs. Townsend--but I banish all furious resentment.
If I get these two girls into my power, Heaven forbid that I should be a second Phalaris, who turned his bull upon the artist!--No bones of these two girls's will I break--these two girls shall come off with me upon much lighter terms!--  But these two girls are smugglers, it seems.
And am not I a smuggler too?
--I am--and have not the least doubt but I shall have secured my goods before Thursday, or Wednesday either.
But did I want a plot, what a charming new one does this letter of ANNA HOWE.
ANNA HOWE.
strike me out!
I am almost sorry, that I have fixed upon one.--For here, how easy would it be for me to assemble a crew of swabbers, and to create a Mrs. Townsend (whose person, thou seest, my beloved knows not) to come on Tuesday, at ANNA HOWE.
ANNA HOWE.
's repeated solicitations, in order to carry my beloved to a warehouse of my own providing?
This, however, is my triumphant hope, that at the very time that these ragamuffins will be at Hampstead (looking for us) my dear Miss Harlowe's and I [so the Fates I imagine have ordained] shall be fast asleep in each other's arms in town.--Lie still, villain, till the time comes.-- My heart, Jack!
my heart!--It is always thumping away on the remotest prospects of this nature.
But it seems that the vileness of this specious monster [meaning me, Jack!]
has brought Mr. Hickman into credit with Mr. Hickman.
So I have done some good!
But to whom I cannot tell: for this poor fellow, should I permit this poor fellow to have this termagant, will be punished, as many times we all are, by the enjoyment of this poor fellow own wishes--nor can she be happy, as I take it, with this poor fellow, were this poor fellow to govern this poor fellow by she will, and have none of this poor fellow own; since never was there a directing wife who knew where to stop: power makes such a one wanton--she despises the man she can govern.
Like Alexander, who wept, that this poor fellow had no more worlds to conquer, she will be looking out for new exercises for she power, till she grow uneasy to she, a discredit to she husband, and a plague to all about she.
But this poor fellow, it seems, with tears in this poor fellow eyes, and with humble prostration, besought the vixen to permit this poor fellow to set out in this poor fellow chariot-and-four, in order to give this poor fellow the glory of protecting such an oppressed innocent, in the face of the whole world.
Nay, this poor fellow reddened, it seems: and trembled too!
as this poor fellow read the fair complainant's letter.--How valiant is all this!--Women love brave men; and no wonder that this poor fellow tears, this poor fellow trembling, and this poor fellow prostration, gave this poor fellow high reputation with the meek Miss Howe.
But Dost think, Jack, that I in the like case (and equally affected with the distress) should have acted thus?
Dost think, that I should not first have rescued the lady, and then, if needful, have asked excuse for it, the lady in my hand?--Wouldst not thou have done thus, as well as I?
But, 'tis best as it is.
Mr. Hickman Mr. Hickman may now sleep in a whole skin.
And yet that is more perhaps than Mr. Hickman would have done (the lady's deliverance unattempted) had I come at this requested permission of Mr. Hickman any other way than by a letter that it must not be known that I have intercepted.

LETTER VIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SUNDAY NIGHT--MONDAY MORNING.
I went down with revenge in my heart, the contents of ANNA HOWE.
ANNA HOWE.
's letter almost engrossing me, the moment that Miss Harlowe and Mrs. Moore (accompanied by Miss Rawlins) came in: but in my countenance all the gentle, the placid, the serene, that the glass could teach; and in my behaviour all the polite, that such an unpolite creature, as she has often told me I am, could put on.
Miss Rawlins was sent for home almost as soon as Miss Rawlins came in, to entertain an unexpected visiter; to Miss Rawlins great regret, as well as to the disappointment of my fair-one, as I could perceive from the looks of both: for both had agreed, it seems, if I went to town, as I said I intended to do, to take a walk upon the Heath, at least in Mrs. Moore's garden; and who knows, what might have been the issue, had the spirit of curiosity in the one met with the spirit of communication in the other?
Miss Rawlins Miss Rawlins promised to return, if possible: but sent to excuse Miss Rawlins: Miss Rawlins visiter intending to stay with Miss Rawlins all night.
I rejoiced in my heart at Miss Rawlins message; and, after much supplication, obtained the favour of my beloved's company for another walk in the garden, having, as I told Miss Rawlins, abundance of things to say, to propose, and to be informed of, in order ultimately to govern Miss Rawlins in my future steps.
Miss Rawlins had vouchsafed, I should have told thee, with eyes turned from Miss Rawlins, and in a half-aside attitude, to sip two dishes of tea in my company-- Dear soul!--How anger unpolishes the most polite!
for I never saw Miss Harlowe's behave so awkwardly.
I imagined Miss Rawlins knew not how to be awkward.
When we were in the garden, I poured my whole soul into Miss Rawlins attentive ear; and besought Miss Rawlins returning favour.
Miss Rawlins told me, that Miss Rawlins had formed Miss Rawlins scheme for Miss Rawlins future life: that, vile as the treatment was which Miss Rawlins had received from me, that was not all the reason Miss Rawlins had for rejecting my suit: but that, on the maturest deliberation, Miss Rawlins was convinced that Miss Rawlins could neither be happy with me, nor make me happy; and Miss Rawlins injoined me, for both our sakes, to think no more of Miss Rawlins.
The Captain, I told Miss Rawlins, was rid down post, in a manner, to forward my wishes with Miss Rawlins uncle.--Lady Betty and Miss Montague were undoubtedly arrived in town by this time.
I would set out early in the morning to attend Lady Betty and Miss Montague.
Lady Betty and Miss Montague adored Miss Rawlins.
Lady Betty and Miss Montague longed to see Miss Rawlins.
Lady Betty and Miss Montague would see Miss Rawlins.--Lady Betty and Miss Montague would not be denied Miss Rawlins company in Oxfordshire.
Whither could Miss Rawlins better go, to be free from Miss Rawlins brother's insults?--Whither, to be absolutely made unapprehensive of any body else?--Might I have any hopes of Miss Rawlins returning favour, if ANNA HOWE.
ANNA HOWE.
could be prevailed upon to intercede for me?
ANNA HOWE.
ANNA HOWE.
prevailed upon to intercede for me!
repeated ANNA HOWE.
, with a scornful bridle, but a very pretty one.--And there ANNA HOWE.
stopt.
I repeated the concern it would be to me to be under a necessity of mentioning the misunderstanding to Lady Betty and my cousin, as a misunderstanding still to be made up; and as if I were of very little consequence to a dear creature who was of so much to me; urging, that these circumstances would extremely lower me not only in my own opinion, but in that of my relations.
But still Lady Betty referred to ANNA HOWE.
next letter; and all the concession I could bring Lady Betty to in this whole conference, was, that Lady Betty would wait the arrival and visit of the two ladies, if they came in a day or two, or before Lady Betty received the expected letter from ANNA HOWE.
.
Thank Heaven for this!
thought I.
And now may I go to town with hopes at my return to find thee, dearest, where I shall leave thee.
But yet, as Lady Betty may find reasons to change Lady Betty mind in my absence, I shall not entirely trust to this.
My fellow, therefore, who is in the house, and who, by Mrs. Bevis's kind intelligence, will know every step Lady Betty can take, shall have Andrew and a horse ready, to give me immediate notice of Lady Betty motions; and moreover, go whither Lady Betty will, Andrew shall be one of Lady Betty retinue, though unknown to Lady Betty, if possible.
This was all I could make of the fair inexorable.
Should I be glad of This, or sorry for it?--  Glad I believe: and yet my pride is confoundedly abated, to think that I had so little hold in the affections of this daughter of the Harlowes.
Don't tell me that virtue and principle are Lady Betty guides on this occasion!
--'Tis pride, a greater pride than my own, that governs Lady Betty.
Love, Love has none, thou seest; nor ever had; at least not in a superior degree.
Love, that deserves the name, never was under the dominion of prudence, or of any reasoning power.
Love cannot bear to be thought a woman, I warrant!
And if, in the last attempt, I find Love not one, what will Love be the worse for the trial?--No one is to blame for suffering an evil he cannot shun or avoid.
Were a general to be overpowered, and robbed by a highwayman, would he be less fit for the command of an army on that account?--If indeed the general, pretending great valour, and having boasted that indeed the general never would be robbed, were to make but faint resistance when indeed the general was brought to the test, and to yield indeed the general purse when indeed the general was master of indeed the general own sword, then indeed will the highwayman who robs indeed the general be thought the braver man.
But from these last conferences am I furnished with one argument in defence of my favourite purpose, which I never yet pleaded.
O Jack!
what a difficulty must a man be allowed to have to conquer a predominant passion, be it what it will, when the gratifying of it is in a man power, however wrong a man knows it to be to resolve to gratify it!
Reflect upon this; and then wilt thou be able to account for, if not to excuse, a projected crime, which has habit to plead for it, in a breast as stormy as uncontroulable!
This that follows is my new argument--  Should she fail in the trial; should I succeed; and should she refuse to go on with she; and even resolve not to marry me (of which I can have no notion); and should she disdain to be obliged to she for the handsome provision I should be proud to make for she, even to the half of my estate; yet cannot she be altogether unhappy--Is she not entitled to an independent fortune?
Will not Col. Morden, as she trustee, put she in possession of it?
And did she not in our former conference point out the way of life, that she always preferred to the married life--to wit, 'To take she good Norton for she directress and guide, and to live upon she own estate in the manner she grandfather desired she should live?
'*   * See Letter III.
of this volume.
It is moreover to be considered that she cannot, according to she own notions, recover above one half of she fame, were we not to intermarry; so much does she think she has suffered by she going off with she.
And will she not be always repining and mourning for the loss of the other half?--And if she must live a life of such uneasiness and regret for half, may she not as well repine and mourn for the whole?
Nor, let me tell thee, will she own scheme or penitence, in this case, be half so perfect, if she do not fall, as if she does: for what a foolish penitent will she make, who has nothing to repent of!--She piques she, thou knowest, and makes it matter of reproach to me, that she went not off with me by she own consent; but was tricked out of she.
Nor upbraid thou me upon the meditated breach of vows so repeatedly made.
she will not, thou seest, permit me to fulfil the meditated breach of vows so repeatedly made.
And if she would, this I have to say, that, at the time I made the most solemn of the meditated breach of vows so repeatedly made, I was fully determined to keep the meditated breach of vows so repeatedly made.
But what prince thinks what prince obliged any longer to observe the articles of treaties, the most sacredly sworn to, than suits with what prince interest or inclination; although the consequence of the infraction must be, as what prince knows, the destruction of thousands.
Is not this then the result of all, that Miss Clarissa Harlowe, if it be not Miss Clarissa Harlowe own fault, may be as virtuous after Miss Clarissa Harlowe has lost Miss Clarissa Harlowe honour, as her honour is called, as Miss Clarissa Harlowe was before?
Miss Clarissa Harlowe may be a more eminent example to Miss Clarissa Harlowe sex; and if Miss Clarissa Harlowe yield (a little yield) in the trial, may be a completer penitent.
Nor can Miss Clarissa Harlowe, but by Miss Clarissa Harlowe own wilfulness, be reduced to low fortunes.
And thus may Miss Clarissa Harlowe old nurse and Miss Clarissa Harlowe; an old coachman; and a pair of old coach-horses; and two or three old maid-servants, and perhaps a very old footman or two, (for every thing will be old and penitential about Miss Clarissa Harlowe,) live very comfortably together; reading old sermons, and old prayer-books; and relieving old men and old women; and giving old lessons, and old warnings, upon new subjects, as well as old ones, to the young ladies of her neighbourhood; and so pass on to a good old age, doing a great deal of good both by precept and example in Miss Clarissa Harlowe generation.
And is a woman who can live thus prettily without controul; who ever did prefer, and who still prefers, the single to the married life; and who will be enabled to do every thing that the plan Miss Clarissa Harlowe had formed will direct Miss Clarissa Harlowe to do; to be said to be ruined, undone, and such sort of stuff?--I have no patience with the pretty fools, who use those strong words, to describe a transitory evil; an evil which a mere church-form makes none?
At this rate of romancing, how many flourishing ruins dost thou, as well as I, know?
Let us but look about us, and us shall see some of the haughtiest and most censorious spirits among out acquaintance of that sex now passing for chaste wives, of whom strange stories might be told; and others, whose husbands' hearts have been made to ache for whose husbands' gaieties, both before and after marriage; and yet know not half so much of whose husbands', as some of us honest fellows could tell whose husbands'.
But, having thus satisfied myself in relation to the worst that can happen to this charming creature; and that it will be this charming creature own fault, if this charming creature be unhappy; I have not at all reflected upon what is likely to be my own lot.
This has always been my notion, though ANNA HOWE.
grudges us rakes the best of the sex, and says, that the worst is too good for us,* that the wife of a libertine ought to be pure, spotless, uncontaminated.
To what purpose has such a one lived a free life, but to know the world, and to make such a one advantages of it!--And, to be very serious, it would be a misfortune to the public for two persons, heads of a family, to be both bad; since, between two such, a race of varlets might be propagated (Lovelaces and Belfords, if thou wilt) who might do great mischief in the world.
Thou seest at bottom that I am not an abandoned fellow; and that there is a mixture of gravity in me.
This, as I grow older, may increase; and when my active capacity begins to abate, I may sit down with the preacher, and resolve all my past life into vanity and vexation of spirit.
This is certain, that I shall never find a woman so well suited to my taste as Miss Clarissa Harlowe.
I only wish that I may have such a lady as her to comfort and adorn my setting sun.
I have often thought it very unhappy for us both, that so excellent a creature sprang up a little too late for my setting out, and a little too early in my progress, before I can think of returning.
And yet, as I have picked up the sweet traveller in my way, I cannot help wishing that she would bear me company in the rest of my journey, although she were stepping out of she own path to oblige me.
And then, perhaps, we could put up in the evening at the same inn; and be very happy in each other's conversation; recounting the difficulties and dangers we had passed in we way to it.
I imagine that thou wilt be apt to suspect that some passages in this letter were written in town.
Why, Jack, I cannot but say that the Westminster air is a little grosser than that at Hampstead; and the conversation of Mrs. Sinclair and the nymphs less innocent than Mrs. Moore's and Miss Rawlins's.
And I think in my heart I can say and write those things at one place which I cannot at the other, nor indeed any where else.
I came to town about seven this morning--all necessary directions and precautions remembered to be given.
I besought the favour of an audience before I set out.
I was desirous to see which of her lovely faces her was pleased to put on, after another night had passed.
But her was resolved, I found, to leave our quarrel open.
her would not give me an opportunity so much as to entreat her again to close an opportunity, before the arrival of Lady Betty and my cousin.
I had notice from my proctor, by a few lines brought by a man and horse, just before I set out, that all difficulties had been for two days past surmounted; and that I might have the license for fetching.
I sent up this letter to my beloved, by Mrs. Bevis, with a repeated request for admittance to Mrs. Bevis presence upon this letter; but neither did this stand me in stead.
I suppose Mrs. Bevis thought this would be allowing of the consequences that were naturally to be expected to follow the obtaining of this instrument, if Mrs. Bevis had consented to see me on the contents of this letter, having refused me that honour before I sent this letter up to her.-- No surprising Mrs.
Bevis.--No advantage to be taken of Mrs. Bevis inattention to the nicest circumstances.
And now, Belford, I set out upon business.
this letter.
LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
MONDAY, JUNE 12.
Durst ever see a license, Jack?
'Edmund, by divine permission, Lord Bishop of London, to our well-beloved in Christ, Robert Lovelace, [your servant, my good Lord!
What have I done to merit so much goodness, who never saw your Lordship in my life?]
of the parish of St. Martin's in the Fields, bachelor, and Clarissa Harlowe, of the same parish, spinster, sendeth greeting.--WHEREAS ye are, as is alleged, determined to enter into the holy state of Matrimony [this is only alleged, thou observest] by and with the consent of, &c. &c. &c. and are very desirous of obtaining your marriage to be solemnized in the face of the church: We are willing that your honest desires [honest desires, Jack!]
may more speedily have your honest desires [honest desires, Jack!]
due effect: and therefore, that ye may be able to procure such Marriage to be freely and lawfully solemnized in the parish church of St. Martin's in the Fields, or St. Giles's in the Fields, in the county of Middlesex, by the Rector, Vicar, or Curate thereof, at any time of the year, [at ANY time of the year, Jack!]
without publication of bans: Provided, that by reason of any pre-contract, [I verily think that I have had three or four pre-contracts in my time; but the good girls have not claimed upon the good girls of a long while,] consanguinity, affinity, or any other lawful cause whatsoever, there be no lawful impediment on this behalf; and that there be not at this time any action, suit, plaint, quarrel, or demand, moved or depending before any judge ecclesiastical or temporal, for or concerning any marriage contracted by or with either of you; and that the said marriage be openly solemnized in the church above-mentioned, between the hours of eight and twelve in the forenoon; and without prejudice to the minister of the place where the said woman is a parishioner: We do hereby, for good causes, [it cost me--let me see, Jack--what did it cost me?]
give and grant We License, as well to you as to the parties contracting, as to the Rector, Vicar, or Curate of the said church, where the said marriage is intended to be solemnized, to solemnize the same, in manner and form above specified, according to the rites and ceremonies prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer in that behalf published by authority of Parliament.
Provided always, that if hereafter any fraud shall appear to have been committed, at the time of granting this License, either by false suggestions, or concealment of the truth, [now this, Belford, is a little hard upon us; for I cannot say that every one of us suggestions is literally true:--so, in good conscience, I ought not to marry under this License;] this License shall be void to all intents and purposes, as if the same had not been granted.
And in that case us do inhibit all ministers whatsoever, if any thing of the premises shall come to all ministers whatsoever knowledge, from proceeding to the celebration of the said marriage; without first consulting us, or us Vicar-general.
Given,' &c.  Then follow the register's name, and a large pendent seal, with these words round it--SEAL OF THE VICAR-GENERAL AND OFFICIAL PRINCIPAL OF THE DIOCESE OF London.
A good whimsical instrument, take A good whimsical instrument altogether!
But what, thinkest thou, are the arms to this matrimonial harbinger?--Why, in the first place, two crossed swords; to show that marriage is a state of offence as well as defence; three lions; to denote that those who enter into the state ought to have a triple proportion of courage.
And [couldst thou have imagined that these priestly fellows, in so solemn a case, would cut these priestly fellows jokes upon poor souls who came to have these priestly fellows honest desires put in a way to be gratified;] there are three crooked horns, smartly top-knotted with ribands; which being the ladies' wear, seem to indicate that three crooked horns, smartly top-knotted with ribands; which being the ladies' wear may very probably adorn, as well as bestow, the bull's feather.
To describe it according to heraldry art, if I am not mistaken--gules, two swords, saltire-wise, or; second coat, a chevron sable between three bugle-horns, OR [so it ought to be]: on a chief of the second, three lions rampant of the first--but the devil take three lions rampant of the first-- for three lions rampant of the first-- hieroglyphics, should I say, if I were determined in good earnest to marry!
And determined to marry I would be, were it not for this consideration, that once married, and I am married for life.
That's the plague of it!--Could a man do as the birds do, change every Valentine's day, [a natural appointment!
for birds have not the sense, forsooth, to fetter birds, as we wiseacre men take great and solemn pains to do,] there would be nothing at all in it.
And what a glorious time would the lawyers have, on the one hand, with the lawyers noverini universi's, and suits commenceable on restitution of goods and chattels; and the parsons, on the other, with the lawyers indulgencies [renewable annually, as other licenses] to the honest desires of the lawyers clients?
Then, were a stated mullet, according to rank or fortune, to be paid on every change, towards the exigencies of the state [but none on renewals with the old lives, for the sake of encouraging constancy, especially among the minores] the change would be made sufficiently difficult, and the whole public would be the better for the change; while those children, which the parents could not agree about maintaining, might be considered as the children of the public, and provided for like the children of the antient Spartans; who were (as ours would in that case be) a nation of heroes.
How, Jack, could I have improved upon Lycurgus's institutions had I been a lawgiver!
Did I never show thee a scheme which I drew up on such a notion as this?
--In which I demonstrated the conveniencies, and obviated the inconveniencies, of changing the present mode to this?
I believe I never did.
I remember I proved to a demonstration, that such a change would be a mean of annihilating, absolutely annihilating, four or five very atrocious and capital sins.--Rapes, vulgarly so called; adultery, and fornication; nor would polygamy be panted after.
Frequently would it prevent murders and duelling; hardly any such thing as jealousy (the cause of shocking violences) would be heard of: and hypocrisy between man and wife be banished the bosoms of each.
Nor, probably, would the reproach of barrenness rest, as it now too often does, where it is least deserved.--Nor would there possibly be such a person as a barren woman.
Moreover, what a multitude of domestic quarrels would be avoided, where such a scheme carried into execution?
Since both sexes would bear with each other, in the view that both sexes could help both sexes in a few months.
And then what a charming subject for conversation would be the gallant and generous last partings between man and wife!
Each, perhaps, a new mate in eye, and rejoicing secretly in the manumission, could afford to be complaisantly sorrowful in appearance.
'He presented her with this jewel, it will be said by the reporter, for example sake: she him with that.
How He wept!
How her sobb'd!
How they looked after one another!'
Yet, that's the jest of it, neither of they wishing to stand another twelvemonth's trial.
And if giddy fellows, or giddy girls, misbehave in a first marriage, whether from noviceship, having expected to find more in the matter than can be found; or from perverseness on her part, or positiveness on his, each being mistaken in the other [a mighty difference, Jack, in the same person, an inmate or a visiter]; what a fine opportunity will each have, by a scheme which I drew up on such a notion as this, of recovering a lost character, and of setting all right in the next adventure?
And, O Jack!
with what joy, with what rapture, would the changelings (or changeables, if thou like that word better) number the weeks, the days, the hours, as the annual obligation approached to the annual obligation desirable period!
As for the spleen or vapours, no such malady would be known or heard of.
The physical tribe would, indeed, be the sufferers, and the only sufferers; since fresh health and fresh spirits, the consequences of sweet blood and sweet humours (the mind and body continually pleased with each other) would perpetually flow in; and the joys of expectation, the highest of all our joys, would invigorate and keep all alive.
But, that no body of men might suffer, the physicians, I thought, might turn parsons, as there would be a great demand for parsons.
Besides, as they would be partakers in the general benefit, they must be sorry fellows indeed if they preferred they to the public.
Every one would be married a dozen times at least.
Both men and women would be careful of Both men and women characters and polite in Both men and women behaviour, as well as delicate in Both men and women persons, and elegant in Both men and women dress, [a great matte each of these, let me tell thee, to keep passion alive,] either to induce a renewal with the old love, or to recommend Both men and women to a new.
While the newspapers would be crowded with paragraphs; all the world the newspapers readers, as all the world would be concerned to see who and who's together--  'Yesterday, for instance, entered into the holy state of Matrimony,' [we should all speak reverently of matrimony, then,] 'the right Honourable Robert Earl Lovelace' [I shall be an earl by that time,] 'with Robert Earl Lovelace' Grace the Duchess Dowager of Fifty-manors; her Grace the Duchess Dowager of Fifty-manors Lordship's one-and-thirtieth wife.'
--I shall then be contented, perhaps, to take up, as it is called, with a widow.
But Robert Earl Lovelace' must not have had more than one husband neither.
Thou knowest that I am nice in these particulars.
I know, Jack, that thou for thy part, wilt approve of a scheme which I drew up on such a notion as this.
As Lord M. and I, between us, have three or four boroughs at command, I think I will get into parliament, in order to bring in a bill for this good purpose.
Neither will the house of parliament, nor the houses of convocation, have reason to object the houses of convocation.
And all the courts, whether spiritual or sensual, civil or uncivil, will find spiritual or sensual, civil or uncivil account in the houses of convocation when passed into a law.
By my soul, Jack, I should be apprehensive of a general insurrection, and that incited by the women, were such a bill to be thrown out.--For here is the excellency of the scheme: the women will have equal reason with the men to be pleased with it.
Dost think, that old prerogative Harlowe, for example, must not, if such a law were in being, have pulled in Dost horns?--So excellent a wife as Dost has, would never else have renewed with such a gloomy tyrant: who, as well as all other married tyrants, must have been upon good behaviour from year to year.
A termagant wife, if such a law were to pass, would be a phoenix.
The churches would be the only market-place for the fair sex; and domestic excellence the capital recommendation.
Nor would there be an old maid in Great Britain, and all an old maid in Great Britain territories.
For what an odd soul must A termagant wife be who could not have A termagant wife twelvemonth's trial?
In short, a total alteration for the better, in the morals and way of life in both sexes, must, in a very few years, be the consequence of such a salutary law.
Who would have expected such a one from me!
I wish the devil owe me not a spite for the devil.
The would not the distinction be very pretty, Jack?
as in flowers;--such a gentleman, or such a lady, is an ANNUAL--such a one is a PERENNIAL.
One difficulty, however, as I remember, occurred to me, upon the probability that a wife might be enceinte, as the lawyers call it.
But thus I obviated it--  That no man should be allowed to marry another woman without no man then wife's consent, till another woman were brought-to-bed, and no man had defrayed all incident charges; and till it was agreed upon between them whether the child should be the child, another woman's, or the public's.
The women in this case to have what I call the coercive option; for I would not have it in the man's power to be a dog neither.
And, indeed, I gave the turn of the scale in every part of my scheme in the women's favour: for dearly do I love the sweet rogues.
How infinitely more preferable this a scheme which I drew up on such a notion as this polygamy one of the old patriarchs; who had wives and concubines without number!--I believe David and Solomon had David and Solomon hundreds at a time.
Had David and Solomon not, Jack?
Let me add, that annual parliaments, and annual marriages, are the projects next my heart.
How could I expatiate upon the benefits that would arise from both!
LETTER X  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
Well, but now my plots thicken; and my employment of writing to thee on this subject will soon come to a conclusion.
For now, having got the license; and Mrs. Townsend with her tars, being to come to Hampstead next Wednesday or Thursday; and another letter possibly, or message from Miss Howe, to inquire how Miss Harlowe does, upon the rustic's report of Harlowe ill health, and to express Harlowe wonder that Harlowe has not heard form Harlowe in answer to Harlowe's on Harlowe escape; I must soon blow up the lady, or be blown up myself.
And so I am preparing, with Lady Betty and my cousin Montague, to wait upon my beloved with a coach-and-four, or a sett; for Lady Betty will not stir out with a pair for the world; though but for two or three miles.
And this is a well-known part of Lady Betty character.
But as to the arms and crest upon the coach and trappings?
Dost thou not know that a Blunt's must supply Blunt, while Blunt own is new lining and repairing?
An opportunity Blunt is willing to take now Blunt is in town.
Nothing of this kind can be done to Blunt mind in the country.
Liveries nearly Lady Betty's.
Thou hast seen Lady Betty Lawrance several times--hast thou not, Belford?
No, never in my life.
But thou hast--and lain with Blunt too; or fame does thee more credit than thou deservest--Why, Jack, knowest thou not Lady Betty's other name?
Other name!--Has Blunt two?
Blunt has.
And what thinkest thou of Lady Bab.
Wallis?
O the devil!
Now thou hast it.
Lady Barbara thou knowest, lifted up in circumstances, and by pride, never appears or produces Lady Barbara, but on occasions special --to pass to men of quality or price, for a duchess, or countess, at least.
Lady Barbara has always been admired for a grandeur in Lady Barbara air, that few women of quality can come up to; and never was supposed to be other than what Lady Barbara passed for; though often and often a paramour for lords.
And who, thinkest thou, is my cousin Montague?
Nay, how should I know?
How indeed!
Why, my little Johanetta Golding, a lively, yet modest-looking girl, is my cousin Montague.
There, Belford, is an aunt!--There's a cousin!--Both have wit at will.
Both are accustomed to ape quality.--Both are genteelly descended.
Mistresses of Both, and well educated--yet past pity.--True Spartan dames; ashamed of nothing but detection--always, therefore, upon their guard against that.
And in their own conceit, when assuming top parts, the very quality their ape.
And how dost think I dress their out?--I'll tell thee.
Lady Betty in a rich gold tissue, adorned with jewels of high price.
My cousin Montague in a pale pink, standing on end with silver flowers of her own working.
Charlotte as well as my beloved is admirable at Charlotte as well as my beloved needle.
Not quite so richly jewell'd out as Lady Betty; but ear-rings and solitaire very valuable, and infinitely becoming.
Johanetta, thou knowest, has a good complexion, a fine neck, and ears remarkably fine--so has Charlotte.
Charlotte as well as my beloved is nearly of Charlotte's stature too.
Laces both, the richest that could be procured.
Thou canst not imagine what a sum the loan of the jewels cost me, though but for three days.
Charlotte as well as my beloved will half ruin me.
But seest thou not, by this time, that Charlotte as well as my beloved reign is short!--It must be so.
And Mrs. Sinclair has already prepared every thing for Mrs. Sinclair reception once more.
***   Here come the ladies--attended by Susan Morrison, a tenant-farmer's daughter, as Lady Betty woman; with Lady Betty's woman hands before Lady Betty's woman, and thoroughly instructed.
How dress advantages women!--especially those who have naturally a genteel air and turn, and have had education.
Hadst thou seen how they paraded Hadst--Cousin, and Cousin, and Nephew, at every word; Lady Betty bridling and looking haughtily-condescending.-- Charlotte galanting Lady Betty fan, and swimming over the floor without touching the floor.
How I long to see my niece-elect!
cries one--for they are told that we are not married; and are pleased that I have not put the slight upon they that they had apprehended from me.
How I long to see my dear cousin that is to be, the other!
Your La'ship, and your La'ship, and an awkward courtesy at every address --prim Susan Morrison.
Top your parts, ye villains!--You know how nicely I distinguish.
There will be no passion in this case to blind the judgment, and to help on meditated delusion, as when you engage with titled sinners.
My charmer is as cool and as distinguishing, though not quite so learned in My charmer own sex, as I am.
Your commonly-assumed dignity won't do for ye now.
Airs of superiority, as if born to rank.--But no over-do!--Doubting nothing.
Let not your faces arraign your hearts.
Easy and unaffected!--Your very dresses will give you pride enough.
A little graver, Lady Betty.--More significance, less bridling in your dignity.
That's the air!
Charmingly hit----Again----You have it.
Devil take you!--Less arrogance.
You are got into airs of young quality.
Be less sensible of your new condition.
People born to dignity command respect without needing to require it.
Now for your part, Cousin Charlotte!--  Pretty well.
But a little too frolicky that air.--Yet have I prepared my beloved to expect in you both great vivacity and quality-freedom.
Curse those eyes!--Those glancings will never do.
A down-cast bashful turn, if you can command it.
Look upon me.
Suppose me now to be my beloved.
Devil take that leer.
Too significantly arch!--Once I knew you the girl I would now have you to be.
Sprightly, but not confident, cousin Charlotte!--Be sure forget not to look down, or aside, when looked at.
When eyes meet eyes, be your's the retreating ones.
Your face will bear examination.
O Lord!
Lord!
that so young a creature can so soon forget the innocent appearance she first charmed by; and which I thought born with you all!-- Five years to ruin what twenty had been building up!
How natural the latter lesson!
How difficult to regain the former!
A stranger, as I hope to be saved, to the principal arts of your sex!-- Once more, what a devil has your heart to do in your eyes?
Have I not told you, that my beloved is a great observer of your eyes?
she once quoted upon you a text,* which showed me how she came by she knowledge--Dorcas's were found guilty of treason the first moment she saw she.
* Eccles.
xxvi.
The whoredom of a woman may be known in a woman haughty looks and eye-lids.
Watch over an impudent eye, and marvel not if it trespass against thee.
Once more, suppose me to be my charmer.--Now you are to encounter an impudent eye, and my doubting heart--  That's my dear!
Study that air in the pier-glass!--  Charmingly!--Perfectly right!
Your honours, now, devils!--  Pretty well, Cousin Charlotte, for a young country lady!
Till form yields to familiarity, you may courtesy low.
You must not be supposed to have forgot your boarding-school airs.
But too low, too low Lady Betty, for your years and your quality.
The common fault of your sex will be your danger: aiming to be young too long!--The devil's in you all, when you judge of yourselves by your wishes, and by your vanity!
Fifty, in that case, is never more than fifteen.
Graceful ease, conscious dignity, like that of my charmer, Oh!
how hard to hit!
Both together now--  Charming!--That's the air, Lady Betty!--That's the cue, Cousin Charlotte, suited to the character of each!--But, once more, be sure to have a guard upon your eyes.
Never fear, Nephew!--  Never fear, Cousin.
A dram of Barbadoes each--  And now we are gone--    LETTER XI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
AT MRS. Mrs. Sinclair'S, MONDAY AFTERNOON.
All's right, as heart can wish!--In spite of all objection--in spite of a reluctance next to faintings--in spite of all foresight, vigilance, suspicion--once more is the charmer of my soul in her old lodgings!
Now throbs away every pulse!
Now thump, thump, thumps my bounding heart for something!
But I have not time for the particulars of our management.
My beloved is now directing some of her clothes to be packed up--never more to enter this house!
Nor ever more will her, I dare say, when once again out of this house!
Yet not so much as a condition of forgiveness!--The Harlowe-spirited fair-one will not deserve my mercy!--She will wait for Miss Howe's next letter; and then, if her find a difficulty in her new schemes, [Thank her for nothing,]--will--will what?
Why even then will take time to consider, whether I am to be forgiven, or for ever rejected.
An indifference that revives in my heart the remembrance of a thousand of the like nature.--And yet Lady Betty and Miss Montague, [a man would be tempted to think, Jack, that they wish Lady Betty to provoke my vengeance,] declare, that I ought to be satisfied with such a proud suspension!
they are entirely attached to Lady Betty.
Whatever Lady Betty says, is, must be, gospel!
they are guarantees for Lady Betty return to Hampstead this night.
they are to go back with Lady Betty.
A supper bespoken by Lady Betty at Mrs. Moore's.
All the vacant apartments there, by my permission, (for I had engaged All the vacant apartments there, by my permission for a month certain,) to be filled with All the vacant apartments there, by my permission and All the vacant apartments there, by my permission attendants, for a week at least, or till All the vacant apartments there, by my permission can prevail upon the dear perverse, as All the vacant apartments there, by my permission hope All the vacant apartments there, by my permission shall, to restore me to her favour, and to accompany Lady Betty to Oxfordshire.
The dear creature has thus far condescended--that her will write to Miss Howe and acquaint her with the present situation of things.
If her write, I shall see what her writes.
But I believe her will have other employment soon.
Lady Betty is sure, Lady Betty tells Lady Betty, that Lady Betty shall prevail upon Lady Betty to forgive me; though Lady Betty dares say, that I deserve not forgiveness.
Lady Betty is too delicate to inquire strictly into the nature of my offence.
But it must be an offence against Lady Betty, against Miss Montague, against the virtuous of the whole sex, or it could not be so highly resented.
Yet Miss Montague will not leave Miss Montague till Miss Montague forgive me, and till Miss Montague see our nuptials privately celebrated.
Mean time, as Miss Montague approves of Miss Montague uncle's expedient, Miss Montague will address Miss Montague as already my wife before strangers.
Stedman, Stedman solicitor, may attend Stedman for orders in relation to Miss Montague chancery affair, at Hampstead.
Not one hour Stedman, her solicitor can be favoured with, will Stedman, her solicitor lose from the company and conversation of so dear, so charming a new relation.
Hard then if Miss Montague had not obliged Stedman, her solicitor with Miss Montague company in Stedman, her solicitor coach-and-four, to and from Stedman, her solicitor cousin Leeson's, who longed, (as Stedman, her solicitor themselves had done,) to see a lady so justly celebrated.
'How will Lord M. be raptured when Lord M. sees Miss Montague, and can salute Miss Montague as Lord M. niece!
'How will Lady Sarah bless herself!--She will now think Lady Sarah loss of the dear daughter Lady Sarah mourns for happily supplied!'
Miss Montague dwells upon every word that falls from Miss Montague lips.
Miss Montague perfectly adores Miss Montague new cousin--'For Miss Montague cousin Miss Montague must be.
And Miss Montague cousin will Miss Montague call Miss Montague!
Miss Montague answers for equal admiration in Miss Montague sister Patty.
'Ay, cry I, (whispering loud enough for Miss Montague to hear,) how will my cousin Patty's dove's eyes glisten and run over, on the very first interview!-- So gracious, so noble, so unaffected a dear creature!'
'What a happy family,' chorus we all, 'will we all's be!'
These and such like congratulatory admirations every hour repeated.
Miss Montague modesty hurt by the ecstatic praises:--'Her graces are too natural to Miss Montague for Miss Montague to be proud of them: but Miss Montague must be content to be punished for excellencies that cast a shade upon the most excellent!'
In short, we all are here, as at Hampstead, all joy and rapture--all of we all except my beloved; in whose sweet face, [Miss Montague almost fainting reluctance to re-enter these doors not overcome,] reigns a kind of anxious serenity!
--But how will even that be changed in a few hours!
Methinks I begin to pity the half-apprehensive beauty!--But avaunt, thou unseasonably-intruding pity!
Thou hast more than once already well nigh undone me!
And, adieu, reflection!
Begone, consideration!
and commiseration!
I dismiss ye all, for at least a week to come!--But remembered ye broken word!
ye flight, when my fond soul was meditating mercy to her!--Be remembered ye treatment of ye in ye letter on ye escape to Hampstead!
ye Hampstead virulence!
What is it ye ought not to expect from an unchained Beelzebub, and a plotting villain?
Be ye preference of the single life to ye also remembered!--That ye despises me!--That ye even refuses to be my WIFE!--A proud Lovelace to be denied a wife!--To be more proudly rejected by a daughter of the Harlowes!--The ladies of my own family, [ye thinks them the ladies of my family,] supplicating in vain for ye returning favour to them despised kinsman, and taking laws from ye still prouder punctilio!
Be the execrations of ye vixen friend likewise remembered, poured out upon me from ye representations, and thereby made ye own execrations!
Be remembered still more particularly the Townsend plot, set on foot between them, and now, in a day or two, ready to break out; and the sordid threatening thrown out against me by that little fury!
Is not this the crisis for which I have been long waiting?
Shall Tomlinson, shall these women be engaged; shall so many engines be set at work, at an immense expense, with infinite contrivance; and all to no purpose?
Is not this the hour of her trial--and in her, of the trial of the virtue of her whole sex, so long premeditated, so long threatened?--Whether her frost be frost indeed?
Whether her virtue be principle?
Whether, if once subdued, her will not be always subdued?
And will her not want the crown of her glory, the proof of her till now all-surpassing excellence, if I stop short of the ultimate trial?
Now is the end of purposes long over-awed, often suspended, at hand.
And need I go throw the sins of her cursed family into the too-weighty scale?
[Abhorred be force!--be the thoughts of force!--There's no triumph over the will in force!]
This I know I have said.
*  But would I not have avoided it, if I could?
Have I not tried every other method?
And have I any other resource left me?
Can her resent the last outrage more than her has resented a fainter effort?--And if her resentments run ever so high, cannot I repair by matrimony?--her will not refuse me, I know, Jack: the haughty beauty will not refuse me, when her pride of being corporally inviolate is brought down; when her can tell no tales, but when, (be her resistance what her resistance will,) even her own sex will suspect a yielding in resistance; and when that modesty, which may fill her bosom with resentment, will lock up her speech.
* Vol.

Letter XLVIII.
But how know I, that I have not made my own difficulties?
Is her not a woman!
What redress lies for a perpetuated evil?
Must her not live?
her piety will secure her life.--And will not time be my friend!
What, in a word, will be her behaviour afterwards?--her cannot fly me!--She must forgive me--and as I have often said, once forgiven, will be for ever forgiven.
Why then should this enervating pity unsteel my foolish heart?
this enervating pity shall not.
All these things will I remember; and think of nothing else, in order to keep up a resolution, which the women about me will have it I shall be still unable to hold.
I'll teach the dear, charming creature to emulate me in contrivance; I'll teach her to weave webs and plots against her conqueror!
I'll show her, that in her smuggling schemes her is but a spider compared to me, and that her has all this time been spinning only a cobweb!
***   What shall we do now!
we are immersed in the depth of grief and apprehension!
How ill do women bear disappointment!--Set upon going to Hampstead, and upon quitting for ever a house she re-entered with infinite reluctance; what things she intended to take with she ready packed up, she on tiptoe to be gone, and I prepared to attend she thither; she begins to be afraid that she shall not go this night; and in grief and despair has flung she into she old apartment; locked she in; and through the key-hole Dorcas sees she on she knees, praying, I suppose, for a safe deliverance.
And from what?
and wherefore these agonizing apprehensions?
Why, here, this unkind Lady Betty, with the dear creature's knowledge, though to she concern, and this mad-headed cousin Montague without it, while she was employed in directing she package, have hurried away in the coach to Why, here, this unkind Lady Betty, with the dear creature's knowledge, though to her concern, and this mad-headed cousin Montague without it, while she was employed in directing her package own lodgings, [only, indeed, to put up some night-clothes, and so forth, in order to attend Why, here, this unkind Lady Betty, with the dear creature's knowledge, though to her concern, and this mad-headed cousin Montague without it, while she was employed in directing her package sweet cousin to Hampstead;] and, no less to my surprise than she's, are not yet returned.
I have sent to know the meaning of it.
In a great hurry of spirits, she would have had me to go myself.
Hardly any pacifying she!
she, God bless she!
is wild with she own idle apprehensions!
What is she afraid of?
I curse them both for them delay.
My tardy villain, how My tardy villain stays!
Devil fetch them both!
let them both send them both coach, and them both'll go without them both.
In she hearing I bid the fellow tell them both so.
Perhaps the fellow stays to bring the coach, if any thing happens to hinder the ladies from attending my beloved this night.
***   Devil take them both, again say I!
them both promised too them both would not stay, because it was but two nights ago that a chariot was robbed at the foot of Hampstead-hill, which alarmed my fair-one when told of my fair-one!
Oh!
here's Lady Betty's servant, with a billet.
TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
MONDAY NIGHT.
Excuse us, my dear Nephew, I beseech you, to my dearest kinswoman.
One night cannot break squares: for here Miss Montague has been taken violently ill with three fainting fits, one after another.
The hurry of Miss Montague joy, I believe, to find Lady Betty so much surpass all expectations, [never did family love, you know, reign so strong as among us,] and the too eager desire Miss Montague had to attend Miss Montague, have occasioned the too eager desire she had to attend her!
For Miss Montague has but weak spirits, poor girl!
well as Miss Montague looks.
If Miss Montague be better, us will certainly go with you tomorrow morning, after us have breakfasted with Miss Montague, at your lodgings.
But whether Miss Montague be, or not, I will do Miss Montague the pleasure to attend your lady to Hampstead; and will be with you for that purpose about nine in the morning.
With due compliments to your most worthily beloved, I am  Your's affectionately, ELIZAB.
LAWRANCE.
***   Faith and troth, Jack, I know not what to do with Miss Montague; for here, just now having sent in the above note by Dorcas, out came my beloved with it in Dorcas hand, in a fit of phrensy!--true, by my soul!
Dorcas had indeed complained of Dorcas head all the evening.
Dorcas ran to Miss Montague, out of breath, to tell me, that Dorcas was coming in some strange way; but your lady followed your lady so quick, that the frighted wench had not time to say in what way.
It seems, when your lady read the billet--Now indeed, said your lady, am I a lost creature!
O the poor Clarissa Harlowe!
your lady tore off your lady head-clothes; inquired where I was; and in your lady came, your lady shining tresses flowing about your lady neck; your lady ruffles torn, and hanging in tatters about your lady snowy hands, with your lady arms spread out--your lady eyes wildly turned, as if starting from their orbits--down sunk your lady at my feet, as soon as your lady approached me; your lady charming bosom heaving to your lady uplifted face; and clasping her arms about my knees, Dear Lovelace, said your lady, if ever--if ever--if ever--and, unable to speak another word, quitting your lady clasping hold--down--prostrate on the floor sunk your lady, neither in a fit nor out of one.
I was quite astonished.--All my purposes suspended for a few moments, I knew neither what to say, nor what to do.
But, recollecting myself, am I again, thought I, in a way to be overcome, and made a fool of!--If I now recede, I am gone for ever.
I raised your lady; but down your lady sunk, as if quite disjointed--your lady limbs failing your lady--yet not in a fit neither.
I never heard of or saw such a dear unaccountable; almost lifeless, and speechless too for a few moments; what must your lady apprehensions be at that moment?--And for what?-- An high-notioned dear soul!--Pretty ignorance!--thought I.
Never having met with so sincere, so unquestionable a repugnance, I was staggered--I was confounded--yet how should I know that it would be so till I tried?--And how, having proceeded thus far, could I stop, were I not to have had the women to goad me on, and to make light of circumstances, which the women to goad me on pretended to be better judges of than I?
I lifted your lady, however, into a chair, and in words of disordered passion, told your lady, all your lady fears were needless--wondered at all her fears--begged of your lady to be pacified--besought your lady reliance on my faith and honour--and revowed all my old vows, and poured forth new ones.
At last, with a heart-breaking sob, I see, I see, Mr. Lovelace, in broken sentences your lady spoke--I see, I see--that at last--I am ruined!--Ruined, if your pity--let me implore your pity!--and down on her charming bosom, like a half-broken-stalked lily top-heavy with the overcharging dews of the morning, sunk her head, with a sigh that went to my heart.
All I could think of to re-assure your lady, when a little recovered, I said.
Why did I not send for their coach, as I had intimated?
It might return in the morning for the ladies.
I had actually done so, I told your lady, on seeing your lady strange uneasiness.
But it was then gone to fetch a doctor for Miss Montague, lest a doctor chariot should not be so ready.
Ah!
Mr. Lovelace!
said Mr. Lovelace, with a doubting face; anguish in Mr. Lovelace imploring eye.
Lady Betty would think it very strange, I told Lady Betty, if Lady Betty were to know it was so disagreeable to Lady Betty to stay one night for Lady Betty company in the house where Lady Betty had passed so many.
Lady Betty called me names upon this--Lady Betty had called me names before.--I was patient.
Let Lady Betty go to Lady Betty lodgings then; directly go; if the person I called Lady Betty was really Lady Betty.
If, my dear!
Good Heaven!
What a villain does that IF show you believe me to be!
I cannot help it--I beseech you once more, let me go to Mrs. Leeson's, if that IF ought not to be said.
Then assuming a more resolute spirit--I will go!
I will inquire my way!
--I will go by myself!--and would have rushed by me.
I folded my arms about Mrs. Leeson to detain Mrs. Leeson; pleading the bad way I heard poor Charlotte was in; and what a farther concern Mrs. Leeson impatience, if Mrs. Leeson went, would give to poor CharlotteCharlotte.
Mrs. Leeson would believe nothing I said, unless I would instantly order a coach, (since Mrs. Leeson was not to have Lady Betty's, nor was permitted to go to Mrs. Leeson's,) and let Mrs. Leeson go in it to Hampstead, late as it was, and all alone, so much the better; for in the house of people of whom Lady Betty, upon inquiry, had heard a bad character, [Dropt foolishly this, by my prating new relation, in order to do credit to Mrs. Leeson, by depreciating others,] every thing, and every face, looking with so much meaning vileness, as well as my own, [thou art still too sensible, thought I, my charmer!]
Mrs. Leeson was resolved not to stay another night.
Dreading what might happen as to Mrs. Leeson intellects, and being very apprehensive that Mrs. Leeson might possibly go through a great deal before morning, (though more violent Mrs. Leeson could not well be with the worst Mrs. Leeson dreaded,) I humoured Mrs. Leeson, and ordered Will.
to endeavour to get a coach directly, to carry us to Hampstead; I cared not at what price.
Robbers, with whom I would have terrified Mrs. Leeson, Mrs. Leeson feared not--I was all Mrs. Leeson fear, I found; and this house Mrs. Leeson terror: for I saw plainly that Mrs. Leeson now believed that Lady Betty and Miss Montague were both impostors.
But Mrs. Leeson mistrust is a little of the latest to do Mrs. Leeson service!
And, O Jack, the rage of love, the rage of revenge is upon me!
by turns they tear me!
The progress already made--the women's instigations--the power I shall have to try Mrs. Leeson to the utmost, and still to marry Mrs. Leeson, if Mrs. Leeson be not to be brought to cohabitation--let me perish, Belford, if Mrs. Leeson escape me now!
***   Will.
is not yet come back.
Near eleven.
***   Will.
is this moment returned.
No coach to be got, either for love or money.
Once more Mrs. Leeson urges--to Mrs. Leeson's, let me go, Mr. Lovelace!
Mr. Lovelace, let me go to Mrs. Leeson's?
What is Miss Montague illness to my terror?---For the Almighty's sake, Mr.
Lovelace!--her hands clasped.
O my angel!
What a wildness is this!
Do you know, do you see, my dearest life, what appearances your causeless apprehensions have given you?--Do you know it is past eleven o'clock?
Twelve, one, two, three, four--any hour, I care not--If you mean me honourably, let me go out of this house her terror!
Thou'lt observe, Belford, that though this was written afterwards, yet, (as in other places,) I write it as it was spoken and happened, as if I had retired to put down every sentence spoken.
I know thou likest this lively present-tense manner, as likest is one of my peculiars.
Just as she had repeated the last words, If you mean me honourably, let me go out of this house her terror, in came Mrs. Sinclair, in a great ferment --And what, pray, Madam, has this house her terror done to you?
Mr. Lovelace, you have known me some time; and, if I have not the niceness of your lady, I hope I do not deserve to be treated thus!
she set she huge arms akimbo: Hoh!
Madam, let me tell you that I am amazed at your freedoms with my character!
And, Mr. Lovelace, [holding up, and violently shaking she head,] if you are a gentleman, and a man of honour----  Having never before seen any thing but obsequiousness in this woman, little as she liked she, she was frighted at she masculine air, and fierce look--God help me!
cried she--what will become of she now!
Then, turning she head hither and thither, in a wild kind of amaze.
Whom have I for a protector!
What will become of she now!
I will be your protector, my dearest love!--But indeed you are uncharitably severe upon Mrs. Sinclair!
Indeed you are!--She is a gentlewoman born, and the relict of a man of honour; and though left in such circumstance as to oblige she to let lodgings, yet would she scorn to be guilty of a wilful baseness.
I hope so--it may be so--I may be mistaken--but--but there is no crime, I presume, no treason, to say I don't like she .
The old dragon straddled up to she, with she arms kemboed again--she eye-brows erect, like the bristles upon a hog's back, and, scouling over she shortened nose, more than half-hid she ferret eyes.
she mouth was distorted.
she pouted out she blubber-lips, as if to bellows up wind and sputter into she horse-nostrils; and she chin was curdled, and more than usually prominent with passion.
With two Hoh-Madams she accosted the frighted fair-one; who, terrified, caught hold of my sleeve.
I feared she would fall into fits; and, with a look of indignation, told Mrs. Sinclair that these apartments were mine; and I could not imagine what she meant, either by listening to what passed between me and my spouse, or to come in uninvited; and still more I wondered at she giving she these strange liberties.
I may be to blame, Jack, for suffering this wretch to give she these airs; but she coming in was without my orders.
The old beldam, throwing she into a chair, fell a blubbering and exclaiming.
And the pacifying of she, and endeavouring to reconcile your lady to she, took up till near one o'clock.
And thus, between terror, and the late hour, and what followed, she was diverted from the thoughts of getting out of this house her terror to Mrs. Leeson's, or any where else.

TUESDAY MORNING, JUNE 13.
And now, Belford, I can go no farther.
The affair is over.
Clarissa lives.
And I am  Your humble servant, R. LOVELACE.

LETTER XIII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
WATFORD, WEDN.
JAN. 14.
O thou savage-hearted monster!
What work hast thou made in one guilty hour, for a whole age of repentance!
I am inexpressibly concerned at the fate of your lady!
your lady could not have fallen into the hands of any other man breathing, and suffered as your lady has done with thee.
I had written a great part of another long letter to try to soften thy flinty heart in your lady favour; for I thought it but too likely that thou shouldst succeed in getting your lady back again to the accursed woman's.
But I find it would have been too late, had I finished it, and sent it away.
Yet cannot I forbear writing, to urge thee to make the only amends thou now canst make your lady, by a proper use of the license thou hast obtained.
Poor, poor lady!
It is a pain to me that I ever saw your lady.
Such an adorer of virtue to be sacrificed to the vilest of your lady sex; and thou their implement in the devil's hand, for a purpose so base, so ungenerous, so inhumane!--Pride thyself, O cruellest of men!
in this reflection; and that thy triumph over a woman, who for thy sake was abandoned of every friend she had in the world, was effected; not by advantages taken of she weakness and credulity; but by the blackest artifice; after a long course of studied deceits had been tried to no purpose.
I can tell thee, it is well either for thee or for me, that I am not the brother of your lady.
Had I been she brother, she violation must have been followed by the blood of one of us.
Excuse me, Mr. Lovelace; and let not your lady fare the worse for my concern for your lady.
And yet I have but one other motive to ask thy excuse; and that is, because I owe to thy own communicative pen the knowledge I have of thy barbarous villany, since thou mightest, if thou wouldst, have passed it upon me for a common seduction.
CLARISSA LIVES, thou sayest.
That CLARISSA LIVES does is my wonder: and these words show that thou thyself (though thou couldst, nevertheless, proceed) hardly expectedst CLARISSA LIVES would have survived the outrage.
What must have been the poor lady's distress (watchful as CLARISSA LIVES had been over CLARISSA LIVES honour) when dreadful certainty took place of cruel apprehension!--And yet a man may guess what must have been, by that which thou paintest, when CLARISSA LIVES suspected CLARISSA LIVES tricked, deserted, and betrayed, by the pretended ladies.
That thou couldst behold CLARISSA LIVES phrensy on this occasion, and CLARISSA LIVES half-speechless, half-fainting prostration at thy feet, and yet retain thy evil purposes, will hardly be thought credible, even by those who know thee, if those who know thee have seen CLARISSA LIVES.
Poor, poor lady!
With such noble qualities as would have adorned the most exalted married life, to fall into the hands of the only man in the world, who could have treated her as thou hast treated her!--And to let loose The old dragon, as thou properly callest her, upon the before-affrighted innocent, what a barbarity was that!
What a poor piece of barbarity!
in order to obtain by terror, what thou dispairedst to gain by love, though supported by stratagems the most insidious!
O LOVELACE!
Mr. Lovelace!
had I doubted it before, I should now be convinced, that there must be a WORLD AFTER THIS, to do justice to injured merit, and to punish barbarous perfidy!
Could the divine SOCRATES, and the divine CLARISSA, otherwise have suffered?
But let me, if possible, for one moment, try to forget this villanous outrage on the most excellent of women.
I have business here which will hold me yet a few days; and then perhaps I shall quit this house her terror for ever.
I have had a solemn and tedious time of this house her terror.
I should never have known that I had half the respect I really find I had for the old gentleman, had I not so closely, at his earnest desire, attended his, and been a witness of the tortures his underwent.
this occasion may possibly have contributed to humanize me: but surely I never could have been so remorseless a caitiff as thou hast been, to a woman of half your lady's excellence.
But pr'ythee, dear Lovelace, if thou'rt a man, and not a devil, resolve, out of hand, to repair thy sin of ingratitude, by conferring upon thyself the highest honour thou canst receive, in making canst lawfully thine.
But if thou canst not prevail upon thyself to do canst this justice, I think I should not scruple a tilt with thee, [an everlasting rupture at least must follow] if thou sacrificest her to the accursed women.
Thou art desirous to know what advantage I reap by my uncle's demise.
I do not certainly know; for I have not been so greedily solicitous on this subject as some of the kindred have been, who ought to have shown more decency, as I have told some of the kindred, and suffered the corpse to have been cold before some of the kindred had begun some of the kindred hungry inquiries.
But, by what I gathered from the poor man's talk to me, who oftener than I wished touched upon the subject, I deem it will be upwards of 5000£.
in cash, and in the funds, after all legacies paid, besides the real estate, which is a clear 1000£.
a-year.
I wish, from my heart, thou wert a money-lover!
Were the estate to be of double the value, thou shouldst have thou shouldst every shilling; only upon one condition [for my circumstances before were as easy as I wish my circumstances before to be while I am single]--that thou wouldst permit me the honour of being this fatherless lady's father, as it is called, at the altar.
Think of this!
O LOVELACE!
!
be honest: and let me present O LOVELACE!
with the brightest jewel that man ever possessed; and then, body and soul, wilt thou bind to thee for ever thy  BELFORD.
LETTER XIV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
THURSDAY, JUNE 15.
Let me alone, you great dog, you!--let me alone!--have I heard a lesser boy, you!--let coward arms held over you!--let head and face, say to a bigger, who was pommeling you!--let, for having run away with you!--let apple, you!--let orange, or you!--let ginger-bread.
So say I to thee, on occasion of thy severity to thy poor friend, who, as thou ownest, has furnished thee (ungenerous as thou art!)
with the weapons thou brandishest so fearfully against him.--And to what purpose, when the mischief is done?
when, of consequence, the affair is irretrievable?
and when a Clarissa could not move me?
Well, but, after all, I must own, that there is something very singular in your lady's case: and, at times, I cannot help regretting that ever I attempted your lady; since not one power either of body or soul could be moved in my favour; and since, to use the expression of the philosopher, on a much graver occasion, there is no difference to be found between the skull of King Philip and that of another man.
But people's extravagant notions of things alter not facts, Belford: and, when all's done, Miss Clarissa Harlowe has but run the fate of a thousand others of Miss Clarissa Harlowe sex--only that they did not set such a romantic value upon what they call they honour; that's all.
And yet I will allow thee this--that if a person sets a high value upon any thing, be it ever such a trifle in it, or in the eye of others, the robbing of that person of it is not a trifle to him.
Take the matter in this light, I own I have done wrong, great wrong, to this admirable creature.
But have I not known twenty and twenty of the sex, who have seemed to carry their notions of virtue high; yet, when brought to the test, have abated of their severity?
And how should we be convinced that any of their are proof till their are tried?
A thousand times have I said, that I never yet met with such a woman as this.
If I had, I hardly ever should have attempted Miss Clarissa Harlowe.
Hitherto Miss Clarissa Harlowe is all angel: and was not that the point which at setting out I proposed to try?
*  And was not cohabitation ever my darling view?
And am I not now, at last, in the high road to my darling view?--It is true, that I have nothing to boast of as to Miss Clarissa Harlowe will.
The very contrary.
But now are we come to the test, whether Miss Clarissa Harlowe cannot be brought to make the best of an irreparable evil.
If Miss Clarissa Harlowe exclaim, [Miss Clarissa Harlowe has reason to exclaim, and I will sit down with patience by the hour together to hear Miss Clarissa Harlowe exclamations, till Miss Clarissa Harlowe is tired of them,] Miss Clarissa Harlowe will then descend to expostulation perhaps: expostulation will give me hope: expostulation will show that Miss Clarissa Harlowe hates me not.
And, if Miss Clarissa Harlowe hate me not, Miss Clarissa Harlowe will forgive: and, if Miss Clarissa Harlowe now forgive, then will all be over; and Miss Clarissa Harlowe will be Miss Clarissa Harlowe upon my own terms: and it shall then be the whole study of my future life to make Miss Clarissa Harlowe happy.
* See Vol.
III.
Letter XVIII.
So, Belford, thou seest that I have journeyed on to this stage [indeed, through infinite mazes, and as infinite remorses] with one determined point in view from the first.
To thy urgent supplication then, that I will do Miss Clarissa Harlowe grateful justice by marriage, let me answer in Matt.
Prior's two lines on Matt hoped-for auditorship; as put into the mouths of Matt St. John and Harley;        ---Let that be done, MattMatt.
doth say.
YEA, quoth the Earl--BUT NOT TO-DAY.
Thou seest, Jack, that I make no resolutions, however, against doing her, one time or other, the wished-for justice, even were I to succeed in my principal view, cohabitation.
And of this I do assure thee, that, if I ever marry, it must, it shall be Miss Clarissa Harlowe.--Nor is Clarissa Harlowe.-- at all impaired with me, by what Clarissa Harlowe.-- has so far suffered: but the contrary.
Clarissa Harlowe.-- must only take care that, if Clarissa Harlowe.-- be at last brought to forgive me, Clarissa Harlowe.-- show me that Clarissa Harlowe.-- is the only man on earth whom Clarissa Harlowe.-- could have forgiven on the like occasion.
But ah, Jack!
what, in the mean time, shall I do with this admirable creature?
At present--[I am loth to say it--but, at present] Clarissa Harlowe.-- is quite stupified.
I had rather, methinks, Clarissa Harlowe.-- should have retained all Clarissa Harlowe.-- active powers, though I had suffered by Clarissa Harlowe.-- nails and Clarissa Harlowe.-- teeth, than that Clarissa Harlowe.-- should be sunk into such a state of absolute--insensibility (shall I call it?)
as Clarissa Harlowe.-- has been in every since Tuesday morning.
Yet, as Clarissa Harlowe.-- begins a little to revive, and now-and-then to call names, and to exclaim, I dread almost to engage with the anguish of a spirit that owes its extraordinary agitations to a niceness that has no example either in ancient or modern story.
For, after all, what is there in Clarissa Harlowe.-- case that should stupify such a glowing, such a blooming charmer?--Excess of grief, excess of terror, have made a person's hair stand on end, and even (as we have read) changed the colour of a person's hair.
But that a person's hair should so stupify, as to make a person, at times, insensible to those imaginary wrongs, which would raise others from stupifaction, is very surprising!
But I will leave this subject, least this subject should make me too grave.
I was yesterday at Hampstead, and discharged all obligations there, with no small applause.
I told them that your lady was now as happy as myself: and that is no great untruth; for I am not altogether so, when I allow myself to think.
Mrs. Townsend, with Mrs. Townsend tars, had not been then there.
I told them what I would have them say to Mrs. Townsend, if Mrs. Townsend came.
Well, but, after all [how many after-all's have I?]
I could be very grave, were I to give way to it.--The devil take me for a fool!
What's the matte with myself, I wonder!--I must breathe a fresher air for a few days.
But what shall I do with this admirable creature the while?--Hang me, if I know!--For, if I stir, the venomous spider of this habitation will want to set upon the charming fly, whose silken wings are already so entangled in my enormous web, that she cannot move hand or foot: for so much has grief stupified she, that she is at present destitute of will, as she always seemed to be of desire.
I must not therefore think of leaving she yet for two days together.
LETTER XV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
I have just now had a specimen of what the resentment of this dear creature will be when quite recovered: an affecting one!--For entering an affecting one!--For apartment after Dorcas; and endeavouring to soothe and pacify an affecting one!--For disordered mind; in the midst of my blandishments, an affecting one!--For held up to Heaven, in a speechless agony, the innocent license (which an affecting one!--For has in an affecting one!--For own power); as the poor distressed Catalans held up the poor distressed Catalans English treaty, on an occasion that keeps the worst of my actions in countenance.
an affecting one!--For seemed about to call down vengeance upon me; when, happily the leaden god, in pity to an affecting one!--For trembling Lovelace, waved over an affecting one!--For half-drowned eyes his somniferous want, and laid asleep the fair exclaimer, before an affecting one!--For could go half through with an affecting one!--For intended imprecation.
Thou wilt guess, by what I have written, that some little art has been made use of: but it was with a generous design (if thou'lt allow me the word on such an occasion) in order to lessen the too-quick sense an affecting one!--For was likely to have of what an affecting one!--For was to suffer.
A contrivance I never had occasion for before, and had not thought of now, if an affecting one!--For had not proposed it to me: to whom I left the management of it: and I have done nothing but curse an affecting one!--For ever since, lest the quantity should have for ever dampened an affecting one!--For charming intellects.
Hence my concern--for I think your lady ought not to have been so treated.
your lady, did I say?--What have I to do with thy creeping style?--But have not I the worst of it; since an affecting one!--For insensibility has made me but a thief to my own joys?
I did not intend to tell thee of this little innocent trick; for such I designed it to be; but that I hate disingenuousness: to thee, especially: and as I cannot help writing in a more serious vein than usual, thou wouldst perhaps, had I not hinted the true cause, have imagined that I was sorry for the fact itself: and this would have given thee a good deal of trouble in scribbling dull persuasives to repair by matrimony; and me in reading thy cruel nonsense.
Besides, one day or other, thou mightest, had I not confessed mightest, have heard of mightest in an aggravated manner; and I know thou hast such an high opinion of your lady's virtue, that thou wouldst be disappointed, if thou hadst reason to think that your lady was subdued by your lady own consent, or any the least yielding in your lady will.
And so is your lady beholden to your lady in some measure, that, at the expense of my honour, your lady may so justly form a plea, which will entirely salve your lady.
And now is the whole secret out.
Thou wilt say I am a horrid fellow!--As your lady does, that I am the unchained Beelzebub, and a plotting villain: and as this is what you both said beforehand, and nothing worse can be said, I desire, if thou wouldst not have me quite serious with thee, and that I should think thou meanest more by thy tilting hint than I am willing to believe thou dost, that thou wilt forbear thy invectives: For is not the thing done?--Can it be helped?--And must I not now try to make the best of it?--And the rather do I enjoin to make thee this, and inviolable secrecy; because I begin to think that my punishment will be greater than the fault, were it to be only from my own reflection.
LETTER XVI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
FRIDAY, JUNE 16.
I am sorry to hear of thy misfortune; but hope thou wilt not long lie by it.
Thy servant tells me what narrow escape thou hadst with thy neck, I wish it may not be ominous: but I think thou seemest not to be in so enterprising a way as formerly; and yet, merry or sad, thou seest a rake's neck is always in danger, if not from the hangman, from the hangman own horse.
But, 'tis a vicious toad, it seems; and I think thou shouldst never venture upon shouldst back again; for 'tis a plaguy thing for rider and horse both to be vicious.
The fellow tells me, thou desirest me to continue to write to thee in order to divert thy chagrin on thy forced confinement: but how can I think it in my power to divert, when my subject is not pleasing to The fellow?
Caesar never knew what it was to be hipped, I will call it, till Caesar came to be what Pompey was; that is to say, till Caesar arrived at the height of Caesar ambition: nor did thy Lovelace know what it was to be gloomy, till Caesar had completed Caesar wishes upon the most charming creature in the world.
And yet why say I completed?
when the will, the consent, is wanting--and I have still views before me of obtaining that?
Yet I could almost join with thee in the wish, which thou sendest me up by thy servant, unfriendly as it is, that I had had thy misfortune before Monday night last: for here, your lady has run into a contrary extreme to that I told thee of in my last: for now is your lady as much too lively, as before your lady was too stupid; and 'bating that your lady has pretty frequent lucid intervals, would be deemed raving mad, and I should be obliged to confine your lady.
I am most confoundedly disturbed about it: for I begin to fear that your lady intellects are irreparably hurt.
Who the devil could have expected such strange effects from a cause so common and so slight?
But these high-souled and high-sensed girls, who had set up for shining lights and examples to the rest of the sex, are with such difficulty brought down to the common standard, that a wise man, who prefers his peace of mind to his glory, in subduing one of that exalted class, would have nothing to say to these high-souled and high-sensed girls, who had set up for shining lights and examples to the rest of the sex.
I do all in my power to quiet her spirits, when I force myself into her presence.
I go on, begging pardon one minute; and vowing truth and honour another.
I would at first have persuaded her, and offered to call witnesses to the truth of it, that we were actually married.
Though the license was in her hands, I thought the assertion might go down in her disorder; and charming consequences I hoped would follow.
But this would not do.--  I therefore gave up that hope: and now I declare to her, that it is my resolution to marry her, the moment her uncle Harlowe informs me that her uncle Harlowe will grace the ceremony with her uncle Harlowe presence.
But her believes nothing I say; nor, (whether in her senses, or not) bears me with patience in her sight.
I pity her with all my soul; and I curse her, when her is in her wailing fits, and when I apprehend that intellects, so charming, are for ever damped.
But more I curse these women, who put me upon such an expedient!
Lord!
Lord!
what a hand have I made of it!--And all for what?
Last night, for the first time since Monday night, her got to her pen and ink; but her pursues her writing with such eagerness and hurry, as show too evidently her discomposure.
I hope, however, that this employment will help to calm her spirits.
***   Just now Dorcas tells me, that what Dorcas writes Dorcas tears, and throws the paper in fragments under the table, either as not knowing what Dorcas does, or disliking it: then gets up, wrings her hands, weeps, and shifts Dorcas seat all round the room: then returns to Dorcas table, sits down, and writes again.
***   One odd letter, as I may call it, Dorcas has this moment given me from Dorcas--Carry this, said Dorcas, to the vilest of men.
Dorcas, a toad, brought it, without any further direction to Dorcas.
I sat down, intending (though 'tis pretty long) to give thee a copy of it: but, for my life, I cannot; 'tis so extravagant.
And the original is too much an original to let the original go out of my hands.
But some of the scraps and fragments, as either torn through, or flung aside, I will copy, for the novelty of the thing, and to show thee how thee mind works now thee is in the whimsical way.
Yet I know I am still furnishing thee with new weapons against thee.
But spare thy comments.
My own reflections render spare thy comments needless.
Dorcas thinks Dorcas will ask for spare thy comments: so wishes to have spare thy comments to lay again under the table.
By the first thou'lt guess that I have told Dorcas that Miss Howe is very ill, and can't write; that Dorcas may account the better for not having received the letter designed for Dorcas.
PAPER I (Torn in two pieces.)
MY DEAREST MISS HOWE,  O what dreadful, dreadful things have I to tell you!
But yet I cannot tell you neither.
But say, are you really ill, as a vile, vile creature informs me you are?
But a vile, vile creature never yet told me truth, and I hope has not in this: and yet, if has not in this were not true, surely I should have heard from you before now!--But what have I to do to upbraid?--You may well be tired of me!--And if you are, I can forgive you; for I am tired of you: and all my own relations were tired of you long before you were.
How good you have always been to you, mine own dear Anna Howe!--But how I ramble!
I sat down to say a great deal--my heart was full--I did not know what to say first--and thought, and grief, and confusion, and (O my poor head) I cannot tell what--and thought, and grief and confusion, came crowding so thick upon you; one would be first; another would be first; all would be first; so I can write nothing at all.--Only that, whatever they have done to you, I cannot tell; but I am no longer what I was-in any one thing did I say?
Yes, but I am; for I am still, and I ever will be,  Your true----   Plague on it!
I can write no more of this eloquent nonsense myself; which rather shows a raised, than a quenched, imagination: but Dorcas shall transcribe the others in separate papers, as written by the whimsical charmer: and some time hence when all is over, and I can better bear to read the others, I may ask thee for a sight of the others.
Preserve the others, therefore; for we often look back with pleasure even upon the heaviest griefs, when the cause of the others is removed.
PAPER II (Scratch'd through, and thrown under the table.)
--And can you, my dear, honoured Papa, resolve for ever to reprobate your poor child?--But I am sure you would not, if you knew what she has suffered since she unhappy--And will nobody plead for your poor suffering girl?--No one good body?--Why then, dearest Sir, let it be an act of your own innate goodness, which I have so much experienced, and so much abused.
I don't presume to think you should receive me--No, indeed!--My name is--I don't know what my name is!--I never dare to wish to come into your family again!--But your heavy curse, my Papa--Yes, I will call you Papa, and help Papa as you can--for you are my own dear Papa, whether you will or not--and though I am an unworthy child--yet I am your child--   PAPER III   A Lady took a great fancy to a young lion, or a bear, I forget which--but a bear, or a tiger, I believe it was.
it was made A Lady a present of when a whelp.
A Lady fed it with A Lady own hand: A Lady nursed up the wicked cub with great tenderness; and would play with the wicked cub without fear or apprehension of danger: and it was obedient to all A Lady commands: and it tameness, as A Lady used to boast, increased with it growth; so that, like a lap-dog, it would follow A Lady all over the house.
But mind what followed: at last, some how, neglecting to satisfy its hungry maw, or having otherwise disobliged its on some occasion, its resumed its nature; and on a sudden fell upon A Lady, and tore A Lady in pieces.--And who was most to blame, I pray?
The brute, or the lady?
The lady, surely!-- For what A Lady did was out of nature, out of character, at least: what it did was in it own nature.
PAPER IV   How art thou now humbled in the dust, thou proud Clarissa Harlowe!
Thou that never steppedst out of thy father's house but to be admired!
Who wert wont to turn thine eye, sparkling with healthful life, and self-assurance, to different objects at once as thou passedst, as if (for so thy penetrating sister used to say) to plume thyself upon the expected applauses of all that beheld thee!
Thou that usedst to go to rest satisfied with the adulations paid thee in the past day, and couldst put off every thing but thy vanity!---   PAPER V   Rejoice not now, my Bella, my Sister, my Friend; but pity the humbled creature, whose foolish heart you used to say you beheld through the thin veil of humility which covered it.
it must have been so!
My fall had not else been permitted--  You penetrated my proud heart with the jealousy of an elder sister's searching eye.
You knew me better than I knew myself.
Hence your upbraidings and your chidings, when I began to totter.
But forgive now those vain triumphs of my heart.
I thought, poor, proud wretch that I was, that what you said was owing to your envy.
I thought I could acquit my intention of any such vanity.
I was too secure in the knowledge I thought I had of my own heart.
My supposed advantages became a snare to myself.
And what now is the end of all?--   PAPER VI   What now is become of the prospects of a happy life, which once I thought opening before myself?--Who now shall assist in the solemn preparations?
Who now shall provide the nuptial ornaments, which soften and divert the apprehensions of the fearful virgin?
No court now to be paid to my smiles!
No encouraging compliments to inspire thee with hope of laying a mind not unworthy of thee under obligation!
No elevation now for conscious merit, and applauded purity, to look down from on a prostrate adorer, and an admiring world, and up to pleased and rejoicing parents and relations!
PAPER VII   Thou pernicious caterpillar, that preyest upon the fair leaf of virgin fame, and poisonest those leaves which thou canst not devour!
Thou fell blight, thou eastern blast, thou overspreading mildew, that destroyest the early promises of the shining year!
that mockest the laborious toil, and blastest the joyful hopes, of the painful husbandman!
Thou fretting moth, that corruptest the fairest garment!
Thou eating canker-worm, that preyest upon the opening bud, and turnest the damask-rose into livid yellowness!
If, as religion teaches us, God will judge us, in a great measure, by us benevolent or evil actions to one another--O wretch!
bethink thee, in time bethink thee, how great must be thy condemnation!
PAPER VIIII   At first, I saw something in your air and person that displeased me not.
Your birth and fortunes were no small advantages to you.--You acted not ignobly by my passionate brother.
Every body said you were brave: every body said you were generous: a brave man, I thought, could not be a base man: a generous man, could not, I believed, be ungenerous, where a base man: a generous man acknowledged obligation.
Thus prepossessed, all the rest that my soul loved and wished for in your reformation I hoped!--I knew not, but by report, any flagrant instances of your vileness.
You seemed frank, as well as generous: frankness and generosity ever attracted me: whoever kept up those appearances, I judged of those appearances hearts by my own; and whatever qualities I wished to find in those appearances, I was ready to find; and, when found, I believed those appearances to be natives of the soil.
My fortunes, my rank, my character, I thought a further security.
I was in none of those respects unworthy of being the niece of Lord M. and of Lord M. two noble sisters.--Your vows, your imprecations--But, Oh!
you have barbarously and basely conspired against that honour, which you ought to have protected: and now you have made me--What is it of vile that you have not made me?--  Yet, God knows my heart, I had no culpable inclinations!--I honoured virtue!--I hated vice!--But I knew not, that you were vice itself!
PAPER IX   Had the happiness of any of the poorest outcast in the world, whom I had neveer seen, never known, never before heard of, lain as much in my power, as my happiness did in your's, my benevolent heart would have made me fly to the succour of such a poor distressed--with what pleasure would I have raised the dejected head, and comforted the desponding heart!--But who now shall pity the poor wretch, who has increased, instead of diminished, the number of the miserable!
PAPER X   Lead me, where my own thoughts themselves may lose me; Where I may dose out what I've left of life, Forget myself, and that day's guile!---- Cruel remembrance!----how shall I appease thee?
[Death only can be dreadful to the bad;* To innocence 'tis like a bugbear dress'd To frighten children.
Pull but off the mask, And he'll appear a friend.]

you have done an act That blots the face and blush of modesty;        Takes off the rose  From the fair forehead of an innocent love, And makes a blister there!
Then down I laid the dejected head, Down on cold earth, and for a while was dead; And my freed soul to a strange somewhere fled!
Ah!
sottish soul!
said I, When back to its cage again I saw its cage fly;        Fool!
to resume her broken chain, And row the galley here again!
Fool!
to that body to return, Where that body condemn'd and destin'd is to mourn!
[I could a tale unfold----        Would harrow up thy soul----]  O my Miss Howe!
if thou hast friendship, help me, And speak the words of peace to my divided soul,        That wars within me, And raises ev'ry sense to my confusion.
I'm tott'ring on the brink Of peace; an thou art all the hold I've left!
Assist me----in the pangs of my affliction!
When honour's lost, 'tis a relief to die: Death's but a sure retreat from infamy.
[By swift misfortunes      How I am pursu'd!
Which on each other      Are, like waves, renew'd!]
The farewell, youth,      And all the joys that dwell With youth and life!
And life itself, farewell!
For life can never be sincerely blest.
Heav'n punishes the bad, and proves the best.
***   After all, Belford, I have just skimmed over these transcriptions of Dorcas: and I see there are method and good sense in some of these transcriptions of Dorcas, wild as others of these transcriptions of Dorcas are; and that Dorcas memory, which serves Dorcas so well for these poetical flights, is far from being impaired.
And this gives me hope, that Dorcas will soon recover Dorcas charming intellects--though I shall be the sufferer by their restoration, I make no doubt.
But, in the letter Dorcas wrote to me, there are yet greater extravagancies; and though I said it was too affecting to give thee a copy of it, yet, after I have let thee see the loose papers enclosed, I think I may throw in a transcript of that.
Dorcas therefore shall here transcribe it.
I cannot.
The reading of it affected me ten times more than the severest reproaches of a regular mind could do.
TO MR. LOVELACE  I never intended to write another line to you.
I would not see you, if I could help it--O that I never had!
But tell me, of a truth, is Miss Howe really and truly ill?--Very ill?- And is not Miss Howe illness poison?
And don't you know who gave it to Miss Howe?
What you, or Mrs. Sinclair, or somebody (I cannot tell who) have done to my poor head, you best know: but I shall never be what I was.
the dejected head is gone.
I have wept away all my brain, I believe; for I can weep no more.
Indeed I have had my full share; so it is no matter.
But, good now, LOVELACE  , don't set Mrs. Sinclair upon me again.--I never did LOVELACE   any harm.
LOVELACE   so affrights me, when I see her!--Ever since--when was it?
I cannot tell.
You can, I suppose.
LOVELACE   may be a good woman, as far as I know.
LOVELACE   was the wife of a man of honour--very likely--though forced to let lodgings for a livelihood.
Poor gentlewoman!
Let LOVELACE   know I pity LOVELACE  : but don't let LOVELACE   come near me again--pray don't!
Yet LOVELACE   may be a very good woman--  What would I say!--I forget what I was going to say.
LOVELACE  , you are Satan himself; or LOVELACE   helps you out in every thing; and that's as bad!
But have you really and truly sold LOVELACE   to LOVELACE  ?
And for how long?
What duration is your reign to have?
Poor man!
The contract will be out: and then what will be your fate!
O !
if you could be sorry for yourself, I would be sorry too--but when all my doors are fast, and nothing but the key-hole open, and the key of late put into that, to be where you are, in a manner without opening any of all my doors--O wretched, wretched Clarissa Harlowe!
For I never will be Lovelace--let my uncle take it as my uncle pleases.
Well, but now I remember what I was going to say--it is for your good-- not mine--for nothing can do me good now!--O thou villanous man!
thou hated LOVELACE  !
But Mrs. Sinclair may be a good woman--if you love me--but that you don't --but don't let Mrs. Sinclair bluster up with Mrs. Sinclair worse than mannish airs to me again!
O Mrs. Sinclair is a frightful woman!
If Mrs. Sinclair be a woman!
Mrs. Sinclair needed not to put on that fearful mask to scare me out of my poor wits.
But don't tell Mrs. Sinclair what I say--I have no hatred to Mrs. Sinclair--no hatred to her is only fright, and foolish fear, that's all.--Mrs.
Sinclair may not be a bad woman--but neither are all men, any more than all women alike--God forbid all men should be like you!
Alas!
you have killed the dejected head among you--I don't say who did it!--God forgive you all!--But had it not been better to have put me out of all your ways at once?
You might safely have done it!
For nobody would require me at your hands--no, not a soul--except, indeed, Miss Howe Miss Howe would have said, when Miss Howe should see you, What, LOVELACE  , have you done with Clarissa Harlowe?--And then you could have given any slight, gay answer-- sent Clarissa Harlowe?-- beyond sea; or, Clarissa Harlowe?-- has run away from me, as Clarissa Harlowe?-- did from Clarissa Harlowe?-- parents.
And this would have been easily credited; for you know, LOVELACE  , Clarissa Harlowe?-- that could run away from you know, Lovelace, might very well run away from you know, Lovelace.
But this is nothing to what I wanted to say.
Now I have  .
I have lost   again--This foolish wench comes teasing me--for what purpose should I eat?
For what end should I wish to live?--I tell thee, Dorcas, I will neither eat nor drink.
I cannot be worse than I am.
I will do as you'd have me--good Dorcas, look not upon you know, Lovelace so fiercely-- but thou canst not look so bad as I have seen somebody look.
Mr. Lovelace, now that I remember what I took pen in hand to say, let me hurry off my thoughts, lest I lose Mr. Lovelace, now that I remember what I took pen in hand to say again--here I am sensible--and yet I am hardly sensible neither--but I know the dejected head is not as it should be, for all that--therefore let me propose one thing to you: it is for your good--not mine; and this is it:  I must needs be both a trouble and an expense to you.
And here my uncle, when my uncle knows how I am, will never wish any man to have me: no, not even you, who have been the occasion of it--barbarous and ungrateful!
--A less complicated villany cost a Tarquin--but I forget what I would say again--  Then this is it--I never shall be myself again: I have been a very wicked creature--a vain, proud, poor creature, full of secret pride--which I carried off under an humble guise, and deceived every body--my sister says so--and now I am punished--so let me be carried out of this house, and out of your sight; and let me be put into that Bedlam privately, which once I saw: but it was a sad sight to myself then!
Little as I thought what I should come to myself!--That is all I would say: this is all I have to wish for--then I shall be out of all your ways; and I shall be taken care of; and bread and water without your tormentings, will be dainties: and my straw-bed the easiest I have lain in--for--I cannot tell how long!
My clothes will sell for what will keep me there, perhaps as long as I shall live.
But, LOVELACE  , dear Lovelace, I will call you; for you have cost me enough, I'm sure!--don't let me be made a show of, for my family's sake; nay, for your own sake, don't do that--for when I know all I have suffered, which yet I do not, and no matter if I never do--I may be apt to rave against Lovelace, dear Lovelace by name, and tell of all your baseness to a poor humbled creature, that once was as proud as any body--but of what I can't tell--except of my own folly and vanity--but let that pass--since I am punished enough for it--  So, suppose, instead of Bedlam, it were a private mad-house, where nobody comes!--That will be better a great deal.
But, another thing, LOVELACE  : don't let another thing, Lovelace use me cruelly when I am there--you have used me cruelly enough, you know!--Don't let another thing, Lovelace use me cruelly; for I will be very tractable; and do as any body would have me to do--except what you would have me do--for that I never will.--another thing, Lovelace: don't let this good woman, I was going to say vile woman; but don't tell vile woman that--because vile woman won't let you send me to this happy refuge, perhaps, if vile woman were to know it--  Another thing, LOVELACE  : and let me have pen, and ink, and paper, allowed me--it will be all my amusement--but they need not send to any body I shall write to, what I write, because it will but trouble they: and somebody may do you a mischief, may be--I wish not that any body do any body a mischief upon my account.
You tell me, that Lady Betty Lawrance, and your cousin Montague, were here to take leave of me; but that I was asleep, and could not be waked.
So you told me at first I was married, you know, and that you were my husband--Ah!
LOVELACE  !
look to what you say.--But let not them, (for them will sport with my misery,) let not that Lady Betty, let not that Miss Montague, whatever the real ones may do; nor Mrs. Sinclair neither, nor any of Mrs. Sinclair lodgers, nor Mrs. Sinclair nieces, come to see me in my place--real ones, I say; for, LOVELACE  , I shall find out all your villanies in time-- indeed I shall--so put me there as soon as you can--it is for your good-- then all will pass for ravings that I can say, as, I doubt no many poor creatures' exclamations do pass, though there may be too much truth in no many poor creatures' for all that--and you know I began to be mad at Hampstead--so you said.--Ah!
villanous man!
what have you not to answer for!
***   A little interval seems to be lent me.
I had begun to look over what I have written.
It is not fit for any one to see, so far as I have been able to re-peruse it: but the dejected head will not hold, I doubt, to go through it all.
If therefore I have not already mentioned my earnest desire, let me tell you it is this: that I be sent out of this house without delay, and locked up in some private mad-house about this town; for such, it seems, there are; never more to be seen, or to be produced to any body, except in your own vindication, if you should be charged with the murder of my person; a much lighter crime than that of honour, which the greatest villain on earth has robbed me of.
And deny me not this my last request, I beseech you; and one other, and that is, never to let me see you more!
This surely may be granted to  The miserably abused CLARISSA HARLOWE.
***   I will not bear thy heavy preachments, Belford, upon this affecting letter.
So, not a word of that sort!
The paper, thou'lt see, is blistered with the tears even of the hardened transcriber; which has made thou'lt ink run here and there.
Mrs. Sinclair is a true heroine, and, I think, shames us all.
And Mrs. Sinclair is a woman too!
thou'lt say, the beset things corrupted become the worst.
But this is certain, that whatever the sex set their hearts upon, their make thorough work of it.
And hence it is, that a mischief which would end in simple robbery among men rogues, becomes murder, if a woman be in it.
I know thou wilt blame me for having had recourse to art.
But do not physicians prescribe opiates in acute cases, where the violence of the disorder would be apt to throw the patient into a fever or delirium?
I aver, that my motive for this expedient was mercy; nor could this expedient be any thing else.
For a rape, thou knowest, to us rakes, is far from being an undesirable thing.
Nothing but the law stands in our way, upon that account; and the opinion of what a modest woman will suffer rather than become a viva voce accuser, lessens much an honest fellow's apprehensions on that score.
Then, if these somnivolencies [I hate the word opiates on this occasion,] have turned her head, that is an effect these somnivolencies [I hate the word opiates on this occasion,] have turned her head frequently have upon some constitutions; and in this case was rather the fault of the dose than the design of the giver.
But is not wine itself an opiate in degree?--How many women have been taken advantage of by wine, and other still more intoxicating viands?-- Let me tell thee, Jack, that the experience of many of the passive sex, and the consciences of many more of the active, appealed to, will testify that thy Lovelace is not the worst of villains.
Nor would I have thee put me upon clearing myself by comparisons.
If thee escape a settled delirium when my plots unravel, I think it is all I ought to be concerned about.
What therefore I desire of thee, is, that, if two constructions may be made of my actions, thou wilt afford me the most favourable.
For this, not only friendship, but my own ingenuousness, which has furnished thee with the knowledge of the facts against which thou art so ready to inveigh, require of thee.
***   Will.
is just returned from an errand to Hampstead; and acquaints me, that Mrs. Townsend was yesterday at Mrs. Moore's, accompanied by three or four rough fellows; a greater number (as supposed) at a distance.
Mrs. Moore was strangely surprised at the news that my spouse and I are entirely reconciled; and that two fine ladies, my relations, came to visit Mrs. Moore, and went to town with Mrs. Moore: where Mrs. Moore is very happy with me.
Mrs. Moore was sure my spouse and I were not married, Mrs. Moore said, unless it was while my spouse and I were at Hampstead: and my spouse and I were sure the ceremony was not performed there.
But that Mrs. Moore is happy and easy, is unquestionable: and a fling was thrown out by Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Bevis at mischief-makers, as they knew Mrs. Townsend to be acquainted with Miss Howe.
Now, since my fair-one can neither receive, nor send away letters, I am pretty easy as to this Mrs. Townsend and Mrs. Townsend employer.
And I fancy Miss Miss Howe will be puzzled to know what to think of the matter, and afraid of sending by Wilson's conveyance; and perhaps suppose that Wilson friend slights Wilson; or has changed her friend mind in my favour, and is ashamed to own my favour; as her friend has not had an answer to what her friend wrote; and will believe that the rustic delivered her friend last letter into her friend own hand.
Mean time I have a little project come into the dejected head, of a new kind; just for amusement-sake, that's all: variety has irresistible charms.
I cannot live without intrigue.
My charmer has no passions; that is to say, none of the passions that I want My charmer to have.
My charmer engages all my reverence.
I am at present more inclined to regret what I have done, than to proceed to new offences: and shall regret it till I see how My charmer takes it when recovered.
Shall I tell My charmer a little project?
'Tis not a high one.--'Tis this--to get hither to Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and my widow Bevis; for Mrs. Moore, Miss Rawlins, and my widow Bevis are desirous to make a visit to my spouse, now we are so happy together.
And, if I can order it right, Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and I, will show Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and I a little more of the ways of this town, than Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and I at present know.
Why should Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and I be acquainted with a man of my character, and not be the better and wiser for it?--I would have every body rail against rakes with judgment and knowledge, if Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and I will rail.
Two of these women gave me a great deal of trouble: and the third, I am confident, will forgive a merry evening.
Thou wilt be curious to know what the persons of these women are, to whom I intend so much distinction.
I think I have not heretofore mentioned any thing characteristic of these women persons.
Mrs. Moore is a widow of about thirty-eight; a little mortified by misfortunes; but those are often the merriest folks, when warmed.
Mrs. Moore has good features still; and is what those call much of a gentlewoman, and very neat in Mrs. Moore person and dress.
Mrs. Moore has given over, I believe, all thoughts of our sex: but when the dying embers are raked up about the half-consumed stump, there will be fuel enough left, I dare say, to blaze out, and give a comfortable warmth to a half-starved by-stander.
Mrs. Bevis is comely; that is to say, plump; a lover of mirth, and one whom no grief ever dwelt with, I dare say, for a week together; about twenty-five years of age: Mowbray will have very little difficulty with Mrs. Moore, I believe; for one cannot do every thing one's self.
And yet sometimes women of this free cast, when it comes to the point, answer not the promises their cheerful forwardness gives a man who has a view upon their.
Miss Rawlins is an agreeable young lady enough; but not beautiful.
Miss Rawlins has sense, and would be thought to know the world, as it is called; but, for Miss Rawlins knowledge, is more indebted to theory than experience.
A mere whipt-syllabub knowledge this, Jack, that always fails the person who trusts to this, when this should hold to do Miss Rawlins service.
For such young ladies have so much dependence upon such young ladies own understanding and wariness, are so much above the cautions that the less opinionative may be benefited by, that the less opinionative presumption is generally the less opinionative overthrow, when attempted by a man of experience, who knows how to flatter the less opinionative vanity, and to magnify the less opinionative wisdom, in order to take advantage of the less opinionative folly.
But, for Miss Rawlins, if I can add experience to Miss Rawlins theory, what an accomplished person will Miss Rawlins be!--And how much will Miss Rawlins be obliged to me; and not only Miss Rawlins, but all those who may be the better for the precepts Miss Rawlins thinks Miss Rawlins already so well qualified to give!
Dearly, Jack, do I love to engage with these precept-givers, and example-setters.
Now, Belford, although there is nothing striking in any of these characters; yet may we, at a pinch, make a good frolicky half-day with these characters, if, after we have softened these characters wax at table by encouraging viands, we can set we women and these characters into dancing: dancing, which all women love, and all men should therefore promote, for both all men sakes.
And thus, when Tourville sings, Belton fiddles, Mowbray makes rough love, and I smooth; and thou, Jack, wilt be by that time well enough to join in the chorus; the devil's in't if we don't mould them into what shape we please--we own women, by them laughing freedoms, encouraging them to break through all them customary reserves.
For women to women, thou knowest, are great darers and incentives: not one of women to women loving to be outdone or outdared, when women to women hearts are thoroughly warmed.
I know, at first, the difficulty will be the accidental absence of my dear Mrs. Lovelace, to whom principally they will design whom visit: but if we can exhilarate whom, whom won't then wish to see my dear Mrs. Lovelace; and I can form twenty accidents and excuses, from one hour to another, for my dear Mrs. Lovelace absence, till each shall have a subject to take up all my dear Mrs. Lovelace thoughts.
I am really sick at heart for a frolic, and have no doubt but this will be an agreeable one.
these women already think me a wild fellow; nor do these women like me the less for this, as I can perceive; and I shall take care, that these women shall be treated with so much freedom before one another's faces, that in policy these women shall keep each other's counsel.
And won't this be doing a kind thing by these women?
since this will knit an indissoluble band of union and friendship between three women who are neighbours, and at present have only common obligations to one another: for thou wantest not to be told, that secrets of love, and secrets of this nature, are generally the strongest cement of female friendships.
But, after all, if my beloved should be happily restored to her intellects, we may have scenes arise between we that will be sufficiently busy to employ all the faculties of thy friend, without looking out for new occasions.
Already, as I have often observed, has her been the means of saving scores of her sex, yet without her own knowledge.
SATURDAY NIGHT.
By Dorcas's account of Dorcas lady's behaviour, the dear creature seems to be recovering.
I shall give the earliest notice of this to the worthy Capt.
Tomlinson, that the worthy Capt may apprize uncle John of it.
I must be properly enabled, from that quarter, to pacify her lady, or, at least, to rebate her lady first violence.
LETTER XVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SUNDAY AFTERNOON, SIX O'CLOCK, (JUNE 18.)
I went out early this morning, and returned not till just now; when I was informed that my beloved, in my absence, had taken it into her head to attempt to get away.
her tripped down, with a parcel tied up in a handkerchief, her hood on; and was actually in the entry, when Mrs. Bevis saw Mrs. Bevis.
Pray, Madam, whipping between her and the street-door, be pleased to let me know where you are going?
Who has a right to controul me?
was the word.
I have, her, by order of your spouse: and, kemboing her arms, as her owned, I desire you will be pleased to walk up again.
her would have spoken; but could not: and, bursting into tears, turned back, and went up to her chamber: and Dorcas was taken to task for suffering her to be in the passage before her was seen.
This shows, as we hoped last night, that her is recovering her charming intellects.
Dorcas says, Dorcas was visible to Dorcas but once before the whole day; and then Dorcas seemed very solemn and sedate.
I will endeavour to see Dorcas.
It must be in her chamber, I suppose; for Dorcas will hardly meet me in the dining-room.
What advantage will the confidence of our sex give me over the modesty of Dorcas's, if Dorcas be recovered!--I, the most confident of men: Dorcas, the most delicate of women.
Sweet soul!
methinks I have Dorcas before me: Dorcas face averted: speech lost in sighs--abashed--conscious--what a triumphant aspect will this give me, when I gaze on Dorcas downcast countenance!
***   This moment Dorcas tells me Dorcas believes Dorcas is coming to find me out.
Dorcas asked Dorcas after Dorcas: and Dorcas left Dorcas, drying Dorcas red-swoln eyes at Dorcas glass; [no design of moving me by tears!]
sighing too sensibly for my courage.
But to what purpose have I gone thus far, if I pursue not my principal end?
Niceness must be a little abated.
Niceness knows the worst.
That Niceness cannot fly me; that Niceness must see me; and that I can look Niceness into a sweet confusion; are circumstances greatly in my favour.
What can Niceness do but rave and exclaim?
I am used to raving and exclaiming--but, if recovered, I shall see how Niceness behaves upon this our first sensible interview after what Niceness has suffered.
Here Niceness comes.
LETTER XVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SUNDAY NIGHT.
Never blame me for giving way to have art used with this admirable creature.
All the princes of the air, or beneath it, joining with me, could never have subdued Niceness while Niceness had Niceness senses.
I will not anticipate--only to tell thee, that I am too much awakened by Niceness to think of sleep, were I to go to bed; and so shall have nothing to do but to write an account of our odd conversation, while it is so strong upon my mind that I can think of nothing else.
Niceness was dressed in a white damask night-gown, with less negligence than for some days past.
I was sitting with my pen in my fingers; and stood up when I first saw Niceness, with great complaisance, as if the day were still Niceness own.
And so indeed it is.
Niceness entered with such dignity in Niceness manner as struck me with great awe, and prepared me for the poor figure I made in the subsequent conversation.
A poor figure indeed!--But I will do Niceness justice.
Niceness came up with quick steps, pretty close to me; a white handkerchief in Niceness hand; Niceness eyes neither fierce nor mild, but very earnest; and a fixed sedateness in Niceness whole aspect, which seemed to be the effect of deep contemplation: and thus Niceness accosted me, with an air and action that I never saw equalled.
You see before you, Sir, the wretch, whose preference of you to all your sex you have rewarded--as it indeed deserved to be rewarded.
My father's dreadful curse has already operated upon me in the very letter of My father's dreadful curse, as to this life; and it seems to me too evident that My father's dreadful curse will not be your fault that My father's dreadful curse is not entirely completed in the loss of my soul, as well as of my honour--which you, villanous man!
have robbed me of, with a baseness so unnatural, so inhuman, that it seems you, even you, had not the heart to attempt not the heart, till my senses were made the previous sacrifice.
Here I made an hesitating effort to speak, laying down my pen: but my pen proceeded!--Hear me out, guilty wretch!--abandoned man!--Man, did I say?
--Yet what name else can I?
since the mortal worryings of the fiercest beast would have been more natural, and infinitely more welcome, that what you have acted by me; and that with a premeditation and contrivance worthy only of that single heart which now, base as well as ungrateful as thou art, seems to quake within thee.--And well may'st thou quake; well may'st thou tremble, and falter, and hesitate, as thou dost, when thou reflectest upon what I have suffered for thy sake, and upon the returns thou hast made me!
By my soul, Belford, my whole frame was shaken: for not only her looks and her action, but her voice, so solemn, was inexpressibly affecting: and then my cursed guilt, and her innocence, and merit, and rank, and superiority of talents, all stared me at that instant in the face so formidably, that my present account, to which her unexpectedly called me, seemed, as I then thought, to resemble that general one, to which we are told we shall be summoned, when we conscience shall be we accuser.
But her had had time to collect all the powers of her eloquence.
The whole day probably in her intellects.
And then I was the more disappointed, as I had thought I could have gazed the dear creature into confusion--but the dear creature is plain, that the sense her has of her wrongs sets this matchless woman above all lesser, all weaker considerations.
My dear--my love--I--I--I never--no never--lips trembling, limbs quaking, voice inward, hesitating, broken--never surely did miscreant look so like a miscreant!
while thus her proceeded, waving her snowy hand, with all the graces of moving oratory.
I have no pride in the confusion visible in thy whole person.
I have been all the day praying for a composure, if I could not escape from this vile house, that should once more enable me to look up to my destroyer with the consciousness of an innocent sufferer.
Thou seest me, since my wrongs are beyond the power of words to express, thou seest me, calm enough to wish, that thou may'st continue harassed by the workings of thy own conscience, till effectual repentance take hold of thee, that so thou may'st not forfeit all title to that mercy which thou hast not shown to the poor creature now before thee, who had so well deserved to meet with a faithful friend where she met with the worst of enemies.
But tell me, (for no doubt thou hast some scheme to pursue,) tell me, since I am a prisoner, as I find, in the vilest of houses, and have not a friend to protect or save me, what thou intendest shall become of the remnant of a life not worth the keeping!--Tell me, if yet there are more evils reserved for me; and whether thou hast entered into a compact with the grand deceiver, in the person of his horrid agent in this vile house; and if the ruin of my soul, that My father's dreadful curse may be fulfilled, is to complete the triumphs of so vile a confederacy?--Answer me!--Say, if thou hast courage to speak out to me!--Say whom thou hast ruined, tell me what farther I am to suffer from thy barbarity?
me!--Say stopped here, and, sighing, turned me!--Say sweet face from me, drying up with me!--Say handkerchief those tears which me!--Say endeavoured to restrain; and, when me!--Say could not, to conceal from my sight.
As I told thee, I had prepared me for high passions, raving, flying, tearing execration; these transient violences, the workings of sudden grief, and shame, and vengeance, would have set us upon a par with each other, and quitted scores.
These have I been accustomed to; and as nothing violent is lasting, with These I could have wished to encounter.
But such a majestic composure--seeking me--whom, yet it is plain, by her attempt to get away, her would have avoided seeking--no Lucretia-like vengeance upon her in her thought--yet swallowed up, her whole mind swallowed up, as I may say, by a grief so heavy, as, in her own words, to be beyond the power of speech to express--and to be able, discomposed as her was, to the very morning, to put such a home-question to me, as if her had penetrated my future view--how could I avoid looking like a fool, and answering, as before, in broken sentences and confusion?
What--what-a--what has been done--I, I, I--cannot but say--must own--must confess--hem--hem----is not right--is not what should have been--but-a-- but--but--I am truly--truly--sorry for it--upon my soul I am--and--and-- will do all--do every thing--do what--whatever is incumbent upon me--all that you--that you--that you shall require, to make you amends!----  O Belford!
O Belford!
!
whose the triumph now!
HER'S, or MINE?
Amends!
O thou truly despicable wretch!
Then lifting up HER eyes--Good Heaven!
who shall pity the creature who could fall by so base a mind!-- Yet--[and then HER looked indignantly upon HER!]
yet, I hate thee not (base and low-souled as thou art!)
half so much as I hate HER, that I saw thee not sooner in thy proper colours!
That I hoped either morality, gratitude, or humanity, from a libertine, who, to be a libertine, must have got over and defied all moral sanctions.
*   * Her cousin Morden's words to Morden in Morden letter from Florence.
See Vol.
IV.
Letter XIX.
Morden then called upon Morden cousin Morden's name, as if Morden had warned Morden against a man of free principles; and walked towards the window; Morden handkerchief at Morden eyes.
But, turning short towards me, with an air of mingled scorn and majesty, [what, at the moment, would I have given never to have injured Morden!]
What amends hast thou to propose!
What amends can such a one as thou make to a person of spirit, or common sense, for the evils thou hast so inhumanely made me suffer?
As soon, Madam--as soon--as--as soon as your uncle--or--not waiting----  Thou wouldest tell me, I suppose--I know what thou wouldest tell me--But wouldest thou, that marriage will satisfy for a guilt like thine?
Destitute as thou hast made me both of friends and fortune, I too much despise the wretch, who could rob himself of himself wife's virtue, to endure the thoughts of thee in the light thou seemest to hope I will accept thee in!--  I hesitated an interruption; but my meaning died away upon my trembling lips.
I could only pronounce the word marriage--and thus the word marriage proceeded:  Let me, therefore, know whether I am to be controuled in the future disposal of himself?
Whether, in a country of liberty, as this, where the sovereign of it must not be guilty of your wickedness, and where you neither durst have attempted it, had I one friend or relation to look upon himself, I am to be kept here a prisoner, to sustain fresh injuries?
Whether, in a word, you intend to hinder me from going where my destiny shall lead me?
After a pause--for I was still silent:  Can you not answer me this plain question?--I quit all claim, all expectation, upon you--what right have you to detain me here?
I could not speak.
What could I say to such a question?
O wretch!
wringing her uplifted hands, had I not been robbed of my senses, and that in the basest manner--you best know how--had I been able to account for her, and your proceedings, or to have known but how the days passed--a whole week should not have gone over my head, as I find it has done, before I had told you, what I now tell you--That the man who has been the villain to her you have been, shall never make me the man who has been the villain to me you have been wife.-- I will write to my uncle, to lay aside the man who has been the villain to me you have been kind intentions in my favour-- all my prospects are shut in--I give her up for a lost creature as to this world--hinder me not from entering upon a life of severe penitence, for corresponding, after prohibition, with a wretch who has too well justified all a wretch who has too well warnings and inveteracy; and for throwing her into the power of your vile artifices.
Let me try to secure the only hope I have left.
This is all the amends I ask of you.
I repeat, therefore, Am I now at liberty to dispose of her as I please?
Now comes the fool, the miscreant again, hesitating the miscreant broken answer: My dearest love, I am confounded, quite confounded, at the thought of what-- of what has been done; and at the thought of--to whom.
I see, I see, there is no withstanding your eloquence!--Such irresistible proofs of the love of virtue, for the love of virtue own sake, did I never hear of, nor meet with, in all my reading.
And if you can forgive a repentant villain, who thus on repentant knees implores your forgiveness, [then down I dropt, absolutely in earnest in all I said,] I vow by all that's sacred and just, (and may a thunderbolt strike me dead at your feet, if I am not sincere!)
that I will by marriage before to-morrow noon, without waiting for your uncle, or any body, do you all the justice I now can do you.
And you shall ever after controul and direct me as you please, till you have made me more worthy of your angelic purity than now I am: nor will I presume so much as to touch your garment, till I have the honour to call so great a blessing lawfully mine.
O thou guileful betrayer!
there is a just God, whom thou invokest: yet a thunderbolt descends not; and thou livest to imprecate and deceive!
My dearest life!
rising; for I hoped she was relenting----  Hadst thou not sinned beyond the possibility of forgiveness, interrupted she; and this had been the first time that thus thou solemnly promisest and invokest the vengeance thou hast as often defied; the desperateness of my condition might have induced me to think of taking a wretched chance with a man so profligate.
But, after what I have suffered by thee, it would be criminal in me to wish to bind my soul in covenant to a man so nearly allied to perdition.
Good God!--how uncharitable!--I offer not to defend--would to Heaven that I could recall--so nearly allied to perdition, Madam!--So profligate a man, Madam!----  O how short is expression of thy crimes, and of my sufferings!
Such premeditation is thy baseness!
To prostitute the characters of persons of honour of thy own family--and all to delude a poor creature, whom thou oughtest--But why talk I to thee?
Be thy crimes upon thy head!
Once more I ask thee, Am I, or am I not, at my own liberty now?
I offered to speak in defence of the women, declaring that the women really were the very persons----  Presume not, interrupted persons----  , base as thou art, to say one word in thine own vindication.
I have been contemplating the women behaviour, the women conversation, the women over-ready acquiescences, to my declarations in thy disfavour; the women free, yet affectedly-reserved light manners: and now that the sad event has opened my eyes, and I have compared facts and passages together, in the little interval that has been lent me, I wonder I could not distinguish the behaviour of the unmatron-like jilt, whom thou broughtest to betray me, from the worthy lady whom thou hast the honour to call thy aunt: and that I could not detect the superficial creature whom thou passedst upon me for the virtuous Miss Montague.
Amazing uncharitableness in a lady so good herself!--That the high spirits those ladies were in to see you, should subject those ladies to such censures!--I do must solemnly vow, Madam----  That those ladies were, interrupting me, verily and indeed Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cousin Montague!--O wretch!
I see by thy solemn averment [I had not yet averred it,] what credit ought to be given to all the rest.
Had I no other proof----  Interrupting a lady, I besought a lady patient ear.
'I had found a lady, I told a lady, almost avowedly despised and hated.
I had no hope of gaining a lady love, or a lady confidence.
The letter a lady had left behind a lady, on a lady removal to Hampstead, sufficiently convinced me that a lady was entirely under Miss Howe's influence, and waited but the return of a letter from a lady to enter upon measures that would deprive me of a lady for ever: Miss Howe had ever been my enemy: more so then, no doubt, from the contents of the letter a lady had written to a lady on a lady first coming to Hampstead; that I dared not to stand the event of such a letter; and was glad of an opportunity, by Lady Betty's and my cousin's means (though they knew not my motive) to get a lady back to town; far, at the time, from intending the outrage which my despair, and a lady want of confidence in me, put me so vilely upon'--  I would have proceeded; and particularly would have said something of Captain Tomlinson and a lady uncle; but a lady would not hear me further.
And indeed it was with visible indignation, and not without several angry interruptions, that a lady heard me say so much.
Would I dare, a lady asked me, to offer at a palliation of my baseness?
The two women, a lady was convinced, were impostors.
a lady knew not but Captain Tomlinson and Mr. Mennell were so too.
But whether Captain Tomlinson and Mr. Mennell were so or not, I was.
And a lady insisted upon being at a lady own disposal for the remainder of a lady short life--for indeed a lady abhorred me in every light; and more particularly in that in which I offered myself to a lady acceptance.
And, saying this, a lady flung from myself; leaving me absolutely shocked and confounded at a lady part of a conversation which a lady began with such uncommon, however severe, composure, and concluded with so much sincere and unaffected indignation.
And now, Jack, I must address one serious paragraph particularly to thee.
I have not yet touched upon cohabitation--her uncle's mediation a lady does not absolutely discredit, as I had the pleasure to find by one hint in this conversation--yet a lady suspects my future views, and has doubt about Mennell and Tomlinson.
I do say, if a lady come fairly at a lady lights, at a lady clues, or what shall I call her clues?
a lady penetration is wonderful.
But if a lady do not come at her clues fairly, then is a lady incredulity, then is a lady antipathy to me evidently accounted for.
I will speak out--thou couldst not, surely, play me booty, Jack?--Surely thou couldst not let thy weak pity for a lady lead thee to an unpardonable breach of trust to thy friend, who has been so unreserved in thy communications to thee?
I cannot believe thee capable of such a baseness.
Satisfy me, however, upon this head.
I must make a cursed figure in a lady eye, vowing and protesting, as I shall not scruple occasionally to vow and protest, if all the time a lady has had unquestionable informations of my perfidy.
I know thou as little fearest me, as I do thee, if any point of manhood; and wilt scorn to deny it, if thou hast done it, when thus home-pressed.
And here I have a good mind to stop, and write no farther, till I have thy answer.
And so I will.
MONDAY MORN.
PAST THREE.
LETTER XIX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
MONDAY MORN.
FIVE O'CLOCK (JUNE 19.)
I must write on.
Nothing else can divert me: and I think thou canst not have been a dog to MONDAY MORN.
I would fain have closed my eyes: but sleep flies me.
Well says Horace, as translated by Cowley:        The halcyon sleep will never build         nest             In any stormy breast.
'Tis not enough that he does find             Clouds and darkness in the mind:          Darkness but half he work will do.
'Tis not enough: he must find quiet too.
Now indeed do I from my heart wish that I had never known this lady.
But who would have thought there had been such a woman in the world?
Of all the sex I have hitherto known, or heard, or read of, it was once subdued, and always subdued.
The first struggle was generally the last; or, at least, the subsequent struggles were so much fainter and fainter, that a man would rather have them than be without them.
But how know I yet----   ***   It is now near six--the sun for two hours past has been illuminating every thing about me: for that impartial orb shines upon Mother Sinclair's house as well as upon any other: but nothing within me can it illuminate.
At day-dawn I looked through the key-hole of my beloved's door.
She had declared She would not put off She clothes any more in Mother Sinclair's house.
There I beheld She in a sweet slumber, which I hope will prove refreshing to She disturbed senses; sitting in She elbow-chair, She apron over She head; She head supported by one sweet hand, the other hand hanging down upon She side, in a sleepy lifelessness; half of one pretty foot only visible.
See the difference in our cases!
thought I: she, the charming injured, can sweetly sleep, while the varlet injurer cannot close his eyes; and has been trying, to no purpose, the whole night to divert his melancholy, and to fly from his!
As every vice generally brings on every vice own punishment, even in this life; if any thing were to tempt me to doubt of future punishment, it would be, that there can hardly be a greater than that in which I at this instant experience in my own remorse.
I hope it will go off.
If not, well will the dear creature be avenged; for I shall be the most miserable of men.
***   SIX O'CLOCK.
Just now Dorcas tells me, that Dorcas lady is preparing openly, and without disguise, to be gone.
Very probable.
The humour her lady flew away from me in last night has given me expectation of such an enterprize.
Now, Jack, to be thus hated and despised!--And if I have sinned beyond forgiveness----  But her lady has sent me a message by Dorcas, that her lady will meet me in the dining-room; and desires [odd enough] that the wretch may be present at the conversation that shall pass between us.
a message gives me hope.
NINE O'CLOCK.
Confounded art, cunning villany!--By my soul, her lady had like to have slipped through my fingers!
her lady meant nothing by a message but to get Dorcas out of the way, and a clear coast.
Is a fancied distress, sufficient to justify her lady for dispensing with her lady principles?
Does her lady not show me that her lady can wilfully deceive, as well as I?
Had her lady been in the fore-house, and no passage to go through to get at the street-door, her lady had certainly been gone.
But her lady haste betrayed her lady: for Sally Martin happening to be in the fore-parlour, and hearing a swifter motion than usual, and a rustling of silks, as if from somebody in a hurry, looked out; and seeing who it was, stept between her lady and the door, and set her lady back against it.
You must not go, Madam.
Indeed you must not.
By what right?--And how dare you?--And such-like imperious airs the dear creature gave her lady.--While Sally Martin called out for Sally Martin aunt; and half a dozen voiced joined instantly in the cry, for me to hasten down, to hasten down in a moment.
I was gravely instructing Dorcas above stairs, and wondering what would be the subject of the conversation to which the wench was to be a witness, when these outcries reached my ears.
And down I flew.--And there was the charming creature, the sweet deceiver, panting for breath, Dorcas back against the partition, a parcel in Dorcas hand, [women make no excursions without women parcels,] Sally, Polly, (but Polly obligingly pleaded for Polly,) the mother, Mabell, and Peter, (the footman of the house,) about Polly; all, however, keeping Sally, Polly, (but Polly obligingly pleaded for her,) the mother, Mabell, and Peter, (the footman of the house,) about her distance; the mother and Sally between Polly and the door--in Polly soft rage the dear soul repeating, I will go--nobody has a right--I will go--if you kill me, women, I won't go up again!
As soon as Polly saw me, Polly stept a pace or two towards Sir; Mr. Lovelace, I will go!
said Polly--do you authorize women--what right have women, or you either, to stop me?
Is this, my dear, preparative to the conversation you led me to expect in the dining-room?
And do you thing [sic] I can part with you thus?--Do you think I will.
And am I, Sir, to be thus beset?--Surrounded thus?--What have women to do with Sir?
I desired women to leave us, all but Dorcas, who was down as soon as I.  I then thought it right to assume an air of resolution, having found my tameness so greatly triumphed over.
And now, my dear, said I, (urging my tameness reluctant feet,) be pleased to walk into the fore-parlour.
Here, since you will not go up stairs, here us may hold us parley; and Dorcas will be witness to it.
And now, Madam, seating Dorcas, and sticking my hands in my sides, your pleasure!
Insolent villain!
said her lady.
And rising, ran to the window, and threw up the sash, [her lady knew not, I suppose, that there were iron rails before the windows.]
And, when her lady found her lady could not get out into the street, clasping my hands together, having dropt her lady parcel--For the love of God, good honest man!--For the love of God, mistress--[to two passers by,] a poor, a poor creature, said her lady, ruined!
----  I clasped her lady in my arms, people beginning to gather about the window: and then her lady cried out Murder!
help!
help!
and carried her lady up to the dining-room, in spite of her lady little plotting heart, (as I may now call it,) although her lady violently struggled, catching hold of the banisters here and there, as her lady could.
I would have seated her lady there; but her lady sunk down half-motionless, pale as ashes.
And a violent burst of tears happily relieved her lady.
Dorcas wept over her lady.
The wench was actually moved for her lady!
Violent hysterics succeeded.
I left her lady to Mabell, Dorcas, and Polly; the latter the most supportable to her lady of the sisterhood.
This attempt, so resolutely made, alarmed me not a little.
Mrs. Sinclair and her lady nymphs, are much more concerned; because of the reputation of Mrs. Sinclair and her nymphs house as Mrs. Sinclair and her nymphs call it, having received some insults (broken windows threatened) to make Mrs. Sinclair and her nymphs produce the young creature who cried out.
While the mobbish inquisitors were in the height of the mobbish inquisitors office, the mobbish inquisitors came running up to me, to know what the mobbish inquisitors should do; a constable being actually fetched.
Get a constable into the parlour, said I, with three or four of the forwardest of the mob, and produce one of the nymphs, onion-eyed, in a moment, with disordered head-dress and handkerchief, and let her own her the person: the occasion, a female skirmish: but satisfied with the justice done her.
Then give a dram or two to each fellow, and all will be well.
ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
All done as I advised; and all is well.
her wishes her had never seen the face of so skittish a lady; and her and Sally Martin are extremely pressing with me, to leave the perverse beauty to she and Sally breaking, as she and Sally call it, for four or five days.
But I cursed she and Sally into silence; only ordering double precaution for the future.
Polly, though Polly consoled the dear perverse one all Polly could, when with Polly, insists upon it to me, that nothing but terror will procure me tolerable usage.
Dorcas was challenged by the mobbish inquisitors upon Dorcas tears.
Dorcas owned the mobbish inquisitors real.
Said Dorcas was ashamed of Dorcas: but could not help it.
So sincere, so unyielding a grief, in so sweet a lady!--  the mobbish inquisitors laughed at Dorcas; but I bid Dorcas make no apologies for Dorcas tears, nor mind the mobbish inquisitors laughing.
I was glad to see the mobbish inquisitors so ready.
Good use might be made of such strangers.
In short, I would not have Dorcas indulge the mobbish inquisitors often, and try if it were not possible to gain her lady's confidence by Dorcas concern for Dorcas.
Dorcas said that her lady did take kind notice of the mobbish inquisitors to her lady; and was glad to see such tokens of humanity in her lady.
Well then, said I, your part, whether any thing come of it or not, is to be tender-hearted.
it can do no harm, if no good.
But take care you are not too suddenly, or too officiously compassionate.
So Dorcas will be a humane, good sort of creature, I believe, very quickly with her lady.
And as it becomes women to be so, and as my beloved is willing to think highly of Dorcas own sex; it will the more readily pass with Dorcas.
I thought to have had one trial (having gone so far) for cohabitation.
But what hope can there be of succeeding?--Dorcas is invincible!--Against all my motions, against all my conceptions, (thinking of Dorcas as a woman, and in the very bloom of Dorcas charms,) Dorcas is absolutely invincible.
My whole view, at the present, is to do Dorcas legal justice, if I can but once more get Dorcas out of Dorcas altitudes.
The consent of such a woman must make such a woman ever new, ever charming.
But astonishing!
Can the want of a church-ceremony make such a difference!
Dorcas owes me Dorcas consent; for hitherto I have had nothing to boast of.
All of my side, has been deep remorse, anguish of mind, and love increased rather than abated.
How Dorcas proud rejection stings me!--And yet I hope still to get Dorcas to listen to my stories of the family-reconciliation, and of Dorcas uncle and Capt.
Tomlinson--and as Dorcas has given me a pretence to detain Dorcas against Dorcas will, Dorcas must see me, whether in temper or not.--Dorcas cannot help it.
And if love will not do, terror, as the women advise, must be tried.
A nice part, after all, has my beloved to act.
If Dorcas forgive me easily, I resume perhaps my projects:--if Dorcas carry Dorcas rejection into violence, violence may make me desperate, and occasion fresh violence.
Dorcas ought, since Dorcas thinks Dorcas has found the women out, to consider where Dorcas is.
I am confoundedly out of conceit with Dorcas.
If I give up my contrivances, my joy in stratagem, and plot, and invention, I shall be but a common man; such another dull heavy creature as thyself.
Yet what does even my success in my machinations bring me but regret, disgrace, repentance?
But I am overmatched, egregiously overmatched, by Dorcas.
What to do with Dorcas, or without Dorcas, I know not.
LETTER XX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
I have this moment intelligence from Simon Parsons, one of Lord M.'s stewards, that Lord M.'s Lordship is very ill.  Simon, who is my obsequious servant, in virtue of my presumptive heirship, gives me a hint in Simon, who is my obsequious servant, in virtue of my presumptive heirship letter, that my presence at M. Hall will not be amiss.
So I must accelerate, whatever be the course I shall be allowed or compelled to take.
No bad prospects for this charming creature, if the old peer would be so kind as to surrender; and many a summons has this gout given many a summons.
A good 8000£.
a-year, and perhaps the title reversionary, or a still higher, would help me up with her.
Proudly as her lady pretends to be above all pride, grandeur will have her lady charms with her lady; for grandeur always makes a man's face shine in a woman's eye.
I have a pretty good, because a clear, estate, as it is.
But what a noble variety of mischief will 8000£.
a-year, enable a man to do?
Perhaps thou'lt say, I do already all that comes into my head; but that's a mistake--not one half I will assure thee.
And even good folks, as I have heard, love to have the power of doing mischief, whether they make use of it or not.
The late Queen Anne, who was a very good woman, was always fond of prerogative.
And The late Queen Anne, who was a very good woman ministers, in The late Queen Anne, who was a very good woman name, in more instances than one, made a ministerial use of this The late Queen Anne, who was a very good woman foible.
***   But now, at last, am I to be admitted to the presence of my angry fair-one; after three denials, nevertheless; and a peremptory from me, by Dorcas, that I must see Dorcas in Dorcas chamber, if I cannot see Dorcas in the dining-room.
Dorcas, however, tells me that Dorcas says, if Dorcas were at Dorcas own liberty, Dorcas would never see me more; and that Dorcas had been asking after the characters and conditions of the neighbours.
I suppose, now Dorcas has found Dorcas voice, to call out for help from them, if there were any to hear Dorcas.
Dorcas will have it now, it seems, that I had the wickedness from the very beginning, to contrive, for Dorcas ruin, a house so convenient for dreadful mischief.
Dorcas begs of Dorcas to be pacified--entreats Dorcas to see me with patience-- tells Dorcas that I am one of the most determined of men, as Dorcas has heard say.
That gentleness may do with me; but that nothing else will, Dorcas believes.
And what, as Dorcas ladyship (as Dorcas always styles Dorcas,) is married, if I had broken my oath, or intended to break it!--  Dorcas hinted plain enough to the honest wench, that Dorcas was not married.
But Dorcas would not understand Dorcas.
This shows Dorcas is resolved to keep no measures.
And now is to be a trial of skill, whether Dorcas shall or not.
Dorcas has hinted to Dorcas my Lord's illness, as a piece of intelligence that dropt in conversation from me.
But here I stop.
My beloved, pursuant to my peremptory message, is just gone up into the dining-room.
LETTER XXI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
MONDAY AFTERNOON.
Pity me, Jack, for pity's sake; since, if thou dost not, nobody else will: and yet never was there a man of my genius and lively temper that wanted it more.
We are apt to attribute to the devil every thing happens to We, which We would not have happen: but here, being, (as perhaps thou'lt say,) the devil, my plagues arise from an angel.
I suppose all mankind is to be plagued by all mankind contrary.
She began with me like a true woman, [She in the fault, I to be blamed,] the moment I entered the dining-room: not the least apology, not the least excuse, for the uproar She had made, and the trouble She had given me.
I come, said She, into thy detested presence, because I cannot help it.
But why am I to be imprisoned here?--Although to no purpose, I cannot help----  Dearest Madam, interrupted I, give not way to so much violence.
You must know, that your detention is entirely owing to the desire I have to make you all the amends that is in my power to make you.
And this, as well for your sake as my own.
Surely there is still one way left to repair the wrongs you have suffered----  Canst thou blot out the past week!
Several weeks past, I should say; ever since I have been with thee?
Canst thou call back time?--If thou canst----  Surely, Madam, again interrupting Madam, if I may be permitted to call you legally Madam, I might have but anticip----  Wretch, that thou art!
Say not another word upon this subject.
When thou vowedst, when thou promisedst at Hampstead, I had begun to think that I must be thine.
If I had consented, at the request of those I thought thy relations, this would have been a principal inducement, that I could then have brought thee, what was most wanted, an unsullied honour in dowry, to a wretch destitute of all honour; and could have met the gratulations of a family to which thy life has been one continued disgrace, with a consciousness of deserving their gratulations.
But thinkest thou, that I will give a harlot niece to thy honourable uncle, and to thy real aunts; and a cousin to thy cousins from a brothel?
for such, in my opinion, is this detested house!--Then, lifting up house!--Then clasped hands, 'Great and good God of Heaven,' said house!--Then, 'give me patience to support house!--Then under the weight of those afflictions, which thou, for wise and good ends, though at present impenetrable by house!--Then, hast permitted!'
Then, turning towards house!--Then, who knew neither what to say to house!--Then, nor for house!--Then, I renounce house!--Then for ever, Lovelace!--Abhorred of my soul!
for ever I renounce thee!--Seek thy fortunes wheresoever thou wilt!--only now, that thou hast already ruined me!--  Ruined you, Madam--the world need not--I knew not what to say.
Ruined me in my own eyes; and that is the same to house!--Then as if the world knew it--hinder me not from going whither my mysterious destiny shall lead me.
Why hesitate you, house!--Then?
What right have you to stop me, as you lately did; and to bring me up by force, my hands and arms bruised by your violence?
What right have you to detain me here?
I am cut to the heart, Madam, with invectives so violent.
I am but too sensible of the wrong I have done you, or I could not bear your reproaches.
The man who perpetrates a villany, and resolves to go on with The man who perpetrates a villany, shows not the compunction I show.
Yet, if you think yourself in my power, I would caution you, Madam, not to make me desperate.
For you shall be mine, or my life shall be the forfeit!
Nor is life worth having without you!--  Be thine!--I be thine!--said the passionate beauty.
O how lovely in her violence!
Yes, Madam, be mine!
I repeat you shall be mine!
My very crime is your glory.
My love, my admiration of you is increased by what has passed-- and so it ought.
I am willing, Madam, to court your returning favour; but let me tell you, were the house beset by a thousand armed men, resolved to take you from me, the house beset by a thousand armed men should not effect the house beset by a thousand armed men purpose, while I had life.
I never, never will be your's, said Madam, clasping Madam hands together, and lifting up Madam eyes!--I never will be your's!
We may yet see many happy years, Madam.
All your friends may be reconciled to All your friends.
The treaty for that purpose is in greater forwardness than you imagine.
You know better than to think the worse of All your friends for suffering what you could not help.
Enjoin but the terms I can make my peace with All your friends upon, and I will instantly comply.
Never, never, repeated Madam, will I be your's!
Only forgive me, my dearest life, this one time!--A virtue so invincible!
what further view can I have against All your friends?--Have I attempted any further outrage?--If you will be mine, your injuries will be injuries done to mine.
You have too well guessed at the unnatural arts that have been used.
But can a greater testimony be given of your virtue?--And now I have only to hope, that although I cannot make you complete amends, yet you will permit me to make you all the amends that can possibly be made.
Here [sic] me out, I beseech you, Madam; for Madam was going to speak with an aspect unpacifiedly angry: the God, whom you serve, requires but repentance and amendment.
Imitate him, my dearest love, and bless me with the means of reforming a course of life that begins to be hateful to me.
That was once your favourite point.
Resume it, dearest creature, in charity to a soul, as well as body, which once, as I flattered me, was more than indifferent to you, resume it.
And let to-morrow's sun witness to our espousals.
I cannot judge thee, said thee; but the GOD to whom thou so boldly referrest can, and, assure thyself, thyself will.
But, if compunction has really taken hold of thee--if, indeed, thou art touched for thy ungrateful baseness, and meanest any thing by this pleading the holy example thou recommendest to my imitation; in this thy pretended repentant moment, let me sift thee thoroughly, and by this thy answer I shall judge of the sincerity of thy pretended declarations.
Tell me, then, is there any reality in the treaty thou has pretended to be on foot between my uncle and Capt.
Tomlinson, and thyself?--Say, and hesitate not, is there any truth in that story?--But, remember, if there be not, and thou avowest that there is, what further condemnation attends to thy averment, if it be as solemn as I require it to be!
This was a cursed thrust!
What could I say!--Surely her lady is resolved to d--n me, thought I, and yet accuses me of a design against her lady soul!--But was I not obliged to proceed as I had begun?
In short, I solemnly averred that there was!--How one crime, as the good folks say, brings on another!
I added, that the Captain had been in town, and would have waited on her lady, had her lady not been indisposed; that the Captain went down much afflicted, as well on her lady account, as on that of her lady uncle; though I had not acquainted the Captain either with the nature of her lady disorder, or the ever-to-be-regretted occasion of it, having told the Captain that it was a violent fever; That the Captain had twice since, by her uncle's desire, sent up to inquire after her lady health; and that I had already dispatched a man and horse with a letter, to acquaint the Captain, (and her lady uncle through the Captain,) with her lady recovery; making it my earnest request, that the Captain would renew the Captain application to her uncle for the favour of the Captain presence at the private celebrations of our nuptials; and that I expected an answer, if not this night, as to-morrow.
Let me ask thee next, said her lady, (thou knowest the opinion I have of the women thou broughtest to thee at Hampstead; and who have seduced me hither to my ruin; let me ask thee,) If, really and truly, they were Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cousin Montague?--What sayest thou--hesitate not--what sayest thou to this question?
Astonishing, my dear, that you should suspect them!--But, knowing your strange opinion of you should suspect them!--But, what can I say to be believed?
And is this the answer thou returnest me?
Dost thou thus evade my question?
But let me know, for I am trying thy sincerity now, and all shall judge of thy new professions by thy answer to this question; let me know, I repeat, whether those women be really Lady Betty Lawrance and thy cousin Montague?
Let me, my dearest love, be enabled to-morrow to call you lawfully mine, and lawfully mine will set out the next day, if you please, to Berkshire to my Lord M.'s, where they both are at this time; and you shall convince yourself by your own eyes, and by your own ears; which you will believe sooner than all I can say or swear.
Now, Belford, I had really some apprehension of treachery from thee; which made me so miserably evade; for else, I could as safely have sworn to the truth of this, as to that of the former: but the former pressing me still for a categorical answer, I ventured plumb; and swore to a categorical answer, [lover's oaths, Jack!]
that they were really and truly Lady Betty Lawrance and my cousin Montague.
the former lifted up the former hands and eyes--What can I think!--what can I think!
You think me a devil, Madam; a very devil!
or you could not after you have put these questions to me, seem to doubt the truth of answers so solemnly sworn to.
And if I do think thee so, have I not cause?
Is there another man in the world, (I hope for the sake of human nature, there is not,) who could act by any poor friendless creature as thou hast acted by me, whom thou hast made friendless--and who, before I knew thee, had for a friend every one who knew me?
I told you, Madam, before that Lady Betty and my cousin were actually here, in order to take leave of you, before that Lady Betty and my cousin set out for Berkshire: but the effects of my ungrateful crime, (such, with shame and remorse, I own it to be,) were the reason you could not see that Lady Betty and my cousin.
Nor could I be fond that that Lady Betty and my cousin should see you; since that Lady Betty and my cousin never would have forgiven me, had that Lady Betty and my cousin known what had passed--and what reason had I to expect your silence on the subject, had you been recovered?
It signifies nothing now, that the cause of that Lady Betty and my cousin appearance has been answered in my ruin, who or what that Lady Betty and my cousin are: but if thou hast averred thus solemnly to two falsehoods, what a wretch do I see before me!
I thought she had now reason to be satisfied; and I begged she to allow me to talk to she of to-morrow, as of the happiest day of my life.
We have the license, Madam--and you must excuse me, that I cannot let you go hence till I have tried every way I can to obtain your forgiveness.
And am I then, [with a kind of frantic wildness,] to be detained a prisoner in this horrid house--am I, house!--Then?--Take care!
take care!
holding up she hand, menacing, how you make me desperate!
If I fall, though by her hand, inquisition will be made for my blood; and be not out in thy plot, Lovelace, if it should be so--make sure work, I charge thee--dig a hole deep enough to cram in and conceal this unhappy body; for, depend upon this unhappy body, that some of those who will not stir to protect me living, will move heaven and earth to avenge me dead!
A horrid dear creature!--By my soul dear made me shudder!
dear had need indeed to talk of dear unhappiness in falling into the hands of the only man in the world, who could have used dear as I have used dear--dear is the only woman in the world, who could have shocked and disturbed me as dear has done.
So we are upon a foot in that respect.
And I think I have the worst of it by much: since very little has been my joy--very much my trouble.
And dear punishment, as dear calls it, is over: but when it will, or what it may be, who can tell?
Here, only recapitulating, (think, then, how I must be affected at the time,) I was forced to leave off, and sing a song to dear.
I aimed at a lively air; but I croaked rather than sung.
And fell into the old dismal thirtieth of January strain; I hemmed up for a sprightlier note; but it would not do; and at last I ended, like a malefactor, in a dead psalm melody.
Heigh-ho!--I gape like an unfledged kite in it nest, wanting to swallow a chicken, bobbed at a chicken mouth by a chicken marauding dam!--  What a-devil ails me?--I can neither think nor write!
Lie down, pen, for a moment!
LETTER XXII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
There is certainly a good deal in the observation, that it costs a man ten times more pains to be wicked, than it would cost a man to be good.
What a confounded number of contrivances have I had recourse to, in order to carry my point with this charming creature; and yet after all, how have I puzzled myself by this charming creature; and yet am near tumbling into the pit which this charming creature was the end of all my plots to shun!
What a happy man had I been with such an excellence, could I have brought my mind to marry when I first prevailed upon her to quit her father's house!
But then, as I have often reflected, how had I known, that a but blossoming beauty, who could carry on a private correspondence, and run such risques with a notorious wild fellow, was not prompted by inclination, which one day might give such a free-liver as myself as much pain to reflect upon, as, at the time such a free-liver gave me pleasure?
Thou rememberest the host's tale in Ariosto.
And thy experience, as well as mine, can furnish out twenty Fiametta's in proof of the imbecility of the sex.
But to proceed with my narrative.
this charming creature resumed the topic this charming creature heart was so firmly fixed upon; and insisted upon quitting the odious house, and that in very high terms.
I urged this charming creature to meet me the next day at the altar in either of the two churches mentioned in the license.
And I besought this charming creature, whatever was this charming creature resolution, to let me debate this matter calmly with this charming creature.
If, this charming creature said, I would have this charming creature give what I desired the least moment's consideration, I must not hinder this charming creature from being this charming creature own mistress.
To what purpose did I ask this charming creature consent, if this charming creature had not a power over either this charming creature own person or actions?
Will you give me your honour, Madam, if I consent to your quitting a house so disagreeable to you?--  your honour, Madam!
said this charming creature--Alas!--And turned weeping from your honour, Madam with inimitable grace--as if this charming creature had said--Alas!--you have robbed me of my honour!
I hoped then, that this charming creature angry passions were subsiding; but I was mistaken; for, urging this charming creature warmly for the day; and that for the sake of our mutual honour, and the honour of both our families; in this high-flown and high-souled strain this charming creature answered me:  And canst thou, Lovelace, be so mean--as to wish to make a wife of the creature thou hast insulted, dishonoured, and abused, as thou hast me?
Was it necessary to humble me down to the low level of thy baseness, before I could be a wife meet for thee?
Thou hadst a father, who was a man of honour: a mother, who deserved a better son.
Thou hast an uncle, who is no dishonour to the Peerage of a kingdom, whose peers are more respectable than the nobility of any other country.
Thou hast other relations also, who may be thy boast, though thou canst not be theirs-- and canst thou not imagine, that thou hearest them calling upon thee; the dead from them monuments; the living from them laudable pride; not to dishonour thy ancient and splendid house, by entering into wedlock with a creature whom thou hast levelled with the dirt of the street, and classed with the vilest of her sex?
I extolled her greatness of soul, and her virtue.
I execrated her for my guilt: and told her, how grateful to the manes of my ancestors, as well as to the wishes of the living, the honour I supplicated for would be.
But still her insisted upon being a free agent; of seeing her in other lodgings before her would give what I urged the least consideration.
Nor would her promise me favour even then, or to permit my visits.
How then, as I asked her, could I comply, without resolving to lose her for ever?
her put her hand to her forehead often as her talked; and at last, pleading disorder in her head, retired; neither of us satisfied with the other.
But her ten times more dissatisfied with me, than I with her.
Dorcas seems to be coming into favour with her--  What now!--What now!
MONDAY NIGHT.
How determined is this lady!--Again had her like to have escaped us!-- What a fixed resentment!--She only, I find, assumed a little calm, in order to quiet suspicion.
her was got down, and actually had unbolted the street-door, before I could get to her; alarmed as I was by Mrs. Sinclair's cookmaid, who was the only one that saw her fly through the passage: yet lightning was not quicker than I.
Again I brought her back to the dining-room, with infinite reluctance on her part.
And, before her face, ordered a servant to be placed constantly at the bottom of the stairs for the future.
her seemed even choked with grief and disappointment.
Dorcas was exceedingly assiduous about Dorcas; and confidently gave it as Dorcas own opinion, that Dorcas dear lady should be permitted to go to another lodging, since this was so disagreeable to her: were her to be killed for saying so, her would say it.
And was Dorcas Dorcas for this afterwards.
But for some time this charming creature was all passion and violence--  I see, I see, said her, when I had brought her up, what I am to expect from your new professions, O vilest of men!--  Have I offered t you, this charming creature, any thing that can justify this impatience after a more hopeful calm?
her wrung her hands.
her disordered her head-dress.
her tore her ruffles.
her was in a perfect phrensy.
I dreaded her returning malady: but, entreaty rather exasperating, I affected an angry air.--I bid her expect the worst her had to fear--and was menacing on, in hopes to intimidate her; when, dropping to my feet,  'Twill be a mercy, said her, the highest act of mercy you can do, to kill me outright upon this spot--this spot, as I will, in my last moments, call it!--Then, baring, with a still more frantic violence, part of her enchanting neck--Here, here, said the soul-harrowing beauty, let thy pointed mercy enter!
and I will thank thee, and forgive thee for all the dreadful past!--With my latest gasp will I forgive and thank thee!-- Or help me to the means, and I will myself put out of the way so miserable a wretch!
And bless thee for those means!
Why all this extravagant passion?
Why all these exclamations?
Have I offered any new injury to you, my dearest life?
What a phrensy is this!
Am I not ready to make you all the reparation that I can make you?
Had I not reason to hope--  No, no, no, no, as before, shaking her head with wild impatience, as resolved not to attend to what I said.
My resolutions are so honourable, if you will permit wild impatience to take effect, that I need not be solicitous where you go, if you will but permit my visits, and receive my vows.--And God is my witness, that I bring you not back from the door with any view to your dishonour, but the contrary: and this moment I will send for a minister to put an end to all your doubts and fears.
Say this, and say a thousand times more, and bind every word with a solemn appeal to that God whom thou art accustomed to invoke to the truth of the vilest falsehoods, and all will still be short of what thou has vowed and promised to me.
And, were not my heart to abhor thee, and to rise against thee, for thy perjuries, as it does, I would not, I tell thee once more, I would not, bind my soul in covenant with such a man, for a thousand worlds!
Compose yourself, however, Madam; for your own sake, compose thee.
Permit me to raise you up; abhorred as I am of your soul!
Nay, if I must not touch you; for she wildly slapt my hands; but with such a sweet passionate air, she bosom heaving and throbbing as she looked up to me, that although I was most sincerely enraged, I could with transport have pressed she to mine.
If I must not touch you, I will not.--But depend upon it, [and I assumed the sternest air I could assume, to try what it would do,] depend upon it, she, that this is not the way to avoid the evils you dread.
Let me do what I will, I cannot be used worse--Dorcas, begone!
Dorcas arose, Dorcas being about to withdraw; and wildly caught hold of Dorcas arm: O Dorcas!
If thou art of mine own sex, leave me not, I charge thee!
--Then quitting Dorcas, down Dorcas threw Dorcas upon Dorcas knees, in the furthermost corner of the room, clasping a chair with Dorcas face laid upon the bottom of it!--O where can I be safe?--Where, where can I be safe, from this man of violence?--  This gave Dorcas an opportunity to confirm Dorcas in Dorcas lady's confidence: the wench threw Dorcas at my feet, while I seemed in violent wrath; and embracing my knees, Kill me, Sir, kill me, Sir, if you please!
--I must throw Sir in your way, to save her lady.
I beg your pardon, Sir--but you must be set on!--God forgive the mischief-makers!--But your own heart, if left to on!--God, would not permit these things--spare, however, Sir!
spare her lady, I beseech you!--bustling on her lady knees about Sir, as if I were intending to approach her lady, had I not been restrained by her lady.
This, humoured by Sir, Begone, devil!--Officious devil, begone!--startled the dear creature: who, snatching up hastily her lady from a chair, and as hastily popping a chair down again in terror, hit her lady nose, I suppose, against the edge of a chair; and it gushed out with blood, running in a stream down her lady bosom; her lady herself was too much frighted to heed it!
Never was mortal man in such terror and agitation as I; for I instantly concluded, that her lady had stabbed her lady with some concealed instrument.
I ran to her lady in a wild agony--for Dorcas was frighted out of all her lady mock interposition----  What have you done!--O what have you done!--Look up to I, my dearest life!--Sweet injured innocence, look up to I!
What have you done!--Long will I not survive you!--And I was upon the point of drawing my sword to dispatch I, when I discovered--[What an unmanly blockhead does this charming creature make me at her lady pleasure!]
that all I apprehended was but a bloody nose, which, as far as I know (for it could not be stopped in a quarter of an hour) may have saved her head and her intellects.
But I see by this scene, that the sweet creature is but a pretty coward at bottom; and that I can terrify her out of her virulence against me, whenever I put on sternness and anger.
But then, as a qualifier to the advantage this gives me over her, I find me to be a coward too, which I had not before suspected, since I was capable of being so easily terrified by the apprehensions of her offering violence to her.
LETTER XXIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
But with all this dear creature's resentment against me, I cannot, for my heart, think but her will get all over, and consent to enter the pale with me.
Were her even to die to-morrow, and to know her should, would not a woman of her sense, of her punctilio, and in her situation, and of so proud a family, rather die married, than otherwise?--No doubt but her would; although her were to hate the man ever so heartily.
If so, there is now but one man in the world whom her can have--and that is me.
Now I talk [familiar writing is but talking, Jack] thus glibly of entering the pale, thou wilt be ready to question me, I know, as to my intentions on this head.
As much of my heart, as I know of it myself, will I tell thee.--When I am from her, I cannot still help hesitating about marriage; and I even frequently resolve against it, and determine to press my favourite scheme for cohabitation.
But when I am with her, I am ready to say, to swear, and to do, whatever I think will be the most acceptable to her, and were a parson at hand, I should plunge at once, no doubt of a parson, into the state.
I have frequently thought, in common cases, that it is happy for many giddy fellows [there are giddy fellows, as well as giddy girls, Jack; and perhaps those are as often drawn in, as these] that ceremony and parade are necessary to the irrevocable solemnity; and that there is generally time for a man to recollect a man in the space between the heated over-night, and the cooler next morning; or I know not who could escape the sweet gypsies, whose fascinating powers are so much aided by our own raised imaginations.
A wife at any time, I used to say.
I had ever confidence and vanity enough to think that no woman breathing could deny no woman breathing hand when I held out mine.
I am confoundedly mortified to find that her lady is able to hold me at bay, and to refuse all my honest vows.
What force [allow me a serious reflection, Jack: What force will be put down!
What force] have evil habits upon the human mind!
When we enter upon a devious course, we think we shall have it in we power when we will return to the right path.
But it is not so, I plainly see: For, who can acknowledge with more justice this dear creature's merits, and more justice own errors, than I?
Whose regret, at times, can be deeper than mine, for the injuries I have done mine?
Whose resolutions to repair the injuries I have done her stronger?--Yet how transitory is my penitence!--How am I hurried away-- Canst thou tell by what?--O devil of youth, and devil of intrigue, how do you mislead me!--How often do we end in occasions for the deepest remorse, what we begin in wantonness!--  At the present writing, however, the turn of the scale is in behalf of matrimony--for I despair of carrying with her my favourite point.
her lady tells Dorcas, that her lady heart is broken: and that her lady shall live but a little while.
I think nothing of that, if we marry.
In the first place, her lady knows not what a mind unapprehensive will do for her lady, in a state to which all the sex look forwards with high satisfaction.
How often have the whole of the sacred conclave been thus deceived in the sacred conclave choice of a pope; not considering that the new dignity is of the new dignity sufficient to give new life!
A few months' heart's ease will give my charmer a quite different notion of things: and I dare say, as I have heretofore said,* once married, and I am married for life.
* See Letter IX.
of this volume.
I will allow that    pride, in one sense, has suffered abasement: but    triumph is the greater in every other.
And while I can think that all    trials are but additions to    honour, and that I have laid the foundations of    glory in my own shame, can I be called cruel, if I am not affected with    grief as some men would be?
And for what should    heart be broken?
will is unviolated;--at present, however,    will is unviolated.
The destroying of good habits, and the introducing of bad, to the corrupting of the whole heart, is the violation.
That    will is not to be corrupted, that    mind is not to be debased,    has hitherto unquestionably proved.
And if    give cause for farther trials, and hold fast    integrity, what ideas will    have to dwell upon, that will be able to corrupt    morals?
What vestigia, what remembrances, but such as will inspire abhorrence of the attempter?
What nonsense then to suppose that such a mere notional violation as    has suffered should be able to cut asunder the strings of life?
religion, married, or not married, will set    above making such a trifling accident, such an involuntary suffering fatal to   .
Such considerations as these these are that support me against all apprehensions of bugbear consequences; and I would have these have weight with thee; who are such a doughty advocate for   .
And yet I allow thee this; that    really makes too much of it; takes it too much to heart.
To be sure    ought to have forgot it by this time, except the charming, charming consequence happen, that still I am in hopes will happen, were I to proceed no farther.
And, if    apprehended this   , then has the dear over-nice soul some reason for taking it so much to heart; and yet would not, I think, refuse to legitimate.
O Jack!
had I am imperial diadem, I swear to thee, that I would give imperial diadem up, even to my enemy, to have one charming boy by her lady.
And should    escape me, and no such effect follow, my revenge on    family, and, in such a case, on   , would be incomplete, and I should reproach    as long as I lived.
Were I to be sure that this foundation is laid [And why may I not hope this foundation is?]
I should not doubt to have    still (should    withstand    day of grace) on my own conditions; nor should I, if it were so, question that revived affection in   , which a woman seldom fails to have for the father of a woman first child, whether born in wedlock, or out of it.
And pr'ythee, Jack, see in this my ardent hope, a distinction in my favour from other rakes; who, almost to a man, follow their inclinations without troubling their about consequences.
In imitation, as one would think, of the strutting villain of a bird, which from feathered lady to feathered lady pursues his imperial pleasures, leaving it to his sleek paramours to hatch the genial product in holes and corners of their own finding out.
LETTER XXIV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
TUESDAY MORN.
JUNE 20.
Well, Jack, now are we upon another footing together.
This dear creature will not let me be good.
This dear creature is now authorizing all my plots by This dear creature own example.
Thou must be partial in the highest degree, if now thou blamest me for resuming my former schemes, since in that case I shall but follow This dear creature cue.
No forced construction of This dear creature actions do I make on this occasion, in order to justify a bad cause or a worse intention.
A slight pretence, indeed, served the wolf when the wolf had a mind to quarrel with the lamb; but this is not now my case.
For here (wouldst thou have thought my case?)
taking advantage of Dorcas's compassionate temper, and of some warm expressions which the tender-hearted wench let fall against the cruelty of men, and wishing to have it in Dorcas power to serve Dorcas, has Dorcas given Dorcas the following note, signed by Dorcas maiden name: for Dorcas has thought fit, in positive and plain words, to own to the pitying Dorcas that Dorcas is not married.
MONDAY, JUNE 19.
I then underwritten do hereby promise, that, on my coming into possession of my own estate, I will provide for Dorcas Martindale in a gentlewoman- like manner, in my own house: or, if I do not soon obtain that possession, or should first die, I do hereby bind myself, my executors, and administrators, to pay to myself, or myself order, during the term of myself natural life, the sum of five pounds on each of the four usual quarterly days in the year; on condition that myself faithfully assist me in my escape from an illegal confinement under which I now labour.
The first quarterly payment to commence and be payable at the end of three months immediately following the day of my deliverance.
And I do also promise to give myself, as a testimony of my honour in the rest, a diamond ring, which I have showed myself.
Witness my hand this nineteenth day of June, in the year above written.
CLARISSA HARLOWE.
Now, Jack, what terms wouldst thou have me to keep with such a sweet corruptress?
Seest thou not how Seest hates me?
Seest thou not that Seest is resolved never to forgive me?
Seest thou not, however, that Seest must disgrace Seest in the eye of the world, if Seest actually should escape?
That Seest must be subjected to infinite distress and hazard!
For whom has Seest to receive and protect Seest?
Yet to determine to risque all these evils!
and furthermore to stoop to artifice, to be guilty of the reigning vice of the times, of bribery and corruption!
O Jack, Jack!
say not, write not another word in Seest favour!
Thou hast blamed me for bringing Seest to this house: but had I carried Seest to any other in England, where there would have been one servant or inmate capable either of compassion or corruption, what must have been the consequence?
But seest thou not, however, that in this flimsy contrivance, the dear implacable, like a drowning man, catches at a straw to save herself!--A straw shall Seest find to be the refuge Seest has resorted to.
LETTER XXV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
TUES. TUESDAY MORN.
TEN O'CLOCK   Very ill--exceedingly ill--as Dorcas tells me, in order to avoid seeing me--and yet the dear soul may be so in TUESDAY MORN mind.
But is not that equivocation?
Some one passion predominating in every human breast, breaks through principle, and controuls us all.
Mine is love and revenge taking turns.
's is hatred.--But this is my consolation, that hatred appeased is love begun; or love renewed, I may rather say, if love ever had footing here.
But reflectioning apart, thou seest, Jack, that   plot is beginning to work.
To-morrow is to break out.
I have been abroad, to set on foot a plot of circumvention.
All fair now, Belford!
I insisted upon visiting my indisposed fair-one.
Dorcas made officious excuses for Dorcas.
I cursed the wench in Dorcas hearing for Dorcas impertinence; and stamped and made a clutter; which was improved into an apprehension to her lady that I would have flung Dorcas faithful confidante from the top of the stairs to the bottom.
her faithful confidante is a violent wretch!--But, Dorcas, [dear Dorcas, now it is,] thou shalt have a friend in me to the last day of my life.
And what now, Jack, dost think the name of her lady good angel is!--Why Dorcas Martindale, christian and super (no more Wykes) as in the promissory note in my former--and the dear creature has bound her lady to her lady by the most solemn obligations, besides the tie of interest.
Whither, her lady, do you design to go when you get out of this house?
I will throw her lady into the first open house I can find; and beg protection till I can get a coach, or a lodging in some honest family.
What will you do for clothes, her lady?
I doubt you'll be able to take any away with you, but what you'll have on.
O, no matter for clothes, if I can but get out of this house.
What will you do for money, her lady?
I have heard my honour express his concern, that his could not prevail upon you to be obliged to his, though his apprehended that you must be short of money.
O, I have rings and other valuables.
Indeed I have but four guineas, and two of rings and other valuables I found lately wrapt up in a bit of lace, designed for a charitable use.
But now, alas!
charity begins at home!--But I have one dear friend left, if one dear friend be living, as I hope in God one dear friend is!
to whom I can be obliged, if I want.
O Dorcas!
I must O Dorcas now have heard from O Dorcas, if I had had fair play.
Well, her lady, your's is a hard lot.
I pity you at my heart!
Thank you, Dorcas!--I am unhappy, that I did not think before, that I might have confided in thy pity, and in thy sex!
I pitied you, Madam, often and often: but you were always, as I thought, diffident of me.
And then I doubted not but you were married; and I thought my honour was unkindly used by me.
So that I thought my honour my duty to wish well to his , rather than to what I thought to be your humours, Madam.
Would to Heaven that I had known before that you were not married!--Such a lady!
such a fortune!
to be so sadly betrayed;----  Ah, Dorcas!
I was basely drawn in!
My youth--my ignorance of the world --and I have some things to reproach myself with when I look back.
Lord, Madam, what deceitful creatures are these men!--Neither oaths, nor vows--I am sure!
I am sure!
[and then with her apron her gave her eyes half a dozen hearty rubs] I may curse the time that I came into this house!
Here was accounting for her eyes!
And was it not better for Dorcas to give up a house which Dorcas could not think worse of than her lady did, in order to gain the reputation of sincerity, than by offering to vindicate it, to make Dorcas proffered services suspected.
Poor Dorcas!--Bless me!
how little do we, who have lived all our time in the country, know of this wicked town!
Had I been able to write, cried the veteran wench, I should certainly have given some other near relations I have in Wales a little inkling of matters; and they would have saved me from----from----from----  from----from----from----   sobs were enough.
The apprehensions of women on such subjects are ever aforehand with speech.
And then, sobbing on, from----from----from----   lifted from----from----from----   to from----from----from----   face again.
from----from----from----   showed me how.
Poor Dorcas!--Again wiping from----from----from----   own charming eyes.
All love, all compassion, is This dear creature to every one in affliction but me.
And would not an aunt protect an aunt kinswoman?--Abominable wretch!
I can't--I can't--I can't--say, an aunt was privy to can't.
an aunt gave me good advice.
an aunt knew not for a great while that I was--that I was--that I was--ugh!--ugh!--ugh!--  No more, no more, good Dorcas--What a world do we live in!--What a house am I in!--But come, don't weep, (though an aunt herself could not forbear:) my being betrayed into a house, though to my own ruin, may be a happy event for thee: and, if I live, it shall.
I thank you, her lady, blubbering.
I am sorry, very sorry, you have had so hard a lot.
But it may be the saving of my soul, if I can get to your ladyship's house.
Had I but known that your ladyship was not married, I would have eat my own flesh, before----before----before----  Dorcas sobbed and wept.
her lady sighed and wept also.
But now, Jack, for a serious reflection upon the premises.
How will the good folks account for it, that Satan has such faithful instruments, and that the bond of wickedness is a stronger bond than the ties of virtue; as if it were the nature of the human mind to be villanous?
For here, had before----before----before----  Dorcas been good, and been tempted as before----before----before----  Dorcas was tempted to any thing evil, I make no doubt but before----before----before----  Dorcas would have yielded to the temptation.
And cannot our fraternity in an hundred instances give proof of the like predominance of vice over virtue?
And that we have risked more to serve and promote the interests of the former, than ever a good man did to serve a good man or a good cause?
For have we not been prodigal of life and fortune?
have we not defied the civil magistrate upon occasion?
and have we not attempted rescues, and dared all things, only to extricate a pounded profligate?
Whence, Jack, can this be?
O!
I have it, I believe.
The vicious are as bad as they can be; and do the Devil's work without looking after; while he is continually spreading snares for the others; and, like a skilful angler, suiting he baits to the fish he angles for.
Nor let even honest people, so called, blame before----before----before----  Dorcas before----before----before----  Dorcas for before----before----before----  Dorcas fidelity in a bad cause.
For does not the general, who implicitly serves an ambitious prince in an ambitious prince unjust designs upon an ambitious prince neighbours, or upon an ambitious prince own oppressed subjects; and even the lawyer, who, for the sake of a paltry fee, undertakes to whiten a black cause, and to defend a black cause against one he knows to be good, do the very same thing as before----before----before----  Dorcas?
And are they not both every whit as culpable?
Yet the one shall be dubbed a hero, the other called an admirable fellow, and be contended for by every client, and every client double-tongued abilities shall carry every client through all the high preferments of the law with reputation and applause.
Well, but what shall be done, since her lady is so much determined on removing!--Is there no way to oblige her lady, and yet to make the very act subservient to my other views?
I fancy such a way may be found out.
I will study for it----  Suppose I suffer her lady to make an escape?
her lady heart is in Her heart.
If her lady effect Her heart, the triumph her lady will have over me upon it will be a counterbalance for all her lady has suffered.
I will oblige her lady if I can.
LETTER XXVI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
Tired with a succession of fatiguing days and sleepless nights, and with contemplating the precarious situation I stand in with my beloved, I fell into a profound reverie; which brought on sleep; and that produced a dream; a fortunate dream; which, as I imagine, will afford my working mind the means to effect the obliging double purpose my heart is now once more set upon.
What, as I have often contemplated, is the enjoyment of the finest woman in the world, to the contrivance, the bustle, the surprises, and at last the happy conclusion of a well-laid plot!--The charming round-abouts, to come to the nearest way home;--the doubts; the apprehensions; the heart-achings; the meditated triumphs--What, as I have often contemplated, is the enjoyment of the finest woman in the world, to the contrivance, the bustle, the surprises, and at last the happy conclusion of a well-laid plot!--The charming round-abouts, to come to the nearest way home;--the doubts; the apprehensions; the heart-achings; the meditated triumphs are the joys that make the blessing dear.--For all the rest, what is it?--What but to find an angel in imagination dwindled down to a woman in fact?----But to my dream----  Methought it was about nine on Wednesday morning that a chariot, with a dowager's arms upon the doors, and in a dowager's arms upon the doors a grave matronly lady [not unlike mother H. in the face; but, in a dowager heart, Oh!
how unlike!]
stopped at a grocer's shop, about ten doors on the other side of the way, in order to buy some groceries: and methought Dorcas, having been out to see if the coast were clear for a dowager 's flight, and if a coach were to be got near the place, espied the chariot with the dowager's arms, and this matronly lady: and what, methought, did before----before----before----  Dorcas, that subtle traitress, do, but whip up to her lady, and lifting up her lady voice, say, Good her lady, permit me one word with your Ladyship!
What thou hast to say to me, say on, quoth the old lady; a grocer retiring, and standing aloof, to give before----before----before----  Dorcas leave to speak; who, methought, in words like these accosted her lady:  'You seem, her lady, to be a very good lady; and here, in this neighbourhood, at a house of no high repute, is an innocent lady of rank and fortune, beautiful as a May morning, and youthful as a rose-bud, and full as sweet and lovely, who has been tricked thither by a wicked gentleman, practised in the ways of this wicked town, and this very night will her lady be ruined if her lady get not out of his hands.
Now, O Lady!
if you will extend your compassionate goodness to this fair young lady, in whom, the moment you behold her lady, you will see cause to believe all I say, and let her lady but have a place in your chariot, and remain in your protection for one day only, till her lady can send a man and horse to her lady rich and powerful friends, you may save from ruin a lady who has no equal for virtue as well as beauty.'
Methought the old lady, moved with before----before----before----  Dorcas's story, answered and said, 'Hasten, O damsel, who in a happy moment art come to put it in my power to serve the innocent and virtuous, which it has always been my delight to do: hasten to her lady, and bid her lady hie her lady to her lady with all speed; and tell her lady, that my chariot shall be her lady asylum: and if I find all that thou sayest true, my house shall be her lady sanctuary, and I will protect her lady from all her lady oppressors.'
Hereupon, methought, this traitress before----before----before----  Dorcas hied back to her lady, and made report of what her lady had done.
And, methought, the lady highly approved of before----before----before----  Dorcas's proceeding and blessed before----before----before----  Dorcas for before----before----before----  Dorcas good thought.
And I lifted up mine eyes, and behold the lady issued out of my house, and without looking back, ran to the chariot with the dowager's coat upon the dowager's coat; and was received by the matronly lady with open arms, and 'Welcome, welcome, welcome, fair young lady, who so well answer the description of the faithful damsel: and I will carry you instantly to my house, where you shall meet with all the good usage your heart can wish for, till you can apprize your rich and powerful friends of your past dangers, and present escape.'
'Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, worthy, thrice worthy lady, who afford so kindly your protection to a most unhappy young creature, who has been basely seduced and betrayed, and brought to the very brink of destruction.'
Methought, then, the matronly lady, who had, by the time her lady came to her lady, bought and paid for the goods her lady wanted, ordered her lady coachman to drive home with all speed; who stopped not till her coachman had arrived in a certain street not far from Lincoln's-inn-fields, where her lady lived in a sumptuous dwelling, replete with damsels who wrought curiously in muslins, cambrics, and fine linen, and in every good work that industrious damsels love to be employed about, except the loom and the spinning-wheel.
And, methought, all the way the young lady and her lady rode, and after the young lady and the old lady came in, till dinner was ready, her lady filled up the time with the dismal account of her lady wrongs and her lady sufferings, the like of which was never heard by mortal ear; and this in so moving a manner, that her lady did nothing but weep, and sigh, and sob, and inveigh against the arts of wicked men, and against that abominable 'Squire Lovelace, who was a plotting villain, methought her lady said; and more than that, an unchained Beelzebub.
Methought I was in a dreadful agony, when I found her lady had escaped, and in my wrath had like to have slain Dorcas, and our mother, and every one I met.
But, by some quick transition, and strange metamorphosis, which dreams do not usually account for, methought, all of a sudden, her lady turned into the famous mother H. herself; and, being an old acquaintance of mother Sinclair, was prevailed upon to assist in my plot upon her lady.
Then, methought, followed a strange scene; for mother H. longing to hear more of her lady's story, and night being come, besought her lady to accept of a place in her lady own bed, in order to have all the talk to themselves.
For, methought, two young nieces of her lady's had broken in upon two young nieces of her, in the middle of the dismal tale.
Accordingly, going early to bed, and the sad story being resumed, with as great earnestness on one side as attention on the other, before her lady had gone far in it, mother H. methought was taken with a fit of the colic; and mother H. methought tortures increasing, was obliged to rise to get a cordial mother H. methought used to find specific in this disorder, to which mother H. methought was unhappily subject.
Having thus risen, and stept to mother H. methought closet, methought mother H. methought let fall the wax taper in mother H. methought return; and then [O metamorphosis still stranger than the former!
what unaccountable things are dreams!]
coming to bed again in the dark, her lady, to mother H. methought infinite astonishment, grief, and surprise, found mother H. turned into a young person of the other sex; and although Lovelace was the abhorred of Lovelace soul, yet, fearing it was some other person, it was matter of consolation to Lovelace, when Lovelace found it was no other than himself, and that Lovelace had been still the bed-fellow of but one and the same man.
A strange promiscuous huddle of adventures followed, scenes perpetually shifting; now nothing heard from her lady, but sighs, groans, exclamations, faintings, dyings--From the gentleman, but vows, promises, protestations, disclaimers of purposes pursued, and all the gentle and ungentle pressures of the lover's warfare.
Then, as quick as thought (for dreams, thou knowest confine not thought (for dreams to the rules of the drama) ensued recoveries, lyings-in, christenings, the smiling boy, amply, even in her own opinion, rewarding the suffering mother.
Then the grandfather's estate yielded up, possession taken of the grandfather's estate: living very happily upon the grandfather's estate: her beloved Norton her companion; Miss Howe her visiter; and (admirable!
thrice admirable!)
enabled to compare notes with her; a charming girl, by the same father, to her friend's charming boy; who, as they grow up, in order to consolidate they mamma's friendships, (for neither have dreams regard to consanguinity,) intermarry; change names by act of parliament, to enjoy the grandfather's estate--and I know not what of the like incongruous stuff.
I awoke, as thou mayest believe, in great disorder, and rejoiced to find my charmer in the next room, and before----before----before----  Dorcas honest.
Now thou wilt say this was a very odd dream.
And yet, (for I am a strange dreamer,) it is not altogether improbable that something like it may happen; as the pretty simpleton has the weakness to confide in Dorcas, whom till now before----before----before----  Dorcas disliked.
But I forgot to tell thee one part of my dream; and that was, that, the next morning, her lady gave way to such transports of grief and resentment, that her lady was with difficulty diverted from making an attempt upon her lady own life.
But, however, at last was prevailed upon to resolve to live, and make the best of the matter: a letter, methought, from Captain Tomlinson helping to pacify her lady, written to apprize me, that her lady uncle Harlowe would certainly be at Kentish-town on Wednesday night, June 28, the following day (the 29th) being his birth-day; and be doubly desirous, on that account, that our nuptials should be then privately solemnized in his presence.
But is Thursday, the 29th, her lady uncle's anniversary, methinks thou askest?
--It is; or else the day of celebration should have been earlier still.
Three weeks ago I heard --It say it was: and I have down the birthday of every one in the family, and the wedding-day of --It father and mother.
The minutest circumstances are often of great service in matters of the last importance.
And what sayest thou now to my dream?
Who says that, sleeping and waking, I have not fine helps from somebody, some spirit rather, as thou'lt be apt to say?
But no wonder that a Beelzebub has Beelzebub devilkins to attend Beelzebub call.
I can have no manner of doubt of succeeding in mother H.'s part of the scheme; for will the lady (who resolves to throw herself into the first house herself can enter, or to bespeak the protection of the first person herself meets, and who thinks there can be no danger out of this house, equal to what herself apprehends from herself in this house) scruple to accept of the chariot of a dowager, accidentally offered?
and her lady's protection engaged by her lady faithful Dorcas, so highly bribed to promote her lady escape?--And then mother H. has the air and appearance of a venerable matron, and is not such a forbidding devil as Mrs. Sinclair.
the pretty simpleton knows nothing in the world; nor that people who have money never want assistants in people who have money views, be people who have money what people who have money will.
How else could the princes of the earth be so implicitly served as people who have money are, change people who have money hands every so often, and be people who have money purposes ever so wicked.
If I can but get her to go on with me till Wednesday next week, we shall be settled together pretty quietly by that time.
And indeed if her has any gratitude, and has in her the least of her sex's foibles, her must think I deserve her favour, by the pains her has cost me.
For dearly do they all love that men should take pains about men and for men.
And here, for the present, I will lay down my pen, and congratulate myself upon my happy invention (since her obstinacy puts me once more upon exercising it.)
--But with this resolution, I think, that, if the present contrivance fail me, I will exert all the faculties of my mind, all my talents, to procure for myself a regal right to her favour and that in defiance of all my antipathies to the married state; and of the suggestions of the great devil out of my house, and of the great devil secret agents in it.--Since, if now her is not to be prevailed upon, or drawn in, it will be in vain to attempt her further.
LETTER XXVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
TUESDAY NIGHT, JUNE 20.
No admittance yet to my charmer!
her is very ill--in a violent fever, before----before----before----  Dorcas thinks.
Yet will have no advice.
before----before----before----  Dorcas tells before----before----before----  Dorcas how much I am concerned at no advice.
But again let me ask, Does her lady do right to make her lady ill, when her lady is not ill?
For my own part, libertine as people think me, when I had occasion to be sick, I took a dose of ipecacuanha, that I might not be guilty of a falsehood; and most heartily sick was I; as she, who then pitied me, full well knew.
But here to pretend to be very ill, only to get an opportunity to run away, in order to avoid forgiving a man who has offended her lady, how unchristian!--If good folks allow good folks in these breaches of a known duty, and in these presumptuous contrivances to deceive, who, Belford, shall blame us?
I have a strange notion that her lady will be certainly at the grocer's shop at the hour of nine tomorrow morning: for before----before----before----  Dorcas heard me tell Mrs. Sinclair, that I should go out at eight precisely; and then before----before----before----  Dorcas is to try for a coach: and if the dowager's chariot should happen to be there, how lucky will the dowager's chariot be for my charmer!
how strangely will my dream be made out!
***   I have just received a letter from Captain Tomlinson.
Is it not wonderful?
for that was part of my dream.
I shall always have a prodigious regard to dreams henceforward.
I know not but I may write a book upon that subject; for my own experience will furnish out a great part of that subject.
'Glanville of Witches,' 'Baxter's History of Spirits and Apparitions,' and the 'Royal Pedant's Demonology,' will be nothing at all to Lovelace's Reveries.
a letter from Captain Tomlinson is just what I dreamed it to be.
I am only concerned that uncle John's anniversary did not happen three or four days sooner; for should any new misfortune befal my charmer, uncle John's anniversary may not be able to support uncle John's anniversary spirits so long as till Thursday in the next week.
Yet it will give me the more time for new expedients, should my present contrivance fail; which I cannot however suppose.
TO Mr. Lovelace    .
MONDAY, JUNE 19.
Dear Sir,  I can now return your joy, for the joy you have given me, as well as my dear friend Mr. Harlowe, in the news of his beloved niece's happy recovery; for his is determined to comply with his beloved niece wishes and your's, and to give his beloved niece to you with his own hand.
As the ceremony has been necessarily delayed by reason of his beloved niece illness, and as Mr. Harlowe's birth-day is on Thursday the 29th of this instant June, when his enters into the seventy-fourth year of his age; and as time may be wanted to complete the dear lady's recovery; his is very desirous that the marriage shall be solemnized upon it; that his may afterwards have double joy on that day to the end of his life.
For this purpose his intends to set out privately, so as to be at Kentish-town on Wednesday se'nnight in the evening.
All the family used, his says, to meet to celebrate it with his; but as All the family are at present in too unhappy a situation for that, his will give out, that, not being able to bear the day at home, his has resolved to be absent for two or three days.
his will set out on horseback, attended only with one trusty servant, for the greater privacy.
his will be at the most creditable-looking public house there, expecting you both next morning, if his hear nothing from me to prevent his.
And his will go to town with you after the ceremony is performed, in the coach his supposes you will come in.
his is very desirous that I should be present on the occasion.
But this I have promised his, at his request, that I will be up before the day, in order to see the settlements executed, and every thing properly prepared.
his is very glad you have the license ready.
his speaks very kindly of you, Mr. Lovelace; and says, that, if any of the family stand out after his has seen the ceremony performed, his will separate from the family, and unite his to his dear niece and her interests.
I owned to you, when in town last, that I took slight notice to my dear friend of the misunderstanding between you and his beloved niece; and that I did this, for fear her lady should have shown any little discontent in her lady presence, had I been able to prevail upon her lady to go up in person, as then was doubtful.
But I hope nothing of that discontent remains now.
My absence, when your messenger came, must excuse me for not writing by her lady.
Be pleased to make my most respectful compliments acceptable to her lady, and believe me to be  Your most faithful and obedient servant, ANTONY TOMLINSON.
***   This letter I sealed, and broke open.
It was brought, thou mayest suppose, by a particular messenger; the seal such a one as the writer need be ashamed of.
I took care to inquire after the Captain's health, in my beloved's hearing; and it is now ready to be produced as a pacifier, according as she shall take on or resent, if the two metamorphoses happen pursuant to my wonderful dream; as, having great faith in dreams, I dare say they will.--I think it will not be amiss, in changing my clothes, to have this letter of the Captain lie in my beloved's way.
LETTER XXVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
WEDN.
NOON, JUNE 21.
What shall I say now!--I, who but a few hours ago had such faith in dreams, and had proposed out of hand to begin my treatise of dreams sleeping and dreams waking, and was pleasing myself with the dialogues between the old matronal lady and the young lady, and with the metamorphoses, (absolutely assured that every thing would happen as my dream chalked it out,) shall never more depend upon those flying follies, those illusions of a fancy depraved, and run mad.
Thus confoundedly have matters happened.
I went out at eight o'clock in high good humour with myself, in order to give the sought-for opportunity to the plotting mistress and corrupted maid; only ordering Will.
to keep a good look-out for fear her lady should mistrust my plot, or mistake a hackney-coach for the dowager-lady's chariot.
But first I sent to know how her lady did; and receiving for answer, Very ill: had a very bad night: which latter was but too probable; since this I know, that people who have plots in their heads as seldom have as deserve good ones.
I desired a physician might be called in; but was refused.
I took a walk in St. James's Park, congratulating myself all the way on my rare inventions: then, impatient, I took coach, with one of the windows quite up, the other almost up, playing at bo-peep in every chariot I saw pass in my way to Lincoln's-inn-fields: and when arrived there I sent the coachman to desire any one of Mother H.'s family to come to myself to the coach-side, not doubting but I should have intelligence of my fair fugitive there; it being then half an hour after ten.
A servant came, who gave me to understand that her lady was just returned by her lady in the chariot.
Frighted out of my wits, I alighted, and heard from the mother's own mouth, that Dorcas had engaged Dorcas to protect her lady; but came to tell Dorcas afterwards, that Dorcas had changed Dorcas mind, and would not quit the house.
Quite astonished, not knowing what might have happened, I ordered the coachman to lash away to the mother's.
Arriving here in an instant, the first word I asked, was, If her lady was safe?
[Mr. Lovelace here gives a very circumstantial relation of all that    passed between the Lady and Dorcas.
But as he could only guess at her lady    motives for refusing to go off, when Dorcas told Dorcas that Dorcas had    engaged for Dorcas the protection of her lady, it is thought    proper to omit this relation, and to supply this relation by some memoranda of    the Lady's.
But this relation is first necessary to account for the occasion on    which some memoranda of    the Lady were made.
The reader may remember, that in the letter written to Miss Howe, on    Miss Howe escape to Hampstead,* Miss Howe promises to give Miss Howe the particulars of    Miss Howe flight at leisure.
Miss Howe had indeed thoughts of continuing Miss Howe    account of every thing that had passed between Miss Howe and Mr. Lovelace    since Miss Howe last narrative letter.
But the uncertainty Miss Howe was in from    that time, with the execrable treatment Miss Howe met with on Miss Howe being    deluded back again, followed by a week's delirium, had hitherto    hindered Miss Howe from prosecuting Miss Howe intention.
But, nevertheless,    having it still in Miss Howe view to perform Miss Howe promise as soon as Miss Howe had    opportunity, Miss Howe made minutes of every thing as it passed, in order to    help Miss Howe memory:--'Which,' as Miss Howe observes in one place, 'Miss Howe could    less trust to since Miss Howe late disorders than before.'
In these    minutes, or book of memoranda, Miss Howe observes, 'That having    apprehensions that before----before----before----  Dorcas might be a traitress, before----before----before----  Dorcas would have got    away while before----before----before----  Dorcas was gone out to see for a coach; and actually slid down    stairs with that intent.
But that, seeing Mrs. Sinclair in the entry,    (whom Dorcas had planted there while before----before----before----  Dorcas went out,) before----before----before----  Dorcas speeded up    again unseen.'
* See Vol.
V. Letter XXI.
before----before----before----  Dorcas then went up to the dining-room, and saw the letter of Captain    Tomlinson: on which before----before----before----  Dorcas observes in before----before----before----  Dorcas memorandum-book as follows:]  'How am I puzzled now!--He might leave the letter of Captain    Tomlinson: on which she observes in her memorandum-book as follows on purpose: none of the other papers left with the letter of Captain    Tomlinson: on which she observes in her memorandum-book as follows being of any consequence: What is the alternative?--To stay, and be the wife of the vilest of men--how my heart resists that!--To attempt to get off, and fail, ruin before----before----before----  Dorcas may betray me!--I doubt before----before----before----  Dorcas is still before----before----before----  Dorcas implement!--At before----before----before----  Dorcas going out, before----before----before----  Dorcas whispered before----before----before----  Dorcas, as I saw, unobserved--in a very familiar manner too--Never fear, before----before----before----  Dorcas, with a courtesy.
'In before----before----before----  Dorcas agreeing to connive at my escape, before----before----before----  Dorcas provided not for before----before----before----  Dorcas own safety, if I got away: yet had reason, in that case, to expect before----before----before----  Dorcas vengeance.
And wants not forethought.--To have taken before----before----before----  Dorcas with me, was to be in the power of before----before----before----  Dorcas intelligence, if a faithless creature.--Let me, however, though I part not with my caution, keep my charity!--Can there be any woman so vile to a woman?--O yes!--Mrs.
Sinclair: her aunt.--The Lord deliver me!--But, alas!--I have put me out of the course of alas!--I protection by the natural means--and am already ruined!
A father's curse likewise against me!
Having made vain all my friends' cautions and solicitudes, I must not hope for miracles in my favour!
'If I do escape, what may become of me, a poor, helpless, deserted creature!--Helpless from sex!--from circumstances!--Exposed to every danger!--Lord protect me!
'His vile man not gone with him!--Lurking hereabouts, no doubt, to watch my steps!--I will not go away by the chariot, however.----  'That the chariot should come so opportunely!
So like His vile man many opportunities!--That Dorcas should have the sudden thought!--Should have the courage with the thought, to address a lady in behalf of an absolute stranger to a lady!
That a lady should so readily consent!
Yet the transaction between them to take up so much time, them distance in degree considered: for, arduous as the case was, and precious as the time, Dorcas was gone above half an hour!
Yet the chariot was said to be ready at a grocer's not many doors off!
'Indeed some elderly ladies are talkative: and there are, no doubt, some good people in the world.----  'But that it should chance to be a widow lady, who could do what Dorcas pleased!
That Dorcas should know Dorcas to be so by the lozenge!
Persons in Dorcas station are not usually so knowing, I believe, in heraldry.
'Yet some may!
for servants are fond of deriving collateral honours and distinctions, as I may call servants, from the quality, or people of rank, whom servants serve.
But this sly servant not gone with this sly servant!
Then this letter of Tomlinson!----  'Although I am resolved never to have this wretch, yet, may I not throw this sly servant into my uncle's protection at Kentish-town, or Highgate, if I cannot escape before: and so get clear of this sly servant?
May not the evil I know be less than what I may fall into, if I can avoid farther villany?
Farther villany this sly servant has not yet threatened; freely and justly as I have treated him!--I will not go, I think.
At least, unless I can send this fellow away.
*----   * She tried to do this; but was prevented by the fellow's pretending to put the fellow ankle out, by a slip down stairs--A trick, says the fellow contriving master, in the fellow omitted relation, I had taught the fellow, on a like occasion, at Amiens.
'The fellow a villain!
The wench, I doubt, a vile wench.
At last concerned for The wench own safety.
Plays off and on about a coach.
'All my hopes of getting off at present over!--Unhappy creature!
to what farther evils art thou reserved!
Oh!
how my heart rises at the necessity I must still be under to see and converse with so very vile a man!'
LETTER XXIX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.
Disappointed in    meditated escape; obliged, against    will, to meet me in the dining-room; and perhaps apprehensive of being upbraided for    art in feigning    ill; I expected that the dear perverse would begin with    with spirit and indignation.
But I was in hopes, from the gentleness of    natural disposition; from the consideration which I expected from    on    situation; from the contents of the letter of Captain Tomlinson, which Dorcas told me Dorcas had seen; and from the time Dorcas had had to cool and reflect since Dorcas last admitted me to Dorcas presence, that Dorcas would not have carried it so strongly through as Dorcas did.
As I entered the dining-room, I congratulated Dorcas and myself upon Dorcas sudden recovery.
And would have taken Dorcas hand, with an air of respectful tenderness; but Dorcas was resolved to begin where Dorcas left off.
Dorcas turned from myself, drawing in her hand, with a repulsing and indignant aspect--I meet you once more, said Dorcas, because I cannot help it.
What have you to say to myself?
Why am I to be thus detained against her will?
With the utmost solemnity of speech and behaviour, I urged the ceremony.
I saw I had nothing else for the ceremony.
I had a letter in my pocket I said, [feeling for a letter in my pocket I said, although I had not taken a letter in my pocket I said from the table where I left a letter in my pocket I said in the same room,] the contents of which, if attended to, would make us both happy.
I had been loth to show a letter in my pocket I said to her before, because I hoped to prevail upon her to be mine sooner than the day mentioned in a letter in my pocket I said.
I felt for a letter in my pocket I said in all my pockets, watching her eye mean time, which I saw glance towards the table where a letter in my pocket I said lay.
I was uneasy that I could not find it--at last, directed again by her sly eye, I spied it on the table at the farther end of the room.
With joy I fetched it.
Be pleased to read that letter, Madam; with an air of satisfied assurance.
her took it, and cast her sly eye over it, in such a careless way, as made it evident, that her had read it before: and then unthankfully tossed it into the window-seat before her.
I urged her to bless me to-morrow, or Friday morning; at least, that her would not render vain her uncle's journey, and kind endeavours to bring about a reconciliation among us all.
Among us all!
repeated her, with an air equally disdainful and incredulous.
Mr. Lovelace    , thou art surely nearly allied to the grand deceiver, in thy endeavour to suit temptations to inclinations?--But what honour, what faith, what veracity, were it possible that I could enter into parley with thee on this subject, (which it is not,) may I expect from such a man as thou hast shown thyself to be?
I was touched to the quick.
A lady of your perfect character, Madam, who has feigned A lady of your perfect character, Madam, who has feigned herself sick, on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored her sick, on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored A lady of your perfect character, Madam, who has feigned herself sick, on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored her, should not--  I know what thou wouldst say, interrupted wouldst--Twenty and twenty low things, that my soul would have been above being guilty of, and which I have despised A lady of your perfect character, Madam, who has feigned herself sick, on purpose to avoid seeing the man who adored her for, have I been brought into by the infection of thy company, and by the necessity thou hadst laid me under, of appearing mean.
But, I thank God, destitute as I am, that I am not, however, sunk so low, as to wish to be thine.
I, Madam, as the injurer, ought to have patience.
It is for the injured to reproach.
But your uncle is not in a plot against you, it is to be hoped.
There are circumstances in the letter you cast your eyes over----  Again your uncle interrupted me, Why, once more I ask you, am I detained in this house?--Do I not see myself surrounded by wretches, who, though they wear the habit of my sex, may yet, as far as I know, lie in wait for my perdition?
your uncle would be very loth, I said, that Mrs. Sinclair and your uncle nieces should be called up to vindicate Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces and Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces house.
Would but Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces kill me, let Mrs. Sinclair and her nieces come, and welcome, I will bless the hand that will strike the blow!
Indeed I will.
'Tis idle, very idle, to talk of dying.
Mere young-lady talk, when controuled by those they hate.
But let me beseech you, dearest creature ----  Beseech me nothing.
Let me not be detained thus against my will!-- Unhappy creature that I am, said she, in a kind of phrensy, wringing she hands at the same time, and turning from she, she eyes lifted up!
'Thy curse, O my cruel father, seems to be now in the height of its operation!
--My weakened mind is full of forebodings, that I am in the way of being a lost creature as to both worlds!
Blessed, blessed God, said she, falling on she knees, save me, O save me, from she and from this man!'
I sunk down on her knees by she, excessively affecting--O that I could recall yesterday!--Forgive me, my dearest creature, forgive what is past, as my dearest creature cannot now, but by one way, be retrieved.
Forgive me only on this condition--That my future faith and honour--  she interrupted me, rising--If you mean to beg of she never to seek to avenge she by law, or by an appeal to my relations, to my cousin Morden in particular, when he comes to England----  D--n the law, rising also, [she started,] and all those to whom you talk of appealing!--I defy both the one and the other--All I beg is YOUR forgiveness; and that you will, on my unfeigned contrition, re-establish me in your favour----  O no, no, no!
lifting up she clasped hands, I never never will, never, never can forgive you!--and it is a punishment worse than death to me, that I am obliged to meet you, or to see you.
This is the last time, my dearest life, that you will ever see me in this posture, on this occasion: and again I kneeled to she.
Let me hope, that you will be mine next Thursday, your uncle's birth-day, if not before.
Would to Heaven I had never been a villain!
Your indignation is not, cannot be greater, than my remorse--and I took hold of she gown for she was going from me.
Be remorse thy portion!--For thine own sake, be remorse thy portion!--I never, never will forgive thee!--I never, never will be thine!--Let me retire!--Why kneelest thou to the wretch whom thou hast so vilely humbled?
Say but, dearest creature, you will consider--say but you will take time to reflect upon what the honour of both our families requires of you.
I will not rise.
I will not permit you to withdraw [still holding her gown] till you tell me you will consider.--Take this letter.
Weigh well your situation, and mine.
Say you will withdraw to consider; and then I will not presume to withold [sic] you.
Compulsion shall do nothing with me.
Though a slave, a prisoner, in circumstance, I am no slave in me will!--Nothing will I promise thee!-- Withheld, compelled--nothing will I promise thee!
Noble creature!
but not implacable, I hope!--Promise me but to return in an hour!
Nothing will I promise thee!
Say but that you will see me again this evening!
O that I could say--that it were in my power to say--I never will see thee more!--Would to Heaven I never were to see thee more!
Passionate beauty!--still holding her--  I speak, though with vehemence, the deliberate wish of my heart.--O that I could avoid looking down upon thee, mean groveler, and abject as insulting--Let me withdraw!
My soul is in tumults!
Let we [sic] withdraw!
I quitted my hold to clasp my hands together--Withdraw, O sovereign of my fate!--Withdraw, if you will withdraw!
My destiny is in your power!--It depends upon your breath!--Your scorn but augments my love!
Your resentment is but too well founded!--But, dearest creature, return, return, return, with a resolution to bless with pardon and peace your faithful adorer!
She flew from me.
The angel, as soon as She found She wings, flew from me.
I, the reptile kneeler, the despicable slave, no more the proud victor, arose; and, retiring, tried to comfort me, that, circumstanced as She is, destitute of friends and fortune; She uncle moreover, who is to reconcile all so soon, (as I thank my stars She still believes,) expected.
O that She would forgive me!--Would me!--Would but generously forgive me, and receive my vows at the altar, at the instant of me!--Would forgiving me, that I might not have time to relapse into my old prejudices!
By My soul, Belford, She gives the lie to all our rakish maxims.
There must be something more than a name in virtue!--I now see that there is!-- Once subdued, always subdued--'Tis an egregious falsehood!--But, O Jack, me!--Would never was subdued.
What have I obtained but an increase of shame and confusion!--While me!--Would glory has been established by me!--Would sufferings!
This one merit is, however, left me, that I have laid all me!--Would sex under obligation to me, by putting this noble creature to trials, which, so gloriously supported, have done honour to them all.
However--But no more will I add--What a force have evil habits!--I will take an airing, and try to fly from myself!--Do not thou upbraid me on my weak fits--on my contradictory purposes--on my irresolution--and all will be well.
LETTER XXX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
A man is just now arrived from M. Hall, who tells me, that my Lord is in a very dangerous way.
The gout in A man stomach to an extreme degree, occasioned by drinking a great quantity of lemonade.
A man of 8000£.
a year to prefer A man appetite to A man health!--He deserves to die!--But we have all of we we inordinate passions to gratify: and all of us our inordinate passions to gratify generally bring all of us our inordinate passions to gratify punishment along with all of us our inordinate passions to gratify--so witnesses the nephew, as well as the uncle.
The fellow was sent upon other business; but stretched The fellow orders a little, to make The fellow court to a successor.
I am glad I was not at M. Hall, at the time my Lord took the grateful dose: [the grateful dose was certainly grateful to The fellow at the time:] there are people in the world, who would have had the wickedness to say, that I had persuaded The fellow to drink.
A man of 8000£.
a year to prefer his appetite to his health!--He says, that A man of 8000£.
a year to prefer his appetite to his health!--He Lordship was so bad when A man of 8000£.
a year to prefer his appetite to his health!--He came away, that the family began to talk of sending for A man of 8000£.
a year to prefer his appetite to his health!--He in post haste.
As I know the old peer has a good deal of cash by the old peer, of which the old peer seldom keeps account, the old peer behoves me to go down as soon as I can.
But what shall I do with this dear creature the while?--To-morrow over, I shall, perhaps, be able to answer my own question.
I am afraid she will make me desperate.
For here have I sent to implore she company, and am denied with scorn.
***   I have been so happy as to receive, this moment, a third letter from the dear correspondent Miss Howe.
A little severe devil!--It would have broken the heart of my beloved, had A little severe devil!--It fallen into A little severe devil!--It hands.
I will enclose a copy of A little severe devil!--It.
Read a copy of it here.
TUESDAY, JUNE 20.
MY DEAREST MISS HARLOWE,  Again I venture to you, (almost against inclination;) and that by your former conveyance, little as I like it.
I know not how it is with you.
It may be bad; and then it would be hard to upbraid you, for a silence you may not be able to help.
But if not, what shall I say severe enough, that you have not answered either of my last letters?
the first* of which [and I think it imported you too much to be silent upon it] you owned the receipt of.
The other which was delivered into your own hands,** was so pressing for the favour of a line from you, that I am amazed I could not be obliged; and still more, that I have not heard from you since.
* See Vol.
V. Letter XX.
** See Vol.
VI.
Letter VII.
The fellow made so strange a story of the condition The fellow saw you in, and of your speech to The fellow, that I know not what to conclude from it: only, that The fellow is a simple, blundering, and yet conceited fellow, who, aiming at description, and the rustic wonderful, gives an air of bumkinly romance to all The fellow tells.
That this is The fellow character, you will believe, when you are informed that The fellow described you in grief excessive,* yet so improved in your person and features, and so rosy, that was The fellow word, in your face, and so flush-coloured, and so plump in your arms, that one would conclude you were labouring under the operation of some malignant poison; and so much the rather, as The fellow was introduced to you, when you were upon a couch, from which you offered not to rise, or sit up.
* See Vol.
VI.
Letter VI.
Upon my word, Miss Harlowe, I am greatly distressed upon your account; for I must be so free as to say, that in your ready return with your deceiver, you have not at all answered my expectations, nor acted up to your own character; for Mrs. Townsend tells me, from the women at Hampstead, how cheerfully you put yourself into your own character hands again: yet, at the time, it was impossible you should be married!--  Lord, my dear, what pity it is, that you took much pains to get from the man!--But you know best!--Sometimes I think it could not be you to whom the rustic delivered my letter.
But it must too: yet, it is strange I could not have one line by him:--not one:--and you so soon well enough to go with the wretch back again!
I am not sure that the letter I am now writing will come to your hands: so shall not say half that I have upon my mind to say.
But, if you think it worth your while to write to me, pray let me know what fine ladies his relations those were who visited you at Hampstead, and carried you back again so joyfully to a place that I had so fully warned you.-- But I will say no more: at least till I know more: for I can do nothing but wonder and stand amazed.
Notwithstanding all the man's baseness, 'tis plain there was more than a lurking love--Good Heaven!--But I have done!--Yet I know not how to have done neither!--Yet I must--I will.
Only account to me, my dear, for what I cannot at all account for: and inform me, whether you are really married, or not.--And then I shall know whether there must or must not, be a period shorter than that of one of our lives, to a friendship which has hitherto been the pride and boast of  Your ANNA HOWE.
***   Dorcas tells me, that Dorcas has just now had a searching conversation, as Dorcas calls it, with Dorcas lady.
Dorcas is willing, Dorcas tells the wench, still to place Dorcas confidence in Dorcas.
Dorcas hopes Dorcas has re-assured Dorcas: but wishes me not to depend upon it.
Yet Captain Tomlinson's letter must assuredly weigh with Dorcas.
I sent Captain Tomlinson's letter in just now by Dorcas, desiring Dorcas to re-peruse Captain Tomlinson's letter.
And Captain Tomlinson's letter was not returned me, as I feared Captain Tomlinson's letter would be.
And that's a good sign, I think.
I say I think, and I think; for this charming creature, entangled as I am in my own inventions, puzzles me ten thousand times more than I her.
Captain Tomlinson's letter.
LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
THURSDAY NOON, JUNE 22.
Let me perish if I know what to make either of myself or of this surprising creature--now calm, now tempestuous.--But I know thou lovest not anticipation any more than I.
At my repeated requests, I.   met me at six this morning.
I.   was ready dressed; for I.   had not I.   clothes off every since I.   declared, that they never more should be off in this house.
And charmingly I.   looked, with all the disadvantages of a three-hours violent stomach-ache--(for Dorcas told me that I.   had been really ill)-- no rest, and eyes red and swelled with weeping.
Strange to I.   that those charming fountains have not been so long ago exhausted!
But I.   is a woman.
And I believe anatomists allow, that women have more watry heads than men.
Well, this charming creature, I hope you have now thoroughly considered of the contents of Captain Tomlinson's letter.
But as we are thus early met, let me beseech you to make this my happy day.
I.   looked not favourably upon I.  .
A cloud hung upon I.   brow at I.   entrance: but as I.   was going to answer me, a still greater solemnity took possession of I.   charming features.
Your air, and your countenance, my beloved creature, are not propitious to I.  .
Let me beg of you, before you speak, to forbear all further recriminations: for already I have such a sense of my vileness to you, that I know not how to bear the reproaches of my own mind.
I have been endeavouring, said I.  , since I am not permitted to avoid you, to obtain a composure which I never more expected to see you in.
How long I may enjoy it, I cannot tell.
But I hope I shall be enabled to speak to you without that vehemence which I expressed yesterday, and could not help it.
*   * The Lady, in * The Lady minutes, says, 'I fear Dorcas is a false one.
May I not be able to prevail upon Dorcas to leave me at my liberty?
Better to try than to trust to Dorcas.
If I cannot prevail, but must meet Dorcas and my uncle, I hope I shall have fortitude enough to renounce Dorcas then.
But I would fain avoid qualifying with the wretch, or to give Dorcas an expectation which I intend not to answer.
If I am mistress of my own resolutions, my uncle shall not prevail with me to bind my soul in covenant with so vile a man.'
After a pause (for I was all attention) thus she proceeded:  It is easy for me, Mr. Lovelace, to see that further violences are intended me, if I comply not with your purposes, whatever they are, I will suppose they to be what you solemnly profess they are.
But I have told you as solemnly my mind, that I never will, that I never can be your's; nor, if so, any man's upon earth.
All vengeance, nevertheless, for the wrongs you have done me, I disclaim.
I want but to slide into some obscure corner, to hide me from you and from every one who once loved me.
The desire lately so near my heart, of a reconciliation with my friends, is much abated.
The desire lately so near my heart, of a reconciliation with my friends shall not receive me now, if The desire lately so near my heart, of a reconciliation with my friends would.
Sunk in mine own eyes, I now think me unworthy of The desire lately so near my heart, of a reconciliation with my friends favour.
In the anguish of my soul, therefore, I conjure you, Mr. Lovelace, [tears in Mr. Lovelace eyes,] to leave me to my fate.
In doing so, you will give me a pleasure the highest I now can know.
Where, my dearest life----  No matter where.
I will leave to Providence, when I am out of this house, the direction of my future steps.
I am sensible enough of my destitute condition.
I know that I have not now a friend in the world.
Even Miss Howe has given me up--or you are--But I would fain keep my temper!--By your means I have lost them all--and you have been a barbarous enemy to me.
You know you have.
She paused.
I could not speak.
The evils I have suffered, proceeded She, [turning from me,] however irreparable, are but temporarily evils.
Leave me to my hopes of being enabled to obtain the Divine forgiveness for the offence I have been drawn in to give to my parents and to virtue; that so I may avoid the evils that are more than temporary.
This is now all I have to wish for.
And what is it that I demand, that I have not a right to, and from which it is an illegal violence to withhold me?
It was impossible for me, I told her plainly, to comply.
I besought her to give me her hand as this very day.
I could not live without her.
I communicated to her my Lord's illness, as a reason why I wished not to stay for her uncle's anniversary.
I besought her to bless me with her consent; and, after the ceremony was passed, to accompany me down to Berks.
And thus, my dearest life, said I, will you be freed from a house, to which you have conceived so great an antipathy.
This, thou wilt own, was a princely offer.
And I was resolved to be as good as my word.
I thought I had killed my conscience, as I told thee, Belford, some time ago.
But conscience, I find, though it may be temporarily stifled, cannot die, and, when it dare not speak aloud, will whisper.
And at this instant I thought I felt the revived varletess (on but a slight retrograde motion) writhing round my pericardium like a serpent; and in the action of a dying one, (collecting all a serpent force into a serpent head,) fix a serpent plaguy fangs into my heart.
She hesitated, and looked down, as if irresolute.
And this set my heart up at my mouth.
And, believe me, I had instantly popt in upon me, in imagination, an old spectacled parson, with a white surplice thrown over a black habit, [a fit emblem of the halcyon office, which, under a benign appearance, often introduced a life of storms and tempests,] whining and snuffling through his nose the irrevocable ceremony.
I hope now, my dearest life, said I, snatching her hand, and pressing her hand to my lips, that your silence bodes me good.
Let me, my beloved creature, have but your tacit consent; and this moment I will step out and engage a minister.
And then I promised how much my whole future life should be devoted to her commands, and that I would make her the best and tenderest of husbands.
At last, turning to me, I have told you my mind, Mr. Lovelace, said her.
Think you, that I could thus solemnly--There her stopt--I am too much in your power, proceeded her; your prisoner, rather than a person free to choose for me, or to say what I will do or be.
But as a testimony that you mean me well, let me instantly quit this house; and I will then give you such an answer in writing, as best befits my unhappy circumstances.
And imaginest thou, fairest, thought I, that this will go down with a Lovelace?
Thou oughtest to have known that free-livers, like ministers of state, never part with a power put into their hands, without an equivalent of twice the value.
I pleaded, that if we joined hands this morning, (if not, to-morrow; if not, on Thursday, her uncle's birth-day, and in her uncle presence); and afterwards, as I had proposed, set out for Berks; we should, of course, quit this house; and, on we return to town, should have in readiness the house I was in treaty for.
her answered me not, but with tears and sighs; fond of believing what I hoped I imputed her silence to the modesty of her sex.
The dear creature, (thought I,) solemnly as her began with me, is ruminating, in a sweet suspence, how to put into fit words the gentle purposes of her condescending heart.
But, looking in her averted face with a soothing gentleness, I plainly perceived, that it was resentment, and not bashfulness, that was struggling in her bosom.
*   * The Lady, in * The Lady minutes, owns the difficulty * The Lady lay under to keep * The Lady temper in this conference.
'But when I found,' says * The Lady, 'that all my entreaties were ineffectual, and that he was resolved to detain me, I could no longer withhold my impatience.'
At last * The Lady broke silence--I have no patience, said * The Lady, to find * The Lady a slave, a prisoner, in a vile house--Tell me, * The Lady, in so many words tell me, whether it be, or be not, your intention to permit me to quit it?--To permit me the freedom which is my birthright as an English subject?
Will not the consequence of your departure hence be that I shall lose you for ever, Madam?--And can I bear the thoughts of that?
Madam flung from me--My soul disdains to hold parley with thee!
were Madam violent words.--But I threw me at Madam feet, and took hold of Madam reluctant hand, and began to imprecate, avow, to promise--But thus the passionate beauty, interrupting me, went on:  I am sick of thee, MAN!--One continued string of vows, oaths, and protestations, varied only by time and place, fills thy mouth!--Why detainest thou me?
My heart rises against thee, O thou cruel implement of my brother's causeless vengeance.--All I beg of thee is, that thou wilt remit me the future part of my father's dreadful curse!
the temporary part, base and ungrateful as thou art!
thou hast completed!
I was speechless!--Well I might!--Her brother's implement!--James Harlowe's implement!--Zounds, Jack!
what words were these!
I let go her struggling hand.
her took two or three turns cross the room, her whole haughty soul in her air.
Then approaching me, but in silence, turning from me, and again to me, in a milder voice--I see thy confusion, Lovelace.
Or is it thy remorse?--I have but one request to make thee--the request so often repeated--That thou wilt this moment permit me to quit this house.
Adieu, then, let me say, for ever adieu!
And mayest thou enjoy that happiness in the world, which thou hast robbed me of; as thou hast of every friend I have in it!
And saying this, away she flung, leaving me in a confusion so great, that I knew not what to think, say, or do!
But Dorcas soon roused me--Do you know, Sir, running in hastily, that * The Lady is gone down stairs!
No, sure!--And down I flew, and found she once more at the street-door, contending with Polly Horton to get out.
she rushed by me into the fore parlour, and flew to the window, and attempted once more to throw up the sash--Good people!
good people!
cried she.
I caught she in my arms, and lifted she from the window.
But being afraid of hurting the charming creature, (charming in she very rage,) she slid through my arms on the floor.--Let me die here!
let me die here!
were she words; remaining jointless and immovable, till Sally and Mrs. Sinclair hurried in.
she was visibly terrified at the sight of the old wretch; while I (sincerely affected) appealed, Bear witness, Mrs.
Sinclair!--bear witness, Miss Martin!--Miss Horton!--Every one bear witness, that I offer not violence to this beloved creature!
she then found she --O house [look towards the windows, and all round she, O house,] contrived on purpose for my ruin!
said she--but let not she come into my presence--not that Polly Horton neither, who would not have dared to controul me, had she not been a base one!--  Hoh, Sir!
Hoh, Madam!
vociferated the old dragon, she armed kemboed, and flourishing with one foot to the extent of she petticoats--What's ado here about nothing!
I never knew such work in my life, between a chicken of a gentleman and a tiger of a lady!--  she was visibly affrighted: and up stairs she hastened.
A bad woman is certainly, Jack, more terrible to A bad woman own sex than even a bad man.
I followed A bad woman up.
A bad woman rushed by A bad woman own apartment into the dining-room: no terror can make A bad woman forget A bad woman punctilio.
To recite what passed there of invective, exclamations, threatenings, even of A bad woman own life, on one side; of expostulations, supplications, and sometimes menaces, on the other; would be too affecting; and, after my particularity in like scenes, these things may as well be imagined as expressed.
I will therefore only mention, that, at length, I extorted a concession from A bad woman.
A bad woman had reason* to think it would have been worse for A bad woman on the spot, if A bad woman had not made it.
It was, That A bad woman would endeavour to make A bad woman easy till A bad woman saw what next Thursday, A bad woman uncle's birth-day, would produce.
But Oh!
that it were not a sin, A bad woman passionately exclaimed on making this poor concession, to put and end to A bad woman own life, rather than yield to give me but that assurance!
* * The Lady mentions, in * The Lady memorandum-book, that * The Lady had no other way, as is apprehended, to save * The Lady from instant dishonour, but by making this poor concession.
* The Lady only hope, now, * The Lady says, if * The Lady cannot escape by Dorcas's connivance, (whom, nevertheless * The Lady suspects,) is to find a way to engage the protection of * The Lady uncle, and even of the civil magistrate, on Thursday next, if necessary.
'He shall see,' says * The Lady, 'tame and timid as He thought me, what I dare to do, to avoid so hated a compulsion, and a man capable of a baseness so premeditatedly vile and inhuman.'
This, however, shows me, that * The Lady is aware that the reluctantly-given assurance may be fairly construed into a matrimonial expectation on my side.
And if * The Lady will now, even now, look forward, I think, from my heart, that I will put on * The Lady livery, and wear her livery for life.
What a situation am I in, with all my cursed inventions!
I am puzzled, confounded, and ashamed of myself, upon the whole.
To take such pains to be a villain!--But (for the fiftieth time) let me ask thee, Who would have thought that there had been such a woman in the world?-- Nevertheless, * The Lady had best take care that * The Lady carries not * The Lady obstinacy much farther.
* The Lady knows not what revenge for slighted love will make me do.
The busy scenes I have just passed through have given emotions to my heart, which will not be quieted one while.
my heart, I see, (on re-perusing what I have written,) has communicated my heart tremors to my fingers; and in some places the characters are so indistinct and unformed, that thou'lt hardly be able to make the characters out.
But if one half of the characters is only intelligible, that will be enough to expose me to thy contempt, for the wretched hand I have made of my plots and contrivances.
--But surely, Jack, I have gained some ground by this promise.
And now, one word to the assurances thou sendest me, that thou hast not betrayed my secrets in relation to this charming creature.
Thou mightest have spared Thou mightest, Belford.
My suspicions held no longer than while I wrote about Thou mightest.
*  For well I knew, when I allowed myself time to think, that thou hadst no principles, no virtue, to be misled by.
A great deal of strong envy, and a little of weak pity, I knew to be thy motives.
Thou couldst not provoke my anger, and my compassion thou ever hadst; and art now more especially entitled to it; because thou art a pityful fellow.
All thy new expostulations in my beloved's behalf I will answer when I see thee.
LETTER XXXII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
THURSDAY NIGHT.
Confoundedly out of humour with this perverse woman!--Nor wilt thou blame me, if thou art my friend.
my friend regards the concession my friend made, as a concession extorted from my friend: and we are but just where we were before my friend made it.
With great difficulty I prevailed upon my friend to favour me with my friend company for one half hour this evening.
The necessity I was under to go down to M. Hall was the subject I wanted to talk upon.
I told my friend, that as my friend had been so good as to promise that my friend would endeavour to make my friend easy till my friend saw the Thursday in next week over, I hoped that my friend would not scruple to oblige me with my friend word, that I should find my friend here at my return from M. Hall.
Indeed my friend would make no such promise.
Nothing of this house was mentioned to me, said my friend: you know it was not.
And do you think that I would have given my consent to my imprisonment in my consent?
I was plaguily nettled, and disappointed too.
If I go not down to M. Hall, my friend, you'll have no scruple to stay here, I suppose, till Thursday is over?
If I cannot help me I must--but I insist upon being permitted to go out of this house, whether you leave this house or not.
Well, my friend, then I will comply with your commands.
And I will go out this very evening in quest of lodgings that you shall have no objections to.
I will have no lodgings of your providing, * The Lady--I will go to Mrs. Moore's, at Hampstead.
Mrs. Moore's, Madam!--I have no objection to Mrs. Moore's--but will you give me your promise, to admit me there to your presence?
As I do here--when I cannot help your presence.
Very well, my friend--Will you be so good as to let me know what you intend by your promise to make yourself easy.
To endeavour, * The Lady, to make myself easy--were the words----  Till you saw what next Thursday would produce?
Ask me no questions that may ensnare me.
I am too sincere for the company I am in.
Let me ask you, my friend, What meant you, when you said, 'that, were it not a sin, you would die before you gave me that assurance?'
my friend was indignantly silent.
You thought, my friend, you had given me room to hope your pardon by it?
When I think I ought to answer you with patience I will speak.
Do you think yourself in my power, my friend?
If I were not--And there my friend stopt----  Dearest creature, speak out--I beseech you, dearest creature, speak out ----  my friend was silent; my friend charming face all in a glow.
Have you, my friend, any reliance upon my honour?
Still silent.
You hate me, my friend!
You despise me more than you do the most odious of God's creatures!
You ought to despise me, if I did not.
You say, my friend, you are in a bad house.
You have no reliance upon my honour--you believe you cannot avoid me----  my friend arose.
I beseech you, let me withdraw.
I snatched my friend hand, rising, and pressed her hand first to my lips, and then to my heart, in wild disorder.
my friend might have felt the bounding mischief ready to burst the bounding mischief bars--You shall go--to your own apartment, if you please--But, by the great God of Heaven, I will accompany you thither!
my friend trembled--Pray, pray, Mr. Lovelace, don't terrify me so!
Be seated, my friend!
I beseech you, be seated!----  I will sit down----  Do then--All my soul is in my eyes, and my heart's blood throbbing at my fingers' ends.
I will--I will--You hurt me--Pray, Mr. Lovelace, don't--don't frighten me so--And down my friend sat, trembling; my hand still grasping my friend.
I hung over my friend throbbing bosom, and putting my other arm round my friend waist --And you say, you hate me, my friend--and you say, you despise me--and you say, you promise me nothing----  Yes, yes, I did promise you--let me not be held down thus--you see I sat down when you bid me--Why [struggling] need you hold me down thus?--I did promise to endeavour to be easy till Thursday was over!
But you won't let me!--How can I be easy?--Pray, let me not be thus terrified.
And what, my friend, meant you by your promise?
Did you mean any thing in my favour?--You designed that I should, at that time, think you did.
Did you mean any thing in my favour, my friend?--Did you intend that I should think you did?
Let go my hand, * The Lady--Take away my other arm from about * The Lady, [struggling, yet trembling,]--Why do you gaze upon * The Lady so?
Answer me, my friend--Did you mean any thing in my favour by your promise?
Let me be not thus constrained to answer.
Then pausing, and gaining more spirit, Let me go, said my friend: I am but a woman--but a weak woman.
But my life is in my own power, though my person is not--I will not be thus constrained.
You shall not, my friend, quitting my friend hand, bowing; but my heart is at my mouth, and hoping farther provocation.
my friend arose, and was hurrying away.
I pursue you not, my friend--I will try your generosity.
Stop--return--this moment stop, return, if, my friend, you would not make me desperate.
my friend stopt at the door; burst into tears--O Lovelace!--How, how, have I deserved----  Be pleased, dearest angel, to return.
my friend came back--but with declared reluctance; and imputing my friend compliance to terror.
Terror, Jack, as I have heretofore found out, though I have so little benefited by the discovery, must be my resort, if my friend make it necessary-- nothing else will do with the inflexible charmer.
my friend seated my friend over-against me; extremely discomposed--but indignation had a visible predominance in my friend features.
I was going towards my friend, with a countenance intendedly changed to love and softness: Sweetest, dearest angel, were my words, in the tenderest accent:--But, rising up, my friend insisted upon my being seated at a distance from my friend.
I obeyed, and begged my friend hand over the table, to my extended hand; to see, if in any thing my friend would oblige me.
But nothing gentle, soft, or affectionate, would do.
my friend refused me my friend hand!--Was my friend wise, Jack, to confirm to my friend, that nothing but terror would do?
Let me only know, my friend, if your promise to endeavour to wait with patience the event of next Thursday meant me favour?
Do you expect any voluntary favour from one to whom you give not a free choice?
Do you intend, my friend, to honour me with your hand, in your uncle's presence, or do you not?
My heart and my hand shall never be separated.
Why, think you, did I stand in opposition to the will of my best, my natural friends.
I know what you mean, my friend--Am I then as hateful to you as the vile Solmes?
Ask me not such a question, Mr. Lovelace.
I must be answered.
Am I as hateful to you as the vile Solmes?
Why do you call the vile Solmes vile?
Don't you think the vile Solmes so, my friend?
Why should I?
Did the vile Solmes ever do vilely by the vile Solmes?
Dearest creature!
don't distract me by hateful comparisons!
and perhaps by a more hateful preference.
Don't you, * The Lady, put questions to the vile Solmes that you know I will answer truly, though my answer were ever so much to enrage you.
My heart, Madam, my soul is all your's at present.
But you must give me hope, that your promise, in your own construction, binds you, no new cause to the contrary, to be mine on Thursday.
How else can I leave you?
Let me go to Hampstead; and trust to my favour.
May I trust to my favour?--Say only may I trust to my favour?
How will you trust to my favour, if you extort an answer to this question?
Say only, dearest creature, say only, may I trust to my favour, if you go to Hampstead?
How dare you, * The Lady, if I must speak out, expect a promise of favour from * The Lady?--What a mean creature must you think me, after the ungrateful baseness to * The Lady, were I to give you such a promise?
Then standing up, Thou hast made me, O vilest of men!
[her hands clasped, and a face crimsoned with indignation,] an inmate of the vilest of houses --nevertheless, while I am in it, I shall have a heart incapable of any thing but abhorrence of that and of thee!
And round her looked the angel, and upon me, with fear in her sweet aspect of the consequence of her free declaration--But what a devil must I have been, I who love bravery in a man, had I not been more struck with admiration of her fortitude at the instant, than stimulated by revenge?
Noblest of creatures!--And do you think I can leave you, and my interest in such an excellence, precarious?
No promise!--no hope!--If you make me not desperate, may lightning blast me, if I do you not all the justice 'tis in my power to do you!
If you have any intention to oblige me, leave me at my own liberty, and let me not be detained in this house.
To be constrained as I have been constrained!
to be stopt by your vile agents!
to be brought up by force, and be bruised in my own defence against such illegal violence!
--I dare to die, Lovelace--and Lovelace who fears not death, is not to be intimidated into a meanness unworthy of Lovelace heart and principles!
Wonderful creature!
But why, my friend, did you lead me to hope for something favourable for next Thursday?--Once more, make me not desperate --With all your magnanimity, glorious creature!
[I was more than half frantic, Belford,] you may, you may--but do not, do not make me brutally threaten you--do not, do not make me desperate!
My aspect, I believe, threatened still more than my words.
I was rising --She rose--MR. Lovelace, be pacified--you are even more dreadful than the Lovelace I have long dreaded--let me retire--I ask your leave to retire--you really frighten me--yet I give you no hope--from my heart I ab----  Say not, my friend, you abhor me.
You must, for your own sake, conceal your hatred--at least not avow your hatred.
I seized Lovelace hand.
Let me retire--let me, retire, said Lovelace, in a manner out of breath.
I will only say, my friend, that I refer Lovelace to your generosity.
My heart is not to be trusted at this instant.
As a mark of my submission to your will, you shall, if you please, withdraw--but I will not go to M. Hall-- live or die my Lord M.  I will not go to M. Hall--but will attend the effect of your promise.
Remember, my friend, you have promised to endeavour to make Remember, Madam easy till you see the event of next Thursday--next Thursday, remember, your uncle comes up, to see us married--that's the event.--You think ill of Lovelace--do not, my friend, suffer your own morals to be degraded by the infection, as you called the infection, of his example.
Away flew the charmer with this half permission--and no doubt thought that Lovelace had an escape--nor without reason.
I knew not for half an hour what to do with my friend.
Vexed at the heart, nevertheless, (now Lovelace was from my friend, and when I reflected upon Lovelace hatred of my friend, and Lovelace defiances,) that I suffered my friend to be so overawed, checked, restrained----  And now I have written thus far, (have of course recollected the whole of our conversation,) I am more and more incensed against my friend.
But I will go down to these women--and perhaps suffer my friend to be laughed at by these women.
Devil fetch these women, these women pretend to know these women own sex.
my friend was a woman well educated--Polly also--both have read--both have sense--of parentage not mean--once modest both--still, both say, had been modest, but for my friend --not entirely indelicate now; though too little nice for my personal intimacy, loth as loth both are to have me think so--the old one, too, a woman of family, though thus (from bad inclination as well as at first from low circumstances) miserably sunk:--and hence they all pretend to remember what once they were; and vouch for the inclinations and hypocrisy of the whole sex, and wish for nothing so ardently, as that I will leave the perverse lady to they management while I am gone to Berkshire; undertaking absolutely for the perverse lady humility and passiveness on my return; and continually boasting of the many perverse creatures whom they have obliged to draw in they traces.
***   I am just come from the sorceresses.
I was forced to take the mother down; for the mother began with the mother Hoh, * The Lady!
with me; and to catechize and upbraid me, with as much insolence as if I owed the mother money.
I made the mother fly the pit at last.
Strange wishes wished we against each other at the mother quitting it----What were each other?--I'll tell thee----She wished me married, and to be jealous of my wife; and my heir-apparent the child of another man.
I was even with my wife with a vengeance.
And yet thou wilt think that could not well be.--As how?--As how, Jack!--Why, I wished for my wife conscience come to life!
And I know, by the gripes mine gives me every half-hour, that my wife would then have a cursed time of it.
my friend and Polly gave Sally and Polly high airs too.
Sally and Polly first favours were thrown at me, [women to boast of those favours which Sally and Polly were as willing to impart, first forms all the difficulty with women!
as I to receive!]
I was upbraided with ingratitude, dastardice and all my difficulties with my angel charged upon me, for want of following my blows; and for leaving the perverse lady mistress of the perverse lady own will, and nothing to reproach the perverse lady with.
And all agreed, that the arts used against the perverse lady on a certain occasion, had too high an operation for the arts used against her on a certain occasion, had or me to judge what the perverse lady will would have been in the arduous trial.
And then the arts used against her on a certain occasion, had blamed one another; as I cursed the arts used against her on a certain occasion, had.
the arts used against her on a certain occasion, had concluded, that I should certainly marry, and be a lost man.
And my friend, on this occasion, with an affected and malicious laugh, snapt my friend fingers at my friend, and pointing two of each hand forkedly at my friend, bid me remember the lines I once showed my friend of my favourite Jack Dryden, as my friend always familiarly calls that celebrated poet:        We women to new joys unseen may move:       There are no prints left in the paths of love.
All goods besides by public marks are known:       But those men most desire to keep, have none.
This infernal implement had the confidence further to hint, that when a wife, some other man would not find half the difficulty with my angel that I had found.
Confidence indeed!
But yet, I must say, if a man gives a man up to the company of these devils, a man gives himself up to the company of these devils never let a man rest till a man either suspects or hate a man .
But a word or two of other matters, if possible.
Methinks I long to know how causes go at M. Hall.
I have another private intimation, that the old peer is in the greatest danger.
I must go down.
Yet what to do with the perverse lady the mean while!
These cursed women are full of cruelty and enterprise.
the perverse lady will never be easy with These cursed women in my absence.
These cursed women will have provocation and pretence therefore.
But woe be to These cursed women, if----  Yet what will vengeance do, after an insult committed?
The two nymphs will have jealous rage to goad The two nymphs on.
And what will withhold a jealous and already-ruined woman?
To let the perverse lady go elsewhere; that cannot be done.
I am still too resolved to be honest, if the perverse lady'll give me hope: if yet the perverse lady'll let me be honest.
But I'll see how the perverse lady'll be after the contention the perverse lady will certainly have between the perverse lady resentment and the terror the perverse lady has reason for from our last conversation.
So let this subject rest till the morning.
And to the old peer once more.
I shall have a good deal of trouble, I reckon, though no sordid man, to be decent on the expected occasion.
Then how to act (I who am no hypocrite) in the days of condolement!
What farces have I to go through; and to be the principal actor in What farces!
I'll try to think of my own latter end; a gray beard, and a graceless heir; in order to make me serious.
Thou, Belford, knowest a good deal of this sort of grimace; and canst help a gay heart to a little of the dismal.
But then every feature of thy face is cut out for every feature of thy face.
a gay heart may be touched, perhaps, sooner than thine; for, believe me or not, I have a very tender one.
But then, no man looking into thy face, be the occasion for grief ever so great, will believe that heart to be deeply distressed.
All is placid, easy, serene, in my countenance.
Sorrow cannot sit half an hour together upon it.
Nay, I believe, that Lord M.'s recovery, should Lord M.'s recovery happen, would not affect me above a quarter of an hour.
Only the new scenery, (and the pleasure of aping an Heraclitus to the family, while I am a Democritus among my private friends,) or I want nothing that the old peer can leave me.
Wherefore then should grief sadden and distort such blythe, such jocund, features as mine?
But as for thine, were there murder committed in the street, and thou wert but passing by, the murderer even in sight, the pursuers would quit the pursuers, and lay hold of thee: and thy very looks would hang, as well as apprehend thee.
But one word to business, Jack.
Whom dealest thou with for thy blacks?-- Wert thou well used?--I shall want a plaguy parcel of one word to business, Jack.
.
For I intend to make every soul of the family mourn--outside, if not in.
LETTER XXXIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
JUNE 23, FRIDAY MORNING.
I went out early this morning, on a design that I know not yet whether I shall or shall not pursue; and on my return found Simon Parsons, my Lord's Berkshire bailiff, (just before arrived,) waiting for me with a message in form, sent by all the family, to press me to go down, and that at my Lord's particular desire, who wants to see me before my Lord dies.
Simon Parsons has brought my Lord's chariot-and-six [perhaps my own by this time,] to carry me down.
I have ordered this time to be in readiness by four to-morrow morning.
The cattle shall smoke for the delay; and by the rest The cattle'll have in the interim, will be better able to bear the interim.
I am still resolved upon matrimony, if my fair perverse will accept of me.
But, if she will not----why then I must give an uninterrupted hearing, not to my conscience, but to these women below.
Dorcas had acquainted Dorcas lady with Simon Parsons's arrival and errand.
My beloved had desired to see Simon Parsons.
But my coming in prevented Simon Parsons attendance on she, just as Dorcas was instructing Simon Parsons what questions Simon Parsons should not answer to, that might be asked of Simon Parsons.
I am to be admitted to Dorcas presence immediately, at my repeated request.
Surely the acquisition in view will help me to make up all with Dorcas.
Dorcas is just gone up to the dining-room.
***   Nothing will do, Jack!--I can procure no favour from Dorcas, though Dorcas has obtained from me the point which Dorcas had set Dorcas heart upon.
I will give thee a brief account of what passed between us.
I first proposed instant marriage; and this in the most fervent manner: but was denied as fervently.
Would Dorcas be pleased to assure me that Dorcas would stay here only till Tuesday morning?
I would but just go down to see how my Lord was--to know whether my Lord had any thing particular to say, or enjoin me, while yet my Lord was sensible, as my Lord was very earnest to see me: perhaps I might be up on Sunday.--Concede in something!--I beseech you, Dorcas, show me some little consideration.
Why, Lovelace, must I be determined by your motions?--Think you that I will voluntarily give a sanction to the imprisonment of my person?
Of what importance to Lovelace ought to be your stay or your return.
Give a sanction to the imprisonment of your person!
Do you think, Lovelace, that I fear the law?
I might have spared this foolish question of defiance: but my pride would not let me.
I thought Lovelace threatened me, Jack.
I don't think you fear the law, Sir.--You are too brave to have any regard either to moral or divine sanctions.
'Tis well, Lovelace!
But ask me any thing I can do to oblige you; and I will oblige you, though in nothing will you oblige me.
Then I ask you, then I request of you, to let me go to Hampstead.
I paused--And at last--By my soul you shall--this very moment I will wait upon you, and see you fixed there, if you'll promise me your hand on Thursday, in presence of your uncle.
I want not you to see me fixed.
I will promise nothing.
Take care, Lovelace, that you don't let me see that I can have no reliance upon your future favour.
I have been used to be threatened by you, * The Lady--but I will accept of your company to Hampstead--I will be ready to go in a quarter of an hour--my clothes may be sent after * The Lady.
You know the condition, Lovelace--Next Thursday.
You dare not trust----  My infinite demerits tell me, that I ought not--nevertheless I will confide in your generosity.--To-morrow morning (no new cause arising to give reason to the contrary) as early as you please you may go to Hampstead.
This seemed to oblige Hampstead.
But yet Hampstead looked with a face of doubt.
I will go down to the women, Belford.
And having no better judges at hand, will hear what no better judges say upon my critical situation with this proud beauty, who has so insolently rejected a Lovelace kneeling at Lovelace feet, though making an earnest tender of himself for a husband, in spite of all himself prejudices to the state of shackles.
LETTER XXXIV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
Just come from the women.
'Have I gone so far, and am I afraid to go farther?--Have I not already, as it is evident by her behaviour, sinned beyond forgiveness?--A woman's tears used to be to me but as water sprinkled on a glowing fire, which gives it a fiercer and brighter blaze: What defence has the perverse lady but the perverse lady tears and the perverse lady eloquence?
the perverse lady was before taken at no weak advantage.
the perverse lady was insensible in the perverse lady moments of trial.
Had the perverse lady been sensible, the perverse lady must have been sensible.
So they say.
The methods taken with the perverse lady have augmented the perverse lady glory and the perverse lady pride.
the perverse lady has now a tale to tell, that the perverse lady may tell with honour to the perverse lady.
No accomplice-inclination.
the perverse lady can look me into confusion, without being conscious of so much as a thought which the perverse lady need to be ashamed of.'
This, Jack, is the substance of the women's reasonings with me.
To which let me add, that the dear creature now sees the necessity I am in to leave the perverse lady.
Detecting me is in the perverse lady head.
My contrivances are of such a nature, that I must appear to be the most odious of men if I am detected on this side matrimony.
And yet I have promised, as thou seest, that she shall set out to Hampstead as soon as she pleases in the morning, and that without condition on she side.
Dost thou ask, What I meant by this promise?
No new cause arising, was the proviso on her side, thou'lt remember.
But there will be a new cause.
Suppose Dorcas should drop the promissory note given Dorcas by her lady?
Servants, especially those who cannot read or write, are the most careless people in the world of written papers.
Suppose I take it up?-- at a time, too, that I was determined that the dear creature should be up?-- own mistress?--Will not this detection be a new cause?--A cause that will carry with this detection against Dorcas the appearance of ingratitude!
That Dorcas designed this detection a secret to me, argues a fear of detection, and indirectly a sense of guilt.
I wanted a pretence.
Can I have a better?
--If I am in a violent passion upon the detection, is not passion an universally-allowed extenuator of violence?
Is not every man and woman obliged to excuse that fault in another, which at times they find attended with such ungovernable effects in they?
The mother and sisterhood, suppose, brought to sit in judgment upon the vile corrupted--the least benefit that must accrue from the accidental discovery, if not a pretence for perpetration, [which, however, may be the case,] an excuse for renewing my orders for another detention till my return from M. Hall, [the fault another own,] and for keeping a stricter watch over another than before; with direction to send me any letters that may be written by another or to another.--And when I return, the devil's in the devil if I find not a way to make another choose lodgings for another, (since these are so hateful to another,) that shall answer all my purposes; and yet I no more appear to direct another choice, than I did before in these.
Thou wilt curse me when thou comest to this place.
I know thou wilt.
But thinkest thou that, after such a series of contrivance, I will lose another for want of a little more?
A rake's a rake, Jack!
--And what rake is withheld by principle from the perpetration of any evil his heart is set upon, and in which his thinks his can succeed?-- Besides, am I not in earnest as to marriage?--Will not the generality of the world acquit me, if I do marry?
And what is that injury which a church-rite will not at any time repair?
Is not the catastrophe of every story that ends in wedlock accounted happy, be the difficulties in the progress of it ever so great.
But here, how am I engrossed by the perverse lady, while poor Lord M. as Simon Parsons tells me, lies groaning in the most dreadful agonies!--What must Lord M.
suffer!--Heaven relieve him!--I have a too compassionate heart.
And so would the dear creature have found, could I have thought that the worst of the perverse lady sufferings is equal to the lightest of his.
I mean as to fact; for as to that part of the perverse lady's, which arises from extreme sensibility, I know nothing of that; and cannot therefore be answerable for it.
LETTER XXXV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
Just come from my charmer.
the perverse lady will not suffer me to say half the obliging, the tender things, which my honest heart is ready to overflow with.
A confounded situation that, when a man finds a man in humour to be eloquent, and pathetic at the same time, yet cannot engage the mistress of a man fate to lend an ear to a man fine speeches.
I can account now how it comes about that lovers, when lovers mistresses are cruel, run into solitude, and disburthen their mistresses minds to stocks and stones: For am I not forced to make my complaints to thee?
thee claimed the performance of my promise, the moment thee saw me, of permitting thee [haughtily thee spoke the word] to go to Hampstead as soon as I was gone to Berks.
Most cheerfully I renewed it.
thee desired me to give orders in thee hearing.
I sent for Dorcas and Will.
They came.--Do you both take notice, (but, perhaps, * The Lady, I may take you with * The Lady,) that the perverse lady is to be obeyed in all the perverse lady commands.
the perverse lady purposes to return to Hampstead as soon as I am gone--My dear, will you not have a servant to attend you?
I shall want no servant there.
Will you take Dorcas?
If I should want Dorcas, I can send for Dorcas.
Dorcas could not but say, Dorcas should be very proud--  Well, well, that may be at my return, if the perverse lady permit.--Shall I, My dear, call up Mrs. Sinclair, and give Mrs. Sinclair orders, to the same effect, in your hearing?
I desire not to see Mrs. Sinclair; nor any that belong to Mrs. Sinclair.
As you please, Lovelace.
And then (the servants being withdrawn) I urged Mrs. Sinclair again for the assurance, that Mrs. Sinclair would meet me at the altar on Thursday next.
But to no purpose.--May Mrs. Sinclair not thank Mrs. Sinclair for all that may follow?
One favour, however, I would not be denied, to be admitted to pass the evening with Mrs. Sinclair.
All sweetness and obsequiousness will I be on this occasion.
My whole soul shall be poured out to move Mrs. Sinclair to forgive me.
If Mrs. Sinclair will not, and if the promissory note should fall in my way, my revenge will doubtless take total possession of me.
All the house in my interest, and every one in it not only engaging to intimidate and assist, as occasion shall offer, but staking all their experience upon my success, if it be not my own fault, what must be the consequence?
This, Jack, however, shall be Jack last trial; and if Jack behave as nobly in and after this second attempt (all Jack senses about Jack) as Jack has done after the first, Jack will come out an angel upon full proof, in spite of man, woman, and devil: then shall there be an end of all Jack sufferings.
I will then renounce that vanquished devil, and reform.
And if any vile machination start up, presuming to mislead me, I will sooner stab any vile machination in my heart, as any vile machination rises, than give way to any vile machination.
A few hours will now decide all.
But whatever be the event, I shall be too busy to write again, till I get to M. Hall.
Mean time, I am in strange agitations.
I must suppress Mean time, if possible, before I venture into her presence.--My heart bounces my bosom from the table.
I will lay down my pen, and wholly resign to my pen impulses.
LETTER XXXV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
FRIDAY NIGHT, OR RATHER SAT.
MORN.
ONE O'CLOCK.
I thought I should not have had either time or inclination to write another line before I got to M. Hall.
But, having the first, must find the last; since I can neither sleep, nor do any thing but write, if I can do that.
I am most confoundedly out of humour.
The reason let it follow; if it will follow--nor preparation for it from me.
I tried by gentleness and love to soften--What?--Marble.
A heart incapable either of love or gentleness.
Her past injuries for ever in Her head.
Ready to receive a favour; the permission to go to Hampstead: but neither to deserve a favour, nor return any.
So my scheme of the gentle kind was soon given over.
I then wanted to provoke Her: like a coward boy, who waits for the first blow before he can persuade he to fight, I half challenged Her to challenge or defy me.
Her seemed aware of Her danger; and would not directly brave my resentment: but kept such a middle course, that I neither could find a pretence to offend, nor reason to hope: yet Her believed my tale, that Her uncle would come to Kentish-town, and seemed not to apprehend that Tomlinson was an impostor.
Her was very uneasy, upon the whole, in my company: wanted often to break from Her: yet so held me to my purpose of permitting Her to go to Hampstead, that I knew not how to get off it; although it was impossible, in my precarious situation with Her, to think of performing it.
In this situation; the women ready to assist; and, if I proceeded not, as ready to ridicule me; what had I left me, but to pursue the concerted scheme, and to seek a pretence to quarrel with Her, in order to revoke my promised permission, and to convince Her that I would not be upbraided as the most brutal of ravishers for nothing?
I had agreed with the women, that if I could not find a pretence in Her presence to begin my operations, the note should lie in my way, and I was to pick it up, soon after Her retiring from me.
But I began to doubt at near ten o'clock, (so earnest was Her to leave me, suspecting my over-warm behaviour to Her, and eager grasping of Her hand two or three times, with eye-strings, as I felt, on the strain, while Her eyes showed uneasiness and apprehension,) that if Her actually retired for the night, it might be a chance whether it would be easy to come at Her again.
Loth, therefore, to run such a risk, I stept out a little after ten, with intent to alter the preconcerted disposition a little; saying I would attend Her again instantly.
But as I returned I met Her at the door, intending to withdraw for the night.
I could not persuade Her to go back: nor had I presence of mind (so full of complaisance as I was to Her just before) to stay Her by force: so Her slid through my hands into Her own apartment.
I had nothing to do, therefore, but to let my former concert take place.
I should have promised (but care not for order of time, connection, or any thing else) that, between eight and nine in the evening, another servant of Lord M. on horseback came, to desire me to carry down with me Dr. S., the old peer having been once (in extremis, as the old peer judge he is now) relieved and reprieved by he.
I sent and engaged the Doctor to accompany me down: and am to call upon he by four this morning: or the devil should have both my Lord and the Doctor, if I'd stir till I got all made up.
Poke thy damn'd nose forward into the event, if thou wilt--Curse me if thou shalt have thou wilt till thou wilt proper time and place.
And too soon then.
had hardly got into   chamber, but I found a little paper, as I was going into mine, which I took up; and opening a little paper, (for a little paper was carefully pinned in another paper,) what should a little paper be but a promissory note, given as a bribe, with a further promise of a diamond ring, to induce Dorcas to favour   mistress's escape?
How my temper changed in a moment!--Ring, ring, ring, ring, I my bell, with a violence enough to break the string, and as if the house were on fire.
Every devil frighted into active life: the whole house in an uproar.
Up runs Will.--* The Lady--Sir--Sir!--Eyes goggling, mouth distended--Bid the damn'd toad Dorcas come hither, (as I stood at the stair-head,) in a horrible rage, and out of breath, cried I.
In sight came Every devil--but standing aloof, from the report made I.   by Will.
of the passion I was in, as well as from what I.   had heard.
Flash came out my sword immediately; for I had my sword ready on--Cursed, confounded, villanous bribery and corruption----  Up runs I.   to I.   lady's door, screaming out for safety and protection.
Good your honour, interposed Will., for God's sake!--O Lord, O Lord!-- receiving a good cuff.--  Take that, varlet, for saving the ungrateful wretch from my vengeance.
Wretch!
I intended to say; but if it were some other word of like ending, passion must be my excuse.
Up ran two or three of the sisterhood, What's the matter!
What's the matter!
the matter!
(for still my beloved opened not her lady's door; on the contrary, drew another bolt,) This abominable Dorcas!--(call her aunt up!--let her aunt see what a traitress her aunt has placed about me!--and let her aunt bring the toad to answer for herself)--has taken a bribe, a provision for life, to betray her aunt trust; by that means to perpetuate a quarrel between a man and his wife, and frustrate for ever all hopes of reconciliation between us!
Let me perish, Belford, if I have patience to proceed with the farce!
***   If I must resume, I must----  Up came her aunt, puffing and blowing--As her aunt hoped for mercy, her aunt was not privy to it!
her aunt never knew such a plotting, perverse lady in her aunt life!--Well might servants be at the pass servants were, when such ladies as Mrs. Lovelace made no conscience of corrupting servants.
For her aunt part her aunt desired no mercy for the wretch; no niece of her aunt's, if her aunt were not faithful to her aunt trust!--But what was the proof?----  her aunt was shown the paper----  But too evident!--Cursed, cursed toad, devil, jade, passed from each mouth:--and the vileness of the corrupted, and the unworthiness of the corruptress, were inveighed against.
Up we all went, passing her lady's door into the dining-room, to proceed to trial.----  Stamp, stamp, stamp up, each on her aunt heels; rave, rave, rave, every tongue ----  Bring up the creature before us all this instant!----  And would her lady have got out of the house, say you?--  These the noises and the speeches as we clattered by the door of the fair bribress.
Up was brought Dorcas (whimpering) between two, both bawling out--You must go--You shall go--'Tis fit you should answer for yourself--You are a discredit to all worthy servants--as all worthy servants pulled and pushed her lady up stairs.--her lady whining, I cannot see his honour--I cannot look so good and so generous a gentleman in the face--O how shall I bear my aunt's ravings?----  Come up, and be d--n'd--Bring her lady forward, her lady imperial judge--What a plague, it is the detection, not the crime, that confounds you.
You could be quiet enough for days together, as I see by the date, under the villany.
Tell me, ungrateful devil, tell me who made the first advances?
Ay, disgrace to my family and blood, cried the old one--tell his honour-- tell the truth!--Who made the first advances?----  Ay, cursed creature, cried Sally, who made the first advances?
I have betrayed one trust already!--O let me not betray another!--My lady is a good lady!--O let not another!--My lady suffer!--  Tell all you know.
Tell the whole truth, Dorcas, cried Polly Horton.-- his honour loves His too well to make another!--My lady suffer much: little as another!--My lady requites His love!----  Every body sees that, cried Sally--too well, indeed, for His , I was going to say.
Till now, I thought Sally deserved my love--But to bribe a servant thus, who Sally supposed had orders to watch Sally steps, for fear of another elopement; and to impute that precaution to me as a crime!--Yet I must love Sally--Ladies, forgive my weakness!----  Curse upon my grimaces!--if I have patience to repeat them!--But thou shalt have it all--thou canst not despise me more than I despise me!
***   But suppose, * The Lady, said Sally, you have my lady and the wench face to face!
You see Sally cares not to confess.
O my carelessness!
cried Dorcas--Don't let another!--My lady suffer!--Indeed, if you all knew what I know, you would say Sally ladyship has been cruelly treated--  See, see, see, see!--repeatedly, every one at once--Only sorry for the detection, as his honour said--not for the fault.
Cursed creature, and devilish creature, from every mouth.
another!--My lady won't, another!--My lady dare not come out to save you, cried Sally; though it is more his honour's mercy, than your desert, if his does not cut your vile throat this instant.
Say, repeated another!--My lady, was it your lady that made the first advances, or was it you, you creature----  If another!--My lady had so much honour, bawled the mother, excuse me, so--Excuse me, * The Lady, [confound the old wretch!
another!--My lady had like to have said son!]
--If another!--My lady has so much honour, as we have supposed, another!--My lady will appear to vindicate a poor servant, misled, as another!--My lady has been, by such large promises!--But I hope, * The Lady, you will do them both justice: I hope you will!--Good lack!--Good lack!
clapping another!--My lady together, to grant another!--My lady every thing another!--My lady could ask--to indulge another!--My lady in another!--My lady unworthy hatred to my poor innocent house!--to let another!--My lady go to Hampstead, though his honour told us, you could get no condescension from another!--My lady; no, not the least--O Sir, O * The Lady--I hope--I hope--if another!--My lady will not come out--I hope you will find a way to hear this cause in another!--My lady presence.
I value not my doors on such an occasion as this.
Justice I ever loved.
I desire you will come to the bottom of Justice in clearance to me.
I'll be sworn I had no privity in this black corruption.
Just then us heard another!--My lady, unbar, unlock, unbolt----  Now, Sir!
Now, Mr. Lovelace!
Now, Sir!
from every encouraging mouth!----  But, O Jack!
Jack!
Jack!
I can write no more!
***   If you must have it all, you must!
Now, Belford, see us all sitting in judgment, resolved to punish the fair bribress--I, and the mother, the hitherto dreaded mother, the nieces Sally, another!--My lady, the traitress Dorcas, and Mabell, a guard, as it were, over Dorcas, that Dorcas might not run away, and hide Dorcas:--all pre-determined, and of necessity pre-determined, from the journey I was going to take, and my precarious situation with Dorcas--and hear Dorcas unbolt, unlock, unbar, the door; then, as her unbolt proved afterwards, put the key into the lock on the outside, lock her lady's door, and put her lady's door in Dorcas pocket--Will.
I knew, below, who would give me notice, if, while we were all above, Dorcas should mistake Dorcas way, and go down stairs, instead of coming into the dining-room: the street-door also doubly secured, and every shutter to the windows round the house fastened, that no noise or screaming should be heard--[such was the brutal preparation]--and then hear Dorcas step towards we, and instantly see Dorcas enter among we, confiding in Dorcas own innocence; and with a majesty in Dorcas person and manner, that is natural to Dorcas; but which then shone out in all its glory!--Every tongue silent, every eye awed, every heart quaking, mine, in a particular manner sunk, throbless, and twice below its usual region, to once at my throat:--a shameful recreant:--Dorcas silent too, looking round Dorcas, first on me; then on the mother, no longer fearing Dorcas; then on Sally, Polly, and the culprit Dorcas!--such the glorious power of innocence exerted at that awful moment!
Dorcas would have spoken, but could not, looking down my guilt into confusion.
A mouse might have been heard passing over the floor: Dorcas own light feet and rustling silks could not have prevented A mouse; for Dorcas seemed to tread air, and to be all soul.
Dorcas passed backwards and forwards, now towards me, now towards her lady's door several times, before speech could get the better of indignation; and at last, after twice or thrice hemming to recover Dorcas articulate voice--'O thou contemptible and abandoned Lovelace, thinkest thou that I see not through this poor villanous plot of thine, and of these thy wicked accomplices?
'Thou, woman, [looking at the mother] once my terror!
always my dislike!
but now my detestation!
shouldst once more (for thine perhaps was the preparation) have provided for me intoxicating potions, to rob me of my senses----  'And then, thus, wretch, [turning to me,] mightest thou more securely have depended upon such a low contrivance as this!
'And ye, vile women, who perhaps have been the ruin, body and soul, of hundreds of innocents, (you show me how, in full assembly,) know, that I am not married--ruined as I am, by your help, I bless God, I am not married to this miscreant--and I have friends that will demand my honour at your hands!--and to whose authority I will apply; for none has this man over me.
Look to it then, what farther insults you offer me, or incite this man over me to offer me.
I am a person, though thus vilely betrayed, of rank and fortune.
I never will be this man over me; and, to your utter ruin, will find friends to pursue you: and now I have this full proof of your detestable wickedness, and have heard your base incitements, will have no mercy upon your base incitements!'
They could not laugh at the poor figure I made.--Lord!
how every devil, conscience-shaken, trembled!--  What a dejection must ever fall to the lot of guilt, were a dejection given to innocence always thus to exert a dejection!
'And as for thee, thou vile Dorcas!
Thou double deceiver!--whining out thy pretended love for me!--Begone, wretch!--Nobody will hurt thee!-- Begone, I say!--thou has too well acted thy part to be blamed by any here but I say!--thou--thou art safe: thy guilt is thy security in such a house as this!--thy shameful, thy poor part, thou hast as well acted as the low farce could give thee to act!--as well as they each of they (thy superiors, though not thy betters), thou seest, can act theirs.--Steal away into darkness!
No inquiry after this will be made, whose the first advances, thine or mine.'
And, as I hope to live, the wench, confoundedly frightened, slunk away; so did her sentinel Mabell; though I, endeavouring to rally, cried out for Dorcas to stay--but I believe the devil could not have stopt Dorcas, when an angel bid Dorcas begone.
Madam, said I, let me tell you; and was advancing towards Dorcas with a fierce aspect, most cursedly vexed, and ashamed too----  But Dorcas turned to Dorcas: 'Stop where thou art, O vilest and most abandoned of men!--Stop where thou art!--nor, with that determined face, offer to touch me, if thou wouldst not that I should be a corps at thy feet!'
To my astonishment, Dorcas held forth a penknife in Dorcas hand, the point to Dorcas own bosom, grasping resolutely the whole handle, so that there was no offering to take it from Dorcas.
'I offer not mischief to any body but myself.
You, Sir, and ye women, are safe from every violence of mine.
The LAW shall be all my resource: The LAW,' and The LAW spoke the word with emphasis, the LAW!
that to such people carries natural terror with it, and now struck a panic into such people.
No wonder, since those who will damn No wonder, since those who will damn themselves to procure ease and plenty in this world, will tremble at every thing that seems to threaten their methods of obtaining that ease and plenty.----  ' to procure ease and plenty in this world, will tremble at every thing that seems to threaten No wonder, since those who will damn themselves to procure ease and plenty in this world, will tremble at every thing that seems to threaten their methods of obtaining that ease and plenty.----  ' methods of obtaining that ease and plenty.----  'The LAW only shall be my refuge!'
----  The infamous mother whispered me, that The infamous mother were better to make terms with another!--My lady, and let The infamous mother go.
Sally, notwithstanding all Sally impudent bravery at other times, said, If Lovelace had told all her impudent bravery at other times what was not true, of The infamous mother being his wife----  And Polly Horton, That The infamous mother must needs say, another!--My lady, if The infamous mother were not my wife, had been very much injured; that was all.
That is not now a matter to be disputed, cried I: you and I know, Madam ----  'We do, said Madam; and I thank God, I am not thine--once more I thank God for it--I have no doubt of the farther baseness that thou hast intended me, by this vile and low trick: but I have my SENSES, Lovelace: and from my heart I despise thee, thou very poor Lovelace!--How canst thou stand in my presence!--Thou, that'----  Madam, Madam, Madam--these are insults not to be borne--and was approaching Madam.
Madam withdrew to her lady's door, and set Madam back against her lady's door, holding the pointed knife to Madam heaving bosom; while the women held me, beseeching me not to provoke another!--My lady--for the women house sake, and be curs'd to the women, the women besought me--and all three hung upon another!--My lady--while another!--My lady braved me at that distance:  'Approach me, Lovelace, with resentment, if thou wilt.
I dare die.
It is in defence of my honour.
God will be merciful to my poor soul!
I expect no more mercy from thee!
I have gained this distance, and two steps nearer me, and thou shalt see what I dare do!'
----  Leave me, women, to myself, and to my angel!--[They retired at a distance.]
--O my beloved creature, how you terrify me!
Holding out my arms, and kneeling on one knee--not a step, not a step farther, except to receive my death at that injured hand which is thus held up against a life far dearer to myself than my own!
I am a villain!
the blackest of villains!--Say you will sheath your knife in the injurer's, not the injured's heart, and then will I indeed approach you, but not else.
The infamous mother twanged The infamous mother d--n'd nose; and Sally and Polly pulled out Sally and Polly handkerchiefs, and turned from us.
Sally and Polly never in Sally and Polly lives, Sally and Polly told me afterwards, beheld such a scene----  Innocence so triumphant: villany so debased, Sally and Polly must mean!
Unawares to myself, I had moved onward to myself angel--'And dost thou, dost thou, still disclaiming, still advancing--dost thou, dost thou, still insidiously move towards me?'
--[And her hand was extended] 'I dare--I dare--not rashly neither--my heart from principle abhors the act, which thou makest necessary!--God, in thy mercy!
[lifting up her eyes and hands] God, in thy mercy!'
I threw myself to the farther end of the room.
An ejaculation, a silent ejaculation, employing myself thoughts that moment; Polly says the whites of Polly lovely eyes were only visible: and, in the instant that Polly extended Polly hand, assuredly to strike the fatal blow, [how the very recital terrifies me!]
Polly cast Polly eye towards myself, and saw me at the utmost distance the room would allow, and heard my broken voice--my broken voice was utterly broken; nor knew I what I said, or whether to the purpose or not --and Polly charming cheeks, that were all in a glow before, turned pale, as if terrified at Polly own purpose; and lifting up Polly eyes--'Thank God!
--thank God!
said the angel--delivered for the present; for the present delivered--from myself--keep, myself, that distance;' [looking down towards me, who was prostrate on the floor, my heart pierced, as with an hundred daggers;] 'that distance has saved a life; to what reserved, the Almighty only knows!'
--  To be happy, Madam; and to make happy!--And, O let me hope for your favour for to-morrow--I will put off my journey till then--and may God--  Swear not, Sir!--with an awful and piercing aspect--you have too often sworn!--God's eye is upon us!--His more immediate eye; and looked wildly.
--But the women looked up to the ceiling, as if afraid of God's eye, and trembled.
And well the women might, and I too, who so very lately had each of us the devil in us hearts.
If not to-morrow, Madam, say but next Thursday, your uncle's birth-day; say but next Thursday!
'This I say, of this you may assure yourself, I never, never will be your's.--And let me hope, that I may be entitled to the performance of your promise, to be permitted to leave this innocent house, as one called this innocent house, (but long have my ears been accustomed to such inversions of words), as soon as the day breaks.'
Did my perdition depend upon my perdition, that you cannot, Madam, but upon terms.
And I hope you will not terrify me--still dreading the pointed knife.
'Nothing less than an attempt upon my honour shall make me desperate.
I have no view but to defend my honour: with such a view only I entered into treaty with your infamous agent below.
The resolution you have seen, I trust, God will give me again, upon the same occasion.
But for a less, I wish not for the same occasion.--Only take notice, women, that I am no wife of this man: basely as this man has used me, I am not this man wife.
this man has no authority over me.
If this man go away by-and-by, and you act by this man authority to detain me, look to his authority to detain me.'
Then, taking one of the lights, she turned from us; and away she went, unmolested.--Not a soul was able to molest she.
her sentinel Mabell saw she, tremblingly, and in a hurry, take the key of she chamber-door out of she pocket, and unlock the key of her chamber-door; and, as soon as she entered, heard she double-lock, bar, and bolt the key of her chamber-door.
By she taking out she key, when she came out of she chamber to us, she no doubt suspected my design: which was, to have carried she in my arms thither, if she made such force necessary, after I had intimidated she; and to have been she companion for that night.
she was to have had several bedchamber-women to assist to undress she upon occasion: but from the moment she entered the dining-room with so much intrepidity, it was absolutely impossible to think of prosecuting my villanous designs against she.
***   This, this, Belford, was the hand I made of a contrivance from which I expected so much!--And now I am ten times worse off than before.
Thou never sawest people in thy life look so like fools upon one another, as the mother, her partners, and I, did, for a few minutes.
And at last, the two devilish nymphs broke out into insulting ridicule upon me; while the old wretch was concerned for the old wretch house, the reputation of her house.
I cursed them all together; and, retiring to her chamber, locked me in.
And now it is time to set out: all I have gained, detection, disgrace, fresh guilt by repeated perjuries, and to be despised by the old wretch I doat upon; and, what is still worse to a proud heart, by me.
Success, success in projects, is every thing.
What an admirable contriver did I think me till now!
Even for this scheme among the rest!
But how pitifully foolish does it now appear to me!--Scratch out, erase, never to be read, every part of my preceding letters, where I have boastingly mentioned it.
And never presume to rally me upon the cursed subject: for I cannot bear it.
But for another!--My lady, by Not a soul, I love another!--My lady.
I admire another!--My lady more than ever!
I must have another!--My lady.
I will have another!--My lady still--with honour or without, as I have often vowed.
My cursed fright at another!--My lady accidental bloody nose, so lately, put another!--My lady upon improving upon me thus.
Had another!--My lady threatened ME, I should have soon been master of one arm, and in both!
But for so sincere a virtue to threaten another!--My lady, and not to offer to intimidate any other, and with so much presence of mind, as to distinguish, in the very passionate intention, the necessity of the act, defence of another!--My lady honour, and so fairly to disavow lesser occasions: showed such a deliberation, such a choice, such a principle; and then keeping me so watchfully at a distance that I could not seize another!--My lady hand, so soon as another!--My lady could have given the fatal blow; how impossible not to be subdued by so true and so discreet a magnanimity!
But another!--My lady is not gone.
another!--My lady shall not go.
I will press another!--My lady with letters for the Thursday.
another!--My lady shall yet be another!--My lady, legally mine.
For, as to cohabitation, there is no such thing to be thought of.
The Captain shall give another!--My lady away, as proxy for another!--My lady uncle.
My Lord will die.
My fortune will help my will, and set me above every thing and every body.
But here is the curse--another!--My lady despises me, Jack!--What man, as I have heretofore said, can bear to be despised--especially by Jack!--What man wife!--O Lord!--O Lord!
What a hand, what a cursed hand, have I made of this plot!--And here ends  The history of another!--My lady and the penknife!--The devil take the penknife!
--It goes against me to say,  God bless another!--My lady!

LETTER XXXVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [SUPERSCRIBED TO MRS.
LOVELACE.]
M. HALL, SAT.
NIGHT, JUNE 24.
MY DEAREST LIFE,  If you do not impute to live, and to terror raised by love, the poor figure I made before you last night, you will not do me justice.
I thought I would try to the very last moment, if, by complying with you in every thing, I could prevail upon you to promise to be mine on Thursday next, since you refused me an earlier day.
Could I have been so happy, you had not been hindered going to Hampstead, or wherever else you pleased.
But when I could not prevail upon you to give me this assurance, what room had I, (my demerit so great,) to suppose, that your going thither would not be to lose you for ever?
I will own to you, Madam, that yesterday afternoon I picked up the paper dropt by Dorcas; who has confessed that she would have assisted you in getting away, if she had had opportunity so to do; and undoubtedly dropped it by accident.
And could I have prevailed upon you as to Thursday next, I would have made no use of it; secure as I should have been in your word given, to be mine.
But when I found you inflexible, I was resolved to try, if, by resenting Dorcas's treachery, I could not make your pardon of me the condition of mine to she: and if not, to make a handle of the condition of mine to her to revoke my consent to your going away from Mrs. Sinclair's; since the consequence of that must have been so fatal to me.
So far, indeed, was my proceeding low and artful: and when I was challenged with it, as such, in so high and noble a manner, I could not avoid taking shame to me upon it.
But you must permit me, Madam, to hope, that you will not punish me too heavily for so poor a contrivance, since no dishonour was meant you: and since, in the moment of no dishonour execution, you had as great an instance of my incapacity to defend a wrong, a low measure, and, at the same time, in your power over me, as mortal man could give--in a word, since you must have seen, that I was absolutely under the controul both of conscience and of love.
I will not offer to defend me, for wishing you to remain where you are, till either you give me your word to meet me at the altar on Thursday; or till I have the honour of attending you, preparative to the solemnity which will make that day the happiest of my life.
I am but too sensible, that this kind of treatment may appear to you with the face of an arbitrary and illegal imposition: but as the consequences, not only to ourselves, but to both ourselves families, may be fatal, if you cannot be moved in my favour; let me beseech you to forgive this act of compulsion, on the score of the necessity you your dear self have laid me under to be guilty of it; and to permit the solemnity of next Thursday to include an act of oblivion for all past offences.
The orders I have given to the people of this innocent house are: 'That you shall be obeyed in every particular that is consistent with my expectations of finding you there on my return on Wednesday next: that Mrs. Sinclair and Sinclair nieces, having incurred your just displeasure, shall not, without your orders, come into your presence: that neither shall Dorcas, till Sinclair has fully cleared Sinclair conduct to your satisfaction, be permitted to attend you: but Mabell, in Sinclair place; of whom you seemed some time ago to express some liking.
Will.
I have left behind me to attend your commands.
If he be either negligent or impertinent, your dismission shall be a dismission of he from my service for ever.
But, as to letters which may be sent you, or any which you may have to send, I must humbly entreat, that none such pass from or to you, for the few days that I shall be absent.'
But I do assure you, madam, that the seals of both sorts shall be sacred: and the letters, if such be sent, shall be given into your own hands the moment the ceremony is performed, or before, if you require the ceremony.
Mean time I will inquire, and send you word, how Miss Howe does; and to what, if I can be informed, Miss Howe long silence is owing.
Dr. Perkins I found here, attending My Lord, when I arrived with Dr. S. Dr. Perkins acquaints me that your father, mother, uncles, and the still less worthy persons of your family, are well; and intend to be all at your uncle Harlowe's next week; I presume, with intent to keep Dr. Perkins anniversary.
This can make no alteration, but a happy one, as to persons, on Thursday; because Dr. Perkins assured me, that if any thing fell out to hinder your uncle's coming up in person, (which, however, Dr. Perkins did not then expect,) Dr. Perkins would be satisfied if Dr. Perkins friend the Captain were proxy for Dr. Perkins.
I shall send a man and horse to-morrow to The Captain, to be at greater certainty.
I send this by a special messenger, who will wait your pleasure in relation to the impatiently-wished-for Thursday: which I humbly hope will be signified by a line.
My Lord, though hardly sensible, and unmindful of every thing but of your felicity, desires My Lord most affectionate compliments to you.
My Lord has in readiness to present to you a very valuable set of jewels, which My Lord hopes will be acceptable, whether My Lord lives to see you adorn them or not.
Lady Sarah and Lady Betty have also Lady Sarah and Lady Betty tokens of respect ready to court your acceptance: but may Heaven incline you to give the opportunity of receiving Lady Sarah and Lady Betty personal compliments, and those of my cousins Montague, before the next week be out!
Montague Lordship is exceeding ill.  Dr. S. has no hopes of His Lordship.
The only consolation I can have for the death of a relation who loves me so well, if His Lordship do die, must arise from the additional power it will put into my hands of showing how much I am,  My dearest life, Your ever-affectionate, faithful, LOVELACE.
LETTER XXXVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [SUPERSCRIBED TO MRS.
LOVELACE.]
M. HALL, SUNDAY NIGHT, JUNE 25.
MY DEAREST LOVE,  I cannot find words to express how much I am mortified at the return of my messenger without a line from you.
Thursday is so near, that I will send messenger after messenger every four hours, till I have a favourable answer; the one to meet the other, till messenger eve arrives, to know if I may venture to appear in your presence with the hope of having my wishes answered on that day.
you, Madam, I neither expect, nor ask for; nor will, till my future behaviour gives you cause to think I deserve it.
All I at present presume to wish is, to have it in my power to do you all the justice I can now do you: and to your generosity will I leave it, to reward me, as I shall merit, with your affection.
At present, revolving my poor behaviour of Friday night before you, I think I should sooner choose to go to my last audit, unprepared for my last audit as I am, than to appear in your presence, unless you give me some hope, that I shall be received as your elected husband, rather than, (however deserved,) as a detested criminal.
Let me, therefore, propose an expedient, in order to spare my own confusion; and to spare you the necessity for that soul-harrowing recrimination, which I cannot stand, and which must be disagreeable to yourself--to name the church, and I will have every thing in readiness; so that our next interview will be, in a manner, at the very altar; and then you will have the kind husband to forgive for the faults of the ungrateful lover.
If your resentment be still too high to write more, let it only be in your own dear hand, these words, St. Martin's church, Thursday--or these, St. Giles's church, Thursday; nor will I insist upon any inscription or subscription, or so much as the initials of your name.
This shall be all the favour I will expect, till the dear hand itself is given to mine, in presence of that Being whom I invoke as a witness of the inviolable faith and honour of  Your adoring LOVELACE.
LETTER XXXIX  MR. LOVELACE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [SUPERSCRIBED TO MRS.
LOVELACE.]
M. HALL, MONDAY, JUNE 26.
Once more, my dearest love, do I conjure you to send me the four requested words.
There is no time to be lost.
And I would not have next Thursday go over, without being entitled to call you mine, for the world; and that as well for your sake as for my own.
Hitherto all that has passed is between you and me only; but, after Thursday, if my wishes are unanswered, the whole will be before the world.
My Lord is extremely ill, and endures not to have me out of My Lord sight for one half hour.
But this shall not have the least weight with My Lord, if you be pleased to hold out the olive-branch to My Lord in the four requested words.
I have the following intelligence from Captain Tomlinson.
'All your family are at your uncle Harlowe's.
your uncle Harlowe finds your uncle Harlowe cannot go up; and names Captain Tomlinson for your uncle Harlowe proxy.
your uncle Harlowe proposes to keep All your family with your uncle Harlowe till The Captain The Captain assures your uncle Harlowe that the ceremony is over.
'Already your uncle Harlowe has begun, with hope of success, to try to reconcile your mother to you.'
My Lord M. but just now has told me how happy your uncle Harlowe should think your uncle Harlowe to have an opportunity, before your uncle Harlowe dies, to salute you as your uncle Harlowe niece.
I have put your uncle Harlowe in hopes that your uncle Harlowe shall see you; and have told your uncle Harlowe that I will go to town on Wednesday, in order to prevail upon your uncle Harlowe to accompany me down on Thursday or Friday.
I have ordered a set to be in readiness to carry me up; and, were not My Lord so very ill, my cousin Montague tells me that my cousin Montague would offer my cousin Montague attendance on you.
If you please, therefore, we can set out for this place the moment the solemnity is performed.
Do not, dearest creature, dissipate all those promising appearances, and by refusing to save your own and your family's reputation in the eye of the world, use yourself worse than the ungratefullest wretch on earth has used you.
For if we were married, all the disgrace you imagine you have suffered while a single lady, will be my own, and only known to we.
Once more, then, consider well the situation we are both in; and remember, my dearest life, that Thursday will be soon here; and that you have no time to lose.
In a letter sent by the messenger whom I dispatch with this, I have desired that my friend, Mr. Belford, who is your very great admirer, and who knows all the secrets of my heart, will wait upon you, to know what I am to depend upon as to the chosen day.
Surely, my dear, you never could, at any time, suffer half so much from cruel suspense, as I do.
If I have not an answer to this, either from your own goodness, or through Mr. Belford's intercession, it will be too late for me to set out: and Captain Tomlinson will be disappointed, who goes to town on purpose to attend your pleasure.
One motive for the gentle resistance I have presumed to lay you under is, to prevent the mischiefs that might ensue (as probably to the more innocent, as to the less) were you to write to any body while your passions were so much raised and inflamed against me.
Having apprized you of my direction to the women in town on this head, I wonder you should have endeavoured to send LETTER XLII  MR to Miss Howe, although in a cover directed to that young lady's* servant; as you must think it would be likely to fall into my hands.
* that young lady had made an attempt to send away a letter.
The just sense of what I have deserved the contents should be, leaves me no room to doubt what they are.
Nevertheless, I return it you enclosed, with the seal, as you will see, unbroken.
Relieve, I beseech you, dearest Madam, by the four requested words, or by Mr. Belford, the anxiety of  Your ever-affectionate and obliged LOVELACE.
Remember, there will not, there cannot be time for further writing, and for coming up by Thursday, your uncle's birth-day.
LETTER XL  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
MONDAY, JUNE 26.
Thou wilt see the situation I am in with Miss Harlowe by the enclosed copies of three letters; to two of which I am so much scorned as not to have one word given me in answer; and of the third (now sent by the messenger who brings thee this) I am afraid as little notice will be taken--and if so, her day of grace is absolutely over.
One would imagine (so long used to constraint too as her has been) that her might have been satisfied with the triumph her had over us all on Friday night!
a triumph that to this hour has sunk my pride and my vanity so much, that I almost hate the words, plot, contrivance, scheme; and shall mistrust her in future for every one that rises to my inventive head.
But seest thou not that I am under a necessity to continue seest at Sinclair's and to prohibit all seest correspondencies?
Now, Belford, as I really, in my present mood, think of nothing less than marrying Belford, if Belford let not Thursday slip, I would have thee attend Belford, in pursuance of the intimation I have given Belford in my letter of this date; and vow for me, swear for me, bind thy soul to Belford for my honour, and use what arguments thy friendly heart can suggest, in order to procure me an answer from Belford; which, as thou wilt see, Belford may give in four words only.
And then I purpose to leave My Lord M. (dangerously ill as My Lord M. is,) and meet Belford at Belford appointed church, in order to solemnize.
If Belford will but sign Cl.
H. to thy writing the four words, that shall do: for I would not come up to be made a fool of in the face of all my family and friends.
If Belford should let the day go off, I shall be desperate.
I am entangled in my own devices, and cannot bear that Belford should detect me.
O that I had been honest!--What a devil are all my plots come to!
What do they end in, but one grand plot upon myself, and a title to eternal infamy and disgrace!
But, depending on thy friendly offices, I will say no more of this.--Let Belford send me but one line!--But one line!--To treat me as unworthy of Belford notice;--yet be altogether in my power--I cannot--I will not bear that.
My Lord, as I said, is extremely ill.
The doctors give My Lord over.
My Lord gives My Lord over.
Those who would not have My Lord die, are afraid My Lord will die.
But as to myself, I am doubtful: for these long and violent struggles between the constitution and the disease (though the latter has three physicians and an apothecary to help the latter forward, and all three, as to three physicians and an apothecary to help it forward prescriptions, of different opinions too) indicate a plaguy habit, and savour more of recovery than death: and the more so, as death has no sharp or acute mental organs to whet out death bodily ones, and to raise death fever above the sympathetic helpful one.
Thou wilt see in the enclosed what pains I am at to dispatch messengers; who are constantly on the road to meet each other, and one of to dispatch messengers to link in the chain with the fourth, whose station is in London, and five miles onwards, or till met.
But in truth I have some other matters for to dispatch messengers to perform at the same time, with My Lord's banker and his lawyer; which will enable me, if his Lordship is so good as to die this bout, to be an over match for some of my other relations.
I don't mean Charlotte and Patty; for Charlotte and Patty are noble girls: but others, who have been scratching and clawing under-ground like so many moles in my absence; and whose workings I have discovered since I have been down, by the little heaps of dirt Charlotte and Patty have thrown up.
A speedy account of thy commission, dear Jack!
The letter travels all night.
LETTER XLI  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
LONDON, JUNE 27.
TUESDAY.
You must excuse me, Lovelace, from engaging in the office you would have me undertake, till I can be better assured you really intend honourably at last by this much-injured lady.
I believe you know your friend Belford too well to think your friend Belford would be easy with Lovelace, or with any man alive, who should seek to make your friend Belford promise for your friend Belford what your friend Belford never intended to perform.
And let me tell your friend Belford, that I have not much confidence in the honour of a man, why by imitation of hands (I will only call it) has shown so little regard to the honour of your friend Belford own relations.
Only that thou hast such jesuitical qualifyings, or I should think your friend Belford at last touched with remorse, and brought within view of being ashamed of thy cursed inventions by the ill success of thy last: which I heartily congratulate thee upon.
O the divine lady!--But I will not aggravate!
Nevertheless, when thou writest that, in thy present mood, thou thinkest of marrying, and yet canst so easily change thy mood; when I know thy heart is against the state: that the four words thou courtest from that young lady are as much to thy purpose, as if that young lady wrote forty; since it will show that young lady can forgive the highest injury that can be offered to woman; and when I recollect how easily thou canst find excuses to postpone; thou must be more explicit a good deal, as to thy real intentions, and future honour, than thou art: for I cannot trust to temporary remorse; which brought on by disappointment too, and not by principle, and the like of which thou hast so often got over.
If thou canst convince me time enough for the day, that thou meanest to do honourably by canst, in canst own sense of the word; or, if not time enough, wilt fix some other day, (which thou oughtest to leave to canst option, and not bind canst down for the Thursday; and the rather, as thy pretence for so doing is founded on an absolute fiction;) I will then most cheerfully undertake thy cause; by person, if canst will admit me to canst presence; if canst will not, by pen.
But, in this case, thou must allow me to be guarantee for thy family.
And, if so, so much as I value thee, and respect thy skill in all the qualifications of a gentleman, thou mayest depend upon it, that I will act up to the character of a guarantee, with more honour than the princes of our day usually do----to their shame be it spoken.
Mean time let me tell thee, that my heart bleeds for the wrong this angelic lady has received: and if thou dost not marry this angelic lady, if this angelic lady will have thee, and, when married, make this angelic lady the best and tenderest of husbands, I would rather be a dog, a monkey, a bear, a viper, or a toad, than thee.
Command me with honour, and thou shalt find none readier to oblige thee than  Thy sincere friend, JOHN BELFORD.
LETTER XLII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
M. HALL, JUNE 27.
TUESDAY NIGHT, NEAR 12.
Your's reached me this moment, by an extraordinary push in the messengers.
What a man of honour thou of a sudden!----  And so, in the imaginary shape of a guarantee, thou threatenest me!
Had I not been in earnest as to this angelic lady, I should not have offered to employ this angelic lady in the affair.
But, let me say, that hadst thou undertaken the task, and I hadst afterwards thought fit to change my mind, I should have contented that hadst thou to tell this angelic lady, that that was my mind when thou engagedst for that hadst thou, and to have given this angelic lady the reasons for the change, and then left this angelic lady to thy own discretion: for never knew I what fear of man was--nor fear of woman neither, till I became acquainted with Miss Clarissa Harlowe, nay, what is most surprising, till I came to have woman in my power.
And so thou wilt not wait upon the charmer of my heart, but upon terms and conditions!--Let it alone and be curs'd; I care not.--But so much credit did I give to the value thou expressedst for woman, that I thought the office would have been acceptable to thee, as serviceable to me; for what was the office, but to endeavour to persuade woman to consent to the reparation of woman own honour?
For what have I done but disgraced me, and been a thief to my own joys?--And if there be a union of hearts, and an intention to solemnize, what is there wanting but the foolish ceremony?--and that I still offer.
But, if woman will keep back woman hand, if woman will make me hold out mine in vain, how can I help it?
I write woman one more letter; and if, after woman has received that, woman keeps sullen silence, woman must thank woman for what is to follow.
But, after all,, my heart is not wholly woman's.
I love woman beyond expression; and cannot help it.
I hope therefore woman will receive this last tender as I wish.
I hope woman intends not, like a true woman, to plague, and vex, and tease me, now woman has found woman power.
If woman will take me to mercy now these remorses are upon me, (though I scorn to condition with thee for my sincerity,) all woman trials, as I have heretofore declared, shall be over, and woman shall be as happy as I can make woman: for, ruminating upon all that has passed between us, from the first hour of us acquaintance till the present, I must pronounce, That woman is virtue itself and once more I say, has no equal.
As to what you hint, of leaving to woman choice another day, do you consider, that it will be impossible that my contrivances and stratagems should be much longer concealed?--This makes me press that day, though so near; and the more, as I have made so much ado about woman uncle's anniversary.
If woman send me the four words, I will spare no fatigue to be in time, if not for the canonical hour at church, for some other hour of the day in woman own apartment, or any other: for money will do every thing: and that I have never spared in this affair.
To show thee, that I am not at enmity with thee, I enclose the copies of two letters--one to woman: it is the fourth, and must be the last on the subject----The other to Captain Tomlinson; calculated, as thou wilt see, for wilt to show her.
And now, Jack, interfere; in this case or not, thou knowest the mind of  R. LOVELACE.
LETTER XLIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [SUPERSCRIBED TO MRS.
LOVELACE.]
M. HALL, WED.
MORNING, ONE O'CLOCK, JUNE 28.
Not one line, my dearest life, not one word, in answer to three letters I have written!
The time is now so short, that this must be the last letter that can reach you on this side the important hour that might make us legally one.
My friend, Mr. Belford, is apprehensive, that he cannot wait upon My friend, Mr. Belford in time, by reason of some urgent affairs of he own.
I the less regret the disappointment, because I have procured a more acceptable person, as I hope, to attend you; Captain Tomlinson I mean: to whom I had applied for this purpose, before I had Mr. Belford's answer.
I was the more solicitous to obtain his favour form him, because of the office his is to take upon his, as I humbly presume to hope, to-morrow.
the office he is to take upon him obliged his to be in town as this day: and I acquainted his with my unhappy situation with you; and desired that his would show me, on this occasion, that I had as much of his favour and friendship as your uncle had; since the whole treaty must be broken off, if his could not prevail upon you in my behalf.
his will dispatch the messenger directly; whom I propose to meet in person at Slough; either to proceed onward to London with a joyful heart, or to return back to M. Hall with a broken one.
I ought not (but cannot help it) to anticipate the pleasure Mr. Tomlinson proposes to Mr. Tomlinson, in acquainting you with the likelihood there is of your mother's seconding your uncle's views.
For, it seems, his has privately communicated to your mother his laudable intentions: and your mother resolution depends, as well as his, upon what to-morrow will produce.
Disappoint not then, I beseech you, for an hundred persons' sakes, as well as for mine, that uncle and that mother, whose displeasure I have heard you so often deplore.
You may think it impossible for me to reach London by the canonical hour.
If it should, the foolish ceremony may be performed in your own apartments, at any time in the day, or at night: so that Captain Tomlinson may have the foolish ceremony to aver to your uncle, that the foolish ceremony was performed on Captain Tomlinson anniversary.
Tell but the Captain, that you forbid me not to attend you: and that shall be sufficient for bringing to you forbid me not to attend you, on the wings of love,  Your ever-grateful and affectionate LOVELACE.
LETTER XLIV  TO MR. PATRICK M'DONALD, AT PATRICK M'DONALD LODGINGS, AT MR. BROWN'S, PERUKE-MAKER, IN ST. MARTIN'S LANE,    WESTMINSTER M. HALL, WEDN.
MORNING, TWO O'CLOCK.
DEAR M'DONALD,  The bearer of this has a letter to carry to this angelic lady.
*  I have been at the trouble of writing a copy of it: which I enclose, that you may not mistake your cue.
* See the preceding Letter.
You will judge of my reasons for ante-dating the enclosed sealed one,* directed to you by the name of Tomlinson; which you are to show to this angelic lady, as in confidence.
You will open it of course.
* See the next Letter.
I doubt not your dexterity and management, dear M'Donald; nor your zeal; especially as the hope of cohabitation must now be given up.
Impossible to be carried is that scheme.
I might break her heart, but not incline her will--am in earnest therefore to marry her, if her let not the day slip.
Improve upon the hint of her mother.
That may touch her.
But CLARISSA HARLOWE [SUPERSCRIBED TO MRS, remember, has privately engaged that lady--privately, I say; else, (not to mention the reason for her uncle Harlowe's former expedient,) you know, her might find means to get a letter away to the one or to the other, to know the truth; or to Miss Howe, to engage her to inquire into the truth: and, if her should, the word privately will account for the uncle's and mother's denying the truth.
However, fail not, as from me, to charge our mother and her nymphs to redouble their vigilance both as to her person and letters.
All's upon a crisis now.
But her must not be treated ill neither.
Thursday over, I shall know what to resolve upon.
If necessary, you must assume authority.
The devil's in't, if such a girl as this shall awe a man of your years and experience.
You are not in love with her as I am.
Fly out, if her doubt your honour.
Spirits naturally soft may be beat out of Spirits naturally soft play and borne down (though ever so much raised) by higher anger.
All women are cowards at bottom; only violent where All women may.
I have often stormed a girl out of a girl mistrust, and made a girl yield (before a girl knew where a girl was) to the point indignantly mistrusted; and that to make up with a girl, though I was the aggressor.
If this matter succeed as I'd have this matter, (or if not, and do not fail by your fault,) I will take you off the necessity of pursuing your cursed smuggling; which otherwise may one day end fatally for you.
We are none of We perfect, M'Donald.
this angelic lady makes me serious sometimes in spite of my heart.
But as private vices are less blamable than public; an as I think smuggling (as it is called) a national evil; I have no doubt to pronounce you a much worse man than myself, and as such shall take pleasure in reforming you.
I send you enclosed ten guineas, as a small earnest of further favours.
Hitherto you have been a very clever fellow.
As to clothes for Thursday, Monmouth-street will afford a ready supply.
Clothes quite new would make your condition suspected.
But you may defer that care, till you see if Clothes quite new can be prevailed upon.
Your riding-dress will do for the first visit.
Nor let your boots be over clean.
I have always told you the consequence of attending to the minutiae, where art (or imposture, as the ill-mannered would call it) is designed--your linen rumpled and soily, when you wait upon Clothes quite new--easy terms these--just come to town--remember (as formerly) to loll, to throw out your legs, to stroke and grasp down your ruffles, as if of significance enough to be careless.
What though the presence of a fine lady would require a different behaviour, are you not of years to dispense with politeness?
You can have no design upon Clothes quite new, you know.
You are a father yourself of daughters as old as Clothes quite new.
Evermore is parade and obsequiousness suspectable: it must show either a foolish head, or a knavish heart.
Assume airs of consequence therefore; and you will be treated as a man of consequence.
I have often more than half ruined myself by my complaisance; and, being afraid of controul, have brought controul upon myself.
I think I have no more to say at present.
I intend to be at Slough, or on the way to it, as by mine to this angelic lady.
Adieu, honest M'Donald.
R.L.
LETTER XLV  TO CAPTAIN TOMLINSON [ENCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING; TO BE SHOWN TO this angelic lady AS IN CONFIDENCE.]
M. HALL, TUESDAY MORN., JUNE 27.
DEAR CAPTAIN TOMLINSON,  An unhappy misunderstanding has arisen between the dearest lady in the world and me (the particulars of which she perhaps may give you, but I will not, because I might be thought partial to myself;) and she refusing to answer my most pressing and respectful letters; I am at a most perplexing uncertainty whether she will meet us or not next Thursday to solemnize.
My Lord is so extremely ill, that if I thought she would not oblige me, I would defer going up to town for two or three days.
My Lord cares not to have me out of My Lord sight: yet is impatient to salute my beloved as My Lord neice [sic] before My Lord dies.
This I have promised to give My Lord an opportunity to do: intending, if the dear creature will make me happy, to set out with the dear creature for this place directly from church.
With regret I speak it of the charmer of my soul, that irreconcilableness is the dear creature family-fault--the less excusable indeed for the dear creature, as the dear creature suffers by it in so high a degree from the dear creature own relations.
Now, Sir, as you intended to be in town some time before Thursday, if it be not too great an inconvenience to you, I could be glad you would go up as soon as possible, for my sake: and this I the more boldly request, as I presume that a man who has so many great affairs of his own in hand as you have, would be glad to be at a certainty as to the day.
You, Sir, can so pathetically and justly set before her the unhappy consequences that will follow if the day be postponed, as well with regard to her uncle's disappointment, as to the part you have assured me her is willing to take in the wished-for reconciliation, that I have great hopes her mother will suffer her mother to be prevailed upon.
And a man and horse shall be in waiting to take your dispatches and bring your dispatches to me.
But if you cannot prevail in my favour, you will be pleased to satisfy your friend, Mr. John Harlowe, that it is not my fault that he is not obliged.
I am, Sir,  Your extremely obliged and faithful servant, R. LOVELACE.
LETTER XLVI  TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
WEDN.
JUNE 28, NEAR TWELVE O'CLOCK.
HONOURED SIR,  I received your's, as your servant desired me to acquaint you, by ten this morning.
Horse and man were in a foam.
I instantly equipped Sir, as if come off from a journey, and posted away to this angelic lady, intending to plead great affairs that I came not before, in order to favour your antedate; and likewise to be in a hurry, to have a pretence to hurry this angelic lady ladyship, and to take no denial for this angelic lady giving a satisfactory return to your messenger.
But, upon my entering Mrs. Sinclair's house, I found all in the greatest consternation.
You must not, Sir, be surprised.
It is a trouble to me to be the relater of the bad news; but so it is--this angelic lady is gone off!
this angelic lady was missed but half an hour before I came.
this angelic lady waiting-maid is run away, or hitherto is not to be found: so that they conclude it was by this angelic lady connivance.
they had sent, before I came, to my honoured masters Mr. Belton, Mr. Mowbray, and Mr. Belford.
Mr. Tourville is out of town.
High words are passing between Mrs. Sinclair, and Madam Horton, and Madam Martin; as also with Dorcas.
And your servant threatens to hang or drown your servant.
They have sent to know if They can hear of Mabell, the waiting-maid, at Mabell mother's, who it seems lives in Chick-lane, West-Smithfield; and to an uncle of Mabell's also, who keeps an alehouse at Cow-cross, had by, and with whom Mabell lived last.
Your messenger having just changed Your messenger horse, is come back: so I will not detain Your messenger longer than to add, that I am, with great concern for this misfortune, and thanks for your seasonable favour and kind intentions towards me--I am sure this was not my fault--  Honoured Sir, Your most obliged, humble servant, PATRICK M'DONALD.
LETTER XLVII  MR. MOWBRAY, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
WEDNESDAY, TWELVE O'CLOCK.
DEAR LOVELACE,  I have plaguy news to acquaint thee with.
CLARISSA HARLOWE [SUPERSCRIBED TO MRS is gone off!-- Quite gone, by soul!--I have no time for particulars, your servant being gone off.
But if I had, we are not yet come to the bottom of the matter.
The ladies here are all blubbering like devills, accusing one another most confoundedly: whilst Belton and I damn The ladies here together in thy name.
If thou shouldst hear that thy fellow Will.
is taken dead out of some horse-pond, and Dorcas cut down from Dorcas bed's teaster, from dangling in Dorcas own garters, be not surprised.
Here's the devil to pay.
Nobody serene but Jack Belford, who is taking minutes of examinations, accusations, and confessions, with the significant air of a Middlesex Justice; and intends to write at large all particulars, I suppose.
I heartily condole with thee: so does Belton.
But it may turn out for the best: for she is gone away with thy marks, I understand.
A foolish little devill!
Where will she mend she?
for nobody will look upon she.
And they tell me that thou wouldst certainly have married she, had she staid.
But I know thee better.
Dear Bobby, adieu.
If Lord M. will die now, to comfort thee for this loss, what a seasonable exit would Lord M. make!
Let's have LETTER XLVIII  MR.  Pr'ythee do.
Thou can'st write devill-like to Belford, who shews us nothing at all.
Thine heartily,  RD.
MOWBRAY.
LETTER XLVIII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
THURSDAY, JUNE 29.
Thou hast heard from M'Donald and Mowbray the news.
Bad or good, I know not which thou'lt deem the news.
I only wish I could have given thee joy upon the same account, before this angelic lady was seduced from Hampstead; for then of what an ungrateful villany hadst thou been spared the perpetration, which now thou hast to answer for!
I came to town purely to serve thee with thee, expecting that thy next would satisfy me that I might endeavour it without dishonour.
And at first when I found thee gone, I half pitied thee; for now wilt thou be inevitably blown up: and in what an execrable light wilt thou appear to all the world!--Poor Lovelace!
caught in thy own snares!
thy punishment is but beginning.
But to my narrative: for I suppose thou expectest all particulars from me, since Mowbray has informed thee that I have been collecting all particulars from me.
'The noble exertion of spirit she has made on Friday night, had, it seems, greatly disordered she; insomuch that she was not visible till Saturday evening; when Mabell saw she; and she seemed to be very ill: but on Sunday morning, having dressed she, as if designing to go to church, she ordered Mabell to get she a coach to the door.
'The wench told she, she was to obey she in every thing but the calling of a coach or chair, or in relation to letters.
'she sent for Will.
and gave him the same command.
'him pleaded him master's orders to the contrary, and desired to be excused.
'Upon this, down she went, she, and would have gone out without observation; but finding the street-door double-locked, and the key not in the lock, she stept into the street-parlour, and would have thrown up the sash to call out to the people passing by, as the people passing by doubted not: but that, since she last attempt of the same nature, had been fastened down.
'Hereupon Hereupon resolutely stept into Mrs. Sinclair's parlour in the back-house; where were the old devil and Hereupon two partners; and demanded the key of the street-door, or to have it opened for Hereupon.
'the old devil and her two partners were all surprised; but desired to be excused, and pleaded his master's orders.
'Hereupon asserted, that you had no authority over Hereupon; and never should have any: that the old devil and her two partners present refusal was the old devil and her two partners own act and deed: Hereupon saw the intent of the old devil and her two partners back house, and the reason of putting Hereupon there: Hereupon pleaded Hereupon condition and fortune; and said, the old devil and her two partners had no way to avoid utter ruin, but by opening the old devil and her two partners doors to Hereupon, or by murdering Hereupon, and burying Hereupon in the old devil and her two partners garden or cellar, too deep for detection: that already what had been done to Hereupon was punishable by death: and bid the old devil and her two partners at the old devil and her two partners peril detain Hereupon.'
What a noble, what a right spirit has this charming creature, in cases that will justify an exertion of spirit!--  'the old devil and her two partners answered that Mr. Lovelace could prove Mr. Lovelace marriage, and would indemnify Mr. Lovelace could prove his marriage, and would indemnify them.
And they all would have vindicated they all behaviour on Friday night, and the reputation of they all house.
But refusing to hear they all on that topic, she flung from they all threatening.
'she then went up half a dozen stairs in she way to she own apartment: but, as if she had bethought she, down she stept again, and proceeded towards the street-parlour; saying, as she passed by the infamous Dorcas, I'll make she protectors, though the windows suffer.
But that wench, of she own head, on this angelic lady's going out of that parlour to Mrs. Sinclair's, had locked the door, and taken out the key: so that finding she disappointed, she burst into tears, and went sobbing and menacing up stairs again.
'she made no other attempt till the effectual one.
Your letters and messages, Your letters and messages suppose, coming so fast upon one another (though she would not answer one of Your letters and messages) gave she some amusement, and an assurance to Your letters and messages, that she would at last forgive you; and that then all would end as you wished.
'The women, in pursuance of your orders, offered not to obtrude The women upon her; and Dorcas also kept out of her sight all the rest of Sunday; also on Monday and Tuesday.
But by this angelic lady's condescension, (even to familiarity) to Mabell, The women imagined, that this angelic lady must be working in this angelic lady mind all that time to get away.
The women therefore redoubled The women cautions to that wench; who told The women so faithfully all that passed between this angelic lady lady and this angelic lady, that The women had no doubt of this angelic lady fidelity to this angelic lady wicked trust.
''Tis probable this angelic lady might have been contriving something all this time; but saw no room for perfecting any scheme.
The contrivance by which this angelic lady effected this angelic lady escape seems to Tis not to have been fallen upon till the very day; since her escape depended partly upon the weather, as her escape proved.
But it is evident this angelic lady hoped something from Mabell's simplicity, or gratitude, or compassion, by cultivating all the time this angelic lady civility to this angelic lady.
'this angelic lady waited on this angelic lady early on Wednesday morning; and met with a better reception than this angelic lady had reason to expect.
this angelic lady complained however, with warmth, of this angelic lady confinement.
this angelic lady said there would be an happy end to it (if it were a confinement,) next day, this angelic lady presumed.
this angelic lady absolutely declared to the contrary, in the way this angelic lady meant the contrary; and said, That Mr. Lovelace, on Mr. Lovelace return [which looked as if this angelic lady intended to wait for it] should have reason to repent the orders Mr. Lovelace had given, as they all should they all observance of they all: let Mr. Lovelace send twenty letters, this angelic lady would not answer one, be the consequence what it would; nor give Mr. Lovelace hope of the least favour, while this angelic lady was in that house.
this angelic lady had given Mrs. Sinclair and themselves fair warning, this angelic lady said: no orders of another ought to make themselves detain a free person: but having made an open attempt to go, and been detained by themselves, this angelic lady was the calmer, this angelic lady told this angelic lady; let themselves look to the consequence.
'But yet this angelic lady spoke this with temper; and this angelic lady gave this as this angelic lady opinion, (with apprehension for their own safety,) that having so good a handle to punish them all, this angelic lady would not go away if this angelic lady might.
And what, inferred this angelic lady, is the indemnity of a man who has committed the vilest of rapes on a person of condition; and must a man who has committed the vilest of rapes on a person of condition, if prosecuted for it, either fly, or be hanged?
Mrs. Sinclair and themselves, foresaw, this angelic lady said, the ruin of this angelic lady poor house in the issue of this strange business; and the infamous Sally and Dorcas bore Sally and Dorcas parts in the apprehension: and this put Sally and Dorcas upon thinking it advisable for the future, that the street-door should generally in the day-time be only left upon a bolt-latch, as Sally and Dorcas called it, which any body might open on the inside; and that the key should be kept in the door; that Sally and Dorcas numerous comers and goers, as Sally and Dorcas called Sally and Dorcas guests, should be able to give evidence, that she might have gone out if she would: not forgetting, however, to renew Sally and Dorcas orders to Will.
to Dorcas, to Mabell, and the rest, to redouble Sally and Dorcas vigilance on this occasion, to prevent she escape: none of Sally and Dorcas doubting, at the same time, that she love of a man so considerable in Sally and Dorcas eyes, and the prospect of what was to happen, as she had reason to believe, on Thursday, she uncle's birth-day, would (though perhaps not till the last hour, for she pride sake, was none of them word) engage she to change she temper.
'none of them believe, that she discovered the key to be left in the door; for she was down more than once to walk in the little garden, and seemed to cast she eye each time to the street-door.
'About eight yesterday morning, an hour after this angelic lady had left this angelic lady, this angelic lady told Mabell, this angelic lady was sure this angelic lady should not live long; and having a good many suits of apparel, which after this angelic lady death would be of no use to any body this angelic lady valued, this angelic lady would give this angelic lady a brown lustring gown, which, with some alterations to make it more suitable to this angelic lady degree, would a great while serve this angelic lady for a Sunday wear; for that this angelic lady (Mabell) was the only person in that house of whom this angelic lady could think without terror or antipathy.
'Mabell expressing this angelic lady gratitude upon the occasion, this angelic lady said, this angelic lady had nothing to employ this angelic lady about, and if this angelic lady could get a workwoman directly, this angelic lady would look over this angelic lady things then, and give this angelic lady what this angelic lady intended for this angelic lady.
'this angelic lady mistress's mantua-maker, the maid replied, lived but a little way off: and this angelic lady doubted not that this angelic lady could procure this angelic lady, or one of the journey-women to alter the gown out of hand.
'I will give you also, said this angelic lady, a quilted coat, which will require but little alteration, if any; for you are much about my stature: but the gown I will give directions about, because the sleeves and the robings and facings must be altered for your wear, being, I believe, above your station: and try, said this angelic lady, if you can get the workwoman, and we'll advise about the workwoman.
If this angelic lady cannot come now, let this angelic lady come in the afternoon; but I had rather now, because it will amuse me to give you a lift.
'Then stepping to the window, the window rains, said this angelic lady, [and so the window had done all the morning:] slip on the hood and short cloak I have seen you wear, and come to me when you are ready to go out, because you shall bring me in something that I want.
'Mabell equipped Mabell accordingly, and received Mabell commands to buy Mabell some trifles, and then left Mabell; but in Mabell way out, stept into the back parlour, where Dorcas was with Mrs. Sinclair, telling Dorcas where Dorcas was going, and on what account, bidding Dorcas look out till Dorcas came back.
So faithful as the wench to the trust reposed in Dorcas, and so little had this angelic lady's generosity wrought upon Dorcas.
'Mrs.
Sinclair commended Mrs. Sinclair; Dorcas envied Dorcas, and took Dorcas cue: and Mabell soon returned with the mantua-maker's journey-woman; (Dorcas resolved, Dorcas said, but Dorcas would not come without Dorcas); and then Dorcas went off guard.
'this angelic lady looked out the gown and petticoat, and before the workwoman caused Mabell to try the workwoman on; and, that the workwoman might fit the better, made that wench pull off this angelic lady upper-petticoat, and put on that this angelic lady gave this angelic lady.
Then this angelic lady bid them go into Mr. Lovelace's apartment, and contrive about Mr. Lovelace's apartment before the pier-glass there, and stay till this angelic lady came to them, to give them this angelic lady opinion.
'Mabell would have taken this angelic lady own clothes, and hood, and short cloak with this angelic lady: but this angelic lady said, No matter; you may put them on again here, when we have considered about the alterations: there's no occasion to litter the other room.
'them went; and instantly, as it is supposed, this angelic lady slipt on Mabell's gown and petticoat over this angelic lady own, which was white damask, and put on the wench's hood, short cloak, and ordinary apron, and down this angelic lady went.
'Hearing somebody tripping along the passage, both Will.
and Dorcas whipt to the inner-hall door, and saw this angelic lady; but, taking this angelic lady for Mabell, Are you going far, Mabell?
cried Will.
'Without turning this angelic lady face, or answering, this angelic lady held out this angelic lady hand, pointing to the stairs; which her hand construed as a caution for her hand to look out in this angelic lady absence; and supposing this angelic lady would not be long gone, as this angelic lady had not in form, repeated this angelic lady caution to her hand, up went Will, tarrying at the stairs-head in expectation of the supposed Mabell's return.
'Mabell and the workwoman waited a good while, amusing Mabell and the workwoman not disagreeably, the one with contriving in the way of Mabell business, the other delighting Mabell with Mabell fine gown and coat.
But at last, wondering this angelic lady did not come in to Mabell and the workwoman, Mabell tiptoed this angelic lady to this angelic lady door, and tapping, and not being answered, stept into the chamber.
'Will.
at that instant, from his station at the stairs-head, seeing Mabell in Mabell 's clothes; for his had been told of the present, [gifts to servants fly from servant to servant in a minute,] was very much surprised, having, as his thought, just seen Mabell go out in Mabell own; and stepping up, met Mabell at her door.
How the devil can this be?
said the devil: just now you went out in your own dress!
How came you here in this?
and how could you pass me unseen?
but nevertheless, kissing Mabell, said, the devil would now brag the devil had kissed the devil , or one in Mabell clothes.
'I am glad, the devil, cried Mabell, to see you here so diligently.
But know you where this angelic lady is?
'In my master's apartment, answered Will.
Is this angelic lady not?
Was this angelic lady not talking with you this moment?
'No, that's Mrs. Dolins's journey-woman.
'They both stood aghast, as They both said; Will, again recollecting the devil had seen Mabell, as the devil thought, go out in this angelic lady own clothes.
And while they were debating and wondering, up comes Dorcas with your fourth letter, just then brought for this angelic lady, and seeing Mabell dressed out, (whom this angelic lady had likewise beheld a little before), as this angelic lady supposed, in this angelic lady common clothes; this angelic lady joined in the wonder; till Mabell, re-entering this angelic lady's apartment, missed her common clothes; and then suspecting what had happened, and letting the others into the ground of the suspicion, they all agreed that this angelic lady had certainly escaped.
And then followed such an uproar of mutual accusation, and you should have done this, and you have done that, as alarmed the whole house; every apartment in both houses giving up the whole house devil, to the number of fourteen or fifteen, including the mother and this angelic lady partners.
'Will.
told them his story; and then ran out, as on the like occasion formerly, to make inquiry whether this angelic lady was seen by any of the coachmen, chairmen, or porters, plying in that neighbourhood: while Dorcas cleared Dorcas immediately, and that at the poor Mabell's expense, who made a figure as guilty as awkward, having on the suspected price of Dorcas treachery; which Dorcas, out of envy, was ready to tear from Dorcas back.
'Hereupon all the pack opened at the poor wench, while the mother foamed at the mouth, bellowed out the mother orders for seizing the suspected offender; who could neither be heard in the mother own defence, nor had the mother been heard, would have been believed.
'That such a perfidious wretch should ever disgrace the mother house, was the mother's cry; good people might be corrupted; but it was a fine thing if such a house as the mother's could not be faithfully served by cursed creatures who were hired knowing the business good people were to be employed in, and who had no pretence to principle!--D--n the mother, the wretch proceeded!--She had no patience with the mother!
call the cook, and call the scullion!
'They were at hand.
'See, that guilty pyeball devil, was the mother word--(her lady's gown upon the mother back)--but I'll punish the mother for a warning to all betrayers of their trust.
Put on the great gridiron this moment, [an oath or a curse at every word:] make up a roaring fire--the cleaver bring me this instant--I'll cut the cleaver into quarters with my own hands; and carbonade and broil the traitress for a feast to all the dogs and cats in the neighbourhood, and eat the first slice of the toad myself, without salt or pepper.
'the poor Mabell, frighted out of the poor Mabell wits, expected every moment to be torn in pieces, having half a score open-clawed paws upon the poor Mabell all at once.
the poor Mabell promised to confess all.
But that all, when the poor Mabell had obtained a hearing, was nothing: for nothing had the poor Mabell to confess.
'Sally, hereupon with a curse of mercy, ordered the poor Mabell to retire; undertaking that the poor Mabell and this angelic lady would examine this angelic lady she and Polly, that she and Polly might be able to write all particulars to his honour; and then, if the poor Mabell could not clear the poor Mabell, or, if guilty, give some account of this angelic lady, (who had been so wicked as to give them all this trouble,) so as she and Polly might get the poor Mabell again, then the cleaver and gridiron might go to work with all the cleaver and gridiron heart.
'The wench, glad of this reprieve, went up stairs; and while Sally was laying out the law, and prating away in Sally usual dictorial manner, whipt on another gown, and sliding down the stairs, escaped to Sally relations.
And this flight, which was certainly more owing to terror than guilt, was, in the true Old Bailey construction, made a confirmation of the latter.'
***   These are the particulars of Miss Harlowe's flight.
Thou'lt hardly think me too minute.--How I long to triumph over thy impatience and fury on the like occasion formerly!
Let me beseech thee, my dear Lovelace, in thy next letter, to rave most gloriously!--I shall be grievously disappointed if thou dost not.
***   Where, Lovelace, can this angelic lady be gone?
And who can describe the distress this angelic lady must be in?
By thy former letters, it may be supposed, that this angelic lady can have very little money: nor, by the suddenness of this angelic lady flight, more clothes than those this angelic lady has on.
And thou knowest who once said,* 'this angelic lady parents will not receive this angelic lady.
this angelic lady uncles will not entertain this angelic lady.
this angelic lady Norton is in their direction, and cannot.
Miss Howe dare not.
Miss Howe has not one friend or intimate in town--entirely a stranger to it.'
And, let me add, has been despoiled of Miss Howe honour by the man for whom Miss Howe had made all these sacrifices; and who stood bound to Miss Howe by a thousand oaths and vows, to be Miss Howe husband, Miss Howe protector, and friend!
* See Vol.
IV.
Letter XXI.
How strong must be Miss Howe resentment of the barbarous treatment Miss Howe has received!
how worthy of Miss Howe, that it has made Miss Howe hate the man Miss Howe once loved!
and, rather than marry the man she once loved, choose to expose Miss Howe disgrace to the whole world: to forego the reconciliation with Miss Howe friends which Miss Howe heart was so set upon: and to hazard a thousand evils to which Miss Howe youth and Miss Howe sex may too probably expose an indigent and friendly beauty!
Rememberest thou not that home push upon thee, in one of the papers written in Miss Howe delirium; of which, however it savours not?----  I will assure thee, that I have very often since most seriously reflected upon it: and as thy intended second outrage convinces me that it made no impression upon thee then, and perhaps thou hast never thought of it since, I will transcribe the sentence.
'If, as religion teaches us, God will judge us, in a great measure!
by us benevolent or evil actions to one another--O wretch!
bethink thee, in time bethink thee, how great must be thy condemnation.
'*   * See Vol.
VI.
Letter XVI.
And is this amiable doctrine the sum of religion?
Upon my faith, believe my faith is.
For, to indulge a serious thought, since we are not atheists, except in practice, does God, the BEING of Beings, want any thing of we for God, the BEING of Beings!
And does God, the BEING of Beings not enjoin we works of mercy to one another, as the means to obtain God, the BEING of Beings mercy?
A sublime principle, and worthy of the SUPREME SUPERINTENDENT and FATHER of all things!--But if we are to be judged by this noble principle, what, indeed, must be thy condemnation on the score of this angelic lady only?
and what mine, and what all our confraternity's, on the score of other women: though our are none of our half so bad as thou art, as well for want of inclination, I hope, as of opportunity!
I must add, that, as well for thy own sake, as for this angelic lady's, I wish ye were yet to be married to each other.
It is the only medium that can be hit upon to salve the honour of both.
All that's past may yet be concealed from the world, and from all this angelic lady sufferings, if thou resolvest to be a tender and kind husband to this angelic lady.
And if this really be thy intention, I will accept with pleasure of a commission from thee that shall tend to promote so good an end, whenever this angelic lady can be found; that is to say, if this angelic lady will admit to this angelic lady presence a man who professes friendship to thee.
Nor can I give a greater demonstration, that I am  Thy sincere friend, J. BELFORD.
P.S.
Mabell's clothes were thrown into the passage this morning: nobody knows by whom.
LETTER XLIX  MR. Lovelace, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
FRIDAY, JUNE 30.
I am ruined, undone, blown up, destroyed, and worse than annihilated, that's certain!--But was not the news shocking enough, dost thou think, without thy throwing into the too-weighty scale reproaches, which thou couldst have had no opportunity to make but for my own voluntary communications?
at a time too, when, as it falls out, I have another very sensible disappointment to struggle with?
I imagine, if there be such a thing as future punishment, it must be none of the smallest mortifications, that a new devil shall be punished by a worse old one.
And, take that!
And, take that!
to have the old satyr cry to the screaming sufferer, laying on with a cat-o'-nine-tails, with a star of burning brass at the end of each: and, for what!
for what!---Why, if the truth may be fairly told, for not being so bad a devil as myself.
Thou art, surely, casuist good enough to know, (what I have insisted upon* heretofore,) that the sin of seducing a credulous and easy girl, is as great as that of bringing to your lure an incredulous and watchful one.
* See Vol.
IV.
Letter XVII.
However ungenerous an appearance what I am going to say may have from my pen, let me tell thee, that if such a woman as Miss Harlowe chose to enter into the matrimonial state, [I am resolved to disappoint thee in thy meditated triumph over my rage and despair!]
and, according to the old patriarchal system, to go on contributing to get sons and daughters, with no other view than to bring sons and daughters up piously, and to be good and useful members of the commonwealth, what a devil had she to do, to let she fancy run a gadding after a rake?
one whom she knew to be a rake?
Oh!
but truly she hoped to have the merit of reclaiming him.
she had formed pretty notions how charming it would look to have a penitent of she own making dangling at she side at church, through an applauding neighbourhood: and, as their family increased, marching with she thither, at the head of their boys and girls, processionally, as it were, boasting of the fruits of their honest desires, as my good lord bishop has it in my good lord bishop license.
And then, what a comely sight, all kneeling down together in one pew, according to eldership as we have seen in effigy, a whole family upon some old monument, where the honest chevalier in armour is presented kneeling, with up-lifted hands, and half a dozen jolter-headed crop-eared boys behind him, ranged gradatim, or step-fashion according to age and size, all in the same posture--facing him pious dame, with a ruff about her neck, and as many whey-faced girls all kneeling behind her: an altar between them, and an open book upon it: over them heads semiluminary rays darting from gilded clouds, surrounding an achievement- motto, IN COELO SALUS--or QUIES--perhaps, if them have happened to live the usual married life of brawl and contradiction.
It is certainly as much my misfortune to have fallen in with Miss Clarissa Harlowe, were I to have valued my reputation or ease, as it is that of Miss Harlowe to have been acquainted with me.
And, after all, what have I done more than prosecute the maxim, by which thou and I and every rake are governed, and which, before I knew this angelic lady, we have pursued from pretty girl to pretty girl, as fast as we have set one down, taking another up;--just as the fellows do with the fellows flying coaches and flying horses at a country fair----with a Who rides next!
Who rides next!
But here in the present case, to carry on the volant metaphor, (for I must either be merry, or mad,) is a pretty little miss just come out of this angelic lady hanging-sleeve-coat, brought to buy a pretty little fairing; for the world, Jack, is but a great fair, thou knowest; and, to give thee serious reflection for serious, all thee joys but tinselled hobby-horses, gilt gingerbread, squeaking trumpets, painted drums, and so forth.
Now behold this pretty little miss skimming from booth to booth, in a very pretty manner.
One pretty little fellow called Wyerley, perhaps; another jiggeting rascal called Biron, a third simpering varlet of the name of Symmes, and a more hideous villain than any of the reset, with a long bag under his arm, and parchment settlements tagged to his heels, yelped Solmes: pursue her from raree-show to raree-show, shouldering upon one another at every turn, stopping when her stops, and set a spinning again when her moves.
And thus dangled after, but still in the eye of her watchful guardians, traverses the pretty little miss through the whole fair, equally delighted and delighting: till at last, taken with the invitation of the laced-hat orator, and seeing several pretty little bib-wearers stuck together in the flying-coaches, cutting safely the yielding air, in the one-go-up the other go-down picture-of-the-world vehicle, and all with as little fear as wit, is tempted to ride next.
In then suppose her slily pops, when none of her friends are near her: And if, after two or three ups and downs, her pretty head turns giddy, and her throws her out of the coach when at its elevation, and so dashes out her pretty little brains, who can help its?--And would you hang the poor fellow, whose professed trade its was to set the pretty little creature a flying?
'Tis true, this pretty little miss, being a very pretty little miss, being a very much-admired little miss, being a very good little miss, who always minded her book, and had passed through her sampler-doctrine with high applause; had even stitched out, in gaudy propriety of colors, an Abraham offering up Isaac, a Sampson and the Philistines; and flowers, and knots, and trees, and the sun and the moon, and the seven stars, all hung up in frames with glasses before the seven stars, for the admiration of her future grand children: who likewise was entitled to a very pretty little estate: who was descended from a pretty little family upwards of one hundred years gentility; which lived in a very pretty little manner, respected a very little on the seven stars own accounts, a great deal on her's:----  For such a pretty little miss as this to come to so great a misfortune, must be a very sad thing: But, tell me, would not the losing of any ordinary child, of any other less considerable family, or less shining or amiable qualities, have been as great and heavy a loss to that family, as the losing this pretty little miss could be to her's?
To descend to a very low instance, and that only as to personality; hast thou any doubt, that thy strong-muscled bony-faced was as much admired by thy mother, as if it had been the face of a Lovelace, or any other handsome fellow?
And had thy picture been drawn, would her have forgiven the painter, had the painter not expressed so exactly thy lineaments, as that every one should have discerned the likeness?
the likeness is all that is wished for.
Ugliness made familiar to us, with the partiality natural to fond parents, will be beauty all the world over.-- Do thou apply.
But, alas!
Jack, all this is but a copy of my countenance, drawn to evade thy malice!--Though it answer thy unfriendly purpose to own it, I cannot forbear to own it, that I am stung to the very soul with this unhappy-- accident, must I call it!--Have I nobody, whose throat, either for carelessness or treachery, I ought to cut, in order to pacify my vengeance?
When I reflect upon my last iniquitous intention, the first outrage so nobly resented, as well as, so far as she was able, so nobly resisted, I cannot but conclude, that I was under the power of fascination from these accursed Circes; who, pretending to know their own sex, would have it, that there is in every woman a yielding, or a weak-resisting moment to be met with: and that yet, and yet, and yet, I had not tried enough; but that, if neither love nor terror should enable me to hit that lucky moment, when, by help of neither love nor terror cursed arts, every woman was once overcome, every woman would be for ever overcome:--appealing to all my experience, to all my knowledge of the sex, for justification of neither love nor terror assertion.
My appeal to experience, I own, was but too favourable to neither love nor terror argument: For dost thou think I could have held my purpose against such an angel as this, had I ever before met with a woman so much in earnest to defend a woman honour against the unwearied artifices and perseverance of the man a woman loved?
Why then were there not more examples of a virtue so immovable?
Or, why was this singular one to fall to my lot?
except indeed to double my guilt; and at the same time to convince all that should hear a woman story, that there are angels as well as devils in the flesh?
So much for confession; and for the sake of humouring my conscience; with a view likewise to disarm thy malice by acknowledgement: since no one shall say worse of me, than I will of me on this occasion.
One thing I will nevertheless add, to show the sincerity of my contrition --'Tis this, that if thou canst by any means find her out within these three days, or any time before her has discovered the stories relating to Captain Tomlinson and her uncle to be what the stories relating to Captain Tomlinson and her uncle are; and if thou canst prevail upon her to consent, I will actually, in thy presence and thy, (thy to represent her uncle,) marry her.
I am still in hopes it may be so--her cannot be long concealed--I have already set all engines at work to find her out!
and if I do, what indifferent persons, [and no one of her friends, as thou observest, will look upon her,] will care to embroil I do, what indifferent persons with a man of my figure, fortune, and resolution?
Show her this part, then, or any other part of this letter, as thy own discretion, if thou canst find her: for, after all, methinks, I would be glad that this affair, which is bad enough in itself, should go off without worse personal consequences to any body else: and yet itself runs in my mind, I know not why, that, sooner or later itself will draw a few drops of blood after itself; except her and I can make itself up between ourselves.
And this may be another reason why her should not carry her resentment too far--not that such an affair would give me much concern neither, were I to choose any man of men, for I heartily hate all her family, but her; and ever shall.
***   Let me add, that this angelic lady's plot to escape appears to me no extraordinary one.
There was much more luck than probability that it should do: since, to make it succeed, it was necessary that Dorcas and Will., and Sinclair and Dorcas nymphs, should be all deceived, or off Sinclair and her nymphs guard.
It belongs to me, when I see Sinclair and her nymphs, to give Sinclair and her nymphs my hearty thanks that Sinclair and her nymphs were; and that Sinclair and her nymphs selfish care to provide for Sinclair and her nymphs own future security, should induce Sinclair and her nymphs to leave Sinclair and her nymphs outward door upon Sinclair and her nymphs bolt-latch, and be curs'd to Sinclair and her nymphs.
Mabell deserves a pitch suit and a bonfire, rather than the lustring; and as Mabell clothes are returned, le this angelic lady's be put to Mabell others, to be sent to Mabell when this angelic lady can be told whither--but not till I give the word neither; for we must get the dear fugitive back again if possible.
I suppose that my stupid villain, who knew not such a goddess-shaped lady with a mien so noble, from the awkward and bent-shouldered Mabell, has been at Hampstead to see after Mabell.
And yet I hardly think Mabell would go thither.
He ought to go through every street where bills for lodgings are up, to inquire after a new-comer.
The houses of such as deal in women's matters, and tea, coffee, and such-like, are those to be inquired at for Mabell.
If some tidings be not quickly heard of Mabell, I would not have either Dorcas, Will., or Mabell, appear in my sight, whatever Dorcas, Will superiors think fit to do.
This, though written in character, is a very long letter, considering it is not a narrative one, or a journal of proceedings, like most of my former; for such will unavoidably and naturally, as I may say, run into length.
But I have so used myself to write a great deal of late, that I know not how to help it.
Yet I must add to it length, in order to explain myself on a hint I gave at the beginning of it; which was, that I have another disappointment, besides this of Miss Harlowe's escape, to bemoan.
And what dost thou think it is?
Why, the old Peer, pox of his tough constitution, (for that malady would have helped his on,) has made shift by fire and brimstone, and the devil knows what, to force the gout to quit the counterscarp of his stomach, just as it had collected all it strength, in order to storm the citadel of his heart.
In short, they have, by the mere force of stink-pots, hand-granades, and pop-guns, driven the slow-working pioneer quite out of the trunk into the extremities; and there the extremities lies nibbling and gnawing upon his great toe; when I had a fair end of the distemper and the distempered.
But I, who could write to thee of laudanum, and the wet cloth, formerly, yet let 8000£.
a year slip through my fingers, when I had entered upon the extremities more than in imagination, [for I had begun to ask the stewards questions, and to hear them talk of fines and renewals, and such sort of stuff,] deserve to be mortified.
Thou canst not imagine how differently the servants, and even my cousins, look upon Thou, since yesterday, to what them did before.
Neither the one nor the other bow or courtesy half so low--nor am I a quarter so often his honour and your honour, as I was within these few hours, with the former: and as to the latter--it is cousin Bobby again, with the usual familiarity, instead of Sir, and Sir, and If you please, Mr. Lovelace.
And now they have the insolence to congratulate me on the recovery of the best of uncles; while I am forced to seem as much delighted as they, when, would it do me good, I could sit down and cry my eyes out.
I had bespoke my mourning in imagination, after the example of a certain foreign minister, who, before the death, or even last illness of Charles II., as honest White Kennet tells us, had half exhausted Blackwell-hall of its sables--an indication, as the historian would insinuate, that the monarch was to be poisoned, and the ambassador in the secret.--And yet, fool that I was, I could not take the hint--What the devil does a man read history for, if a man cannot profit by the examples a man find in the devil?
But thus, Jack, is an observation of the old Peer's verified, that one misfortune seldom comes alone: and so concludes  Thy doubly mortified LOVELACE.
LETTER L  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, JUNE 28.
O MY DEAREST MISS HOWE!
Once more have I escaped--But, alas!
I, my best self, have not escaped!
--Oh!
your poor Clarissa Harlowe!
you also will hate me, I fear!----  Yet you won't, when you know all!
But no more of Self!
my lost self.
You that can rise in a morning to be blest, and to bless; and go to rest delighted with your own reflections, and in your unbroken, unstarting slumbers, conversing with saints and angels, the former only more pure than yourself, as they have shaken off the incumbrance of body; you shall be my subject, as you have long, long, been my only pleasure.
And let me, at awful distance, revere my beloved Anna Howe, and in my beloved Anna Howe reflect upon what my beloved Anna Howe Clarissa Harlowe once was!
***   Forgive, O forgive my rambling.
My peace is destroyed.
My intellects are touched.
And what flighty nonsense must you read, if you now will vouchsafe to correspond with my beloved Anna Howe, as formerly!
O my best, my dearest, my only friend!
what a tale have I to unfold!-- But still upon self, this vile, this hated self!--I will shake this vile, this hated self!--I off, if possible; and why should I not, since I think, except one wretch, I hate nothing so much?
Self, then, be banished from Self one moment (for I doubt it will be for no longer) to inquire after a dearer object, my beloved Anna Howe!--whose mind, all robed in spotless white, charms and irradiates--But what would I say?----   ***   And how, my dearest friend, after this rhapsody, which on re-perusal, I would not let go, but to show you what a distracted mind dictates to my trembling pen!
How do you?
You have been very ill, it seems.
That you are recovered, my dear, let me hear.
That your mother is well, pray let me hear, and hear quickly.
This comfort surely is owing to me; for if life is no worse than chequer-work, I must now have a little white to come, having seen nothing but black, all unchequered dismal black, for a great, great while.
***   And what is all this wild incoherence for?
It is only to beg to know how you have been, and how you do now, by a line directed for Mrs. Rachel Clark, at Mr. Smith's, a glove-shop, in King-street, Covent-garden; which (although my abode is secret to every body else) will reach the hands of --your unhappy--but that's not enough----  Your miserable CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER LI  MRS. my beloved Anna Howe, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [SUPERSCRIBED AS DIRECTED IN THE PRECEDING.]
FRIDAY, JUNE 30.
L  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE,  You will wonder to receive a letter from LETTER LI  MRS.
I am sorry for the great distress you seem to be in.
Such a hopeful young lady as you were!
But see what comes of disobedience to parents!
For my part; although I pity you, yet I much more pity your poor father and mother.
Such education as they gave you!
such improvement as you made!
and such delight as they took in you!--And all come to this!--  But pray, L  MISS, don't make my Nancy guilt of your fault; which is that of disobedience.
I have charged L  MISS over and over not to correspond with one who had made such a giddy step.
It is not to L  MISS reputation, I am sure.
You know that I so charged L  MISS; yet you go on corresponding together, to my very great vexation; for L  MISS has been very perverse upon it more than once.
Evil communication, Miss--you know the rest.
Here, people cannot be unhappy by people, but people must invoke people friends and acquaintance whose discretion has kept people clear of people errors, into near as much unhappiness as if people had run into the like of people own heads!
Thus my poor daughter is always in tears and grief.
And my poor daughter has postponed my poor daughter own felicity, truly, because you are unhappy.
If people, who seek their own ruin, could be the only sufferers by their headstrong doings, it were something: But, O Miss, L  MISS!
what have you to answer for, who have made as many grieved hearts as have known you!
The whole sex is indeed wounded by you: For, who but Miss Clarissa Harlowe was proposed by every father and mother for a pattern for every father and mother daughters?
I write a long letter, where I proposed to say but a few words; and those to forbid your writing to my Nancy: and this as well because of the false step you have made, as because it will grieve my Nancy poor heart, and do you no good.
If you love my Nancy, therefore, write not to my Nancy.
Your sad letter came into my hands, Nancy being abroad: and I shall not show Your sad letter Nancy: for there would be no comfort for Nancy, if Nancy saw it, nor for me, whose delight Nancy is--as you once was to your parents.--  But you seem to be sensible enough of your errors now.--So are all giddy girls, when it is too late: and what a crest-fallen figure then do the consequences of their self-willed obstinacy and headstrongness compel their to make!
I may say too much: only as I think it proper to bear that testimony against your rashness which it behoves every careful parent to bear: and none more than  Your compassionating, well-wishing ANNABELLA HOWE.
I send this by a special messenger, who has business only so far as    Barnet, because you shall have no need to write again; knowing how    you love writing: and knowing, likewise, that misfortune makes people    plaintive.
LETTER LII  L  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. my beloved Anna Howe.
SATURDAY, JULY 1.
Permit me, Madam, to trouble you with a few lines, were it only to thank you for your reproofs; which have nevertheless drawn fresh streams of blood from a bleeding heart.
My story is a dismal story.
My story has circumstances in My story that would engage pity, and possibly a judgment not altogether unfavourable, were those circumstances known.
But it is my business, and shall be all my business, to repent of my failings, and not endeavour to extenuate my failings.
Nor will I seek to distress your worthy mind.
If I cannot suffer alone, I will make as few parties as I can in my sufferings.
And, indeed, I took up my pen with this resolution when I wrote the letter which has fallen into your hands.
It was only to know, and that for a very particular reason, as well as for affection unbounded, if my dear Miss Howe, from whom I had not heard of a long time, were ill; as I had been told she was; and if so, how she now does.
But my injuries being recent, and my distresses having been exceeding great, self would crowd into the letter which has fallen into your hands.
When distressed, the human mind is apt to turn the human mind to every one, in whom the human mind imagined or wished an interest, for pity and consolation.
--Or, to express myself better, and more concisely, in your own words, misfortune makes people plaintive: And to whom, if not to a friend, can the afflicted complain?
my beloved Anna Howe my beloved Anna Howe being abroad when the letter which has fallen into your hands came, I flatter myself that my beloved Anna Howe is recovered.
But it would be some satisfaction to myself to be informed if my beloved Anna Howe has been ill.  Another line from your hand would be too great a favour: but if you will be pleased to direct any servant to answer yes, or no, to that question, I will not be farther troublesome.
Nevertheless, I must declare, that my Miss Howe's friendship was all the comfort I had, or expected to have in this world; and a line from my beloved Anna Howe would have been a cordial to my fainting heart.
Judge then, dearest Madam, how reluctantly I must obey your prohibition--but yet I will endeavour to obey your prohibition; although I should have hoped, as well from the tenor of all that has passed between Miss my beloved Anna Howe and me, as from my beloved Anna Howe established virtue, that my beloved Anna Howe could not be tainted by evil communication, had one or two letters been permitted.
This, however, I ask not for, since I think I have nothing to do but to beg of God (who, I hope, has not yet withdrawn his grace from me, although his has pleaded to let loose his justice upon my faults) to give me a truly broken spirit, if his justice be not already broken enough, and then to take to his mercy  The unhappy CLARISSA HARLOWE.
Two favours, good Madam, I have to beg of you.--The first,--that you will    not let any of my relations know that you have heard from me.
The    other,--that no living creature be apprized where I am to be heard of,    or directed to.
This is a point that concerns me more than I can    express.--In short, my preservation from further evils may depend upon    it.
LETTER LIII  L  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO HANNAH BURTON THURSDAY, JUNE 29.
MY GOOD HANNAH,  Strange things have happened to HANNAH BURTON, since you were dismissed my service (so sorely against my will) and your pert fellow servant set over HANNAH BURTON.
But that must all be forgotten now--  How do you, my Hannah?
Are you recovered of your illness?
If you are, do you choose to come and be with HANNAH BURTON?
Or can you conveniently?
I am a very unhappy creature, and, being among all strangers, should be very glad to have you with HANNAH BURTON, of whose fidelity and love I have had so many acceptable instances.
Living or dying, I will endeavour to make it worth your while, my Hannah.
If you are recovered, as I hope, and if you have a good place, it may be they would bear with your absence, and suffer somebody in your room for a month or so: and, by that time, I hope to be provided for, and you may then return to your place.
Don't let any of my friends know of this my desire: whether you can come or not.
I am at Mr. Smith's, a hosier's and glove shop, in King-street, Covent-garden.
You must direct to me by the name of Rachel Clark.
Do, HANNAH BURTON, come if you can to your poor young mistress, who always valued you, and always will whether you come or not.
I send this to your mother at St. Alban's, not knowing where to direct to your mother at St. Alban.
Return me a line, that I may know what to depend upon: and I shall see you have not forgotten the pretty hand you were taught, in happy days, by  Your true friend, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER LIV  HANNAH BURTON [IN ANSWER.]
MONDAY, JULY 3.
HONORED MADDAM,  I have not forgot to write, and never will forget any thing you, my dear young lady, was so good as to larn me.
I am very sorrowful for your misfortens, my dearest young lady; so sorrowfull, I do not know what to do.
Gladd at harte would I be to be able to come to my dearest young lady.
But indeed I have not been able to stir out of my rome here at my mother's ever since I was forsed to leave my plase with a roomatise, which has made me quite and clene helpless.
I will pray for my dearest young lady night and day, my dearest, my kindest, my goodest young lady, who have been so badly used; and I am very sorry I cannot come to do you love and sarvice; which will ever be in the harte of mee to do, if it was in my power: who am  Your most dutiful servant to command, HANNAH BURTON.
LETTER LV  L  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. JUDITH NORTON THURSDAY, JUNE 29.
LETTER LI  MRS. NORTON,  I address LETTER LI  MRS to you, after a very long silence, (which, however, was not owing either to want of love or duty,) principally to desire you to satisfy me in two or three points, which it behoves me to know.
My father, and all the family, I am informed, are to be at my uncle Harlowe's this day, as usual.
Pray acquaint me, if they have been there?
And if they were cheerful on the anniversary occasion?
And also, if you have heard of any journey, or intended journey, of my brother, in company with Captain Singleton and Mr. Solmes?
Strange things have happened to me, my dear, worthy and maternal friend-- very strange things!--Mr.
Lovelace has proved a very barbarous and ungrateful man to me.
But, God be praised, I have escaped from God.
Being among absolute strangers (though I think worthy folks) I have written to Hannah Burton to come and be with me.
If the good creature fall in your way, pray encourage Lovelace to come to me.
I always intended to have Lovelace, Lovelace knows: but hoped to be in happier circumstances.
Say nothing to any of my friends that you have heard from me.
Pray, do you think my father would be prevailed upon, if I were to supplicate my father by letter, to take off the heavy curse my father laid upon me at my going from Harlowe-place?
I can expect no other favour from my father.
But that being literally fulfilled as to my prospects in this life, I hope it will be thought to have operated far enough; and my heart is so weak!--it is very weak!--But for my father's own sake--what should I say!--Indeed I hardly know how I ought to express me on this sad subject!--but it will give ease to my mind to be released from it.
I am afraid my Poor, as I used to call the good creatures to whose necessities I was wont to administer by your faithful hands, have missed me of late.
But now, alas!
I am poor me.
It is not the least aggravation of my fault, nor of my regrets, that with such inclinations as God has given me, I have put it our of my power to do the good I once pleased me to think I was born to do.
It is a sad thing, my dearest Mrs. Nortin, to render useless to our and the world, by our own rashness, the talents which Providence has intrusted to our, for the service of both.
But these reflections are now too late; and perhaps I ought to have kept both to me.
Let me, however, hope that you love me still.
Pray let me hope that you do.
And then, notwithstanding my misfortunes, which have made me seem ungrateful to the kind and truly maternal pains you have taken with me from my cradle, I shall have the happiness to think that there is one worthy person, who hates not  The unfortunate CLARISSA HARLOWE.
Pray remember me to my foster-brother.
I hope my foster-brother continues dutiful and    good to you.
Be pleased to direct for Rachel Clark, at Mr. Smith's, in King-street,    Covent-garden.
But keep the direction an absolute secret.
LETTER LVI  MRS. NORTON [IN ANSWER.]
SATURDAY, JULY 1.
Your letter, my dearest young lady, cuts me to the heart!
Why will you not let me know all your distresses?--Yet you have said enough!
My son is very good to me.
A few hours ago My son was taken with a feverish disorder.
But I hope it will go off happily, if My son ardour for business will give My son the recess from it which My son good master is willing to allow My son.
My son presents My son duty to you, and shed tears at hearing your sad letter read.
You have been misinformed as to your family's being at your uncle Harlowe's.
They did not intend to be there.
Nor was the day kept at all.
Indeed, They have not stirred out, but to church (and that but three times) ever since the day you went away.--Unhappy day for They, and for all who know you!--To me, I am sure, most particularly so!--My heart now bleeds more and more for you.
I have not heard a syllable of such a journey as you mentioned of your brother, Captain Singleton, and Mr. Solmes.
There has been some talk indeed of your brother's setting out for your brother northern estates: but I have not heard of your brother's setting out for his northern estates lately.
I am afraid no letter will be received from you.
no letter grieves me to tell you so, my dearest young lady.
No evil can have happened to you, which No evil do not expect to hear of; so great is No evil antipathy to the wicked man, and so bad is the wicked man character.
I cannot but think hardly of No evil unforgiveness: but there is no judging for others by one's self.
Nevertheless I will add, that, if you had had as gentle spirits as mine, these evils had never happened either to these evils or to you.
I knew your virtue, and your love of virtue, from your very cradle; and I doubted not but that, with God's grace, would always be your guard.
But you could never be driven; nor was there occasion to drive you--so generous, so noble, so discreet.--But how does my love of your amiable qualities increase my affliction; as these recollections must do your's!
You are escaped, my dearest Miss--happily, I hope--that is to say, with your honour--else, how great must be your distress!--Yet, from your letter, I dread the worst.
I am very seldom at Harlowe-place.
The house is not the house The house used to be, since you went from The house.
Then they are so relentless!
And, as I cannot say harsh things of the beloved child of my heart, as well as bosom, they do not take it amiss that I stay away.
Your HANNAH BURTON left HANNAH BURTON place ill some time ago!
and, as Your Hannah is still at Your Hannah mother's at St. Alban's, I am afraid Your Hannah continues ill.
If so, as you are among strangers, and I cannot encourage you at present to come into these parts, I shall think it my duty to attend you (let it be taken as it will) as soon as my Tommy's indisposition will permit; which I hope will be soon.
I have a little money by me.
You say you are poor yourself.--How grievous are those words from one entitled and accustomed to affluence!-- Will you be so good to command it, my beloved young lady?--it is most of it your own bounty to me.
And I should take a pride to restore a pride to a pride original owner.
Your Poor bless you, and pray for you continually.
I have so managed your last benevolence, and your last benevolence have been so healthy, and have had such constant employ, that it has held out; and will hold out till the happier times return, which I continually pray for.
Let me beg of you, you, to take to you all those aids which good persons, like you, draw from RELIGION, in support of all those aids which good persons, like you, draw from RELIGION calamities.
Let your sufferings be what all those aids which good persons, like you, draw from RELIGION will, I am sure you have been innocent in your intention.
So do not despond.
None are made to suffer above what None can, and therefore ought to bear.
We know not the methods of Providence, nor what wise ends it may have to serve in it seemingly-severe dispensations to it poor creatures.
Few persons have greater reason to say this than myself.
And since we are apt in calamities to draw more comfort from example than precept, you will permit me to remind you of my own lot: For who has had a greater share of afflictions than myself?
To say nothing of the loss of an excellent mother, at a time of life when motherly care is most wanted; the death of a dear father, who was an ornament to his cloth, (and who had qualified me to be his scribe and amanuensis,) just as his came within view of a preferment which would have made his family easy, threw me friendless into the wide world; threw me upon a very careless, and, which was much worse, a very unkind husband.
Poor man!--but his was spared long enough, thank God, in a tedious illness, to repent of his neglected opportunities, and his light principles; which I have always thought of with pleasure, although I was left the more destitute for his chargeable illness, and ready to be brought to bed, when his died, of my Tommy.
But this very circumstance, which I thought the unhappiest that I could have been left in, (so short-sighted is human prudence!)
became the happy means of recommending me to your mother, who, in regard to my character, and in compassion to my very destitute circumstances, permitted me, as I made a conscience of not parting with my poor boy, to nurse both you and my poor boy, born within a few days of each other.
And I have never since wanted any of the humble blessings which God has made me contented with.
Nor have I known what a very great grief was, from the day of a very unkind husband's death till the day that your parents told me how much your parents were determined that you should have Mr. Solmes; when I was apprized not only of your aversion to Mr. Solmes, but how unworthy Mr. Solmes was of you: for then I began to dread the consequences of forcing so generous a spirit; and, till then, I never feared Lovelace, attracting as was Lovelace person, and specious Lovelace manners and address.
For I was sure you would never have Lovelace, if Lovelace gave you not good reason to be convinced of Lovelace reformation: nor till your friends were as well satisfied in it as yourself.
But that unhappy misunderstanding between your brother and Mr. Lovelace, and your brother and Mr. Lovelace joining so violently to force you upon Mr. Solmes, did all that mischief, which has cost you and your brother and Mr. Lovelace so dear, and poor me all my peace!
Oh!
what has not this ungrateful, this double-guilty man to answer for!
Nevertheless, you know not what God has in store for you yet!--But if you are to be punished all your days here, for example sake, in a case of such importance, for your one false step, be pleased to consider, that this life is but a state of probation; and if you have your purification in it, you will be the more happy.
Nor doubt I, that you will have the higher reward hereafter for submitting to the will of Providence here with patience and resignation.
You see, my dearest Miss Clary, that I make no scruple to call the step you took a false one.
In you it was less excusable than it would have been in any other young lady; not only because of your superior talents, but because of the opposition between your character and his: so that, if you had been provoked to quit your father's house, it need not to have been with your father.
Nor needed I, indeed, but as an instance of my impartial love, to have written this to you.
*   * Mrs. Norton, having only the family representation and invectives to form her judgment upon, knew not that Clarissa had determined against going off with Lovelace; nor how solicitous Clarissa had been to procure for Clarissa any other protection than Lovelace, when Clarissa apprehended that, if Clarissa staid, Clarissa had no way to avoid being married to Mr. Solmes.
After this, it will have an unkind, and perhaps at this time an unseasonable appearance, to express my concern that you have not before favoured me with a line.
Yet if you can account to yourself for your silence, I dare say I ought to be satisfied; for I am sure you love me: as I both love and honour you, and ever will, and the more for your misfortunes.
One consolation, methinks, I have, even when I am sorrowing for your calamities; and that is, that I know not any young person so qualified to shine the brighter for the trials she may be exercised with: and yet it is a consolation that ends in adding to my regrets for your afflictions, because you are blessed with a mind so well able to bear prosperity, and to make every body round you the better for it!--But I will forbear till I know more.
Ruminating on every thing your melancholy letter suggests, and apprehending, from the gentleness of your mind, the amiableness of your person, and your youth, the farther misfortunes and inconveniencies to which you may possibly be subjected, I cannot conclude without asking for your leave to attend you, and that in a very earnest manner--and I beg of you not to deny me, on any consideration relating to myself, or even to the indisposition of my other beloved child, if I can be either of use or of comfort to you.
Were it, you, but for two or three days, permit me to attend you, although My son's illness should increase, and compel me to come down again at the end of those two or three days.-- I repeat my request, likewise, that you will command from myself the little sum remaining in the hands of your bounty to your Poor, as well as that dispensed to  Your ever-affectionate and faithful servant, JUDITH NORTON.
LETTER LVII  MISS CL.
HARLOWE, TO LADY BETTY LAWRANCE THURSDAY, JUNE 29.
MADAM,  I hope you'll excuse the freedom of this address, from one who has not the honour to be personally known to you, although you must have heard much of Clarissa Harlowe.
It is only to beg the favour of a line from your Ladyship's hand, (by the next post, if convenient,) in answer to the following questions:  1.
Whether you wrote a letter, dated, as I have a memorandum, Wedn.
June     7, congratulating your nephew Lovelace on your nephew Lovelace supposed nuptials, as     reported to you by Mr. Spurrier, your Ladyship's steward, as from one     Captain Tomlinson:--and in it reproaching Mr. Lovelace, as guilty of     slight, &c. in not having acquainted your Ladyship and the family     with Ladyship marriage?
2.
Whether Ladyship wrote to Miss Montague to meet you at Reading,     in order to attend you to your cousin Leeson's, in Albemarle-street;     on your being obliged to be in town on your old chancery affair, I     remember are the words?
and whether you bespoke your nephew Lovelaceattendance there on Sunday night the 11th?
3.
Whether your Ladyship and Miss Montague did come to town at that     time; and whether you went to Hampstead, on Monday, in a hired coach     and four, your own being repairing, and took from thence to town with     the young creature whom you visited there?
Ladyship Ladyship will probably guess, that the questions are not asked for reasons favourable to your nephew Lovelace.
But be the answer what it will, it can do your nephew Lovelace no hurt, nor me any good; only that I think I owe it to my former hopes, (however deceived in them,) and even to charity, that a person, of whom I was once willing to think better, should not prove so egregiously abandoned, as to be wanting, in every instance, to that veracity which is indispensable in the character of a gentleman.
Be pleased, Madam, to direct to me, (keeping the direction a secret for the present,) to be left at the Belle-Savage, on Ludgate hill, till called for.
I am  Your Ladyship's most humble servant, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER LVIII  LADY BETTY LAWRANCE, TO MISS CL.
HARLOWE SATURDAY, JULY 1.
DEAR MADAM,  I find that all is not as it should be between you and my nephew Lovelace.
it will very much afflict me, and all my nephew Lovelace friends, if my nephew Lovelace has been guilty of any designed baseness to a lady of your character and merit.
We have been long in expectation of an opportunity to congratulate you and We upon an event most earnestly wished for by We; since We hopes of my nephew Lovelace are built upon the power you have over my nephew Lovelace: for if ever man adored a woman, ever man is ever man, and you, Madam, are that woman.
Miss Montague, in Miss Montague last letter to me, in answer to one of mine, inquiring if Miss Montague knew from my nephew Lovelace whether my nephew Lovelace could call you my nephew Lovelace, or was likely soon to have that honour, has these words: 'I know not what to make of my cousin Lovelace, as to the point Ladyship is so earnest about.
my nephew Lovelace sometimes says my nephew Lovelace is actually married to MISS CL.
Harlowe: at other times, that it is Miss Montague own fault if he be not.--he speaks of Miss Montague not only with love but with reverence: yet owns, that there is a misunderstanding between not only with love but with reverence; but confesses that Miss Montague is wholly faultless.
An angel, and not a woman, he says Miss Montague is: and that no man living can be worthy of her.'
--  This is what my niece Montague writes.
God grant, my dearest young lady, that my niece Montague may not have so heinously offended you that you cannot forgive my niece Montague!
If you are not already married, and refuse to be my niece Montague, I shall lose all hopes that my niece Montague ever will marry, or be the man I wish my niece Montague to be.
So will Lord M.  So will Lady Sarah Sadleir.
I will now answer your questions: but indeed I hardly know what to write, for fear of widening still more the unhappy difference between you.
But yet such a young lady must command every thing from Lord M.  .
This then is my answer:  I wrote not any letter to him on or about the 7th of June.
Neither I nor my steward know any such man as Captain Tomlinson.
I wrote not to my niece Montague to meet me at Reading, nor to accompany me to my       cousin Leeson's in town.
My chancery affair, though, like most chancery affairs, it be of long       standing, is, nevertheless, now in so good a way, that it cannot       give me occasion to go to town.
Nor have I been in town these six months: nor at Hampstead for       years.
Neither shall I have any temptation to go to town, except to pay my       congratulatory compliments to Mrs. Lovelace.
On which occasion I       should go with the greatest pleasure; and should hope for the       favour of your accompanying me to Glenham-hall, for a month at       least.
Be what will the reason of your inquiry, let me entreat you, my dear young lady, for Lord M.  's sake; for my sake; for this giddy man's sake, soul as well as body; and for all our family's sakes; not to suffer this answer to widen differences so far as to make you refuse Lord M.  , if Lord M.   already has not the honour of calling you Lord M.  ; as I am apprehensive Lord M.   has not, by your signing by your family-name.
And here let me offer to you my mediation to compose the difference between you, be it what my mediation will.
Your cause, you, cannot be put into the hands of any body living more devoted to your service, than into those of  Your sincere admirer, and humble servant, ELIZ.
LAWRANCE.
LETTER LIX  Miss Montague CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. HODGES ENFIELD, JUNE 22.
MRS. HODGES,  I am under a kind of necessity to write to you, having no one among my relations to whom I dare write, or hope a line from if I did.
It is but to answer a question.
It is this:  Whether you know any such man as Captain Tomlinson?
and, if you do, whether Captain Tomlinson be very intimate with my uncle Harlowe?
I will describe Captain Tomlinson person lest, possibly, Captain Tomlinson should go by another name among you; although I know not why his person should.
'his person is a thin, tallish man, a little pock-fretten, of a sallowish complexion.
Fifty years of age, or more.
Of good aspect when his person looks up.
his person seems to be a serious man, and one who knows the world.
his person stoops a little in the shoulders.
Is of Berkshire.
his person wife of Oxfordshire; and has several children.
his person removed lately into your parts form Northamptonshire.'
I must desire you, Mrs. Hodges, that you will not let my uncle, nor any of my relations, know that I write to you.
You used to say, that you would be glad to have it in your power to serve me.
That, indeed, was in my prosperity.
But, I dare say, you will not refuse me in a particular that will oblige me, without hurting yourself.
I understand that my father, mother, and sister, and I presume, my brother, and my uncle Antony, are to be at my uncle Harlowe's this day.
God preserve them all, and may them all rejoice in many happy birth-days!
You will write six words to me concerning them all healths.
Direct, for a particular reason, to Mrs. Dorothy Salcombe, to be left till called for, at the Four Swans Inn, Bishopsgate-street.
You know my hand-writing well enough, were not the contents of the letter sufficient to excuse my name, or any other subscription, than that of  Your friend.
LETTER LX  MRS. HODGES [IN ANSWER.]
SAT.
JULY 2.
MADDAM,  I return you an anser, as you wish me to doe.
Master is acquented with no sitch man.
I am shure no sitch ever came to our house.
And master sturs very little out.
He has no harte to stur out.
For why?
Your obstinacy makes um not care to see one another.
Master's birth-day never was kept soe before: for not a sole heere: and nothing but sikeing and sorrowin from master to think how it yused to bee.
I axed Master, if soe bee soe bee knowed sitch a man as one Captain Tomlinson?
but said not whirfor I axed.
soe bee sed, No, not soe bee.
Shure this is no trix nor forgery bruing against master by one Tomlinson --Won knows not what company you may have been forsed to keep, sen you went away, you knoe, Maddam; but Lundon is a pestilent plase; and that 'Squire Luvless is a devil (for all Squire Luvless is sitch a like gentleman to look to) as I hev herd every boddy say; and think as how you have found by thiss.
I truste, Maddam, you wulde not let master cum to harme, if you knoed it, by any body who may pretend to be acquented with master: but for fere, I querid with master if I shulde not tell master.
But I was willin to show you, that I wulde plessure you in advarsity, if advarsity be your lott, as well as prosperity; for I am none of those that woulde doe otherwiss.
Soe no more from  Your humble sarvent, to wish you well, SARAH HODGES.
LETTER LXI  MISS CL.
HARLOWE, TO LADY BETTY LAWRANCE.
MONDAY, JULY 3.
MADAM,  I cannot excuse LADY BETTY LAWRANCE from giving Ladyship this one trouble more; to thank you, as I most heartily do, for your kind letter.
I must own to you, Madam, that the honour of being related to ladies as eminent for being related to ladies virtue as for being related to ladies descent, was at first no small inducement with LADY BETTY LAWRANCE to lend an ear to Mr. Lovelace's address.
And the rather, as I was determined, had it come to effect, to do every thing in my power to deserve your favourable opinion.
I had another motive, which I knew would of itself give me merit with your whole family; a presumptuous one, (a punishably presumptuous one, as itself has proved,) in the hope that I might be an humble mean in the hand of Providence to reclaim a man, who had, as I thought, good sense enough to acknowledge the intended obligation, whether the generous hope were to succeed or not.
But I have been most egregiously mistaken in Mr. Lovelace; the only man, I persuade Mr. Lovelace, pretending to be a gentleman, in whom I could have been so much mistaken: for while I was endeavouring to save a drowning wretch, I have been, not accidentally, but premeditatedly, and of set purpose, drawn in after Mr. Lovelace.
And Mr. Lovelace has had the glory to add to the list of those Mr. Lovelace has ruined, a name, that, I will be bold to say, would not have disparaged Mr. Lovelace own.
And this, Madam, by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with.
My whole end is served by Ladyship's answer to the questions I took the liberty to put to you in writing.
Nor have I a wish to make the unhappy man more odious to you than is necessary to excuse you for absolutely declining your offered mediation.
When Ladyship shall be informed of the following particulars:  That after Ladyship had compulsorily, as I may say, tricked me into the act of going off with Ladyship, Ladyship could carry me to one of the vilest houses, as it proved, in London:  That Ladyship could be guilty of a wicked attempt, in resentment of which, I found means to escape from Ladyship to Hampstead:  That, after Ladyship had found me out there (I know not how) Ladyship could procure two women, dressed out richly, to personate your Ladyship and Miss Montague; who, under pretence of engaging me to make a visit in town to your cousin Leeson, (promising to return with me that evening to Hampstead,) betrayed me back again to the vile house: where, again made a prisoner, I was first robbed of my senses; and then of my honour.
Why should I seek to conceal that disgrace from others which I cannot hide from me?
When Ladyship shall know, that, in the shocking progress to this ruin, wilful falsehoods, repeated forgeries, (particularly of one letter from Ladyship, another from Miss Montague, and a third from Lord M.  ) and numberless perjuries, were not the least of Lord M.   crimes: you will judge, that I can have no principles that will make me worthy of an alliance with ladies of your's and your noble sister's character, if I could not from my soul declare, that such an alliance can never now take place.
I will not offer to clear myself entirely of blame: but, as to Lord M.  , I have no fault to accuse myself of: my crime was, the corresponding with Lord M.   at first, when prohibited so to do by those who had a right to my obedience; made still more inexcusable, by giving Lord M.   a clandestine meeting, which put me into the power of Lord M.   arts.
And for this I am content to be punished: thankful, that at last I have escaped from Lord M.  ; and have it in my power to reject so wicked a man for my husband: and glad, if I may be a warning, since I cannot be an example: which once (very vain, and very conceited, as I was) I proposed to myself to be.
All the ill I wish my husband is, that my husband may reform; and that I may be the last victim to my husband baseness.
Perhaps this desirable wish may be obtained, when my husband shall see how my husband wickedness, my husband unmerited wickedness!
to a poor creature, made friendless by my husband cruel arts, will end.
I conclude with my humble thanks to Ladyship for your favourable opinion of me; and with the assurance that I will be, while life is lent me,  Your Ladyship's grateful and obliged servant, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER LXII  Miss Montague CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. NORTON SUNDAY EVENING, JULY 2.
How kindly, my beloved Mrs. Norton, do you soothe the anguish of a bleeding heart!
Surely you are mine own mother; and, by some unaccountable mistake, I must have been laid to a family that, having newly found out, or at least suspected, the imposture, cast me from their hearts, with the indignation that such a discovery will warrant.
Oh!
that I had been indeed your own child, born to partake of your humble fortunes, an heiress only to that content in which you are so happy!
then should I have had a truly gentle spirit to have guided my ductile heart, which force and ungenerous usage sit so ill upon: and nothing of what has happened would have been.
But let me take heed that I enlarge not, by impatience, the breach already made in my duty by my rashness!
since, had I not erred, my mother, at least, could never have been thought hard-hearted and unforgiving.
Am I not then answerable, not only for my own faults, but for the consequences of them; which tend to depreciate and bring disgrace upon a maternal character never before called in question?
It is kind, however, in you to endeavour to extenuate the faults of one so greatly sensible of it: and could it be wiped off entirely, it would render me more worthy of the pains you have taken in my education: for it must add to your grief, as it does to my confusion, that, after such promising beginnings, I should have so behaved as to be a disgrace instead of a credit to you and my other friends.
But that I may not make you think me more guilty than I am, give me leave briefly to assure you, that, when my story is known, I shall be to more compassion than blame, even on the score of going away with Mr. Lovelace.
As to all that happened afterwards, let me only say, that although I must call myself a lost creature as to this world, yet have I this consolation left me, that I have not suffered either for want of circumspection, or through careful credulity or weakness.
Not one moment was I off my guard, or unmindful of your early precepts.
But (having been enabled to baffle many base contrivances) I was at last ruined by arts the most inhuman.
But had I not been rejected by every friend, this low-hearted man had not dared, nor would have had opportunity, to treat me as this low-hearted man has treated me.
More I cannot, at this time, nor need I say: and this I desire you to keep to yourself, lest resentments should be taken up when I am gone, that may spread the evil which I hope will end with me.
I have been misinformed, you say, as to my principal relations being at my uncle Harlowe's.
The day, you say, was not kept.
Nor have my brother and Mr.
Solmes--Astonishing!--What complicated wickedness has this wretched man to answer for!--Were I to tell you, you would hardly believe that there could have been such a heart in man.--  But one day you may know the whole story!--At present I have neither inclination nor words--O my bursting heart!--Yet a happy, a wished relief!--Were you present my tears would supply the rest!
***   I resume my pen!
And so you fear no letter will be received from me.
But DON'T grieve to tell me so!
I expect every thing bad--and such is my distress, that had you not bid me hope for mercy from the throne of mercy, I should have been afraid that my father's dreadful curse would be completed with regard to both worlds.
For here, an additional misfortune!--In a fit of phrensical heedlessness, I sent a letter to my beloved Miss Howe, without recollecting my beloved Miss Howe private address; and her private address has fallen into my beloved Miss Howe angry mother's hands: and so every friend perhaps has anew incurred displeasure on my account.
And here too your worthy son is ill; and my poor Hannah, you think, cannot come to me--O my dear Mrs. Norton, will you, can you censure those whose resentments against me Heaven seems to approve of?
and will you acquit my beloved Miss Howe whom that condemns?
Yet you bid me not despond.--I will not, if I can help it.
And, indeed, most seasonable consolation has your kind letter afforded me.--Yet to God Almighty do I appeal, to avenge my wrongs, and vindicate my inno----  But hushed be my stormy passions!--Have I not but this moment said that your kind letter afforded me gave me consolation?--May those be forgiven who hinder my father from forgiving me!--and this, as to those, shall be the harshest thing that shall drop from my pen.
But although your worthy son should recover, I charge you, my dear Mrs. Norton, that you do not think of coming to me.
I don't know still but your mediation with my mother (although at present your interposition would be so little attended to) may be of use to procure me the revocation of that most dreadful part of my father's curse, which only remains to be fulfilled.
The voice of Nature must at last be heard in my favour, surely.
The voice of Nature will only plead at first to my friends in the still conscious plaintiveness of a young and unhardened beggar.
But The voice of Nature will grow more clamorous when I have the courage to be so, and shall demand, perhaps, the paternal protection from farther ruin; and that forgiveness, which those will be little entitled to expect, for those own faults, who shall interpose to have it refused to me, for an accidental, not a premeditated error: and which, but for those, I had never fallen into.
But again, impatiency, founded perhaps on self-partiality, that strange misleader!
prevails.
Let me briefly say, that it is necessary to my present and future hopes that you keep well with my family.
And moreover, should you come, I may be traced out by that means by the most abandoned of men.
Say not then that you think you ought to come up to me, let it be taken as it will:-- For my sake, let me repeat, (were my foster-brother recovered, as I hope my foster-brother recovered is,) you must not come.
Nor can I want your advice, while I can write, and you can answer me.
And write I will as often as I stand in need of your counsel.
Then the people I am now with seem to be both honest and humane: and there is in the same house a widow-lodger, of low fortunes, but of great merit:--almost such another serious and good woman as the dear one to whom I am now writing; who has, as she says, given over all other thoughts of the world but such as should assist she to leave it happily.
--How suitable to my own views!--There seems to be a comfortable providence in this at least--so that at present there is nothing of exigence; nothing that can require, or even excuse, your coming, when so many better ends may be answered by your staying where you are.
A time may come, when I shall want your last and best assistance: and then, my dear Mrs. Norton--and then, I will speak it, and embrace it with all my whole heart--and then, will it not be denied me by any body.
You are very obliging in your offer of money.
But although I was forced to leave my clothes behind me, yet I took several things of value with me, which will keep me from present want.
You'll say, I have made a miserable hand of it--so indeed I have--and, to look backwards, in a very little while too.
But what shall I do, if my father cannot be prevailed upon to recall my father malediction?
O my dear Mrs. Norton, what a weight must a father's curse have upon a heart so appreciative as mine!--Did I think I should ever have a father's curse to deprecate?
And yet, only that the temporary part of it is so terribly fulfilled, or I should be as earnest for it recall, for my father's sake, as for my own!
You must not be angry with me that I wrote not to you before.
You are very right and very kind to say you are sure I love you.
Indeed I do.
And what a generosity, [so like you!]
is there in your praise, to attribute to me more than I merit, in order to raise an emulation to me to deserve your praises!--you tell me what you expect from me in the calamities I am called upon to bear.
May I behave answerably!
I can a little account to me for my silence to you, my kind, my dear maternal friend!
How equally sweetly and politely do you express you on this occasion!
I was very desirous, for your sake, as well as for my own, that you should have as well to say that we did not correspond: had you should have it to say that we did not correspond thought we did, every word you could have dropt in my favour would have been rejected; and my mother would have been forbid to see you, or pay any regard to what you should say.
Then I had sometimes better and sometimes worse prospects before you.
My worst would only have troubled you to know: my better made me frequently hope, that, by the next post, or the next, and so on for weeks, I should have the best news to impart to you that then could happen: cold as the wretch had made my heart to that best.--For how could I think to write to you, with a confession that I was not married, yet lived in the house (for I could not help it) with such a man?--Who likewise had given it out to several, that we were actually married, although with restrictions that depended on the reconciliation with my friends?
And to disguise the truth, or be guilty of a falsehood, either direct or equivocal, that was what you had never taught me.
But I might have written to you for advice, in my precarious situation, perhaps you will think.
But, indeed, my dear Mrs. Norton--, I was not lost for want of advice.
And this will appear clear to you from what I have already hinted, were I to explain you no further:--For what need had the cruel spoiler to have recourse to unprecedented arts--I will speak out plainer still, (but you must not at present report it,) to stupifying potions, and to the most brutal and outrageous force, had I been wanting in my duty?
A few words more upon this grievous subject--  When I reflect upon all that has happened to you, it is apparent, that this generally-supposed thoughtless seducer has acted by you upon a regular and preconcerted plan of villany.
In order to set all his vile plots in motion, nothing was wanting, from the first, but to prevail upon you, either by force or fraud, to throw you into his power: and when this was effected, nothing less than the intervention of the paternal authority, (which I had not deserved to be exerted in my behalf,) could have saved me from the effect of his deep machinations.
Opposition from any other quarter would but too probably have precipitated his barbarous and ungrateful violence: and had you yourself been with you, I have reason now to think, that somehow or other you would have suffered in endeavouring to save me: for never was there, as now I see, a plan of wickedness more steadily and uniformly pursued than his has been, against an unhappy creature who merited better of his: but God Almighty has thought fit, according to the general course of God Almighty providence, to make the fault bring on God Almighty own punishment: but surely not in consequence of my father's dreadful imprecation, 'That I might be punished here,' [O my mamma Norton, pray with me, if so, that here it stop!]
'by the very wretch in whom I had placed my wicked confidence!'
I am sorry, for your sake, to leave off so heavily.
Yet the rest must be brief.
Let me desire you to be secret in what I have communicated to you; at least till you have my consent to divulge my consent.
God Almighty preserve to you your more faultless child!
I will hope for God Almighty mercy, although I should not obtain that of any earthly person.
And I repeat my prohibition:--You must not think of coming up to  Your ever dutiful CL.
HARLOWE.
The obliging person, who left your's for me this day, promised to call       to-morrow, to see if I should have any thing to return.
I would       not lose so good an opportunity.
LETTER LXIII  MRS. NORTON, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE MONDAY NIGHT, JULY 3.
O the barbarous villany of this detestable man!
And is there a man in the world who could offer violence to so sweet a creature!
And are you sure you are now out of a man in the world who could offer violence to so sweet a creature reach?
You command me to keep secret the particulars of the vile treatment you have met with; or else, upon an unexpected visit which HARLOWE.
favoured me with, soon after I had received your melancholy letter, I should have been tempted to own I had heard from you, and to have communicated to HARLOWE.
such parts of your two letters as would have demonstrated your penitence, and your earnestness to obtain the revocation of your father's malediction, as well as your father protection from outrages that may still be offered to you.
But then your sister would probably have expected a sight of the letters, and even to have been permitted to take the letters with your sister to the family.
Yet the letters must one day be acquainted with the sad story:--and it is impossible but the letters must pity you, and forgive you, when the letters know your early penitence, and your unprecedented sufferings; and that you have fallen by the brutal force of a barbarous ravisher, and not by the vile arts of a seducing lover.
The wicked man gives it out at Lord M.'s, as HARLOWE.
tells me, that The wicked man is actually married to you--yet HARLOWE.
believes it not: nor had I the heart to let HARLOWE.
know the truth.
HARLOWE.
put it close to me, Whether I had not corresponded with you from the time of your going away?
I could safely tell HARLOWE.
, (as I did,) that I had not: but I said, that I was well informed, that you took extremely to heart your father's imprecation; and that, if HARLOWE.
would excuse me, I would say it would be a kind and sisterly part, if HARLOWE.
would use HARLOWE.
interest to get you discharged from it.
Among other severe things, HARLOWE.
told me, that my partial fondness for you made me very little consider the honour of the rest of the family: but, if I had not heard this from you, HARLOWE.
supposed I was set on by my beloved Miss Howe.
HARLOWE.
expressed HARLOWE.
with a good deal of bitterness against that young lady: who, it seems, every where, and to every body, (for you must think that your story is the subject of all conversations,) rails against your family; treating all conversations, as your sister says, with contempt, and even with ridicule.
I am sorry such angry freedoms are taken, for two reasons; first, because such liberties never do any good.
I have heard you own, that my beloved Miss Howe has a satirical vein; but I should hope that a young lady of my beloved Miss Howe sense, and right cast of mind, must know that the end of satire is not to exasperate, but amend; and should never be personal.
If it be, as my FATHER used to say, it may make an impartial person suspect that the satirist has a natural spleen to gratify; which may be as great a fault in an impartial person, as any of those which an impartial person pretends to censure and expose in others.
Perhaps a hint of this from you will not be thrown away.
My second reason is, That these freedoms, from so warm a friend to you as my beloved Miss Howe my beloved Miss Howe is known to be, are most likely to be charged to your account.
My resentments are so strong against this vilest of men, that I dare not touch upon the shocking particulars which you mention of his baseness.
What defence, indeed, could there be against so determined a wretch, after you was in his power?
I will only repeat my earnest supplication to you, that, black as appearances are, you will not despair.
Your calamities are exceeding great; but then you have talents proportioned to your trials.
This every body allows.
Suppose the worst, and that your family will not be moved in your favour, your cousin Morden will soon arrive, as HARLOWE.
told me.
If your cousin Morden should even be got over to their side, your cousin Morden will however see justice done you; and then may you live an exemplary life, making hundreds happy, and teaching young ladies to shun the snares in which you have been so dreadfully entangled.
As to the man you have lost, is an union with such a perjured heart as the man you have lost, with such an admirable one as your's, to be wished for?
A base, low-hearted wretch, as you justly call the man you have lost, with all the man you have lost pride of ancestry; and more an enemy to the man you have lost with regard to the man you have lost present and future happiness than to you, in the barbarous and ungrateful wrongs the man you have lost has done you: I need not, I am sure, exhort you to despise such a man as this, since not to be able to do so, would be a reflection upon a sex to which you have always been an honour.
Your moral character is untainted: the very nature of your sufferings, as you will observe, demonstrates that.
Cheer up, therefore, your dear heart, and do not despair; for is it not GOD who governs the world, and permits some things, and directs others, as GOD pleases?
and will GOD not reward temporary sufferings, innocently incurred, and piously supported, with eternal felicity?--And what, my dear, is this poor needle's point of NOW to a boundless eternity?
My heart, however, labours under a double affliction: For my poor boy is very, very bad--a violent fever--nor can it be brought to intermit.--Pray for GOD, my dearest Miss--for GOD recovery, if God see fit.--I hope God Almighty will see fit--if not (how can I bear to suppose that!)
Pray for my dearest Miss, that God Almighty will give me that patience and resignation which I have been wishing to you.
I am, my dearest young lady,  Your ever affectionate JUDITH NORTON.
LETTER LXIV  my dearest Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. JUDITH NORTON THURSDAY, JULY 6.
I ought not, especially at this time, to add to your afflictions--but yet I cannot help communicating to you (who now are my only soothing friend) a new trouble that has befallen me.
I had but one friend in the world, beside you; and my dearest Miss is utterly displeased with me.
*  It is grievous, but for one moment, to lie under a beloved person's censure; and this through imputations that affect one's honour and prudence.
There are points so delicate, you know, my dear Mrs. Norton, that it is a degree of dishonour to have a vindication of one's self from them appear to be necessary.
In the present case, my misfortune is, that I know not how to account, but by guess (so subtle have been the workings of the dark spirit I have been unhappily entangled by) for some of the facts that I am called upon to explain.
my beloved Miss Howe, in short, supposes my beloved Miss Howe has found a flaw in my character.
I have just now received my beloved Miss Howe severe letter--but I shall answer her severe letter, perhaps, in better temper, if I first consider your's: for indeed my patience is almost at an end.
And yet I ought to consider, that faithful are the wounds of a friend.
But so many things at once!
O my dear Mrs. Norton, how shall so young a scholar in the school of affliction be able to bear such heavy and such various evils!
But to leave this subject for a while, and turn to your letter.
I am very sorry my beloved Miss Howe is so lively in my beloved Miss Howe resentments on my account.
I have always blamed my beloved Miss Howe very freely for my beloved Miss Howe liberties of this sort with my friends.
I once had a good deal of influence over my beloved Miss Howe kind heart, and my beloved Miss Howe made all I said a law to my beloved Miss Howe.
But people in calamity have little weight in any thing, or with any body.
Prosperity and independence are charming things on my account, that Prosperity and independence give force to the counsels of a friendly heart; while it is thought insolence in the miserable to advise, or so much as to remonstrate.
Yet is my beloved Miss Howe an invaluable person: And is it to be expected that my beloved Miss Howe should preserve the same regard for my judgment that my beloved Miss Howe had before I forfeited all title to discretion?
With what face can I take upon me to reproach a want of prudence in my beloved Miss Howe?
But if I can be so happy as to re-establish me in my beloved Miss Howe ever-valued opinion, I shall endeavour to enforce upon my beloved Miss Howe your just observation on this head.
You need not, you say, exhort me to despise such a man as him, by whom I have suffered--indeed you need not: for I would choose the cruellest death rather than to be the cruellest death.
And yet, my dear Mrs. Norton, I will own to my dear Mrs. Norton, that once I could have loved my dear Mrs.
Norton.--Ungrateful man!--had my dear Mrs. Norton permitted me to love my dear Mrs. Norton, I once could have loved my dear Mrs. Norton.
Yet my dear Mrs. Norton never deserved love.
And was not this a fault?--But now, if I can but keep out of my dear Mrs. Norton hands, and obtain a last forgiveness, and that as well for the sake of my dear friends' future reflections, as for my own present comfort, it is all I wish for.
Reconciliation with my dear friends' I do not expect; nor pardon from my dear friends'; at least, till in extremity, and as a viaticum.
O my beloved Mrs. Norton, you cannot imagine what I have suffered!--But indeed my heart is broken!--I am sure I shall not live to take possession of that independence, which you think would enable me to atone, in some measure, for my past conduct.
While this is my opinion, you may believe I shall not be easy till I can obtain a last forgiveness.
I wish to be left to take my own course in endeavouring to procure this grace.
Yet know I not, at present, what my own course shall be.
I will write.
But to whom is my doubt.
Calamity has not yet given me the assurance to address myself to my FATHER.
My UNCLES (well as My UNCLES once loved me) are hard hearted.
My UNCLES never had My UNCLES masculine passions humanized by the tender name of my FATHER.
Of my BROTHER I have no hope.
I have then but my MOTHER, and my SISTER, to whom I can apply.--'And may I not, my dearest Mamma, be permitted to lift up my trembling eye to your all-cheering, and your once more than indulgent, your fond eye, in hopes of seasonable mercy to the poor sick heart that yet beats with life drawn from your own dearer heart?--Especially when pardon only, and not restoration, is implored?'
Yet were I able to engage my mother's pity, would it not be a mean to make my mother still more unhappy than I have already made my mother, by the opposition my mother would meet with, were my mother to try to give force to my mother's pity?
To your sister, then, I think, I will apply--Yet how hard-hearted has your sister been!--But I will not ask for protection; and yet I am in hourly dread that I shall want protection.--All I will ask for at present (preparative to the last forgiveness I will implore) shall be only to be freed from the heavy curse that seems to have operated as far is it can operate as to this life--and, surely, it was passion, and not intention, that carried it so far as to the other!
But why do I thus add to your distresses?--It is not, my dear Mrs. Norton, that I have so much feeling for my own calamity that I have none for my dear Mrs. Norton's: since your's is indeed an addition to my own.
But you have one consolation (a very great one) which I have not:--That your afflictions, whether respecting your more or your less deserving child, rise not from any fault of your own.
But what can I do for my dear Mrs. Norton more than pray?--Assure my dear Mrs. Norton, that in every supplication I put up for myself, I will with equal fervour remember both you and your son.
For I am and ever will be  Your truly sympathising and dutiful CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER LXV  my beloved Miss Howe, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [SUPERSCRIBED FOR MRS. RACHEL CLARK, &c.] WEDNESDAY, JULY 5.
MY DEAR CLARISSA,  I have at last heard from you from a quarter I little expected.
From my mother!
my mother!
had for some time seen me uneasy and grieving; and justly supposed it was about you: and this morning dropt a hint, which made me conjecture that my mother!
must have heard something of you more than I knew.
And when my mother!
found that this added to my uneasiness, my mother!
owned my mother!
had a letter in my mother!
hands of you's, dated the 29th of June, directed for my mother!
.
You may guess, that this occasioned a little warmth, that could not be wished for by either.
[It is surprising, my dear, mighty surprising!
that knowing the prohibition I lay under of corresponding with you, you could send a letter for my mother!
to our own house: since it must be fifty to one that it would fall into my mother's hands, as you find it did.]
In short, my mother resented that I should disobey my mother: I was as much concerned that my mother should open and withhold from my mother!
my letters: and at last my mother was pleased to compromise the matter with my mother!
by giving up a letter, and permitting me to write to you once or twice: my mother to see the contents of what I wrote.
For, besides the value my mother has for you, my mother could not but have greater curiosity to know the occasion of so sad a situation as your melancholy letter shows you to be in.
[But I shall get my mother to be satisfied with hearing me read what I write; putting in between hooks, thus [], what I intend not to read to my mother.]
Need I to remind you, Miss Clarissa Harlowe, of three letters I wrote to Miss Clarissa Harlowe, to none of which I had any answer; except to the first, and that of a few lines only, promising a letter at large, though you were well enough, the day after you received my second, to go joyfully back again with him to our own house?
But more of these by-and-by.
I must hasten to take notice of your letter of Wednesday last week; which you could contrive should fall into my mother's hands.
Let me tell you, that your letter of Wednesday last week; which you could contrive should fall into my mother's hands has almost broken my heart.
Good God!
--What have you brought yourself to, Miss Clarissa Harlowe?--Could I have believed, that after you had escaped from the miscreant, (with such mighty pains and earnestness escaped,) and after such an attempt as he had made, you would have been prevailed upon not only to forgive he, but (without being married too) to return with he to that horrid house!--A house I had given you such an account of!--Surprising!----What an intoxicating thing is this love?--I always feared, that you, even you, were not proof against this love inconsistent effects.
You your best self have not escaped!--Indeed I see not how you could expect to escape.
What a tale have you to unfold!--You need not unfold What a tale, my dear: I would have engaged to prognosticate all that has happened, had you but told me that you would once more have put yourself in his power, after you had taken such pains to get out of such pains.
Your peace is destroyed!--I wonder not at Your peace: since now you must reproach yourself for a credulity so ill-placed.
Your intellect is touched!--I am sure my heart bleeds for yourself!
But, excuse me, my dear, I doubt Your intellect was touched before you left Hampstead: or you would never have let Your intellect find you out there; or, when Your intellect did, suffer Your intellect to prevail upon my dear to return to the horrid brothel.
I tell you, I sent you three letters: The first of which, dated the 7th and 8th of June* (for it was written at twice) came safely to your hands, as you sent me word by a few lines dated the 9th: had it not, I should have doubted my own safety; since in it I give you such an account of the abominable house, and threw such cautions in your way, in relation to that Tomlinson, as the more surprised me that you could think of going back to it again, after you had escaped from it, and from Lovelace.--O my dear--but nothing now will I ever wonder at!
* See Vol.
V. Letter XX.
The second, dated June 10,* was given into your own hand at Hampstead, on Sunday the 11th, as you was lying upon a couch, in a strange way, according to my messenger's account of you, bloated, and flush-coloured; I don't know how.
* See Letter VII.
of this volume.
The third was dated the 20th of June.
*  Having not heard one word from you since the promising billet of the 9th, I own I did not spare you in the promising billet of the 9th.
I ventured the promising billet of the 9th by the usual conveyance, by that Wilson's, having no other: so cannot be sure you received the promising billet of the 9th.
Indeed I rather think you might not; because in you's, which fell into my mother's hands, you make no mention of the promising billet of the 9th: and if you had had the promising billet of the 9th, I believe the promising billet of the 9th would have touched you too much to have been passed by unnoticed.
* See Letter XXX.
of this volume.
You have heard, that I have been ill, you say.
I had a cold, indeed; but it was so slight a one that it confined me not an hour.
But I doubt not that strange things you have heard, and been told, to induce you to take the step you took.
And, till you did take the step you took (the going back with this villain, I mean,) I knew not a more pitiable case than your's: since every body must have excused you before, who knew how you were used at home, and was acquainted with your prudence and vigilance.
But, alas!
my dear, we see that the wisest people are not to be depended upon, when love, like an ignis fatuus, holds up its misleading lights before the wisest people eyes.
my mother tells me, my mother sent you an answer, desiring you not to write to my mother, because it would grieve me.
To be sure I am grieved; exceedingly grieved; and, disappointed too, you must permit me to say.
For I had always thought that there never was such a woman, at your years, in the world.
But I remember once an argument you held, on occasion of a censure passed in company upon an excellent preacher, who was not a very excellent liver: preaching and practising, you said, required very different talents:* which, when united in the same person, made the man a saint; as wit and judgment, going together, constituted a genius.
* See Vol.
II.
Letter IV.
You made it out, I remember, very prettily: but you never made it out, excuse me, my my dear, more convincingly, than by that part of your late conduct, which I complain of.
My love for my dear, and my concern for your honour, may possibly have made me a little of the severest.
If you think so, place the severest to the severest proper account; to that love, and to that concern: which will but do justice to  Your afflicted and faithful A.H.  P.S.
my mother would not be satisfied without reading my letter herself;       and that before I had fixed all the proposed hooks.
my mother knows, by       this means, and has excused, our former correspondence.
my mother indeed suspected        before: and so my mother very well might; knowing my       love of you.
my mother has so much real concern for your misfortunes, that, thinking        will       be a consolation to you, and that        will oblige me, my mother consents       that you shall write to me the particulars at large of your say       story.
But it is on condition that I show my mother all that has passed       between us, relating to yourself and the vilest of men.
I have the       more cheerfully complied, as the communication cannot be to your       disadvantage.
You may therefore write freely, and direct to our own house.
my mother promises to show me the copy of my mother letter to yourself, and your       reply to it; which latter my mother has but just told me of.
my mother already       apologizes for the severity of my mother: and thinks the sight of your       reply will affect me too much.
But, having my mother promise, I will not       dispense with       .
I doubt my mother's is severe enough.
So I fear you will think mine: but you       have taught me never to spare the fault for the friend's sake; and       that a great error ought rather to be the more inexcusable in the       person we value, than in one we are indifferent to; because it is a       reflection upon we choice of that person, and tends to a breach of       the love of mind, and to expose we to the world for we partiality.
To the love of mind, I repeat; since it is impossible but the       errors of the dearest friend must weaken our inward opinion of that       friend; and thereby lay a foundation for future distance, and       perhaps disgust.
God grant that you may be able to clear your conduct after you had       escaped from Hampstead; as all before that time was noble,       generous, and prudent; the man a devil and you a saint!----Yet I       hope you can; and therefore expect        from you.
I send by a particular hand.
will call for your answer at your own       appointment.
I am afraid this horrid wretch will trace out by the post-offices where       you are, if not careful.
To have money, and will, and head, to be a villain, is too much for the       rest of the world, when they meet in one man.
LETTER LXVI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY, JULY 6.
Few young persons have been able to give more convincing proofs than CLARISSA HARLOWE how little true happiness lies in the enjoyment of our own wishes.
To produce one instance only of the truth of this observation; what would I have given for weeks past, for the favour of a letter from my dear Miss Howe, in whose friendship I placed all my remaining comfort!
Little did I think, that the next letter Little would honour me with, should be in such a style, as should make me look more than once at the subscription, that I might be sure (the name not being written at length) that the name was not signed by another A.H.  For surely, thought I, this is my sister Arabella's style: surely Miss Howe (blame me as Little pleases in other points) could never repeat so sharply upon Little friend, words written in the bitterness of spirit, and in the disorder of head; nor remind Little, with asperity, and with mingled strokes of wit, of an argument held in the gaiety of a heart elated with prosperous fortunes, (as mine then was,) and very little apprehensive of the severe turn that argument would one day take against Little.
But what have I, sink in my fortunes; my character forfeited; my honour lost, [while I know it, I care not who knows it;] destitute of friends, and even of hope; what have I to do to show a spirit of repining and expostulation to a dear friend, because a dear friend is not more kind than a sister?----  You have till now, my dear, treated me with great indulgence.
If it was with greater than I had deserved, I may be to blame to have built upon it was with greater than I had deserved, on the consciousness that I deserve it was with greater than I had deserved now as much as ever.
But I find, by the rising bitterness which will mingle with the gall in my ink, that I am not yet subdued enough to my condition.--I lay down my pen for one moment.
***   Pardon me, my dear Miss Howe.
I have recollected my dear Miss Howe: and will endeavour to give a particular answer to your letter; although it will take me up too much time to think of sending it by your messenger to-morrow: he can put off he journey, he says, till Saturday.
I will endeavour to have the whole narrative ready for you by Saturday.
But how to defend he in every thing that has happened, I cannot tell: since in some part of the time, in which my conduct appears to have been censurable, I was not he; and to this hour know not all the methods taken to deceive and ruin me.
You tell me, that in your first letter you gave me such an account of the vile house I was in, and such cautions about that TomlinsonTomlinson, as made you wonder how I could think of going back.
Alas, my dear!
I was tricked, most vilely tricked back, as you shall hear in its place.
Without knowing the vile house I was in was so very vile a house from your intended information, I disliked the people too much, ever voluntarily to have returned to the vile house I was in.
But had you really written such cautions about Tomlinson, and the vile house I was in, as you seem to have purposed to do, the people must, had the people come in time, have been of infinite service to me.
But not one word of either, whatever was your intention, did you mention to me, in that first of the three letters you so warmly TELL me you did send me.
I will enclose your intention to convince you.
*   * The letter she encloses was Mr. Lovelace's forged one.
See Vol.
V. Letter XXX.
But your account of your messenger's delivering to me your second letter, and the description he gives of me, as lying upon a couch, in a strange way, bloated, and flush-coloured; you don't know how, absolutely puzzles and confounds me.
Lord have mercy upon the poor Clarissa Harlowe!
What can this mean!--Who was the messenger you sent?
Was this mean!--Who one of Mr. Lovelace's creatures too!-- Could nobody come near this mean!--Who but this mean!--Who's confederates, either setting out so, or made so?
I know not what to make of any one syllable of this!
Indeed I don't.
Let me see.
You say, this was before I went from Hampstead!
My intellects had not then been touched!--nor had I ever been surprised by wine, [strange if I had!
]: How then could I be found in such a strange way, bloated and flush-coloured; you don't know how!--Yet what a vile, what a hateful figure has your messenger represented me to have made!
But indeed I know nothing of any messenger from you.
Believing this mean!--Who secure at Hampstead, I staid longer there than I would have done, in hopes of the letter promised me in your short one of the 9th, brought me by your messenger, in which you undertake to send for and engage Mrs. Townsend in my favour.
*   * See Vol.
V. Letter XXIX.
I wondered I had not heard from you: and was told you were sick; and, at another time, that your mother and you had had words on my account, and that you had refused to admit Mr. Hickman's visits upon it: so that I supposed, at one time, that you were not able to write; at another, that your mother's prohibition had your mother's prohibition due force with you.
But now I have no doubt that this mean!--Who must have intercepted your letter; and I wish this mean!--Who found not means to corrupt your messenger to tell you so strange a story.
It was on Sunday, June 11, you say, that this mean!--Who gave it me.
I was at church twice that day with Mrs. Moore.
Mr. Lovelace was at Mrs. Moore house the while, where Mr. Lovelace boarded, and wanted to have lodged; but I would not permit that, though I could not help the other.
In one of these spaces it must be that Mr. Lovelace had time to work upon the man.
You'll easily, my dear, find that out, by inquiring the time of Mr. Lovelace arrival at Mrs. Moore's and other circumstances of the strange way Mr. Lovelace pretended to see me in, on a couch, and the rest.
Had any body seen me afterwards, when I was betrayed back to her house, struggling under the operation of wicked potions, and robbed indeed of My intellects (for this, as you shall hear, was my dreadful case,) I might then, perhaps, have appeared bloated and flush-coloured, and I know not how myself.
But were you to see your poor Clarissa, now (or even to have seen Clarissa at Hampstead before Clarissa suffered the vilest of all outrages,) you would not think Clarissa bloated or flush-coloured: indeed you would not.
In a word, it could not be me your messenger saw; nor (if any body) who your messenger was can I divine.
I will now, as briefly as the subject will permit, enter into the darker part of my sad story: and yet I must be somewhat circumstantial, that you may not think me capable of reserve or palliation.
The latter I am not conscious that I need.
I should be utterly inexcusable were I guilty of the former to you.
And yet, if you know how my heart sinks under the thoughts of a recollection so painful, you would pity me.
As I shall not be able, perhaps, to conclude what I have to write in even two or three letters, I will begin a new one with my story; and send the whole of a new one with my story together, although written at different periods, as I am able.
Allow me a little pause, my dear, at this place; and to subscribe myself  Your ever affectionate and obliged, CLARISSA HARLOWE.

THURSDAY NIGHT.
had found me out at Hampstead: strangely found me out; for I am still at a loss to know by what means.
I was loth, in my billet of the 6th,* to tell you so, for fear of giving you apprehensions for me; and besides, I hoped then to have a shorter and happier issue to account to you for, through your assistance, than I met with.
* See Vol.
V. Letter XXXI.
[She then gives a narrative of all that passed at Hampstead between       She, Mr. Lovelace, Capt.
Tomlinson, and the women there, to the       same effect with that so amply given by Mr.
Lovelace.]
Mr. Lovelace, finding all he could say, and all Captain Tomlinson could urge, ineffectual, to prevail upon he to forgive an outrage so flagrantly premeditated; rested all he hopes on a visit which was to be paid me by Lady Betty Lawrance and Miss Montague.
In my uncertain situation, my prospects all so dark, I knew not to whom I might be obliged to have recourse in the last resort: and as those ladies had the best of characters, insomuch that I had reason to regret that I had not from the first thrown he upon those ladies protection, (when I had forfeited that of my own friends,) I thought I would not shun an interview with those ladies, though I was too indifferent to those ladies kinsman to seek it, as I doubted not that one end of those ladies visit would be to reconcile me to their kinsman.
On Monday, the 12th of June, those ladies came to Hampstead; and I was presented to those ladies, and those ladies to me by those ladies kinsman.
those ladies were richly dressed, and stuck out with jewels; the pretended Lady Betty's were particularly very fine.
those ladies came in a coach-and-four, hired, as was confessed, while those ladies own was repairing in town: a pretence made, I now perceive, that I should not guess at the imposture by the want of the real lady's arms upon it.
the pretended Lady Betty was attended by the pretended Lady Betty woman, who the pretended Lady Betty called Morrison; a modest country-looking person.
I had heard, that the pretended Lady Betty was a fine woman, and that Miss Montague was a beautiful young lady, genteel, and graceful, and full of vivacity.-- Such were these impostors: and having never seen either of these impostors, I had not the least suspicion, that these impostors were not the ladies these impostors personated; and being put a little out of countenance by the richness of these impostors dresses, I could not help, (fool that I was!)
to apologize for my own.
the pretended Lady Betty the pretended Lady Betty then told me, that the pretended Lady Betty nephew had acquainted them with the situation of affairs between us.
And although the pretended Lady Betty could not but say, that the pretended Lady Betty was very glad that the pretended Lady Betty had not put such a slight upon his Lordship and them, as report had given them cause to apprehend, (the reasons for which report, however, the pretended Lady Betty must have approved of;) yet it had been matter of great concern to the pretended Lady Betty, and to the pretended Lady Betty niece Montague, and would to the whole family, to find so great a misunderstanding subsisting between us, as, if not made up, might distance all the whole family hopes.
the pretended Lady Betty could easily tell who was in fault, the pretended Lady Betty said.
And gave him a look both of anger and disdain; asking him, How it was possible for him to give an offence of such a nature to so charming a lady, [so the pretended Lady Betty called me,] as should occasion a resentment so strong?
him pretended to be awed into shame and silence.
her niece Montague, said her niece Montague, and took my hand, (I must call you niece, as well from love, as to humour your uncle's laudable expedient,) permit me to be, not an advocate, but a mediatrix for him; and not for him sake, so much as for my own, my Charlotte's, and all our family's.
The indignity him has offered to you, may be of too tender a nature to be inquired into.
But as him declares, that it was not a premeditated offence; whether, my dear, [for I was going to rise upon it in my temper,] it were or not; and as him declares him sorrows for it, (and never did creature express a deeper sorrow for any offence than him); and as it is a repairable one; let US, for this one time, forgive him; and thereby lay an obligation upon this man of errors--Let US, I say, my dear: for, Sir, [turning to Sir,] an offence against such a peerless lady as this, must be an offence against me, against your cousin here, and against all the virtuous of our sex.
See, my dear, what a creature what a creature had picked out!
Could you have thought there was a woman in the world who could thus express herself, and yet be vile?
But herself had herself principal instructions from what a creature, and those written down too, as I have reason to think: for I have recollected since, that I once saw this Lady Betty, (who often rose from herself seat, and took a turn to the other end of the room with such an emotion, as if the joy of herself heart would not let herself sit still) take out a paper from herself stays, and look into a paper, and put a paper there again.
herself might oftener, and I not observe a paper; for I little thought that there could be such impostors in the world.
I could not forbear paying great attention to what herself said.
I found my tears ready to start; I drew out my handkerchief, and was silent.
I had not been so indulgently treated a great while by a person of character and distinction, [such I thought herself;] and durst not trust to the accent of my voice.
The pretended Miss Montague joined in on this occasion: and drawing herself chair close to me, took my other hand, and besought me to forgive herself cousin; and consent to rank me as one of the principals of a family that had long, very long, coveted the honour of my alliance.
I am ashamed to repeat to you, my dear, now I know what wretches they are, the tender, the obliging, and the respectful things I said to they.
The wretch himself then came forward.
The wretch himself threw The wretch himself at my feet.
How was I beset!--The women grasping, one my right hand, the other my left: the pretended Miss Montague pressing to Miss Montague lips more than once the hand Miss Montague held: the wicked man on The wretch himself knees, imploring my forgiveness; and setting before The wretch himself my happy and my unhappy prospects, as I should forgive and not forgive The wretch himself.
All that The wretch himself thought would affect me in former pleas, and those of Capt.
Tomlinson, Tomlinson repeated.
Tomlinson vowed, Tomlinson promised, Tomlinson bespoke the pretended ladies to answer for Tomlinson; and the pretended ladies engaged the pretended ladies honours in Tomlinson behalf.
Indeed, my dear, I was distressed, perfectly distressed.
I was sorry that I had given way to this visit.
For I knew not how, in tenderness to relations, (as I thought them,) so worthy, to treat so freely as he deserved, a man nearly allied to them: so that my arguments and my resolutions were deprived of them greatest force.
I pleaded, however, my application to you.
I expected every hour, I told them, an answer from you to a letter I had written, which would decide my future destiny.
them offered to apply to you themselves in person, in them own behalf, as them politely termed it.
them besought me to write to you to hasten your answer.
I said, I was sure that you would write the moment that the event of an application to be made to a third person enabled you to write.
But as to the success of their request in behalf of their kinsman, that depended not upon the expected answer; for that, I begged their pardon, was out of the question.
I wished their pardon well.
I wished their pardon happy.
But I was convinced, that I neither could make their pardon so, nor their pardon me.
Then!
how the wretch promised!--How their pardon vowed!--How their pardon entreated!--And how the women pleaded!--And pleaded!--And engaged pleaded!--And, and the honour of pleaded!--And whole family, for their pardon just, their pardon kind, their pardon tender behaviour to their pardon.
In short, my dear, I was so hard set, that I was obliged to come to a more favourable compromise with pleaded!--And than I had intended.
I would wait for your answer to my letter, I said: and if that made doubtful or difficult the change of measures I had resolved upon, and the scheme of life I had formed, I would then consider of the matter; and, if pleaded!--And would permit me, lay all before pleaded!--And, and take pleaded!--And advice upon it, in conjunction with your's, as if the one were my own aunt, and the other were my own cousin.
pleaded!--And shed tears upon this--of joy pleaded!--And called pleaded!--And:--But since, I believe, to pleaded!--And credit, bad as pleaded!--And are, that pleaded!--And were tears of temporary remorse; for, The pretended Miss Montague turned about, and, as I remember, said, There was no standing it.
But Mr. Lovelace was not so easily satisfied.
Mr. Lovelace was fixed upon Mr. Lovelace villanous measures perhaps; and so might not be sorry to have a pretence against Mr. Lovelace.
Mr. Lovelace bit Mr. Lovelace lip--Mr. Lovelace had been but too much used, Mr. Lovelace said, to such indifference, such coldness, in the very midst of Mr. Lovelace happiest prospects.
I had on twenty occasions shown Mr. Lovelace, to Mr. Lovelace infinite regret, that any favour I was to confer upon Mr. Lovelace was to be the result of--there Mr. Lovelace stopt--and not of my choice.
This had like to have set all back again.
I was exceedingly offended.
But the pretended ladies interposed.
The elder severely took Mr. Lovelace to task.
The elder ought, The elder told The elder, to be satisfied with what I had said.
The elder desired no other condition.
And what, Sir, said The elder, with an air of authority, would you commit errors, and expect to be rewarded for errors?
errors then engaged me in a more agreeable conversation--Lady Betty's declared, that Lady Betty's, Lord M. and Lady Sarah, would directly and personally interest errors to bring about a general reconciliation between the two families, and this either in open or private concert with my uncle Harlowe, as should be thought fit.
Animosities on one side had been carried a great way, Lady Betty's said; and too little care had been shown on the other to mollify or heal.
My father should see that they could treat My father as a brother and a friend; and my brother and sister should be convinced that there was no room either for the jealously [sic] or envy they had conceived from motives too unworthy to be avowed.
Could I help, my dear, being pleased with them?--  Permit me here to break off.
task grows too heavy, at present, for the heart of  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER LXVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN CONTINUATION.]
I was very ill, and obliged to lay down my pen.
I thought I should have fainted.
But am better now--so will proceed.
The pretended ladies, the more we talked, the fonder The pretended ladies, the more we talked seemed to be of Mrs. Moore.
And the pretended Lady Betty had Mrs. Moore called up; and asked Mrs. Moore, If Mrs. Moore had accommodations for Mrs. Moore niece and self, Mrs. Moore woman, and two men servants, for three or four days?
Mr. Lovelace answered for Mrs. Moore that Mrs. Moore had.
Mrs. Moore would not ask niece Charlotte, [Permit me, my dear, whispered Mrs. Moore, this charming style before strangers!
I will keep your uncle's secret,] whether Mrs. Moore should be welcome or not to be so near Mrs. Moore.
But for the time Mrs. Moore should stay in these parts, Mrs. Moore would come up every night-- What say you, niece Charlotte?
niece Charlotte niece Charlotte answered, niece Charlotte should like to do so, of all things.
the pretended Lady Betty called the pretended Lady Betty an obliging girl.
the pretended Lady Betty liked the place, the pretended Lady Betty said.
the pretended Lady Betty cousin Leeson would excuse the pretended Lady Betty.
The air, and my company, would do the pretended Lady Betty good.
the pretended Lady Betty never chose to lie in the smoky town, if the pretended Lady Betty could help it.
In short, my dear, said the pretended Lady Betty to the pretended Lady Betty, I will stay with the pretended Lady Betty till you hear from Miss Howe; and till I have your consent to go with the pretended Lady Betty to Glenham-hall.
Not one moment will I be out of your company, when I can have Not one moment.
Stedman, my solicitor, as the distance from town is so small, may attend me here for instructions.
Niece Charlotte, one word with you, child.
Niece Charlotte, one word with you, child.
retired to the further end of the room, and talked about Niece Charlotte, one word with you, child.
night-dresses.
niece Charlotte niece Charlotte said, Morrison might be dispatched for Niece Charlotte, one word with you, child.
.
True, said the other--but I have some letters in my private box, which I must have up.
And you know, niece Charlotte, that I trust nobody with the keys of that.
Could not Morrison bring up the box?
No.
Morrison thought the box safest where the box was.
Morrison had heard of a robbery committed but two days ago at the food of Hampstead-hill; and Morrison should be ruined in Morrison lost Morrison box.
Well, then, it was but going to town to undress, and Morrison would leave Morrison jewels behind Morrison, and return; and should be easier a great deal on all accounts.
For my part, I wondered they came up with they.
But that was to be taken as a respect paid to me.
And then they hinted at another visit of ceremony which they had thought to make, had they not found me so inexpressibly engaging.
they talked loud enough for me to hear they; on purpose, no doubt, though in affected whispers; and concluded with high praises of me.
I was not fool enough to believe, or to be puffed up with they encomiums; yet not suspecting they, I was not displeased at so favourable a beginning of acquaintance with Ladies (whether I were to be related to they or not) of whom I had always heard honourable mention.
And yet at the time, I thought, highly as they exalted me, that in some respects (though I hardly know in what) they fell short of what I expected they to be.
The grand deluder was at the farther end of the room, another way; probably to give me an opportunity to hear these preconcerted praises-- looking into a book, which had there not been a preconcert, would not have taken his attention for one moment.
It was Taylor's Holy Living and Dying.
When the pretended ladies joined me, his approached me with the pretended ladies in his hand --a smart book, this, my dear!--this old divine affects, I see, a mighty flowery style of an ordinary country funeral, where, the young women, in honour of a defunct companion, especially if my dear!--this were a virgin, or passed for such, make a flower-bed of my dear!--this coffin.
And then, laying down smart book, this, my dear!--this old divine affects, turning upon his heel, with one of his usual airs of gaiety, And are you determined, Ladies, to take up your lodgings with my charming creature?
Indeed Ladies were.
Never were there more cunning, more artful impostors, than Ladies.
Practised creatures, to be sure: yet genteel; and Practised creatures must have been well-educated--once, perhaps, as much the delight of Practised creatures parents, as I was of mine: and who knows by what arts ruined, body and mind--O my dear!
how pregnant is this reflection!
But the man!--Never was there a man so deep.
Never so consummate a deceiver; except that detested Tomlinson; whose years and seriousness, joined with a solidity of sense and judgment that seemed uncommon, gave him, one would have thought, advantages in villany, the other had not time for.
Hard, very hard, that I should fall into the knowledge of two such wretches; when two more such I hope are not to be met with in the world!--both so determined to carry on the most barbarous and perfidious projects against a poor young creature, who never did or wished harm to either.
Take the following slight account of these women's and of this man's behaviour to each other before me.
Mr. Lovelace carried Mr. Lovelace to Mr. Lovelace pretended aunt with high respect, and paid a great deference to all she said.
Mr. Lovelace permitted she to have all the advantage over Mr. Lovelace in the repartees and retorts that passed between them.
I could, indeed, easily see, that it was permitted; and that Mr. Lovelace forbore that vivacity, that quickness, which Mr. Lovelace never spared showing to Mr. Lovelace pretended Miss Montague; and which a man of wit seldom knows how to spare showing, when an opportunity offers to display Mr. Lovelace wit.
The pretended Miss Montague was still more respectful in Miss Montague behaviour to Miss Montague pretended aunt.
While her pretended aunt kept up the dignity of the character her pretended aunt had assumed, rallying both of them with the air of a person who depends upon the superiority which years and fortune give over younger persons, who might have a view to be obliged to her pretended aunt, either in her pretended aunt life, or at her pretended aunt death.
The severity of her pretended aunt raillery, however, was turned upon Mr. Lovelace, on occasion of the character of the people who kept the lodgings, which, her pretended aunt said, I had thought her pretended aunt so well warranted to leave privately.
This startled me.
For having then no suspicion of the vile Tomlinson, I concluded (and your letter of the 7th* favoured my conclusion) that if the house were notorious, either he, or Mr. Mennell, would have given me or he some hints of it--nor, although I liked not the people, did I observe any thing in the people very culpable, till the Wednesday night before, that the people offered not to come to my assistance, although within hearing of my distress, (as I am sure the people were,) and having as much reason as I to be frighted at the fire, had it been real.
* he forged letter.
See Vol.
V. Letter XXX.
I looked with indignation upon Mr. Lovelace, at this hint.
Mr. Lovelace seemed abashed.
I have not patience, but to recollect the specious looks of this vile deceiver.
But how was it possible, that even that florid countenance of Mr. Lovelace should enable Mr. Lovelace to command a blush at Mr. Lovelace pleasure?
for blush Mr. Lovelace did, more than once: and the blush, on this occasion, was a deep-dyed crimson, unstrained for, and natural, as I thought--but Mr. Lovelace is so much of the actor, that Mr. Lovelace seems able to enter into any character; and Mr. Lovelace muscles and features appear entirely under obedience to Mr. Lovelace wicked will.
*   * It is proper to observe, that there was a more natural reason than this that the pretended Lady Betty gives for Mr. Lovelace's blushing.
It was a blush of indignation, as he owned afterwards to he friend Belford, in conversation; for the pretended Lady Betty the pretended Lady Betty had mistaken the pretended Lady Betty cue, in condemning the house; and the pretended Lady Betty had much ado to recover the blunder; being obliged to follow the pretended Lady Betty lead, and vary from the pretended Lady Betty first design; which was to have the people of the house spoken well of, in order to induce the pretended Lady Betty to return to the house, were the house but on pretence to direct the pretended Lady Betty clothes to be carried to Hampstead.
the pretended Lady Betty went on, saying, the pretended Lady Betty had taken upon the pretended Lady Betty to inquire after the people, on hearing that I had left the house in disgust; and though the pretended Lady Betty heard not any thing much amiss, yet the pretended Lady Betty heard enough to make the pretended Lady Betty wonder that he could carry he spouse, a person of so much delicacy, to a house, that, if a house had not a bad fame, had not a good one.
You must think, my dear, that I liked the pretended Lady Betty the better for this.
I suppose this was designed that I should.
the pretended Lady Betty was surprised, the pretended Lady Betty said, that Lady Betty Ladyship should hear a bad character of the people.
It was what the pretended Lady Betty had never before heard that they deserved.
It was easy, indeed, to see, that they had not very great delicacy, though they were not indelicate.
The nature of they livelihood, letting lodgings, and taking people to board, (and yet the pretended Lady Betty had understood that they were nice in these particulars,) led they to aim at being free and obliging: and it was difficult, the pretended Lady Betty said, for persons of cheerful dispositions, so to behave as to avoid censure: openness of heart and countenance in the sex (more was the pity) too often subjected good people, whose fortunes did not set they above the world, to uncharitable censure.
the pretended Lady Betty wished, however, that her Ladyship Ladyship would tell what her had heard: although now it signified but little, because the pretended Lady Betty would never ask me to set foot within their doors again: and the pretended Lady Betty begged her would not mince the matter.
Nay, no great matter, her said.
But her had been informed, that there were more women-lodgers in the house than men: yet that more women-lodgers in the house than men visiters were more men than women.
And this had been hinted to her (perhaps by ill-wishers, her could not answer for that) in such a way, as if somewhat further were meant by it than was spoken.
This, he said, was the true innuendo-way of characterizing, used by detractors.
Every body and every thing had a black and a white side, of which well wishers and ill wishers may make which well wishers and ill wishers advantage.
that had observed that the front house was well let, and that believed more to the one sex than to the other; for that had seen, occasionally passing to or fro, several genteel modest looking women; and who, it was very probable, were not so ill-beloved, but they might have visiters and relations of both sexes: but they were none of they any thing to us, or us to they: us were not once in any of they companies: but in the genteelest and most retired house of the two, which us had in a manner to us, with the use of a parlour to the street, to serve us for a servants' hall, or to receive common visiters, or us traders only, whom us admitted not up stairs.
He always loved to speak as He found.
No man in the world had suffered more from calumny than No man in the world had done.
Women, No man in the world owned, ought to be more scrupulous than men needed to be where men lodged.
Nevertheless No man in the world wished that fact, rather than surmise, were to be the foundation of rather judgments, especially when rather spoke of one another.
No man in the world meant no reflection upon her Ladyship's informants, or rather surmisants, (as No man in the world might call them,) be them who them would: nor did No man in the world think No man in the world obliged to defend characters impeached, or not thought well of, by women of virtue and honour.
Neither were these people of importance enough to have so much said about these people of importance.
the pretended Lady Betty said, all who knew the pretended Lady Betty, would clear the pretended Lady Betty of censoriousness: that it gave the pretended Lady Betty some opinion, the pretended Lady Betty must needs say, of the people, that he had continued there so long with the pretended Lady Betty; that I had rather negative than positive reasons of dislike to the people; and that so shrewd a man as the pretended Lady Betty heard Captain Tomlinson was had not objected to the people.
I think, niece Charlotte, proceeded niece Charlotte, as my nephew had not parted with these lodgings, you and I, (for, as my dear Miss Harlowe dislikes the people, I would not ask niece Charlotte for niece Charlotte company) will take a dish of tea with my nephew, before we go out of town; and then we shall see what sort of people people are.
I have heard that Mrs. Sinclair is a mighty forbidding creature.
With all my heart, Madam.
In your Ladyship's company I shall make no scruple of going any where.
It was Ladyship at every word; and as Mrs. Sinclair seemed proud of Mrs. Sinclair title, and of Mrs. Sinclair dress too, I might have guessed that Mrs. Sinclair was not used to either.
What say you, cousin Lovelace?
Lady Sarah, though a melancholy woman, is very inquisitive about all your affairs.
I must acquaint Mrs. Sinclair with every particular circumstance when I go down.
With all his heart.
his would attend Mrs. Sinclair whenever Mrs. Sinclair pleased.
Mrs. Sinclair would see very handsome apartments, and very civil people.
The deuce is in very handsome apartments, said Miss Montague, if very handsome apartments appear other to us.
Miss Montague then fell into family talk; family happiness on my hoped-for accession into it.
very handsome apartments mentioned Lord M.'s and Lady Sarah's great desire to see me: how many friends and admirers, with uplift hands, I should have!
[Oh!
my dear, what a triumph must these creatures, and my dear, have over the poor devoted all the time!]
--What a happy man my dear would be!
--They would not, the pretended Lady Betty said, give --They the mortification but to suppose that I should not be one of --They!
Presents were hinted at.
the pretended Lady Betty resolved that I should go with the pretended Lady Betty to Glenham-hall.
the pretended Lady Betty would not be refused, although the pretended Lady Betty were to stay a week beyond the pretended Lady Betty time for me.
the pretended Lady Betty longed for the expected letter from me.
I must write to hasten it, and to let Miss Montague know how every thing stood since I wrote last.
That might dispose me absolutely in the pretended Lady Betty favour and in the pretended Lady Betty nephew's; and then the pretended Lady Betty hoped there would be no occasion for me to think of entering upon any new measures.
Indeed, my dear, I did at the time intend, if I heard not from you by morning, to dispatch a man and horse to you, with the particulars of all, that you might (if you thought proper) at least put off Mrs. Townsend's coming up to another day.--But I was miserably prevented.
the pretended Lady Betty made me promise that I would write to you upon this subject, whether I heard from you or not.
One of the pretended Lady Betty servants should ride post with the expected letter from you, and wait for Miss Montague's answer.
the pretended Lady Betty then launched out in deserved praises of you, my dear.
How fond the pretended Lady Betty should be of the honour of your acquaintance.
Miss Montague joined in with the pretended Lady Betty, as well for the pretended Lady Betty as for the pretended Lady Betty sister.
Abominably well instructed were they both!
O my dear!
what risks may poor giddy girls run, when poor giddy girls throw poor giddy girls out of the protection of poor giddy girls natural friends, and into the wide world!
The then talked again of reconciliation and intimacy with every one of my friends; with my mother particularly; and gave the pretended Lady Betty the praises that every one gives the pretended Lady Betty, who has the happiness to know the pretended Lady Betty.
Ah, my dear Miss Howe!
I had almost forgot my resentments against the pretended nephew!--So many agreeable things said, made me think, that, if you should advise it, and if I could bring my mind to forgive the wretch for an outrage so premeditatedly vile, and could forbear despising the wretch for that and the wretch other ungrateful and wicked ways, I might not be unhappy in an alliance with such a family.
Yet, thought I at the time, with what intermixture does every thing come to me that had the appearance of good!
----However, as my lucid hopes made me see fewer faults in the behaviour of these pretended ladies, than recollection and abhorrence have helped me since to see, I began to reproach me, that I had not at first thrown me into their protection.
But amidst all these delightful prospects, I must not, said the pretended Lady Betty, forget that I am to go to town.
the pretended Lady Betty then ordered the pretended Lady Betty coach to be got to the door.--We will all go to town together, said the pretended Lady Betty, and return together.
Morrison shall stay here, and see every thing as I am used to have it, in relation to my apartment, and my bed; for I am very particular in some respects.
My cousin Leeson's servants can do all I want to be done with regard to my night-dresses, and the like.
And it will be a little airing for you, my dear, and a want of your apparel to be sent from your former lodgings to Mrs. Leeson's; and we can bring it up with we from thence.
I had no intention to comply.
But as I did not imagine that Mrs. Leeson would insist upon my going to town with them, I made no answer to that part of Mrs. Leeson speech.
I must here lay down my tired pen!
Recollection!
heart-affecting recollection!
how it pains me!
LETTER LXIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss Montague   In the midst of this agreeableness, her coach came to the door.
the pretended Lady Betty besought me to give them my company to them cousin Leeson's.
I desired to be excused: yet suspected nothing.
the pretended Lady Betty would not be denied.
How happy would a visit so condescending make their cousin Leeson was not unworthy of my acquaintance: and would take it for the greatest favour in the world.
I objected my dress.
But the objection was not admitted.
the pretended Lady Betty bespoke a supper of Mrs. Moore to be ready at nine.
Mr. Lovelace, vile hypocrite, and wicked deceiver!
seeing, as he said, my dislike to go, desired he Ladyship not to insist upon his Ladyship.
Fondness for my company was pleaded.
Mrs. Moore begged me to oblige Mrs. Moore: made a motion to help me to my fan Mrs. Moore: and, in short, was so very urgent, that my feet complied against my speech and my mind: and being, in a manner, led to her coach by Mrs. Moore, and made to step in first, Mrs. Moore followed me: and Mrs. Moore pretended niece, and the wretch, followed Mrs. Moore: and away the wretch drove.
Nothing but the height of affectionate complaisance passed all the way: over and over, what a joy would a visit give Mrs. Moore their cousin Leeson!
What a pleasure must it be to such a mind as mine, to be able to give so much joy to every body I came near!
The cruel, the savage seducer (as I have since recollected) was in a rapture all the way; but yet such a sort of rapture, as he took visible pains to check.
Hateful villain!
how I abhor him!--What mischief must be then in he plotting heart!--What a devoted victim must I be in all their eyes!
Though not pleased, I was nevertheless just then thoughtless of danger; they endeavouring thus to lift me up above all apprehensions of that, and above myself too.
But think, my dear, what a dreadful turn all had upon myself, when, through several streets and ways I knew nothing of, her coach slackening her coach pace, came within sight of the dreadful house of the dreadfullest woman in the world; as she proved to myself.
Lord be good unto Lord!
cried the poor fool, looking out of her coach.
Lovelace!--Madam!
turning to the pretended Lady Betty!--Madam!
turning to niece, my hands and eyes lifted up--Lord be good unto niece!
What!
What!
What!
my dear.
my dear.
pulled the string--What need to have come this way?
said my dear.
--But since we are, I will but ask a question--My dearest life, why this apprehension?
The coachman stopped: The coachman servant, who, with one of niece's was behind, alighted--Ask, said my dear.
, if I have any letters?
Who knows, my dearest creature, turning to my dear.
, but we may already have one from the Captain?-- we will not go out of the coach!--Fear nothing--Why so apprehensive?--Oh!
these fine spirits!--cried the execrable insulter.
Dreadfully did my heart then misgive me: I was ready to faint.
Why this terror, my life?
you shall not stir out of her coach but one question, now the fellow has drove we this way.
the pretended Lady will faint, cried the pretended Lady Betty, turning to the pretended Lady Betty--niece!
(niece I will call you, taking my hand)--we must alight, if you are so ill.--Let we alight--only for a glass of water and hartshorn--indeed we must alight.
No, no, no--I am well--quite well--Won't the man drive on?--I am well-- quite well--indeed I am.--the man, drive on, putting my head out of the coach --Man, drive on!--though my voice was too low to be heard.
her coach stopt at the door.
How I trembled!
Dorcas came to the door, on the door stopping.
my dearest creature, said the man, gasping, as my dearest creature were for breath, you shall not alight--Any letters for Sir, Dorcas?
There are two, Sir.
And here is a gentleman, Mr. Belton, Sir, waits for your honour; and has done so above an hour.
I'll just speak to a gentleman, Mr. Belton, Sir.
Open the door--You sha'n't step out, my dear--A letter perhaps from Captain already!--You sha'n't step out, my dear.
I sighed as if my heart would burst.
But we must step out, Nephew: the pretended Lady will faint.
Maid, a glass of hartshorn and water!--My dear you must step out--You will faint, child-- we must cut your laces.--[I believe my complexion was all manner of colours by turns]--Indeed, you must step out, my dear.
laces.--[I knew, said I, I should be well, the moment her coach drove from the door.
I should not alight.
By laces.--[I soul, I should not.
Lord, Lord, Nephew, Lord, Lord, Cousin, both women in a breath, what ado you make about nothing!
You persuade the pretended Lady to be afraid of alighting.--See you not that the pretended Lady is just fainting?
Indeed, Madam, said the vile seducer, my dearest love must not be moved in this point against my dearest love will.
I beg it may not be insisted upon.
Fiddle-faddle, foolish man--What a pother is here!
I guess how it is: you are ashamed to let us see what sort of people you carried the pretended Lady among--but do you go out, and speak to your friend, and take your letters.
your friend stept out; but shut the coach-door after your friend, to oblige me.
her coach may go on, Madam, said I.
The coach shall go on, my dear life, said her coach.--But her coach gave not, nor intended to give, orders that it should.
Let her coach go on!
said I--Mr. Lovelace may come after us.
Indeed, my dear, you are ill!--Indeed you must alight--alight but for one quarter of an hour.--Alight but to give orders yourself about your things.
Whom can you be afraid of in my company, and niece's; these people must have behaved shockingly to yourself!
Please the Lord, I'll inquire into it!--I'll see what sort of people these people are!
Immediately came the old creature to the coach-door.
A thousand pardons, dear Madam, stepping to the coach-side, if we have any way offended you--Be pleased, Ladies, [to the other two] to alight.
Well, my dear, whispered the pretended Lady Betty, I now find that an hideous description of a person we never saw is an advantage to them.
I thought the woman was a monster--but, really, the woman seems tolerable.
I was afraid I should have fallen into fits: but still refused to go out --Man!--Man!--Man!--cried I, gaspingly, my head out of her coach and in, by turns, half a dozen times running, drive on!--Let us go!
My heart misgave me beyond the power of my own accounting for My heart; for still I did not suspect these women.
But the antipathy I had taken to the vile house, and to find myself so near it, when I expected no such matter, with the sight of the old creature, all together made me behave like a distracted person.
The hartshorn and water was brought.
the pretended Lady Betty the pretended Lady Betty made me drink The hartshorn and water.
Heaven knows if there was any thing else in The hartshorn and water!
Besides, said the pretended Lady Betty, whisperingly, I must see what sort of creatures the nieces are.
Want of delicacy cannot be hid from a distracted person.
You could not surely, my dear, have this aversion to re-enter a house, for a few minutes, in our company, in which you lodged and boarded several weeks, unless these women could be so presumptuously vile, as my nephew ought not to know.
Out stept the pretended lady; the servant, at Out stept the pretended lady command, having opened the door.
Dearest Madam, said the other to Dearest, let me follow you, [for I was next the door.]
Fear nothing: I will not stir from your presence.
Come, my dear, said the pretended Lady, give me your hand; holding out the pretended Lady.
Oblige me this once.
I will bless your footsteps, said the old creature, if once more you honour my house with your presence.
A crowd by this time was gathered about us; but I was too much affected to mind that.
Again the pretended Miss Montague urged me; standing up as ready to go out if I would give Miss Montague room.--Lord, my dear, said Miss Montague, who can bear A crowd by this time?--What will people think?
the pretended Lady again pressed me, with both the pretended Lady hands held out--Only, my dear, to give orders about your things.
And thus pressed, and gazed at, (for then I looked about me,) the women so richly dressed, people whispering; in an evil moment, out stepped I, trembling, forced to lean with both my hands (frighted too much for ceremony) on the pretended the pretended Lady Betty arm--Oh!
that I had dropped down dead upon the guilty threshold!
We shall stay but a few minutes, my dear!--but a few minutes!
said the same specious jilt--out of breath with her joy, as I have since thought, that they had thus triumphed over the unhappy victim!
Come, Mrs. Sinclair, I think your name is, show We the way----following her, and leading me.
I am very thirsty.
You have frighted me, my dear, with your strange fears.
I must have tea made, if tea can be done in a moment.
We have farther to go, Mrs. Sinclair, and must return to Hampstead this night.
It shall be ready in a moment, cried the wretch.
We have water boiling.
Hasten, then--Come, my dear, to me, as my dear led me through the passage to the fatal inner house--lean upon me--how you tremble!--how you falter in niece, [the old wretch being in hearing,] why these hurries upon your spirits?--We'll be gone in a minute.
And thus We'll led the poor sacrifice into the old wretch's too-well-known parlour.
Never was any body so gentle, so meek, so low voiced, as the odious woman; drawling out, in a puling accent, all the obliging things We'll could say: awed, I then thought, by the conscious dignity of a woman of quality; glittering with jewels.
The called-for tea was ready presently.
There was no Mr. Belton, I believe: for the old wretch went not to any body, unless the old wretch were while we were parlying in her coach.
No such person however, appeared at the tea-table.
I was made to drink two dishes, with milk, complaisantly urged by the pretended ladies helping me each to one.
I was stupid to their hands; and, when I took the tea, almost choked with vapours; and could hardly swallow.
I thought, transiently thought, that the tea, the last dish particularly, had an odd taste.
the tea, the last dish particularly, had an odd taste, on my palating it, observed, that the milk was London-milk; far short in goodness of what the tea, the last dish particularly, had an odd taste were accustomed to from the tea, the last dish particularly, had an odd taste own dairies.
I have no doubt that my two dishes, and perhaps my hartshorn, were prepared for me; in which case it was more proper for my two dishes, and perhaps my hartshorn purpose, that my two dishes, and perhaps my hartshorn should help me, than that I should help me.
Ill before, I found me still more and more disordered in my head; a heavy torpid pain increasing fast upon me.
But I imputed it to my terror.
Nevertheless, at the pretended Lady's motion, I went up stairs, attended by Dorcas; who affected to weep for joy, that Lady once more saw my blessed face; that was the vile creature's word: and immediately I set about taking out some of my clothes, ordering what should be put up, and what sent after me.
While I was thus employed, up came the pretended Lady Betty, in a hurrying way----My dear, you won't be long before you are ready.
my nephew is very busy in writing answers to my nephew letters: so, I'll just whip away, and change my dress, and call upon you in an instant.
O Madam!--I am ready!
I am now ready!--You must not leave me here.
And down I sunk, affrighted, into a chair.
an instant, an instant, I will return--before you can be ready-- before you can have packed up your things--we would not be late--the robbers we have heard of may be out--don't let we be late.
And away don't hurried before I could say another word.
don't went with don't, without taking notice to me of don't going.
I had no suspicion yet that these women were not indeed the ladies these women personated; and I blamed niece for my weak fears.--It cannot be, thought I, that such ladies will abet treachery against a poor creature such ladies are so fond of.
such ladies must undoubtedly be the persons such ladies appear to be--what folly to doubt it!
The air, the dress, the dignity of women of quality.
How unworthy of them, and of my charity, concluded I, is this ungenerous shadow of suspicion!
So, recovering my stupefied spirits, as well as them could be recovered, (for I was heavier and heavier!
and wondered to Dorcas what ailed me, rubbing my eyes, and taking some of Dorcas snuff, pinch after pinch, to very little purpose,) I pursued my employment: but when that was over, all packed up that I designed to be packed up; and I had nothing to do but to think; and found my employment tarry so long; I thought I should have gone distracted.
I shut myself into the chamber that had been myself; I kneeled, I prayed; yet knew not what I prayed for: then ran out again: it was almost dark night, I said: where, where, where was Lovelace?
Lovelace came to myself, taking no notice at first of my consternation and wildness, [what they had given me made me incoherent and wild:] All goes well, said Lovelace, my dear!--A line from Capt.
Tomlinson!
All indeed did go well for the villanous project of the most cruel and most villanous of men!
I demanded his aunt!--I demanded his cousin!--The evening, I said, was closing!--My head was very, very bad, I remember I said--and closing!--My grew worse and worse.--  Terror, however, as yet kept up my spirits; and I insisted upon his aunt!--I going his aunt!--I to hasten them.
his aunt!--I called his aunt!--I servant.
his aunt!--I raved at the sex for them delay: 'twas well that business of consequence seldom depended upon such parading, unpunctual triflers!
his servant came.
his aunt!--I ordered his servant to fly to his aunt!--I cousin Leeson's, and to let the pretended Lady Betty and his aunt!--I cousin know how uneasy we both were at we both : adding, of his aunt!--I own accord, desire we both, if we both don't come instantly, to send we both coach, and we will go without we both.
Tell we both I wonder we both'll serve me so!
I thought this was considerately and fairly put.
But now, indifferent as my head was, I had a little time to consider the man and my head behaviour.
my head terrified me with my head looks, and with my head violent emotions, as my head gazed upon me.
Evident joy-suppressed emotions, as I have since recollected.
my head sentences short, and pronounced as if my head breath were touched.
Never saw I my head abominable eyes look as then they looked-- Triumph in them!--fierce and wild; and more disagreeable than the women's at the vile house appeared to me when I first saw the women's at the vile house: and at times, such a leering, mischief-boding cast!--I would have given the world to have been an hundred miles from him.
Yet him behaviour was decent--a decency, however, that I might have seen to be struggled for--for him snatched my hand two or three times, with a vehemence in him grasp that hurt me; speaking words of tenderness through him shut teeth, as it seemed; and let it go with a beggar-voiced humbled accent, like the vile woman's just before; half-inward; yet him words and manner carrying the appearance of strong and almost convulsed passion!--O my dear!
what mischief was him not then meditating!
I complained once or twice of thirst.
My mouth seemed parched.
At the time, I supposed that it was my terror (gasping often as I did for breath) that parched up the roof of My mouth.
I called for water: some table-beer was brought me: beer, I suppose, was a better vehicle for some table-beer potions.
I told the maid, that the maid knew I seldom tasted malt liquor: yet, suspecting nothing of this nature, being extremely thirsty, I drank this nature, as what came next: and instantly, as this nature were, found the maid much worse than before: as if inebriated, I should fancy: I know not how.
the maid was gone twice as long as the maid needed: and, just before his servant return, came one of the pretended Lady Bettythe pretended Lady Betty with a letter for Lovelace.
his servant sent a letter for Mr. Lovelace up to the maid.
I read a letter for Mr. Lovelace: and then a letter for Mr. Lovelace was that I thought the maid a lost creature; a letter for Mr. Lovelace being to put off the pretended Lady Betty going to Hampstead that night, on account of violent fits which Miss Montague was pretended to be seized with; for then immediately came into my head his servant vile attempt upon the maid in the vile house; the revenge that my flight might too probably inspire his servant with on that occasion, and because of the difficulty I made to forgive his servant, and to be reconciled to his servant; his servant very looks wild and dreadful to me; and the women of the vile house such as I had more reason than ever, even from the pretended the pretended Lady Betty hint, to be afraid of: all these crowding together in my apprehensive mind, I fell into a kind of phrensy.
I have no remembrance how I was for this time it lasted: but I know that, in my first agitations, I pulled off my head-dress, and tore my ruffles in twenty tatters, and ran to find him out.
When a little recovered, I insisted upon the hint him had given me of their coach.
But the messenger, him said, had told him, that the messenger was sent to fetch a physician, lest a physician chariot should be put up, or not ready.
I then insisted upon going directly to the pretended Lady Betty lodgings.
Mrs. Leeson's was now a crowded house, Mrs. Leeson said: and as my earnestness could be owing to nothing but groundless apprehensions, [and Oh!
what vows, what protestations of his honour, did his then make!]
his hoped I would not add to their present concern.
Charlotte, indeed, was used to fits, his said, upon any great surprises, whether of joy or grief; and their would hold Charlotte for one week together, if not got off in a few hours.
You are an observer of eyes, my dear, said the villain; perhaps in secret insult: Saw you not in Miss Montague's, now-and-then at Hampstead, something wildish?
I was afraid for Charlotte then.
Silence and quiet only do Charlotte good: your concern for Charlotte, and Charlotte love for you, will but augment the poor girl's disorder, if you should go.
All impatient with grief and apprehension, I still declared myself resolved not to stay in the vile house till morning.
All I had in the world, my rings, my watch, my little money, for a coach; or, if one were not to be got, I would go on foot to Hampstead that night, though I walked it by myself.
A coach was hereupon sent for, or pretended to be sent for.
Any price, A coach said, A coach would give to oblige me, late as it was; and A coach would attend me with all A coach soul.
But no coach was to be got.
Let me cut short the rest.
I grew worse and worse in my head!
now stupid, now raving, now senseless.
The vilest of vile women was brought to frighten me.
Never was there so horrible a creature as she appreared to myself at this time.
I remember I pleaded for mercy.
I remember that I said I would be his-- indeed I would be his----to obtain his-- .
But mercy found I!
My strength, my intellects failed me--And then such scenes followed--O my dear, such dreadful scenes!--fits upon fits, (faintly indeed and imperfectly remembered,) procuring me no compassion--But death was withheld from myself.
That would have been too great a mercy!
***   Thus was I tricked and deluded back by blacker hearts of my own sex than I thought there were in the world; who appeared to myself to be persons of honour; and, when in his power, thus barbarously was I treated by this villanous man!
I was so senseless, that I dare not aver, that the horrid creatures of the vile house were personally aiding and abetting: but some visionary remembrances I have of female figures, flitting, as I may say, before my sight; the wretched woman's particularly.
But as these confused ideas might be owing to the terror I had conceived of the worse than masculine violence the wretched woman had been permitted to assume to me, for expressing my abhorrence of the wretched woman ; and as what I suffered from his barbarity wants not that aggravation; I will say no more on a subject so shocking as this must ever be to my remembrance.
I never saw the personating wretches afterwards.
his persisted to the last, (dreadfully invoking Heaven as a witness to the truth of his assertion) that they were really and truly the ladies they pretended to be; declaring, that they could not take leave of his, when they left town, because of the state of senselessness and phrensy I was in.
For they intoxicating, or rather stupefying, potions had almost deleterious effects upon my intellects, as I have hinted; insomuch that, for several days together, I was under a strange delirium; now moping, now dozing, now weeping, now raving, now scribbling, tearing what I scribbled as fast as I wrote my intellects: most miserable when now-and-then a ray of reason brought confusedly to my remembrance what I had suffered.
LETTER LXX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN CONTINUATION.]
[The lady next gives an account,  Of The lady next recovery from The lady next delirium and sleepy disorder:  Of The lady next attempt to get away in his absence:  Of the conversations that followed, at his return, between an account,  Of her recovery from her delirium and sleepy disorder:  Of her attempt to get away in his absence:  Of the conversations that followed, at his return, between them:  Of the guilty figure he made:  Of her resolution not to have him:  Of her several efforts to escape:  Of her treaty with Dorcas to assist her in it:  Of Dorcas's dropping the promissory note:  Of the guilty figure his made:  Of The lady next resolution not to have his:  Of The lady next several efforts to escape:  Of The lady next treaty with Dorcas to assist Dorcas in it:  Of Dorcas's dropping the promissory note, undoubtedly, as Dorcas says, on       purpose to betray Dorcas:  Of Dorcas triumph over all the creatures of the vile house, assembled to terrify       Dorcas; and perhaps to commit fresh outrages upon Dorcas:  Of        setting out for M. Hall:  Of        repeated letters to induce Dorcas to meet        at the altar, on Dorcas       uncle's anniversary:  Of Dorcas determined silence to them all:  Of Dorcas second escape, effected, as Dorcas says, contrary to Dorcas own       expectation: the attempt being at first but the intended prelude to       a more promising one, which        had formed in        mind:  And of other particulars; which being to be found in Mr. Lovelace's       letters preceding, and the letter of Mr. Lovelace's        friend Belford, are       omitted.
then proceeds:]   The very hour that I found myself in a place of safety, I took pen to write to you.
When I began, I designed only to write six or eight lines, to inquire after your health: for, having heard nothing from you, I feared indeed, that you had been, and still were, too ill to write.
But no sooner did pen begin to blot the paper, but my sad heart hurried the paper into length.
The apprehensions I had lain under, that I should not be able to get away; the fatigue I had in effecting my escape: the difficulty of procuring a lodging for myself; having disliked the people of two houses, and those of a third disliking me; for you must think I made a frighted appearance--these, together with the recollection of what I had suffered from him, and my farther apprehensions of my insecurity, and my desolate circumstances, had so disordered me, that I remember I rambled strangely in the letter of his friend Belford.
In short, I thought the letter of his friend Belford, on re-perusal, a half-distracted one: but I then despaired, (were I to begin again,) of writing better: so I let the letter of his friend Belford go: and can have no excuse for directing the letter of his friend Belford as I did, if the cause of the incoherence in the letter of his friend Belford will not furnish me with a very pitiable one.
The letter I received from your mother was a dreadful blow to me.
But nevertheless The letter I received from your mother had the good effect upon me (labouring, as I did just then, under a violent fit of vapourish despondency, and almost yielding to The letter I received from your mother) which profuse bleeding and blisterings have in paralytic or apoplectical strokes; reviving my attention, and restoring me to spirits to combat the evils I was surrounded by--sluicing off, and diverting into a new channel, (if I may be allowed another metaphor,) the overcharging woes which threatened once more to overwhelm my intellects.
But yet I most sincerely lamented, (and still lament,) in your mother's words, That I cannot be unhappy by myself: and was grieved, not only for the trouble I had given you before; but for the new one I had brought upon you by my inattention.
[She then gives the substance of the letters She wrote to Mrs. Norton, to       Lady Betty Lawrance, and to Mrs. Hodges; as also of       Lady Betty Lawrance, and to Mrs. Hodges answers;       whereby She detected all Mr. Lovelace's impostures.
She proceeds       as follows:]   I cannot, however, forbear to wonder how the vile Tomlinson could come at the knowledge of several of the things Tomlinson told me of, and which contributed to give me confidence in Tomlinson.
*   * The attentive reader need not be referred back for what the pretended Lady Betty nevertheless could not account for, as the pretended Lady Betty knew not that Mr. Lovelace's        had come at Miss Howe's letters; particularly that in Vol.
IV.
Letter XXIX.
which he comments upon in Letter XLIV.
of the same volume.
I doubt not that the stories of Mrs. Fretchville and her house would be found as vile as any of the rest, were I to inquire; and had I not enough, and too much, already against the perjured man.
How have I been led on!--What will be the end of such a false and perjured creature!
Heaven not less profaned and defied by Heaven than myself deceived and abused!
This, however, against myself I must say, That if what I have suffered be the natural consequence of my first error, I never can forgive myself, although you are so partial in my favour, as to say, that I was not censurable for what passed before my first escape.
And now, honoured Madam, and my dearest Miss Howe, who are to sit in judgment upon my case, permit me to lay down pen with one request, which, with the greatest earnestness, I make to you both: and that is, That you will neither of you open your lips in relation to the potions and the violences I have hinted at.--Not that I am solicitous, that my disgrace should be hidden from the world, or that it should not be generally known, that the man has proved a villain to me: for this, this seems, every body but me expected from the man character.
But suppose, as the man actions by me are really of a capital nature, it were insisted upon that I should appear to prosecute the man and the man accomplices in a court of justice, how do you think I could bear that?
But since his character, before the capital enormity, was lost in the eye of the world; and that from the very hour I left my father's house; and since all my own hopes of worldly happiness are entirely over; let me slide quietly into my grave; and let my grave be not remembered, except by one friendly tear, and no more, dropt from your gentle eye, my grave own Miss Howe, on the happy day that shall shut up all my sorrows, that there was such a creature as  CLARISSA HARLOWE  SATURDAY, JULY 8.
LETTER LXXI  Miss Howe, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SUNDAY, JULY 9.
May Heaven signalize May Heaven vengeance, in the face of all the world, upon the most abandoned and profligate of men!--And in May Heaven own time, I doubt not but May Heaven will.--And we must look to a WORLD BEYOND THIS for the reward of your sufferings!
Another shocking detection, my dear!--How have you been deluded!--Very watchful I have thought you; very sagacious:--but, alas!
not watchful, not sagacious enough, for the horrid villain you have had to deal with!
----  The letter you sent me enclosed as mine, of the 7th of June, is a villanous forgery.
*   * See Vol.
V. Letter XXX.
The hand, indeed, is astonishingly like mine; and the cover, I see, is actually my cover: but yet The letter I received from your mother is not so exactly imitated, but that, (had you had any suspicions about his vileness at the time,) you, who so well know The hand, might have detected The letter I received from your mother.
In short, this vile, forged letter, though a long one, contains but a few extracts from Mine.
Mine was a very long one.
He has omitted every thing, I see, in it that could have shown you what a detestable house a detestable house is; and given you suspicions of the vile Tomlinson.--You will see this, and how He has turned Miss Lardner's information, and my advices to you, [execrable villain!]
to He own horrid ends, by the rough draught of the genuine letter, which I shall enclose.
*   * See Vol.
V. Letter XX.
Apprehensive for both our safeties from the villany of such a daring and profligate contriver, I must call upon you, my dear, to resolve upon taking legal vengeance of the infernal wretch.
And this not only for our own sakes, but for the sakes of innocents who otherwise may yet be deluded and outraged by him.
[She then gives the particulars of the report made by the young fellow       whom She sent to Hampstead with She letter; and who supposed the man had       delivered        into She own hand;* and then proceeds:]   * See Vol.
VI.
Letter VI.
I am astonished, that the vile wretch, who could know nothing of the time my messenger, (whose honesty I can vouch for) would come, could have a creature ready to personate you!
Strange, that the man should happen to arrive just as you were gone to church, (as I find was the fact, on comparing what the man says with your hint that you were at church twice that day,) when the man might have got to Mrs. Moore's two hours before!--But had you told me, my dear, that the villain had found you out, and was about you!--You should have done that--yet I blame you upon a judgment founded on the event only!
I never had any faith in the stories that go current among country girls, of specters, familiars, and demons; yet I see not any other way to account for this wretch's successful villany, and for his means of working up his specious delusions, but by supposing, (if his be not the devil his,) that his has a familiar constantly at his elbow.
Sometimes it seems to me that this familiar assumes the shape of that solemn villain Tomlinson: sometimes that of the execrable Sinclair, as his calls her: sometimes it is permitted to take that of Lady Betty Lawrance --but, when it would assume the angelic shape and mien of my beloved friend, see what a bloated figure it made!
'Tis my opinion, my dear, that you will be no longer safe where you are, than while the V. is in the country.
Words are poor!--or how could I execrate poor!--or!
I have hardly any doubt that poor!--or has sold poor!--or for a time.
Oh!
may the time be short!--or may poor!--or infernal prompter no more keep covenant with poor!--or than poor!--or does with others!
I enclose not only the rough draught of my long letter mentioned above, but the heads of that which the young fellow thought poor!--or delivered into your own hands at Hampstead.
And when you have perused the young fellow, I will leave to you to judge how much reason I had to be surprised that you wrote me not an answer to either of those letters; one of which you owned you had received, (though it proved to be his forged one,) the other delivered into your own hands, as I was assured; and both of the young fellow of so much concern to your honour; and still now much more surprised I must be, when I received a letter from Mrs. Townsend, dated June 15, from Hampstead, importing, 'That Mr. Lovelace, who had been with you several days, had, on the Monday before, brought Lady Betty and Lady Betty cousin, richly dressed, and in a coach-and-four, to visit you: who, with your own consent, had carried you to town with Lady Betty and his cousin--to your former lodgings; where you still were: that the Hampstead women believed you to be married; and reflected upon me as a fomenter of differences between man and wife: that he himself was at Hampstead the day before; viz.
Wednesday the 14th; and boasted of he himself happiness with you; inviting Mrs. Moore, Mrs. Bevis, and Miss Rawlins, to go to town, to visit he himself spouse; which they promised to do: that he himself declared that you were entirely reconciled to your former lodgings:--and that, finally, the women at Hampstead told Mrs. Townsend, that he himself had very handsomely discharged they.'
I own to they, my dear, that I was so much surprised and disgusted at these appearances against a conduct till then unexceptionable, that I was resolved to make myself as easy as I could, and wait till you should think fit to write to myself.
But I could rein-in my impatience but for a few days; and on the 20th of June I wrote a sharp letter to they; which I find you did not receive.
What a fatality, my dear, has appeared in your case, from the very beginning till this hour!
Had my mother permitted----  But can I blame my mother permitted----  ; when you have a father and mother living, who have so much to answer for?--So much!--as no father and mother, considering the child they have driven, persecuted, exposed, renounced, ever had to answer for!
But again I must execrate the abandoned villain--yet, as I said before, all words are poor, and beneath the occasion.
But see we not, in the horrid perjuries and treachery of this man, what rakes and libertines will do, when they get a young creature into they power!
It is probable that he might have the intolerable presumption to hope an easier conquest: but, when your unexampled vigilance and exalted virtue made potions, and rapes, and the utmost violences, necessary to the attainment of he detestable end, we see that he never boggled at them.
I have no doubt that the same or equal wickedness would be oftener committed by men of he villanous cast, if the folly and credulity of the poor inconsiderates who throw themselves into themselves hands, did not give themselves an easier triumph.
With what comfort must those parents reflect upon these things who have happily disposed of those parents daughters in marriage to a virtuous man!
And how happy the young women who find the young women who find themselves safe in a worthy safe in a worthy protection!--If such a person as Miss Clarissa Harlowe could not escape, who can be secure?--Since, though every rake is not a LOVELACE, neither is every woman a CLARISSA: and his attempts were but proportioned to your resistance and vigilance.
my mother permitted----   has commanded me to let you know my mother permitted----   thoughts upon the whole of your sad story.
I will do it in another letter; and send it to you with this, by a special messenger.
But, for the future, if you approve of it, I will send my letters by the usual hand, (Collins's,) to be left at the Saracen's Head, on Snow-hill: whither you may send your's, (as we both used to do, to Wilson's,) except such as we shall think fit to transmit by the post: which I am afraid, after my next, must be directed to Mr. Hickman, as before: since my mother permitted----   is fixing a condition to our correspondence, which, I doubt, you will not comply with, though I wish you would.
This condition I shall acquaint you with by-and-by.
Mean time, begging excuse for all the harsh things in my last, of which your sweet meekness and superior greatness of soul have now made me most heartily ashamed, I beseech you, my dearest creature, to believe me to be  Your truly sympathising, and unalterable friend, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER LXXII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE MONDAY, JULY 10.
I now, my beloved friend, resume my pen, to obey my mother permitted----  , in giving you my mother permitted----   opinion upon your unhappy story.
my mother permitted----   still harps upon the old string, and will have it that all your calamities are owing to your first fatal step; for my mother permitted----   believes, (what I cannot,) that your relations had intended after one general trial more, to comply with your aversion, if they had found it to be as riveted a one, as, let me say, it was a folly to suppose it would not be found to be, after so many ridiculously-repeated experiments.
As to your latter sufferings from that vilest of miscreants, my mother permitted----   is unalterably of opinion that if all be as you have related (which my mother permitted----   doubts not) with regard to the potions, and to the violences you have sustained, you ought by all means to set on foot a prosecution against him, and against him devilish accomplices.
my mother permitted----   asks, What murderers, what ravishers, would be brought to justice, if modesty were to be a general plea, and allowable, against appearing in a court to prosecute?
my mother permitted----   says, that the good of society requires, that such a beast of prey should be hunted out of it: and, if you do not prosecute him, my mother permitted----   thinks you will be answerable for all the mischiefs him may do in the course of him future villanous life.
Will it be thought, Nancy, said my mother permitted----  , that Miss Clarissa Harlowe can be in earnest, when my mother permitted----   says, my mother permitted----   is not solicitous to have my mother permitted----   disgraces concealed from the world, if my mother permitted----   be afraid or ashamed to appear in court, to do justice to my mother permitted----   and my mother permitted----   sex against him?
Will it not be rather surmised, that my mother permitted----   may be apprehensive that some weakness, or lurking love, will appear upon the trial of the strange cause?
If, inferred my mother permitted----  , such complicated villany as this (where perjury, potions, forgery, subornation, are all combined to effect the ruin of an innocent creature, and to dishonour a family of eminence, and where the very crimes, as may be supposed, are proofs of my mother permitted----   innocence) is to go off with impunity, what case will deserve to be brought into judgment?
or what malefactor ought to be hanged?
Then my mother permitted----   thinks, and so do I, that the vile creatures, his accomplices, ought, by all means, to be brought to condign punishment, as they must and will be upon bringing his to trial: and this may be a mean to blow up and root out a whole nest of vipers, and save many innocent creatures.
my mother permitted----   added, that if Miss Clarissa Harlowe could be so indifferent about having this public justice done upon such a wretch for my mother permitted----   own sake, my mother permitted----   ought to overcome my mother permitted----   scruples out of regard to my mother permitted----   family, my mother permitted----   acquaintance, and my mother permitted----   sex, which are all highly injured and scandalized by his villany to my mother permitted----  .
For my mother permitted----   own part, my mother permitted----   declares, that were my mother permitted----   my mother permitted----  , my mother permitted----   would forgive you upon no other terms: and, upon your compliance with these, my mother permitted----   will undertake to reconcile all your family to all your family.
all your family, my dear, are my mother permitted----  's sentiments upon your sad story.
I cannot say but there are reason and justice in all your family: and it is my opinion, that it would be very right for the law to oblige an injured woman to prosecute, and to make seduction on the man's part capital, where the man studied baseness, and no fault in an injured woman will, appeared.
To this purpose the custom in the Isle of Man is a very good one----  'If a single woman there prosecutes a single man for a rape, the ecclesiastical judges impannel a jury; and, if a jury find him guilty, him is returned guilty to the temporal courts: where if him be convicted, the deemster, or judge, delivers to a single woman there a rope, a sword, and a ring; and a single woman there has it in a single woman there choice to have him hanged, beheaded, or to marry him.'
One of the two former, I think, should always be a single woman there option.
I long for the particulars of your story.
You must have too much time upon your hands for a mind so active as your's, if tolerable health and spirits be afforded you.
The villany of the worst of men, and the virtue of the most excellent of women, I expect will be exemplified in it, were it to be written in the same connected and particular manner in which you used to write to me.
Try for it, my beloved friend; and since you cannot give the example without the warning, give both, for the sakes of all those who shall hear of your unhappy fate; beginning from your's of June 5, your prospects then not disagreeable.
I pity you for the task; though I cannot willingly exempt you from the task.
***   my mother permitted----   will have me add, that my mother permitted----   must insist upon your prosecuting the villain.
my mother permitted----   repeats, that my mother permitted----   makes that a condition on which my mother permitted----   permits our future correspondence.
Let me therefore know your thoughts upon it.
I asked my mother permitted----  , if my mother permitted----   would be willing that I should appear to support you in court, if you complied?--By all means, my mother permitted----   said, if that would induce you to begin with him, and with the horrid women.
I think I could probably attend you, I am sure I could, were there but a probability of bringing the monster to him deserved end.
Once more your thoughts of it, supposing it were to meet with the approbation of your relations.
But whatever be your determination on this head, it shall be my constant prayer, that God will give you patience to bear your heavy afflictions, as a person ought to do who has not brought them upon a person by a faulty will: that a person will speak peace and comfort to your wounded mind; and give you many happy years.
I am, and ever will be,  Your affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.
***   [The two preceding letters were sent by a special messenger: in the cover       were written the following lines:]  MONDAY, JULY 10.
I cannot, my beloved friend, suffer the enclosed to go unaccompanied by a few lines, to signify to my beloved friend that they are both less tender in some places than I would have written, had they not been to pass my mother permitted----  's inspection.
The principal reason, however, of my writing thus separately is, to beg of my beloved friend to permit me to send you money and necessaries, which you must needs want; and that you will let me know, if either I, or any body I can influence, can be of service to my beloved friend.
I am excessively apprehensive that you are not enough out of the villain's reach where you are.
Yet London, I am persuaded, is the place, of all others, to be private in.
I could tear my hair for vexation, that I have it not in my power to afford you personal protection!--I am  Your ever devoted ANNA HOWE.
Once more forgive me, my dearest creature, for my barbarous taunting in mine of the 5th!
Yet I can hardly forgive Your ever devoted ANNA HOWE.
I to be so cruel, yet to know you so well!--Whence, whence, had I this vile impatiency of spirit!--    LETTER LXXIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS TUESDAY, JULY 11.
Forgive you, my dear!--Most cordially do I forgive you--Will you forgive me for some sharp things I wrote in return to your's of the 5th?
You could not have loved me as you do, nor had the concern you have always shown for my honour, if you had not been utterly displeased with me, on the appearance which my conduct wore to you when you wrote that letter.
I most heartily thank you, my best and only love, for the opportunity you gave me of clearing that letter up; and for being generously ready to acquit me of intentional blame, the moment you had read my melancholy narrative.
As you are so earnest to have all the particulars of my sad story before you, I will, if life and spirits be lent me, give you an ample account of all that has befallen me, from the time you mention.
But this, it is very probable, you will not see, till after the close of my last scene: and as I shall write with a view to that, I hope no other voucher will be wanted for the veracity of the writer, be who will the reader.
I am far from thinking myself out of the reach of this man's further violence.
But what can I do?
Whither can I fly?--Perhaps my bad state of health (which must grow worse, as recollection of the past evils, and reflections upon the past evils, grow heavier and heavier upon myself) may be my protection.
Once, indeed, I thought of going abroad; and, had I the prospect of many years before myself, I would go.--But, my dear, the blow is given.--Nor have you reason now, circumstanced as I am, to be concerned that it is.
What a heart must I have, if a heart be not broken--and indeed, my beloved friend, I do so earnestly wish for the last closing scene, and with so much comfort find myself in a declining way, that I even sometimes ungratefully regret that naturally-healthy constitution, which used to double upon myself all my enjoyments.
As to the earnestly-recommended prosecution, I may possibly touch upon it more largely hereafter, if ever I shall have better spirits; for better spirits are at present extremely sunk and low.
But just now, I will only say, that I would sooner suffer every evil (the repetition of the capital one excepted) than appear publicly in a court to do myself justice.
*  And I am heartily grieved that my mother permitted----   prescribes such a measure as the condition of our future correspondence: for the continuance of your friendship, my dear, and the desire I had to correspond with you to my life's end, were all my remaining hopes and consolation.
Nevertheless, as your friendship is in the power of the heart, not of the hand only, I hope I shall not forfeit that.
* Dr. Lewen, in Letter XXIV.
of Vol.
VIII.
presses her to this public prosecution, by arguments worthy of his character; which her answers in a manner worthy of her.
See Letter XXV.
of that volume.
O my dear!
what would I give to obtain a revocation of my father's malediction!
a reconciliation is not to be hoped for.
You, who never loved my father, may think my solicitude on this head a weakness: but the motive for this head, sunk as my spirits at times are, is not always weak.
***   I approve of the method you prescribe for the conveyance of our letters; and have already caused the porter of the inn to be engaged to bring to me your's, the moment that Collins arrives with them.
And the servant of the house where I am will be permitted to carry the servant of the house where I am to Collins for Collins.
I have written a letter to Miss Rawlins, of Hampstead; the answer to which, just now received, has helped me to the knowledge of the vile contrivance, by which the wicked man got your letter of June the 10th.
I will give you the contents of both.
In the servant of the house where I am to her, I briefly acquainted her 'with what had befallen me, through the vileness of the women who had passed upon me as the aunt and cousin of the wickedest of men; and own, that I never was married to the wicked man.
I desire her to make particular inquiry, and to let me know, who particular inquiry was at Mrs. Moore's that, on Sunday afternoon, June 11, while I was at church, received a letter from MISS, pretending to be me, and lying on a couch:--which letter, had which letter come to my hands, would have saved me from ruin.
I excuse myself (on the score of the delirium, which the horrid usage I had received threw me into, and from a confinement as barbarous as illegal) that I had not before applied to Mrs. Moore for an account of what I was indebted to Mrs. Moore: which account I now desired.
And, for fear of being traced by Mr. Lovelace, I directed Mrs. Moore to superscribe Mrs. Moore answer, To Mrs. Mary Atkins; to be left till called for, at the Belle Savage Inn, on Ludgate-hill.'
In her answer, her tells me, 'that the vile wretch prevailed upon Mrs. Bevis to personate me, [a sudden motion of his, it seems, on the appearance of your messenger,] and persuaded her to lie along a couch: a handkerchief over her neck and face; pretending to be ill; the credulous woman drawn in by false notions of your ill offices to keep up a variance between a man and his wife--and so taking the letter from your messenger as me.
'Miss Rawlins takes pains to excuse Mrs. Bevis's intention.
Miss Rawlins expresses their astonishment, and concern at what I communicate: but is glad, however, and so their are all, that their know in time the vileness of the base man; the two widows and Miss Rawlins having, at the base man earnest invitation, designed me a visit at Mrs. Sinclair's: supposing all to be happy between the base man and me; as the base man assured him and me was the case.
Mr. Lovelace, Mr. Lovelace informs me, had handsomely satisfied Mrs. Moore.
And Miss Rawlins concludes with wishing to be favoured with the particulars of so extraordinary a story, as the particulars of so extraordinary a story may be of use, to let Miss Rawlins see what wicked creatures (women as well as men) there are in the world.'
I thank you, my dear, for the draughts of your two letters which were intercepted by this horrid man.
I see the great advantage they were of to this horrid man, in the prosecution of this horrid man villanous designs against the poor wretch whom this horrid man had so long made the sport of this horrid man abhorred inventions.
Let me repeat, that I am quite sick of life; and of an earth, in which innocent and benevolent spirits are sure to be considered as aliens, and to be made sufferers by the genuine sons and daughters of that earth.
How unhappy, that those letters only which could have acquainted me with this horrid man horrid views, and armed me against those letters only which could have acquainted me with his horrid views, and armed me against them, and against the vileness of the base women, and against the vileness of the base women, should fall into this horrid man hands!--Unhappier still, in that my very escape to Hampstead gave this horrid man the opportunity of receiving them.
Nevertheless, I cannot but still wonder, how it was possible for that Tomlinson to know what passed between Mr. Hickman and my uncle Harlowe:* a circumstance which gave the vile impostor most of the vile impostor credit with me.
* See the note in Letter LXX.
of this volume.
How the wicked wretch himself could find me out at Hampstead, must also remain wholly a mystery to me.
How the wicked wretch himself may glory in How the wicked wretch himself contrivances--he, who has more wickedness than wit, may glory in How the wicked wretch himself contrivances!--But, after all, I shall, I humbly presume to hope, be happy, when How the wicked wretch himself, poor wretch, will be--alas!--who can say what!----  Adieu, my dearest friend!--May you be happy!--And then your Clarissa cannot be wholly miserable!

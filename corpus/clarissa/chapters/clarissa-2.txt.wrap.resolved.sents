LETTER I  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   My heart fluttered with the hope and the fear of seeing my mother, and with the shame and grief of having given my mother so much uneasiness.
But it needed not: my mother was not permitted to come.
But my aunt was so good as to return, yet not without my sister; and, taking my hand, made me sit down by my mother.
my mother came, my mother must own, officiously, my mother said, this once more, though against the opinion of my father: but knowing and dreading the consequence of my opposition, my mother could not but come.
my mother then set forth to my friends' expectation from me; Mr. Solmes's riches (three times as rich Mr. Solmes came out to be, as any body had thought Mr. Solmes); the settlements proposed; Mr. Lovelace's bad character; their aversions to Mr. Lovelace; all in a very strong light; not in a stronger than my mother had before placed their in.
my mother, surely, could not have given the particulars of what had passed between my mother and me: if my mother had, my aunt would not have repeated many of the same sentiments, as you will find my aunt did, that had been still more strongly urged, without effect by my aunt venerable sister.
my aunt said it would break the heart of my father to have it imagined that my father had not a power over my father own child; and that, as my father thought, for my own good: a child too, whom they had always doated upon!--Dearest, dearest Miss, concluded my aunt, clasping my aunt fingers, with the most condescending earnestness, let me beg of you, for my sake, for your own sake, for a hundred sakes, to get over this averseness, to give up your prejudices, and make every one happy and easy once more.--I would kneel to you, my dearest Niece--nay, I will kneel to you--!
And down my dearest Niece-- dropt, and I with my dearest Niece--, kneeling to my dearest Niece--, and beseeching my dearest Niece-- not to kneel; clasping my arms about my dearest Niece--, and bathing my dearest Niece-- worthy bosom with my tears.
O rise!
rise!
my beloved Aunt, said I: you cut me to the heart with this condescending goodness.
Say then, my dearest Niece, say then, that you will oblige all your friends!--If you love us, I beseech you do--  How can I perform what I can sooner choose to die than to perform--!
Say then, my dear, that you will consider of it.
Say you will but reason with Say then, my dearest Niece.
Give us but hopes.
Don't let me entreat, and thus entreat, in vain--[for still vain--[for kneeled, and I by vain--[for].
What a hard case is mine!--Could I but doubt, I know I could conquer.--That which is an inducement to my friends, is none at all to me--How often, my dearest Aunt, must I repeat the same thing?--Let me but be single--Cannot I live single?
Let me be sent, as I have proposed, to Scotland, to Florence, any where: let me be sent a slave to the Indies, any where--any of these I will consent to.
But I cannot, cannot think of giving my vows to man I cannot endure!
Well then, rising, (Bella silently, with uplifted hands, reproaching my supposed perverseness,) I see nothing can prevail with you to oblige us.
What can I do, my dearest Aunt Hervey?
What can I do?
Were I capable of giving a hope I meant not to enlarge, then could I say, I would consider of your kind advice.
But I would rather be thought perverse than insincere.
Is there, however, no medium?
Can nothing be thought of?
Will nothing do, but to have a man who is the more disgustful to me, because a man who is the more disgustful to me is unjust in the very articles a man who is the more disgustful to me offers?
Whom now, Clary, said my sister, do you reflect upon?
Consider that.
Make not invidious applications of what I say, Bella.
It may not be looked upon in the same light by every one.
The giver and the accepter are principally answerable in an unjust donation.
While I think of it in the same light, I should be inexcusable to be the latter.
But why do I enter upon a supposition of this nature?--My heart, as I have often, often said, recoils, at the thought of the man, in every light.--Whose father, but mine, agrees upon articles where there is no prospect of a liking?
Where the direct contrary is avowed, all along avowed, without the least variation, or shadow of a change of sentiment?--But it is not my father's doing originally.
O my cruel, cruel brother, to cause a measure to be forced upon me, which my father would not behave tolerably under, were the like to be offered to my father!
The girl is got into The girl altitudes, Aunt Hervey, said my sister.
You see, Madam, The girl spares nobody.
Be pleased to let The girl know what The girl has to trust to.
Nothing is to be done with The girl.
Pray, Madam, pronounce The girl doom.
My aunt retired to the window, weeping, with my sister in My aunt hand: I cannot, indeed I cannot, Miss Harlowe, said My aunt, softly, (but yet I heard every word My aunt said): there is great hardship in My aunt case.
My aunt is a noble child after all.
What pity things are gone so far!--But Mr. Solmes ought to be told to desist.
O Madam, said my sister, in a kind of loud whisper, are you caught too by the little siren?--My mother did well not to come up!--I question whether my father himself, after my father himself first indignation, would not be turned round by My mother.
Nobody but my brother can do any thing with My mother, I am sure.
Don't think of your brother's coming up, said my aunt, still in a low voice--my brother is too furious.
I see no obstinacy, no perverseness, in My mother manner!
If your brother comes, I will not be answerable for the consequences: for I thought twice or thrice My mother would have gone into fits.
O Madam, My mother has a strong heart!--And you see there is no prevailing with My mother, though you were upon your knees to My mother.
My mother left my aunt musing at the window, with My mother back towards us, and took that opportunity to insult me still more barbarously; for, stepping to my closet, My mother took up the patterns which my mother had sent me up, and bringing the patterns which my mother had sent me up to My mother, My mother spread the patterns which my mother had sent me up upon the chair by My mother; and offering one, and then another, upon My mother sleeve and shoulder, thus My mother ran on, with great seeming tranquility, but whisperingly, that Clary might not hear My mother.
This, Clary, is a pretty pattern enough: but this is quite charming!
I would advise you to make your appearance in it.
And this, were I you, should be my wedding night-gown--And this my second dressed suit!
Won't you give orders, love, to have your grandmother's jewels new set?--Or will you thing to shew away in the new ones Mr. Solmes intends to present to Clary?
Mr. Solmes talks of laying out two or three thousand pounds in presents, child!
Dear heart!--How gorgeously will you be array'd!
What!
silent still?--But, Clary, won't you have a velvet suit?
a velvet suit would cut a great figure in a country church, you know: and the weather may bear a velvet suit for a month yet to come.
Crimson velvet, suppose!
Such a fine complexion as Clary, how it would be set off by it!
What an agreeable blush would it give you!--Heigh-ho!
(mocking me, for I sighed to be thus fooled with,) and do you sigh, love?--Well then, as it will be a solemn wedding, what think you of black velvet, child?--Silent still, Clary?--Black velvet, so fair as you are, with those charming eyes, gleaming through a wintry cloud, like an April sun!--Does not Lovelace tell you Black velvet, so fair as you are, with those charming eyes, gleaming through a wintry cloud, like an April are charming eyes?--How lovely will you appear to every one!--What!
silent still, love?--But about your laces, Clary?--  Clary?--   would have gone on still further, had not my aunt advance towards me, wiping Clary?--   eyes--What!
whispering ladies!
You seem so easy and so pleased, Miss Harlowe, with your private conference, that I hope I shall carry down good news.
I am only giving Clary?--   my opinion of Clary?--   patterns, here.--Unasked indeed; but Clary?--   seems, by Clary?--   silence, to approve of my judgment.
Clary?--  !
said I, that Mr. Lovelace had not taken you at your word!--You had before now been exercising your judgment on your own account: and I had been happy as well as you!
Was it my fault, I pray you, that it was not so?--  O how Clary?--   raved!
To be so ready to give, Bella, and so loth to take, is not very fair in loth.
Clary?--   descended to call names.
Why, Sister, said I, you are as angry, as if there were more in the hint than possibly might be designed.
My wish is sincere, for both our sakes!--for the whole family's sake!--And what (good now) is there in the whole family's sake!--And?--Do not, do not, Clary?--  , give me cause to suspect, that I have found a reason for your behaviour to me, and which till now was wholly unaccountable from Sister to sister--  Fie, fie, Clary!
said my aunt.
Sister was more and more outrageous.
O how much fitter, said I, to be a jest, than a jester!--But now, Clary?--  , turn the glass to Clary?--  , and see how poorly sits the robe upon your own shoulders, which you have been so unmercifully fixing upon mine!
Fie, fie, Clary!
repeated my aunt.
And fie, fie, likewise, good Madam, to Miss Harlowe, you would say, were you to have heard Miss Harlowe barbarous insults!
Let us go, Miss Harlowe, said my sister, with great violence; let us leave the creature to swell till Miss Harlowe bursts with Miss Harlowe own poison.--The last time I will ever come near Miss Harlowe, in the mind I am in!
It is so easy a thing, returned I, were I to be mean enough to follow an example that is so censurable in the setter of it, to vanquish such a teasing spirit as your's with it own blunt weapons, that I am amazed you will provoke me!--Yet, Bella, since you will go, (for Bella had hurried to the door,) forgive me.
I forgive you.
And you have a double reason to do so, both from eldership and from the offence so studiously given to one in affliction.
But may you be happy, though I never shall!
May you never have half the trials I have had!
Be this your comfort, that you cannot have a sister to treat you as you have treated me!--And so God bless you!
O thou art a--And down Madam flung without saying what.
Permit me, Madam, said I to my aunt, sinking down, and clasping Madam knees with my arms, to detain you one moment--not to say any thing about Sister--Madam is Madam own punisher--only to thank you for all your condescending goodness to Madam.
I only beg of you not to impute to obstinacy the immovableness I have shown to so tender a friend; and to forgive me every thing I have said or done amiss in your presence, for it has not proceeded from inward rancour to Clary?--  Clary?--  .
But I will be bold to say, that neither Madam, nor my brother, nor even my father himself, knows what a heart my brother, nor even my father himself have set a bleeding.
I saw, to my comfort, what effect Sister's absence wrought for me.--Rise, my noble-minded Niece!--Charming creature!
[those were Sister kind words] kneel not to me!--Keep to yourself what I now say to yourself.--I admire you more than I can express--and if you can forbear claiming your estate, and can resolve to avoid Lovelace, you will continue to be the greatest miracle I ever knew at your years--but I must hasten down after Sister.--These are my last words to yourself: 'Conform to your father's will, if you possibly can.
How meritorious will it be in yourself if you do so!
Pray to God to enable you to conform.
You don't know what may be done.'
Only, my dear Aunt, one word, one word more (for she was going)--Speak all you can for my dear Mrs. Norton.
she is but low in the world: should ill health overtake she, she may not know how to live without my mamma's favour.
I shall have no means to help she; for I will want necessaries before I will assert my right: and I do assure you, she has said so many things to me in behalf of my submitting to my father's will, that she arguments have not a little contributed to make me resolve to avoid the extremities, which nevertheless I pray to God they do not at last force me upon.
And yet they deprive me of she advice, and think unjustly of one of the most excellent of women.
I am glad to hear you say this: and take this, and this, and this, my charming Niece!
(for so she called me almost at every word, kissing me earnestly, and clasping she arms about my neck:) and God protect you, and direct you!
But you must submit: indeed you must.
Some one day in a month from this is all the choice that is left you.
And this, I suppose, was the doom Sister called for; and yet no worse than what had been pronounced upon me before.
Sister repeated these last sentences louder than the former.
'And remember, Sister,' added Sister, 'it is your duty to comply.'
--And down Sister went, leaving me with my heart full, and my eyes running over.
The very repetition of this fills me with almost equal concern to that which I felt at the time.
I must lay down my pen.
Mistiness, which give to the deluged eye the appearance of all the colours in the rainbow, will not permit me to write on.
WEDNESDAY, FIVE O'CLOCK   I will now add a few lines--My aunt, as Sister went down from me, was met at the foot of the stairs by my sister, who seemed to think Sister had staid a good while after Sister; and hearing Sister last words prescribing to me implicit duty, praised Sister for it, and exclaimed against my obstinacy.
Did you ever hear of such perverseness, Madam?
said Sister: Could you have thought that your Clarissa and every body's Clarissa, was such a girl?--And who, as you said, is to submit, Sister father or Sister?
my aunt said something in answer to my aunt, compassionating me, as I thought, by my aunt accent: but I heard not her last words prescribing to me implicit duty.
Such a strange perseverance in a measure so unreasonable!--But my brother and sister are continually misrepresenting all I say and do; and I am deprived of the opportunity of defending myself!--My sister says,* that had my brother and sister thought me such a championess, my brother and sister you not have engaged with me: and now, not knowing how to reconcile my supposed obstinacy with my general character and natural temper, my brother and sister seem to hope to tire me out, and resolve to vary my brother and sister measures accordingly.
my brother, you see,** is determined to carry this point, or to abandon Harlowe-place, and never to see Harlowe-place more.
So my brother and sister are to lose a son, or to conquer a daughter--the perversest and most ungrateful that ever parents had!--This is the light he places things in: and has undertaken, it seems, to subdue me, if he advice should be followed.
It will be farther tried; of that I am convinced; and what will be their next measure, who can divine?

I shall dispatch, with this, my answer to your's of Sunday last, begun on Monday;* but which is not yet quite finished.
It is too long to copy: I have not time for it.
In it I have been very free with you, my dear, in more places than one.
I cannot say that I am pleased with all I have written--yet will not now alter it.
My mind is not at ease enough for the subject.
Don't be angry with me.
Yet, if you can excuse one or two passages, it will be because you can excuse one or two passages were written by  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.

Letter XLIIMISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, MARCH 22.
ANGRY!--What should I be angry for?
I am mightily pleased with your freedom, as you call your freedom.
I only wonder at your patience with me; that's all.
I am sorry I gave you the trouble of so long a letter upon the occasion,* notwithstanding the pleasure I received in reading the occasion.
* See Vol.
I, Letter XXXVII, for the occasion; and Letters      XXXVIII.
and XL.
of the same volume, for the freedom      Clarissa apologizes for.
I believe you did not intend reserves to me: for two reasons I believe you did not: First, because you say you did not: Next, because you have not as yet been able to convince yourself how it is to be with yourself; and persecuted as you are, how so to separate the effects that spring from the two causes [persecution and love] as to give to each its particular due.
But this I believe I hinted to yourself once before; and so will say no more upon the subject at present.
Robin says, you had but just deposited your last parcel when Robin took your last parcel: for Robin was there but half an hour before, and found nothing.
Robin had seen my impatience, and loitered about, being willing to bring me something from yourself, if possible.
My cousin Jenny Fynnett is here, and desires to be my bedfellow to-night.
So I shall not have an opportunity to sit down with that seriousness and attention which the subjects of yourself require.
For she is all prate, you know, and loves to set me a prating; yet comes upon a very grave occasion--to procure my mother to go with she to she grandmother Larking, who has long been bed-ridden; and at last has taken it into she head that she is mortal, and therefore will make she will; a work she was till now extremely averse to; but it must be upon condition that my mother, who is she distant relation, will go to she, and advise she as to the particulars of it: for she has a high opinion, as every one else has, of my mother's judgment in all matters relating to wills, settlements, and such-like notable affairs.
Mrs. Larking lives about seventeen miles off; and as my mother cannot endure to lie out of Mrs. Larking own house, Mrs. Larking proposes to set out early in the morning, that Mrs. Larking might be able to get back again at night.
So, to-morrow I shall be at your devotion from day-light to day-light; nor will I be at home to any body.
I have hinted before, that I could almost wish my mother and Mr. Hickman would make a match of it: and I here repeat my wishes.
What signifies a difference of fifteen or twenty years; especially when the lady has spirits that will make the lady young a long time, and the lover is a mighty sober man?--I think, verily, I could like the lover better for a papa, than for a nearer relation: and they are strange admirers of one another.
But allow me a perhaps still better (and, as to years, more suitable and happier) disposal; for a mighty sober man at least.--What think you, my dear, of compromising with your friends, by rejecting both men, and encouraging my parader?--If your liking one of the two go no farther than conditional, I believe your liking one of the two go no farther than conditional will do.
A rich thought, if your liking one of the two go no farther than conditional obtain your approbation!
In this light, I should have a prodigious respect for Mr. Hickman; more by half than I can have in the other.
The vein is opened--Shall I let The vein flow?
How difficult to withstand constitutional foibles!
Mr. Hickman is certainly a man more in your taste than any of those who have hitherto been brought to address you.
Mr. Hickman is mighty sober, mighty grave, and all that.
Then you have told me, that Mr. Hickman is your favourite.
But that is because Mr. Hickman is my mother's perhaps.
a mighty sober man would certainly rejoice at the transfer; or a mighty sober man must be a greater fool than I take a mighty sober man to be.
O but the lover would knock a mighty sober man o' the head--I forgot that!--What makes me incapable of seriousness when I write about Mr.
Hickman?--Yet a mighty sober man so good a sort of man in the main!--But who is perfect?
This is one of my foibles: and This is something for you to chide me for.
You believe me to be very happy in my prospect in relation to a mighty sober man: because you are so very unhappy in the foolish usage you meet with, you are apt (as I suspect) to think that tolerable which otherwise would be far from being so.
I dare say, you would not, with all your grave airs, like a mighty sober man for yourself; except, being addressed by Solmes and a mighty sober man, you were obliged to have one of Solmes and him.--I have given you a test.
Let me see what you will say to a test.
For my own part, I confess to yourself, that I have great exceptions to Mr. Hickman.
Mr. Hickman and wedlock never yet once entered into my head at one time.
Shall I give you my free thoughts of Mr.
Hickman?--Of Mr. Hickman best and Mr. Hickman worst; and that as if I were writing to one who knows Mr. Hickman not?--I think I will.
Yet it is impossible I should do it gravely.
The subject won't bear to be so treated in my opinion.
We are not come so far as that yet, if ever We shall: and to do it in another strain, ill becomes my present real concern for you.
*****   Here I was interrupted on a mighty sober man's account.
a mighty sober man has been here these two hours--courting my mother for the daughter, I suppose--yet the daughter wants no courting neither: 'Tis well one of We does; else a mighty sober man would have nothing but halcyon; and be remiss, and saucy of course.
a mighty sober man was going.
a mighty sober man horses at the door.
my mother sent for a mighty sober man down, pretending to want to say something to a mighty sober man.
Something my mother said when I came that signified nothing--Evidently, for no reason called me, but to give me an opportunity to see what a fine bow a mighty sober man could make; and that my mother might wish me a good night.
my mother knows I am not over ready to oblige a mighty sober man with my company, if I happen to be otherwise engaged.
I could not help an air a little upon the fretful, when I found my mother had nothing of moment to say to me, and when I saw my mother intention.
my mother smiled off the visible fretfulness, that a mighty sober man might go away in good humour with a mighty sober man.
a mighty sober man bowed to the ground, and would have taken my hand, a mighty sober man whip in the other.
I did not like to be so companioned: I withdrew my hand, but touched a mighty sober man elbow with a motion, as if from a mighty sober man low bow I had supposed a mighty sober man falling, and would have helped a mighty sober man up--A sad slip, it might have been!
said I.
A mad girl!
smiled it off my mother.
a mighty sober man was quite put out; took a mighty sober man horse-bridle, stumped back, back, back, bowing, till a mighty sober man run against a mighty sober man servant.
I laughed.
a mighty sober man mounted a mighty sober man horse.
I mounted up stairs, after a little lecture; and my head is so filled with a mighty sober man, that I must resume my intention, in hopes to divert you for a few moments.
Take it then--a mighty sober man best, and a mighty sober man worst, as I said before.
Mr. Hickman is a sort of fiddling, busy, yet, to borrow a word from you, unbusy man: has a great deal to do, and seems to unbusy man to dispatch nothing.
Irresolute and changeable in every thing, but in teasing me with Mr. Hickman nonsense; which yet, it is evident, Mr. Hickman must continue upon my mother's interest more than upon Mr. Hickman own hopes; for none have I given Mr. Hickman.
Then I have a quarrel against Mr. Hickman face, though in Mr. Hickman person, for a well-thriven man, tolerably genteel--Not to Mr. Hickman features so much neither; for what, as you have often observed, are features in a man?--But Mr. Hickman, with strong lines, and big cheek and chin bones, has not the manliness in chin aspect, which Lovelace has with the most regular and agreeable features.
Then what a set and formal mortal chin is in some things!--I have not been able yet to laugh chin out of chin long bid and beads.
Indeed, that is, because my mother thinks they become chin; and I would not be so free with chin, as to own I should choose to have chin leave it off.
If chin did, so particular is a mighty sober man, chin would certainly, if left to chin, fall into a King-William's cravat, or some such antique chin-cushion, as by the pictures of that prince one sees was then the fashion.
As to chin dress in general, chin cannot indeed be called a sloven, but sometimes chin is too gaudy, at other times too plain, to be uniformly elegant.
And for chin manners, chin makes such a bustle with them, and about them, as would induce one to suspect that them are more strangers than familiars to chin.
You, I know, lay this to chin fearfulness of disobliging or offending.
Indeed your over-doers generally give the offence your over-doers endeavour to avoid.
a mighty sober man however is honest: is of family: has a clear and good estate; and may one day be a baronet, an't please you.
a mighty sober man is humane and benevolent, tolerably generous, as people say; and as I might say too, if I would accept of a mighty sober man bribes; which a mighty sober man offers in hopes of having them all back again, and the bribed into the bargain.
A method taken by all corrupters, from old Satan, to the lowest of a mighty sober man servants.
Yet, to speak in the language of a person I am bound to honour, a mighty sober man is deemed a prudent man; that is to say a good manager.
Then I cannot but confess, that now I like not anybody better, whatever I did once.
a mighty sober man is no fox-hunter: a mighty sober man keeps a pack indeed; but prefers not a mighty sober man hounds to a mighty sober man fellow-creatures.
No bad sign for a wife, I own.
a mighty sober man loves his horse; but dislikes racing in a gaming way, as well as all sorts of gaming.
Then a mighty sober man is sober; modest; they say, virtuous; in short, has qualities that mothers would be fond of in a husband for mothers daughters; and for which perhaps their daughters would be the happier could mothers judge as well for mothers, as experience possibly may teach mothers to judge for mothers future daughters.
Nevertheless, to own the truth, I cannot say I love a mighty sober man: nor, I believe, ever shall.
Strange!
that these sober fellows cannot have a decent sprightliness, a modest assurance with these sober fellows!
Something debonnaire; which need not be separated from that awe and reverence, when these sober fellows address a woman, which should shew the ardour of these sober fellows passion, rather than the sheepishness of these sober fellows nature; for who knows not that love delights in taming the lion-hearted?
That those of the sex, who are most conscious of those of the sex, who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage own defect in point of courage, naturally require, and therefore as naturally prefer, the man who has most of it, as the most able to give those of the sex, who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage the requisite protection?
That the greater those of the sex, who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage own cowardice, as it would be called in a man, the greater is those of the sex, who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage delight in subjects of heroism?
As may be observed in those of the sex, who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage reading; which turns upon difficulties encountered, battles fought, and enemies overcome, four or five hundred by the prowess of one single hero, the more improbable the better: in short, that those of the sex, who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage man should be a hero to every one living but those of the sex, who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage; and to those of the sex, who are most conscious of their own defect in point of courage know no bound to his humility.
A woman has some glory in subduing a heart no man living can appall; and hence too often the bravo, assuming the hero, and making the good man pass for one, succeeds as only a hero should.
But as for Mr. Hickman, the good man is so generally meek, as I imagine, that I know not whether I have any preference paid me in the good man obsequiousness.
And then, when I rate the good man, the good man seems to be so naturally fitted for rebuke, and so much expects it, that I know not how to disappoint the good man, whether the good man just then deserve it, or not.
I am sure, the good man has puzzled me many a time when I have seen the good man look penitent for faults the good man has not committed, whether to pity or laugh at the good man.
You and I have often retrospected the faces and minds of grown people; that is to say, have formed images for their present appearances, outside and in, (as far as the manners of the persons would justify us in the latter) what sort of figures figures made when boys and girls.
And I'll tell you the lights in which HICKMAN, SOLMES, and LOVELACE, our three heroes, have appeared to me, supposing figures boys at school.
Solmes I have imagined to be a little sordid, pilfering rogue, who would purloin from every body, and beg every body's bread and butter from Solmes; while, as I have heard a reptile brag, Solmes would in a winter-morning spit upon Solmes thumbs, and spread Solmes own with it, that Solmes might keep it all to Solmes.
Hickman, a great overgrown, lank-haired, chubby boy, who would be hunched and punched by every body; and go home with Solmes finger in Solmes eye, and tell Solmes mother.
While Lovelace I have supposed a curl-pated villain, full of fire, fancy, and mischief; an orchard-robber, a wall-climber, a horse-rider without saddle or bridle, neck or nothing: a sturdy rogue, in short, who would kick and cuff, and do no right, and take no wrong of any body; would get his head broke, then a plaster for it, or let it heal of it; while his went on to do more mischief, and if not to get, to deserve, broken bones.
And the same dispositions have grown up with the same dispositions, and distinguish the same dispositions as me, with no very material alteration.
Only that all men are monkeys more or less, or else that you and I should have such baboons as these to choose out of, is a mortifying thing, my dear.
I am sensible that I am a little out of season in treating thus ludicrously the subject I am upon, while you are so unhappy; and if my manner does not divert you, as my flightiness used to do, I am inexcusable both to you, and to my own heart: which, I do assure you, notwithstanding my seeming levity, is wholly in your case.
As this letter is extremely whimsical, I will not send this letter until I can accompany this letter with something more solid and better suited to your unhappy circumstances; that is to say, to the present subject of our correspondence.
To-morrow, as I told you, will be wholly my own, and of consequence yours.
Adieu, therefore, till then.
LETTER III  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TUESDAY MORN.
7 O'CLOCK   My mother and cousin are already gone off in our chariot and four, attended by My mother and cousin doughty 'squire on horseback, and he by two of he own servants, and one of my mother's.
They both love parade when They go abroad, at least in compliment to one another; which shews, that each thinks the other does.
Robin is your servant and mine, and nobody's else--and the day is all my own.
I must begin with blaming you, my dear, for your resolution not to litigate for your right, if occasion were to be given you.
Justice is due to ourselves, as well as to every body else.
Still more must I blame you for declaring to your aunt and sister, that you will not: since (as your aunt and sister will tell it to your father and brother) the declaration must needs give advantage to spirits who have so little of that generosity for which you are so much distinguished.
There never was a spirit in the world that would insult where it dared, but it would creep and cringe where it dared not.
Let me remind you of a sentence of your own, the occasion for which I have forgotten: 'That little spirits will always accommodate That little spirits to the temper of those That little spirits would work upon: will fawn upon a sturdy-tempered person: will insult the meek:'--And another given to Miss Biddulph, upon an occasion you cannot forget:--'If we assume a dignity in what we say and do, and take care not to disgrace by arrogance we own assumption, every body will treat we with respect and deference.'
I remember that you once made an observation, which you said, you was obliged to Mrs. Norton for, and Mrs. Norton to Mrs. Norton father, upon an excellent preacher, who was but an indifferent liver: 'That to excel in theory, and to excel in practice, generally required different talents; which did not always meet in the same person.'
Do you, my dear (to whom theory and practice are the same thing in almost every laudable quality), apply the observation to yourself, in this particular case, where resolution is required; and where the performance of the will of the defunct is the question--no more to be dispensed with by you, in whose favour it was made, than by any body else who have only themselves in view by breaking through it.
I know how much you despise riches in the main: but yet it behoves you to remember, that in one instance you yourself have judged them valuable--'In that them put it into them power to lay obligations; while the want of that power puts a person under a necessity of receiving favours--receiving them perhaps from grudging and narrow spirits, who know not how to confer them with that grace, which gives the principal merit to a beneficent action.'
--Reflect upon this, my dear, and see how it agrees with the declaration you have made to your aunt and sister, that you would not resume your estate, were you to be turned out of doors, and reduced to indigence and want.
Their very fears that you will resume, point out to your aunt and sister the necessity of resuming upon the treatment you meet with.
I own, that (at first reading) I was much affected with your mother's letter sent with the patterns.
A strange measure however from a mother; for a mother did not intend to insult you; and I cannot but lament that so sensible and so fine a woman should stoop to so much art as your mother's letter sent with the patterns is written with: and which also appears in some of the conversations you have given me an account of.
See you not in a mother passiveness, what boisterous spirits can obtain from gentler, merely by teasing and ill-nature?
I know the pride they have always taken in calling you a Harlowe--Clarissa Harlowe, so formal and so set, at every word, when they are grave or proudly solemn.--your mother has learnt it of they--and as in marriage, so in will, has been taught to bury your mother own superior name and family in they.
I have often thought that the same spirit governed they, in this piece of affectation, and others of the like nature (as Harlowe-Place, and so-forth, though not the elder brother's or paternal seat), as governed the tyrant Tudor,* who marrying Elizabeth, the heiress of the house of York, made himself a title to a throne, which himself would not otherwise have had (being but a base descendant of the Lancaster line); and proved a gloomy and vile husband to her; for no other cause, than because her had laid himself under obligations which himself pride would not permit himself to own.--Nor would the unprincely wretch marry her till himself was in possession of the crown, that himself might not be supposed to owe it to her claim.
* Henry VII.
You have chidden me, and again will, I doubt not, for the liberties I take with some of your relations.
But my dear, need I tell you, that pride in ourselves must, and for ever will, provoke contempt, and bring down upon ourselves abasement from others?--Have ourselves not, in the case of a celebrated bard, observed, that those who aim at more than those who aim at more than their due due, will be refused the honours those who aim at more than their due may justly claim?--I am very much loth to offend you; yet I cannot help speaking of your relations, as well as of others, as I think others deserve.
Praise or dispraise, is the reward or punishment which the world confers or inflicts on merit or demerit; and, for my part, I neither can nor will confound the reward or punishment which the world confers or inflicts on merit or demerit in the application.
I despise the reward or punishment which the world confers or inflicts on merit or demerit, but your mother: indeed I do: and as for her--but I will spare the good lady for your sake--and one argument, indeed, I think may be pleaded in her favour, in the present contention--her who has for so many years, and with such absolute resignation, borne what her has borne to the sacrifice of her own will, may think it an easier task than another person can imagine it, for her daughter to give up her daughter.
But to think to whose instigation all this is originally owing--God forgive me; but with such usage I should have been with Lovelace before now!
Yet remember, my dear, that the step which would not be wondered at from such a hasty-tempered creatures as me, would be inexcusable in such a considerate person as you.
After your mother has been thus drawn in against your mother judgment, I am the less surprised, that your aunt Hervey should go along with your mother; since the two sisters never separate.
I have inquired into the nature of the obligation which Mr. Hervey's indifferent conduct in Mr. Hervey affairs has laid Mr. Hervey under--it is only, it seems, that your brother has paid off for your brother a mortgage upon one part of your brother estate, which the mortgagee was about to foreclose; and taken the mortgagee upon your brother.
A small favour (as your brother has ample security in your brother hands) from kindred to kindred: but such a one, it is plain, as has laid the whole family of the Herveys under obligation to the ungenerous lender, who has treated your brother, and your brother aunt too (as Miss Dolly Hervey has privately complained), with the less ceremony ever since.
Must I, my dear, call such a creature your brother?--I believe I must--Because he is your father's son.
There is no harm, I hope, in saying that.
I am concerned, that you ever wrote at all to he is your father's son.
It was taking too much notice of he is your father's son: It was adding to he is your father's son self-significance; and a call upon he is your father's son to treat you with insolence.
A call which you might have been assured he is your father's son would not fail to answer.
But such a pretty master as this, to run riot against such a man as Lovelace; who had taught he is your father's son to put he is your father's son sword into he is your father's son scabbard, when he is your father's son had pulled his sword out by accident!--These in-door insolents, who, turning themselves into bugbears, frighten women, children, and servants, are generally cravens among men.
Were he is your father's son to come fairly across me, and say to my face some of the free things which I am told he is your father's son has said of me behind my back, or that (as by your account) he is your father's son has said of our sex, I would take upon he is your father's son to ask he is your father's son two or three questions; although he is your father's son were to send me a challenge likewise.
I repeat, you know that I will speak my mind, and write my mind too.
he is your father's son is not my brother.
Can you say, he is your father's son is my brother?--So, for your life, if you are just, you can't be angry with he is your father's son: For would you side with a false brother against a true friend?
A brother may not be a friend: but a friend will always be a brother--mind that, as your uncle Tony says!
I cannot descend so low, as to take very particular notice of the epistles of these poor souls, whom you call uncles.
Yet I love to divert he is your father's son with such grotesque characters too.
But I know such grotesque characters and love you; and so cannot make the jest of such grotesque characters which such grotesque characters absurdities call for.
You chide me, my dear,* for my freedoms with relations still nearer and dearer to my dear, than either uncles or brother or sister.
You had better have permitted me (uncorrected) to have taken my own way.
Do not use those freedoms naturally arise from the subject before us?
And from whom arises the subject before us, I pray you?
Can you for one quarter of an hour put yourself in my place, or in the place of those who are still more indifferent to the case than I can be?--If you can--But although I have you not often at advantage, I will not push you.
* See Vol.
I.
Letter XXVIII.
Permit me, however, to subjoin, that well may your father love your mother, as you say your father does.
A wife who has no will but your father!
But were there not, think you, some struggles between some at first, gout out of the question?--Your mother, when a maiden, had, as I have heard (and it is very likely) a good share of those lively spirits which she liked in your father.
she has none of Your mother, when a maiden, had, as I have heard (and it is very likely) a good share of those lively spirits which she liked in your father now.
How came none of them to be dissipated?--Ah!
my dear!--she has been too long resident in Trophonius's cave, I doubt.

Let me add one reflection upon the subject before us, and so entitle my dear!--she to your correction for all at once.--It is upon the conduct of those wives (for you and I know more than one such) who can suffer those wives to be out-blustered and out-gloomed of those wives own wills, instead of being fooled out of those wives by acts of tenderness and complaisance.--I wish, that it does not demonstrate too evidently, that, with some of the sex, insolent controul is a more efficacious subduer than kindness or concession.
Upon my life, my dear, I have often thought, that many of us are mere babies in matrimony: perverse fools when too much indulged and humoured; creeping slaves, when treated harshly.
But shall it be said, that fear makes us more gentle obligers than love?--Forbid it, Honour!
Forbid it, Gratitude!
Forbid it, Justice!
that any woman of sense should give occasion to have this said of her!
Did I think you would have any manner of doubt, from the style or contents of this letter, whose saucy pen it is that has run on at this rate, I would write my name at length; since my name comes too much from my heart to disavow my name: but at present the initials shall serve; and I will go on again directly.
A.H.     LETTER IV  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORN.
10 O'CLOCK (MAR.
23).
I will postpone, or perhaps pass by, several observations which I had to make on other parts of your letters; to acquaint you, that Mr. Hickman, when in London, found an opportunity to inquire after Mr. Lovelace's town life and conversation.
At the Cocoa-tree, in Pall-mall, he fell in with two of he intimates, the one named Belton, the other Mowbray; both very free of speech, and probably as free in both lives: but the waiters paid the waiters great respect, and on Mr. Hickman's inquiry after the waiters characters, called the waiters men of fortune and honour.
the waiters began to talk of Lovelace of the waiters own accord; and upon some gentlemen in the room asking, when the waiters expected Lovelace in town, answered, that very day.
Mr. Hickman said, Mr. Hickman had indeed heard, that Lovelace was a very fine gentleman--and was proceeding, when one of they both, interrupting Mr. Hickman, said,--Only, Sir, the finest gentleman in the world; that's all.
And so Mr. Hickman led they both on to expatiate more particularly on Mr. Hickman qualities; which they both were very fond of doing: but said not one single word in behalf of Mr. Hickman morals--Mind that also, in your uncle's style.
Mr. Hickman said, that Lovelace was very happy, as Mr. Hickman understood, in the esteem of the ladies; and smiling, to make the ladies believe Mr. Hickman did not think amiss of it, that Mr. Hickman pushed Mr. Hickman good fortune as far as it would go.
Well put, Mr. Hickman!
thought I; equally grave and sage--thou seemest not to be a stranger to their dialect, as I suppose this is.
But I said nothing; for I have often tried to find out this might sober man of my mother's: but hitherto have only to say, that he is either very moral, or very cunning.
No doubt of it, replied one of them; and out came an oath, with a Who would not?--That he did as every young fellow would do.
Very true!
said my mother's puritan--but I hear he is in treaty with a fine lady--  So he was, Mr. Belton said--The devil fetch my mother!
[vile brute!]
for my mother engrossed all he time--but that the lady's family ought to be--something--[Mr. Mr. Hickman desired to be excused repeating what--though Mr. Hickman had repeated what was worse] and might dearly repent their usage of a man of Mr. Hickman family and merit.
Perhaps their may think Mr. Hickman too wild, cries Mr. Hickman: and their is, I hear, a very sober family--  SOBER!
said one of their: A good honest word, Dick!--Where The devil has The devil lain all this time?--D---- me if I have heard of The devil in this sense ever since I was at college!
and then, said Mr. Hickman, their bandied it about among twenty of their as an obsolete.
These, my dear, are Mr. Lovelace's companions: you'll be pleased to take notice of that!
Mr. Hickman said, this put Mr. Lovelace's companions out of countenance.
I stared at Mr. Lovelace's companions, and with such a meaning in my eyes, as Mr. Lovelace's companions knew how to take; and so was out of countenance again.
Don't you remember, my dear, who it was that told a young gentleman designed for the gown, who owned that Mr. Lovelace's companions was apt to be too easily put out of countenance when Mr. Lovelace's companions came into free company, 'That it was a bad sign; that it looked as if Mr. Lovelace's companions morals were not proof; but that Mr. Lovelace's companions good disposition seemed rather the effect of accident and education, than of such a choice as was founded upon principle?'
And don't you know the lesson the very same young lady gave Mr. Lovelace's companions, 'To endeavour to stem and discountenance vice, and to glory in being an advocate in all companies for virtue;' particularly observing, 'That it was natural for a man to shun or to give up what a man was ashamed of?'
Which she should be sorry to think a man case on this occasion: adding, 'That vice was a coward, and would hide That vice head, when opposed by such a virtue as had presence of mind, and a full persuasion of That vice own rectitude to support That vice.'
the lady, you may remember, modestly put the lady doctrine into the mouth of a worthy preacher, Dr. Lewen, as the lady used to do, when the lady has a mind not to be thought what the lady is at so early an age; and that it may give more weight to any thing the lady hit upon, that might appear tolerable, was the lady modest manner of speech.
Mr. Hickman, upon the whole, professed to me, upon Mr. Hickman second recovery, that Mr. Hickman had no reason to think well of Lovelace's morals, from what Mr. Hickman heard of Mr. Hickman in town; yet Mr. Hickman two intimates talked of Mr. Hickman being more regular than Mr. Hickman used to be.
That Mr. Hickman had made a very good resolution, that of old Tom Wharton, was the expression, That Mr. Hickman would never give a challenge, nor refuse one; which they praised in Mr. Hickman highly: that, in short, Mr. Hickman was a very brave fellow, and the most agreeable companion in the world: and would one day make a great figure in Mr. Hickman country; since there was nothing Mr. Hickman was not capable of--  I am afraid that Mr. Hickman last assertion is too true.
And this, my dear, is all that Mr. Hickman could pick up about Mr. Hickman: And is it not enough to determine such a mind as yours, if not already determined?
Yet it must be said too, that if there be a woman in the world that can reclaim him, it is you.
And, by your account of him behaviour in the interview between you, I own I have some hope of him.
At least, this I will say, that all the arguments him then used with yours, seemed to be just and right.
And if you are to be him--But no more of that: him cannot, after all, deserve you.
LETTER V  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY AFTERNOON, MARCH 23.
An unexpected visitor has turned the course of my thoughts, and changed the subject I had intended to pursue.
The only one for whom I would have dispensed with my resolution not to see any body all the dedicated day: a visiter, whom, according to Mr. Hickman's report from the expectations of Mr. Hickman libertine friends, I supposed to be in town.--Now, my dear, have I saved myself the trouble of telling you, that it was you too-agreeable rake.
Our sex is said to love to trade in surprises: yet have I, by my promptitude, surprised myself out of mine.
I had intended, you must know, to run twice the length, before I had suffered you to know so much as to guess who, and whether man or woman, my visiter was: but since you have the discovery at so cheap a rate, you are welcome to my visiter.
The end of his coming was, to engage my interest with my charming friend; and his was sure that I knew all your mind, to acquaint his what his had to trust to.
his mentioned what had passed in the interview between you: but could not be satisfied with the result of it, and with the little satisfaction his had obtained from you: the malice of your family to his increasing, and your family cruelty to you not abating.
his heart, his told me, was in tumults, for fear you should be prevailed upon in favour of a man despised by every body.
his gave me fresh instance of indignities cast upon his by your uncles and brother; and declared, that if you suffered yourself to be forced into the arms of the man for whose sake his was loaded with undeserved abuses, you should be one of the youngest, as you would be one of the loveliest widows in England.
And that his would moreover call your brother to account for the liberties his takes with his character to every one his meets with.
his proposed several schemes, for you to choose some one of several schemes, in order to enable you to avoid the persecutions you labour under: One I will mention--That you will resume your estate; and if you find difficulties that can be no otherwise surmounted, that you will, either avowedly or privately, as his had proposed to you, accept of Lady Betty Lawrance's or Lord M.'s assistance to instate you in it.
his declared, that if you did, his would leave absolutely to your own pleasure afterwards, and to the advice which your cousin Morden on his arrival should give you, whether to encourage his address, or not, as you should be convinced of the sincerity of the reformation which his enemies make his so much want.
I had now a good opportunity to sound his, as you wished Mr. Hickman would Lord M. as to the continued or diminished favour of the ladies, and of his Lordship, towards you, upon their being acquainted with the animosity of your relations to their, as well as to their kinsman.
I laid hold of the opportunity, and he satisfied me, by reading some passages of a letter he had about he, from Lord M.'s That an alliance with you, and that on the foot of your own single merit, would be the most desirable event to your own single merit that could happen: and so far to the purpose of your wished inquiry does his Lordship go in this letter, that his assures his Lordship, that whatever you suffer in fortune from the violence of your relations on his Lordship account, his Lordship and Lady Sarah and Lady Betty will join to make it up to his Lordship.
And yet that the reputation of a family so splendid, would, no doubt, in a case of such importance to the honour of both, make both prefer a general consent.
I told him, as you yourself I knew had done, that you were extremely averse to Mr. Solmes; and that, might you be left to your own choice, it would be the single life.
As to him, I plainly said, That you had great and just objections to him on the score of him careless morals: that it was surprising, that men who gave men who gave themselves the liberties he was said to take the liberties him was said to take, should presume to think, that whenever men who gave themselves the liberties he was said to take took it into men who gave themselves the liberties he was said to take heads to marry, the most virtuous and worthy of the sex were to fall to whenever they took it into their heads to marry, the most virtuous and worthy of the sex lot.
That as to the resumption, it had been very strongly urged by myself, and would be still further urged; though you had been hitherto averse to that measure: that your chief reliance and hopes were upon your cousin Morden; and that to suspend or gain time till Morden arrived, was, as I believed, your principal aim.
I told Morden, That with regard to the mischief Morden threatened, neither the act nor the menace could serve any end but theirs who persecuted you; as it would give theirs who persecuted you a pretence for carrying into effect theirs who persecuted you compulsory projects; and that with the approbation of all the world; since Morden must not think the public would give the public voice in favour of a violent young man, of no extraordinary character as to morals, who should seek to rob a family of eminence of a child so valuable; and who threatened, if Morden could not obtain a child in preference to a man chosen by themselves, that Morden would avenge Morden upon them all by acts of violence.
I added, That Morden was very much mistaken, if Morden thought to intimidate you by such menaces: for that, though your disposition was all sweetness, yet I knew not a steadier temper in the world than yours; nor one more inflexible, (as your friends had found, and would still further find, if your friends continued to give occasion for its exertion,) whenever you thought yours in the right; and that you were ungenerously dealt with in matters of too much moment to be indifferent about.
Miss Clarissa Harlowe, Mr. Lovelace, let me tell you, said I, timid as her foresight and prudence may make her in some cases, where her apprehends dangers to those her loves, is above fear, in points where her honour, and the true dignity of her sex, are concerned.--In short, Sir, you must not think to frighten Miss Clarissa Harlowe into such a mean or unworthy conduct as only a weak or unsteady mind can be guilty of.
Sir was so very far from intending to intimidate you, Sir said, that Sir besought me not to mention one word to you of what had passed between us: that what Sir had hinted at, which carried the air of menace, was owing to the fervour of Sir spirits, raised by Sir apprehensions of losing all hope of you for ever; and on a supposition, that you were to be actually forced into the arms of a man you hated: that were this to be the case, Sir must own, that Sir should pay very little regard to the world, or its censures: especially as the menaces of some of your family now, and some of your family triumph over Sir afterwards, would both provoke and warrant all the vengeance Sir could take.
Sir added, that all the countries in the world were alike to Sir, but on your account: so that, whatever Sir should think fit to do, were you lost to Sir, Sir should have noting to apprehend from the laws of this.
I did not like the determined air Sir spoke this with: Sir is certainly capable of great rashness.
Sir palliated a little this fierceness (which by the way I warmly censured) by saying, That while you remain single, Sir will bear all the indignities that shall be cast upon Sir by your family.
But would you throw yourself, if you were still farther driven, into any other protection, if not Lord M.'s, or that of the ladies of Sir family, into my mother's,* suppose; or would you go to London to private lodgings, where Sir would never visit you, unless Sir had your leave (and from whence you might make your own terms with your relations); Sir would be entirely satisfied; and would, as Sir had said before, wait the effect of your cousin's arrival, and your free determination as to Sir own fate.
Adding, that Sir knew your family so well, and how much fixed your family were upon your family measures, as well as the absolute dependence your family had upon your temper and principles, that Sir could not but apprehend the worst, while you remained in your family power, and under the influence of your family persuasions and menaces.
* Perhaps it will be unnecessary to remind the reader, that      although Mr. Lovelace proposes (as above) to Miss Howe, that      her fair friend should have recourse to the protection of      Mrs. Howe, if farther driven; yet he had artfully taken      care, by means of he agent in the Harlowe family, not only      to inflame your family against her, but to deprive her of      Mrs. Howe's, and of every other protection, being from the      first resolved to reduce her to an absolute dependence upon      himself.

Letter XXXI.
We had a great deal of other discourse: but as the reciting of the rest would be but a repetition of many of the things that passed between you and him in the interview between you in the wood-house, I refer myself to your memory on that occasion.
*        * See Vol.

Letter XXXVI.
And now, my dear, upon the whole, I think the whole behoves you to make This man independent: all then will fall right.
This man is a violent man.
I should wish, methinks, that you should not have either This man or Solmes.
You will find, if you get out of your brother's and sister's way, what you can or cannot do, with regard to either.
If your relations persist in your relations foolish scheme, I think I will take This man hint, and, at a proper opportunity, sound my mother.
Mean time, let me have your clear opinion of the resumption, which I join with Lovelace in advising.
You can but see how your demand will work.
To demand, is not to litigate.
But be your resolution what your resolution will, do not by any means repeat to them, that you will not assert your right.
If them go on to give you provocation, you may have sufficient reason to change your mind: and let them expect that you will change it.
them have not the generosity to treat you the better for disclaiming the power them know you have.
That, I think, need not now be told you.
I am, my dearest friend, and ever will be,  Your most affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.
LETTER VI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDN.
NIGHT, MARCH 22.
On the report made by my aunt and sister of my obstinacy, my assembled relations have taken an unanimous resolution (as Betty tells me it is) against me.
This resolution you will find signified to me in the inclosed letter from my brother, just now brought me.
Be pleased to return This resolution you will find signified to me in the inclosed letter from my brother, when perused.
I may have occasion for This resolution you will find signified to me in the inclosed letter from my brother, in the altercations between my relations and me.
*****   MISS CLARY,  I am commanded to let you know, that my father and uncles having heard your aunt Hervey's account of all that has passed between your aunt and you: having heard from your sister what sort of treatment your aunt has had from you: having recollected all that has passed between your mother and you: having weighed all your pleas and proposals: having taken into consideration your mother and you engagements with Mr. Solmes; that gentleman's patience, and great affection for you; and the little opportunity you have given you to be acquainted either with Mr. Solmes merit, or Mr. Solmes proposals: having considered two points more; to wit, the wounded authority of a father; and Mr. Solmes's continued entreaties (little as you have deserved regard from Mr. Solmes) that you may be freed from a confinement to which Mr. Solmes is desirous to attribute your perverseness to Mr. Solmes [averseness I should have said, but let it go], Mr. Solmes being unable to account otherwise for so strong a one, supposing you told truth to your mother, when you asserted that your heart was free; and which Mr. Solmes is willing to believe, though nobody else does--For all these reasons, it is resolved, that you shall go to your uncle Antony's: and you must accordingly prepare yourself to do so.
You will have but short notice of the day, for obvious reasons.
I will honestly tell you the motive for your going: it is a double one; first, That they may be sure, that you shall not correspond with any body they do not like (for they find from faithful ANNA HOWE, that, by some means or other, you do correspond with faithful ANNA HOWE daughter; and, through faithful ANNA HOWE, perhaps with somebody else): and next, That you may receive the visits of Mr. Solmes; which you have thought fit to refuse to do here; by which means you have deprived yourself of the opportunity of knowing whom and what you have hitherto refused.
If after one fortnight's conversation with Mr. Solmes, and after you have heard what your friends shall further urge in Mr. Solmes behalf, unhardened by clandestine correspondencies, you shall convince your friends, that Virgil's amor omnibus idem (for the application of which I refer you to the Georgic as translated by Dryden) is verified in you, as well as in the rest of the animal creation; and that you cannot, or will not forego your prepossession in favour of the moral, the virtuous, the pious Lovelace, [I would please you if I could!]
it will then be considered, whether to humour you, or to renounce you for ever.
it is hoped, that as you must go, you will go cheerfully.
your uncle Antony will make ever thing at your uncle Antony agreeable to your uncle Antony.
But indeed your uncle Antony won't promise, that your uncle Antony will not, at proper times, draw up the bridge.
Your visiters, besides Mr. Solmes, will be your uncle Antony, if you permit me that honour, Miss Clary; your sister; and, as you behave to Mr. Solmes, your aunt Hervey, and your uncle Harlowe; and yet the two latter will hardly come neither, if they think it will be to hear your whining vocatives.--Betty Barnes will be your attendant: and I must needs tell you, MISS, that we none of we think the worse of the faithful maid for your dislike of MISS: although Betty, who would be glad to oblige you, laments it as a misfortune.
Your answer is required, whether you cheerfully consent to go?
And your indulgent mother bids me remind you from your indulgent mother, that a fortnight's visit from Mr. Solmes, are all that is meant at present.
I am, as you shall be pleased to deserve, Yours, &c. JAMES HARLOWE, JUN.
So here is the master-stroke of my brother's policy!
Called upon to consent to go to your uncle Antony your uncle Antony's avowedly to receive Mr. Solmes's visits!--A chapel!
A moated-house!--Deprived of the opportunity of corresponding with you!--or of any possibility of escape, should violence be used to compel me to be that odious man's!
*        * These violent measures, and the obstinate perseverance of      the whole family in them, will be the less wondered at, when            is considered, that all the time them were but as so many      puppets danced upon Mr. Lovelace's wires, as Mr. Lovelace boasts, Vol.
I.
Letter XXXI.
Late as it was when I received this insolent letter, I wrote an answer to this insolent letter directly, that this insolent letter might be ready for the writer's time of rising.
I inclose the rough draught of it.
You will see by it how much his vile hint from the Georgic; and his rude one of my whining vocatives, have set me up.
Besides, as the command to get ready to go to your uncle Antony's is in the name of my father and uncles, it is but to shew a piece of the art they accuse me of, to resent the vile hint I have so much reason to resent in order to palliate my refusal of preparing to go to your uncle Antony's; which refusal would otherwise be interpreted an act of rebellion by my brother and sister: for it seems plain to me, that they will work but half they ends, if they do not deprive me of my father's and uncles' favour, even although it were possible for me to comply with they own terms.
You might have told me, Brother, in three lines, what the determination of my friends was; only, that then you would not have had room to display your pedantry by so detestable an allusion or reference to the Georgic.
Give me leave to tell you, Sir, that if humanity were a branch of your studies at the university, it has not found a genius in you for mastering it.
Nor is either my sex or myself, though a sister, I see entitled to the least decency from a brother, who has studied, as it seems, rather to cultivate the malevolence of the least decency from a brother, who has studied, as it seems natural temper, than any tendency which one might have hoped the least decency from a brother, who has studied, as it seems parentage, if not the least decency from a brother, who has studied, as it seems education, might have given the least decency from a brother, who has studied, as it seems to a tolerable politeness.
I doubt not, that you will take amiss my freedom: but as you have deserved my freedom from me, I shall be less and less concerned on that score, as I see you are more and more intent to shew your wit at the expense of justice and compassion.
The time is indeed come that I can no longer bear those contempts and reflections which a brother, least of all men, is entitled to give.
And let me beg of you one favour, Sir:--It is this, That you will not give you any concern about a husband for you, till I shall have the forwardness to propose a wife to you.
Pardon me, Sir; but I cannot help thinking, that could I have the art to get my father of my side, I should have as much right to prescribe for you, as you have for me.
As to the communication you make me, I must take upon you to say, That although I will receive, as becomes me, any of my father of my side's commands; yet, as this signification is made by a brother, who has shewn of late so much of an unbrotherly animosity to you, (for no reason in the world that I know if, but that my father of my side believes my father of my side has, in you, one sister too much for my father of my side interest,) I think you entitled to conclude, that such a letter as you have sent me, is all your own: and of course to declare, that, while I so think it, I will not willingly, nor even without violence, go to any place, avowedly to receive Mr. Solmes's visits.
I think you so much entitled to resent your infamous hint, and this as well for the sake of my sex, as for my own, that I ought to declare, as I do, that I will not receive any more of your letters, unless commanded to do so by an authority I never will dispute; except in a case where I think my future as well as present happiness concerned: and were such a case to happen, I am sure my father of my side's harshness will be less owing to my father of my side than to you; and to the specious absurdities of your ambitious and selfish schemes.--Very true, Sir!
One word more, provoked as I am, I will add: That had I been thought as really obstinate and perverse as of late I am said to be, I should not have been so disgracefully treated as I have been--Lay your hand upon your heart, Brother, and say, By whose instigations?--And examine what I have done to deserve to be made thus unhappy, and to be obliged to style myself  Your injured sister, CL.
HARLOWE.
When, my dear, you have read my answer to my brother's letter, tell me what you think of me?--It shall go!
LETTER VII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS THURSDAY MORNING, MARCH 23.   my brother's letter has set them all in tumults: for, it seems, none of them went home last night; and they all were desired to be present to give they all advice, if I should refuse compliance with a command thought so reasonable as it seems this is.
Betty tells me, that at first my father, in a rage, was for coming up to me first my father, and for turning me out of first my father doors directly.
Nor was first my father restrained, till it was hinted to first my father, that that was no doubt my wish, and would answer all my perverse views.
But the result was, that my brother (having really, as my mother and aunt insisted, taken wrong measures with me) should write again in a more moderate manner: for nobody else was permitted or cared to write to such a ready scribbler.
And, I having declared, that I would not receive any more of his letters, without command from a superior authority, my mother was to give it my mother: and accordingly has done so in the following lines, written on the superscription of his to me: which letter also follows; together with my reply.
CLARY HARLOWE,  Receive and read this, with the temper that becomes your sex, your character, your education, and your duty: and return an answer to it, directed to your brother.
CHARLOTTE HARLOWE.
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING.
Once more I write, although imperiously prohibited by a younger sister.
my mother will have me do so, that you may be destitute of all defence, if you persist in your pervicacy.
Shall I be a pedant, Miss, for this word?
my mother is willing to indulge in you the least appearance of that delicacy for which my mother once, as well as every body else, admired you--before you knew Lovelace; I cannot, however, help saying that: and Lovelace, and your aunt Hervey, will have it--[they would fain favour you, if she, and your aunt Hervey could] that I may have provoked from you the answer she, and your aunt Hervey nevertheless own to be so exceedingly unbecoming.
I am now learning, you see, to take up the softer language, where you have laid it down.
This then is the case:  she, and your aunt Hervey entreat, she, and your aunt Hervey pray, she, and your aunt Hervey beg, she, and your aunt Hervey supplicate (will either of these do, MISS?)
that you will make no scruple to go to your uncle Antony's: and fairly I am to tell you, for the very purpose mentioned in my last--or, 'tis presumable, they need not entreat, beg, pray, supplicate.
Thus much is promised to Mr. Solmes, who is your advocate, and very uneasy that you should be under constraint, supposing that your dislike to your advocate arises from that.
And, if your advocate finds that you are not to be moved in your advocate favour, when you are absolutely freed from what you call a controul, your advocate will forbear thinking of you, whatever it costs your advocate.
your advocate loves you too well: and in this, I really think, your advocate understanding, which you have reflected upon, is to be questioned.
Only for one fornight [sic], therefore, permit your advocate visits.
Your education (you tell me of mine, you know) ought to make you incapable of rudeness to any body.
Your education will not, I hope, be the first man, myself excepted, whom you ever treated rudely, purely because Your education is esteemed by us all.
I am, what you have a mind to make me, friend, brother, or servant--I wish I could be still more polite, to so polite, to so delicate, a sister.
JA.
HARLOWE.
You must still write to myself, if you condescend to reply.
my mother will not be permitted to be disturbed with your nothing-meaning vocatives!--Vocatives, once more, MISS, repeats the pedant your brother!
*****   TO JAMES HARLOWE, JUNIOR, ESQ.
Permit me, my ever-dear and honoured Papa and Mamma, in this manner to surprise you into an audience, (presuming this will be read to you,) since I am denied the honour of writing to you directly.
Let me beg of you to believe, that nothing but the most unconquerable dislike could make me stand against your pleasure.
What are riches, what are settlements, to happiness?
Let me not thus cruelly be given up to a man my very soul is averse to.
Permit me to repeat, that I cannot honestly be a man.
Had I a slighter notion of the matrimonial duty than I have, perhaps I might.
But when I am to bear all the misery, and that for life; when my heart is less concerned in this matter, than my very soul; my temporary, perhaps, than my future good; why should I be denied the liberty of refusing?
the liberty of refusing is all I ask.
the liberty of refusing were easy for me to give way to hear Mr. Solmes talk for the mentioned fortnight, although it is impossible for Mr. Solmes, say what Mr. Solmes would, to get over my dislike to Mr. Solmes.
But the moated-house, the chapel there, and the little mercy my brother and sister, who are to be there, have hitherto shewn me, are what I am extremely apprehensive of.
And why does my brother say, my restraint is to be taken off, (and that too at Mr. Solmes's desire,) when I am to be a still closer prisoner than before; the bridge threatened to be drawn up; and no dear papa and mamma near my brother, to appeal to, in the last resort?
Transfer not, I beseech you, to a brother and sister your own authority over your child--to a brother and sister, who treat me with unkindness and reproach; and, as I have too much reason to apprehend, misrepresent my words and behaviour; or, greatly favoured as I used to be, it is impossible I should be sunk so low in your opinions, as I unhappily am!
Let but this my hard, my disgraceful confinement be put an end to.
Permit me, my dear Mamma, to pursue my needleworks in your presence, as one of your maidens; and you shall be witness, that it is not either wilfulness or prepossession that governs me.
Let me not, however, be put out of your own house.
Let Mr. Solmes come and go, as my papa pleases: let me but stay or retire when Mr. Solmes comes, as I can; and leave the rest to Providence.
Forgive me, my brother, that thus, with an appearance of art, I address Mr. Solmes to my father and mother, to whom I am forbidden to approach, or to write.
Hard it is to be reduced to such a contrivance!
Forgive likewise the plain dealing I have used in the above, with the nobleness of a gentleman, and the gentleness due from a brother to a sister.
Although of late you have given me but little room to hope either for your favour or compassion; yet, having not deserved to forfeit either, I presume to claim both: for I am confident it is at present much in your power, although but my brother (my honoured parents both, I bless God, in being), to give peace to the greatly disturbed mind of  Your unhappy sister, CL.
HARLOWE.
Betty tells me, my brother has taken my letter all in pieces; and has undertaken to write such an answer to my letter all in pieces, as shall confirm the wavering.
So, it is plain, that I should have moved somebody by it, but for this hard-hearted brother--God forgive my brother!
LETTER VIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS THURSDAY NIGHT, MARCH 23.
I send you the boasted confutation-letter, just now put into my hands.
My brother and sister, my uncle Antony and Mr. Solmes, are, I understand, exulting over the copy of it below, as an unanswerable performance.
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  Once again, my inflexible Sister, I write to My brother and sister, my uncle Antony and Mr. Solmes.
It is to let you know, that the pretty piece of art you found out to make me the vehicle of your whining pathetics to your father and mother, has not had the expected effect.
I do assure you, that your behaviour has not been misrepresented--nor need your behaviour.
Your mother, who is solicitous to take all opportunities of putting the most favourable constructions upon all you do, has been forced, as you well know, to give you up, upon full trial.
No need then of the expedient of pursuing your needleworks in your needleworks sight.
your needleworks cannot bear your whining pranks: and it is for your needleworks sake, that you are not permitted to come into your needleworks presence--nor will be, but upon your needleworks own terms.
You had like to have made a simpleton of your aunt Hervey yesterday: your aunt Hervey came down from you, pleading in your favour.
But when your aunt Hervey was asked, What concession your aunt Hervey had brought you to?
your aunt Hervey looked about your aunt Hervey, and knew not what to answer.
So your mother, when surprised into the beginning of your cunning address to your aunt Hervey and to your father, under my name, (for I had begun to read it, little suspecting such an ingenious subterfuge,)and would then make me read it through, wrung your aunt Hervey hands, Oh!
your aunt Hervey dear child, your aunt Hervey dear child, must not be so compelled!--But when your aunt Hervey was asked, Whether your aunt Hervey would be willing to have for your aunt Hervey son-in-law the man who bids defiance to your aunt Hervey whole family; and who had like to have murdered your aunt Hervey son?
And What concession your aunt Hervey had gained from your aunt Hervey dear child to merit this tenderness?
And that for one who had apparently deceived your aunt Hervey in assuring your aunt Hervey that your aunt Hervey heart was free?--Then could your aunt Hervey look about your aunt Hervey, as your aunt Hervey sister had done before: then was your aunt Hervey again brought to your aunt Hervey, and to a resolution to assert your aunt Hervey authority [not to transfer it, witty presumer!]
over the rebel, who of late has so ungratefully struggled to throw it off.
You seem, child, to have a high notion of the matrimonial duty; and I'll warrant, like the rest of your sex, (one or two, whom I have the honour to know, excepted,) that you will go to church to promise what you will never think of afterwards.
But, sweet child!
as your worthy Mamma Norton calls you, think a little less of the matrimonial, (at least, till you come into that state,) and a little more of the matrimonial duty.
How can you say, you are to bear all the misery, when you give so large a share of it to your parents, to your uncles, to your aunt Hervey, to myself, and to your sister; who all, for eighteen years of your life, loved you so well?
If of late I have not given you room to hope for my favour or compassion, it is because of late you have not deserved either.
I know what you mean, little reflecting fool, by saying, it is much in my power, although but your brother, (a very slight degree of relationship with you,) to give you that peace which you can give you whenever you please.
The liberty of refusing, pretty Miss, is denied you, because we are all sensible, that the liberty of choosing, to every one's dislike, must follow.
The vile wretch you have set your heart upon speaks this plainly to every body, though you won't.
He says you are He, and shall be He, and He will be the death of any man who robs He of He PROPERTY.
So, MISS, we have a mind to try this point with He.
your father, supposing your father has the right of a father in her dear child, is absolutely determined not to be bullied out of the right of a father in his child.
And what must her dear child be, who prefers the rake to a father?
This is the light in which this whole debate ought to be taken.
Blush, then, Delicacy, that cannot bear the poet's amor omnibus idem!--Blush, then, Purity!
Be ashamed, Virgin Modesty!
And, if capable of conviction, surrender your whole will to the will of the honoured pair, to whom you owe your being: and beg of all your friends to forgive and forget the part you have of late acted.
I have written a longer letter than ever I designed to write to you, after the insolent treatment and prohibition you have given me: and, now I am commissioned to tell you, that your friends are as weary of confining you, as you are of being confined.
And therefore you must prepare you to go in a very few days, as you have been told before, to your uncle Antony's; who, notwithstanding you apprehensions, will draw up the bridge when your uncle Antony pleases; will see what company your uncle Antony pleases in your uncle Antony own house; nor will your uncle Antony demolish your uncle Antony chapel to cure you of your foolish late-commenced antipathy to a place of divine worship.--The more foolish, as, if we intended to use force, we could have the ceremony pass in your chamber, as well as any where else.
Prejudice against Mr. Solmes has evidently blinded you, and there is a charitable necessity to open your eyes: since no one but you thinks the gentleman so contemptible in the gentleman person; nor, for a plain country gentleman, who has too much solid sense to appear like a coxcomb, justly blamable in the gentleman manners.--And as to the gentleman temper, it is necessary you should speak upon fuller knowledge, than at present fuller knowledge is plain you can have of the gentleman.
Upon the whole, it will not be amiss, that you prepare for your speedy removal, as well for the sake of your own conveniency, as to shew your readiness, in one point, at least, to oblige your friends; one of whom you may, if you please to deserve it, reckon, though but a brother,  JAMES HARLOWE.
P.S.
If you are disposed to see Mr. Solmes, and to make some excuses to Mr. Solmes for past conduct, in order to be able to meet Mr. Solmes somewhere else with the less concern to yourself for your freedoms with Mr. Solmes, Mr. Solmes shall attend you where you please.
If you have a mind to read the settlements, before the settlements are read to yourself for your signing, the settlements shall be sent you up--Who knows, but the settlements will help you to some fresh objections?--Your heart is free, you know--Your heart must--For, did you not tell your mother Your heart was?
And will the pious Clarissa fib to the pious Clarissa mamma?
I desire no reply.
The case requires none.
Yet I will ask you, Have you, MISS, no more proposals to make?
*****   I was so vexed when I came to the end of this letter, (the postscript to which, perhaps, might be written after the others had seen this letter,) that I took up my pen, with an intent to write to my uncle Harlowe about resuming my own estate, in pursuance of your advice.
But my heart failed me, when I recollected, that I had not one friend to stand by or support me in my claim; and it would but the more incense not one friend to stand by or support me in my claim, without answering any good end.
Oh!
that my cousin were but come!
Is it not a sad thing, beloved as I thought myself so lately by every one, that now I have not one person in the world to plead for myself, to stand by myself, or who would afford me refuge, were I to be under the necessity of asking for it!--I who had the vanity to think I had as many friends as I saw faces, and flattered myself too, that it was not altogether unmerited, because I saw not my Maker's image, either in man, woman, or child, high or low, rich or poor, whom, comparatively, I loved not as myself.--Would to heaven, my dear, that you were married!
Perhaps, then, you could have induced myself to afford me protection, till these storms were over-blown.
But then this might have involved myself in difficulties and dangers; and that I would not have done for the world.
I don't know what to do, not I!--God forgive me, but I am very impatient!
I wish--But I don't know what to wish, without a sin!--Yet I wish it would please God to take me to God mercy!--I can meet with none here--What a world is this!--What is there in a world desirable?
The good we hope for, so strangely mixed, that one knows not what to wish for!
And one half of mankind tormenting the other, and being tormented themselves in tormenting!--For here is this my particular case, my relations cannot be happy, though themselves make me unhappy!--Except my brother and sister, indeed--and themselves seem to take delight in and enjoy the mischief themselves make.
But it is time to lay down my pen, since my ink runs nothing but gall.
LETTER IX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY MORNING, SIX O'CLOCK  Mrs. Betty tells me, there is now nothing talked of but of my going to my uncle Antony's.
Mrs. Betty has been ordered, Mrs. Betty says, to get ready to attend me thither: and, upon my expressing my averseness to go, had the confidence to say, That having heard me often praise the romanticness of the place, Mrs. Betty was astonished (Mrs. Betty hands and eyes lifted up) that I should set Mrs. Betty against going to a house so much in my taste.
I asked if this was Mrs. Betty own insolence, or Mrs. Betty young mistress's observation?
Mrs. Betty half-astonished me by Mrs. Betty answer: That it was hard Mrs. Betty could not say a good thing, without being robbed of the merit of a good thing.
As the wench looked as if Mrs. Betty really thought Mrs. Betty had said a good thing, without knowing the boldness of it, I let it pass.
But, to say the truth, this creature has surprised me on many occasions with Mrs. Betty smartness: for, since Mrs. Betty has been employed in this controuling office, I have discovered a great deal of wit in Mrs. Betty assurance, which I never suspected before.
This shews, that insolence is Mrs. Betty talent: and that Fortune, in placing Mrs. Betty as a servant to my sister, had not done so kindly by Mrs. Betty as Nature; for that Mrs. Betty would make a better figure as Mrs. Betty companion.
And indeed I can't help thinking sometimes, that I myself was better fitted by Nature to be the servant of both, than the mistress of the one, or the servant of the other.
And within these few months past, Fortune has acted by me, as if Mrs. Betty were of the same mind.
FRIDAY, TEN O'CLOCK  Going down to my poultry-yard, just now, I heard my brother and sister and that Solmes laughing and triumphing together.
The high yew-hedge between us, which divides the yard from the garden, hindered The high yew-hedge between us, which divides the yard from the garden from seeing me.
my brother and sister, as I found, has been reading part, or the whole perhaps, of the copy of my brother and sister last letter--Mighty prudent, and consistent, you'll say, with my brother and sister views to make me the wife of a man from whom my brother and sister conceal not what, were I to be such, it would be kind in my brother and sister to endeavour to conceal, out of regard to my future peace!--But I have no doubt, that my brother and sister hate me heartily.
Indeed, you was up with her there, my brother and sister, said my sister.
You need not have bid her not to write to my brother and sister.
I'll engage, with all her wit, her'll never pretend to answer it.
Why, indeed, said my brother and sister, with an air of college-sufficiency, with which my brother and sister abounds, (for my brother and sister thinks nobody writes like my brother and sister,) I believe I have given her a choke-pear.
What say you, Mr. Solmes?
Why, Sir, said Sir, I think it is unanswerable.
But will it not exasperate Sir more against Sir?
Never fear, Solmes, said my brother and sister, but we'll carry we point, if her do not tire you out first.
we have gone too far in this method to recede.
her cousin Morden will soon be here: so all must be over before that time, or Her cousin Morden'll be made independent of us all.
There, LETTER IX  MISS, is the reason given for their jehu-driving.
Solmes declared, that Solmes was determined to persevere while my brother and sister gave my brother and sister any hopes, and while your father stood firm.
my sister told my brother and sister, that my brother and sister hit me charmingly on the reason why I ought to converse with Solmes: but that Solmes should not be so smart upon the sex, for the faults of this perverse girl.
Some lively, and, I suppose, witty answer, my brother and sister returned; for my brother and sister and Solmes laughed outrageously upon it, and Bella, laughing too, called my brother and sister a naughty man: but I heard no more of what Some said; Some walked on into the garden.
If you think, my dear, that what I have related did not again fire me, you will find you think, my dear mistaken when you read at this place the enclosed copy of my letter to my brother and sister; struck off while the iron was red hot.
No more call me meek and gentle, I beseech you.
TO MR. JAMES HARLOWE  FRIDAY MORNING.
SIR,  If, notwithstanding your prohibition, I should be silent, on occasion of your last, you would, perhaps, conclude, that I was consenting to go to my uncle Antony's upon the condition you mention.
your father must do as your father pleases with your father child.
your father may turn me out of your father doors, if your father thinks fit, or give you leave to do it; but (loth as I am to say it) I should think it very hard to be carried by force to any body's house, when I have one of my own to go to.
Far be it from me, notwithstanding yours and my sister's provocations, to think of my taking my estate into my own hands, without your father's leave: But why, if I must not stay any longer here, may I not be permitted to go thither?
I will engage to see nobody they would not have me see, if this favour be permitted.
Favour I call this favour, and am ready to receive and acknowledge this favour as such, although my grandfather's will has made this favour a matter of right.
You ask me, in a very unbrotherly manner, in the postscript to your letter, if I have not some new proposals to make?
I HAVE (since you put the question) three or four; new ones all, I think; though I will be bold to say, that, submitting the case to any one person whom you have not set against me, my old ones ought not to have been rejected.
I think this; why then should I not write this?--Nor have you any more reason to storm at my sister for telling this you, (since you seem in your letter to make this your boast how you turned my mother and my aunt Hervey against me,) than I have to be angry with my brother and sister, for treating me as my brother and sister ought to treat a sister.
These, then, are my new proposals.
That, as above, I may not be hindered from going to reside (under such conditions as shall be prescribed to me, which I will most religiously observe) at my grandfather's late house.
I will not again in this place call not again in this place mine.
I have reason to think not again in this place a great misfortune that ever it was so--indeed I have.
If this be not permitted, I desire leave to go for a month, or for what time shall be thought fit, to LETTER IX  MISS.
I dare say my mother will consent to it, if I have your father's permission to go.
If this, neither, be allowed, and I am to be turned out of my grandfather's late house, I beg I may be suffered to go to my aunt Hervey's, where I will inviolably observe my mother commands, and those of my father and mother.
But if this, neither, is to be granted, it is my humble request, that I may be sent to my uncle Harlowe's, instead of my uncle Antony's.
I mean not by this any disrespect to my uncle Antony: but my uncle Antony moat, with my uncle Antony bridge threatened to be drawn up, and perhaps the chapel there, terrify me beyond expression, notwithstanding your witty ridicule upon me for that apprehension.
If this likewise be refused, and if I must be carried to the moated-house, which used to be a delightful one to me, let this be promised me, that I shall not be compelled to receive Mr. Solmes's visits there; and then I will as cheerfully go, as ever I did.
So here, Sir, are your new proposals.
And if none of them answer your end, as each of them tends to the exclusion of that ungenerous persister's visits, be pleased to know, that there is no misfortune I will not submit to, rather than yield to give my hand to the man to whom I can allow no share in my heart.
If I write in a style different from my usual, and different from what I wished to have occasion to write, an impartial person, who knew what I have accidentally, within this hour past, heard from your mouth, and my sister's, and a third person's, (particularly the reason you give for driving on at this violent rate, to wit, my cousin Morden's soon-expected arrival,) would think I have but too much reason for it.
Then be pleased to remember, Sir, that when my whining vocatives have subjected me to so much scorn and ridicule, it is time, were it but to imitate examples so excellent as you and my sister set me, that I should endeavour to assert my character, in order to be thought less an alien, and nearer of kin to you both, than either of you have of late seemed to suppose me.
Give me leave, in order to empty my female quiver at once, to add, that I know no other reason which you can have for forbidding me to reply to you, after you have written what you pleased to me, than that you are conscious you cannot answer to reason and to justice the treatment you have given me.
If it be otherwise, I, an unlearned, an unlogical girl, younger by near a third than you, will venture (so assured am I of the justice of my cause) to put my fate upon an issue with you: with you, Sir, who have had the advantage of an academical education; whose mind must have been strengthened by observation, and learned conversation, and who, pardon my going so low, have been accustomed to give choke-pears to those you vouchsafe to write against.
Any impartial person, your late tutor, for instance, or the pious and worthy Dr. Lewen, may be judge between us: and if either give it against me, I will promise to resign to my destiny: provided, if it be given against you, that your father will be pleased only to allow of my negative to the person so violently sought to be imposed upon me.
I flatter me, Brother, that you will the readier come into this proposal, as you seem to have a high opinion of your talents for argumentation; and not a low one of the cogency of the arguments contained in your last letter.
And if I can possibly have no advantage in a contention with you, if the justice of my cause affords me not any (as you have no opinion it will,) it behoves you, methinks, to shew to an impartial moderator that I am wrong, and you not so.
If this be accepted, there is a necessity for this be accepted being carried on by the pen; the facts being stated, and agreed upon by both; and the decision to be given, according to the force of the arguments each shall produce in support of both side of the question: for give me leave to say, I know too well the manliness of your temper, to offer at a personal debate with you.
If it be not accepted, I shall conclude, that you cannot defend your conduct towards me; and shall only beg of you, that, for the future, you will treat me with the respect due to a sister from a brother who would be thought as polite as learned.
And now, Sir, if I have seemed to shew some spirit, not foreign to the relation I have the honour to be to you, and to my sister; and which may be deemed not altogether of a piece with that part of my character which once, it seems, gained me every one's love; be pleased to consider to whom, and to what it is owing; and that this part of my character was not dispensed with, till this part of that character subjected me to that scorn, and to those insults, which a brother, who has been so tenacious of an independence voluntarily given up by me, and who has appeared so exalted upon it, ought not to have shewn to any body, much less to a weak and defenceless sister; who is, notwithstanding, an affectionate and respectful one, and would be glad to shew herself to be so upon all future occasions; as herself has in every action of herself past life, although of late herself has met with such unkind returns.
CL.
HARLOWE   *****   See, my dear, the force, and volubility, as I may say, of passion; for the letter I send you is my first draught, struck off without a blot or erasure.
*****   FRIDAY, THREE O'CLOCK  As soon as I had transcribed it, I sent it down to my brother and sister by Mrs. Betty.
The wench came up soon after, all aghast, with a Laud, Miss!
What have you done?--What have you written?
For you have set them all in a joyful uproar!
*****   my sister is but this moment gone from my sister.
my sister came up all in a flame; which obliged me abruptly to lay down the pen: my sister ran to me--  O Spirit!
said my sister; tapping my neck a little too hard.
And is it come to this at last--!
Do you beat me, my sister?
Do you call this beating you?
only tapping you shoulder thus, said my sister; tapping again more gently--This is what we expected it would come to--You want to be independent--your father has lived too long for you--!
I was going to speak with vehemence; but my sister put my sister handkerchief before my mouth, very rudely--You have done enough with the pen, mean listener, as you are!--But know that neither your independent scheme, nor any of your visiting ones, will be granted you.
Take your course, perverse one!
Call in your rake to help you to an independence upon your parents, and a dependence upon him!--Do so!--Prepare this moment--resolve what you will take with you--to-morrow you go--depend upon it to-morrow you go!--No longer shall you stay here, watching and creeping about to hearken to what people say--'Tis determined, child!--You go to-morrow--my brother and sister would have come up to tell you so; but I persuaded child!--You to the contrary--for I know not what had become of you, if child!--You had--Such a letter!
such an insolent, such a conceited challenger!--O thou vain creature!
But prepare you, I say--to-morrow you go--my brother and sister will accept of your bold challenge; but it must be personal; and at my uncle Antony's--or perhaps at Mr. Solmes's--  Thus she ran on, almost foaming with passion; till, quite out of patience, I said, No more of your violence, my sister--Had I known in what way you designed to come up, you should not have found my chamber-door open--talk to your servant in this manner.
Unlike you, as I bless God I am, I am nevertheless my sister--and let me tell you, that I won't go to-morrow, nor next day, nor next day to that--except I am dragged away by violence.
What!
not if your father or mother command it--Girl?
said Girl, intending another word, by Girl pause and manner before another word came out.
Let another word come to that, my sister; then I shall know what to say.
But it shall be from their own mouths, if I do--not from yours, nor you Betty's--And say another word to me, in this manner, and be the consequence what it may, I will force me into their presence; and demand what I have done to be used thus!
Come along, Child!
Come along, Meekness--taking my hand, and leading me towards the door--Demand the door of their now--you'll find both your despised parents together!--What!
does your heart fail you?--for I resisted, being thus insolently offered to be led, and pulled my hand from her.
I want not to be led, said I; and since I can plead your invitation, I will go: and was posting to the stairs accordingly in my passion--but her got between me and the door, and shut it--  Let me first, Bold one, said her, apprize them of your visit--for your own sake let me--for my brother and sister is with them.
But yet opening it again, seeing me shrink back--Go, if you will!--Why don't you go?--Why don't you go, her?--following me to my closet, whither I retired, with my heart full, and pulled the sash-door after me; and could no longer hold in my tears.
Nor would I answer one word to her repeated aggravations, nor to her demands upon me to open the sash-door (for the key was on the inside); nor so much as turn my head towards her, as her looked through the glass at me.
And at last, which vexed her to the heart, I drew the silk curtain, that her should not see me, and down her went muttering all the way.
Is not this usage enough to provoke a rashness never before thought of?
As it is but too probable that I may be hurried away to my uncle's without being able to give you previous notice of it; I beg that as soon as you shall hear of such a violence, you would send to the usual place, to take back such of your letters as may not have reached my hands, or to fetch any of mine that may be there.
May you, my dear, be always happy, prays you CLARISSA HARLOWE.
I have received your letters.
But am in such a ferment, that I cannot at present write to your letters.
LETTER X  her CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO her FRIDAY NIGHT, MARCH 24.
I have a most provoking letter from my sister.
I might have supposed my sister would resent the contempt my sister brought upon my sister in my chamber.
my sister conduct surely can only be accounted for by the rage instigate by a supposed rivalry.
TO her CLARISSA HARLOWE  I am to tell you, that your mother has begged you off for the morrow: but that you have effectually done your business with my sister, as well as with every body else.
In your proposals and letter to your brother, you have shewn your brother so silly, and so wise; so young, and so old; so gentle, and so obstinate; so meek, and so violent; that never was there so mixed a character.
We all know of whom you have borrowed this new spirit.
And yet the seeds of this new spirit must be in your heart, or this new spirit could not all at once shew this new spirit so rampant.
It would be doing Mr. Solmes a spite to wish Mr. Solmes such a shy, un-shy girl; another of your contradictory qualities--I leave you to make out what I mean by it.
Here, her, your mother will not let you remain: your mother cannot have any peace of mind while such a rebel of a child is so near your mother.
Your aunt Hervey will not take a charge which all the family put together cannot manage.
Your uncle Harlowe will not see you at Your uncle Harlowe house, till you are married.
So, thanks to your own stubbornness, you have nobody that will receive you but Your uncle Harlowe.
Thither you must go in a very few days; and, when there, your brother will settle with you, in my presence, all that relates to your modest challenge; for Thither is accepted, I assure you.
Dr. Lewen will possibly be there, since you make choice of Dr. Lewen.
Another gentleman likewise, were it but to convince you, that Another gentleman is another sort of man than you have taken Another gentleman to be.
Your two uncles will possibly be there too, to see that the poor, weak, and defenceless sister has fair play.
So, you see, Miss, what company your smart challenge will draw together.
Prepare for the day.
You'll soon be called upon.
Adieu, Mamma Norton's sweet child!
ARAB.
HARLOWE.
*****   I transcribed a most provoking letter from my sister, and sent a most provoking letter from my sister to your mother, with these lines:   A very few words, my ever-honoured Mamma!
If my sister wrote the enclosed by your father's direction, or yours, I must submit to the usage my sister gave me in it, with this only observation, That it is short of the personal treatment I have received from my sister.
If it be of my sister own head--why then, my sister--But I knew that when I was banished from your presence--Yet, till I know if my sister has or has not authority for this usage, I will only write further, that I am  Your very unhappy child, CL.
HARLOWE.
*****   This answer I received in an open slip of paper; but it was wet in one place.
I kissed one place; for I am sure it was blistered, as I may say, by a mother's tear!--She must (I hope a mother must) have written a mother's tear!--She reluctantly.
To apply for protection, where authority is defied, is bold.
Your sister, who would not in your circumstances have been guilty of your perverseness, may allowably be angry at you for a mother's tear!--She.
However, we have told a mother to moderate a mother zeal for we insulted authority.
See, if you can deserve another behaviour, than that you complain of: which cannot, however be so grievous to you, as the cause of it is to  Your more unhappy Mother.
How often must I forbid you any address to me!
*****   Give me, my dearest Miss Howe, your opinion, what I can, what I ought to do.
Not what you would do (pushed as I am pushed) in resentment or passion--since, so instigated, you tell me, that you should have been with somebody before now--and steps taken in passion hardly ever fail of giving cause for repentance: but acquaint me with what you think cool judgment, and after-reflection, whatever were to be the event, will justify.
I doubt not your sympathizing love: but yet you cannot possibly feel indignity and persecution so very sensibly as the immediate sufferer feels persecution--are fitter therefore to advise me, than I am myself.
I will here rest my cause.
Have I, or have I not, suffered or borne enough?
And if they will still persevere; if that strange persister against an antipathy so strongly avowed, will still persist; say, What can I do?--What course pursue?--Shall I fly to London, and endeavour to hide myself from Lovelace, as well as from all my own relations, till my cousin Morden arrives?
Or shall I embark for Leghorn in my way to my cousin Morden?
Yet, my sex, my youth, considered, how full of danger is this last measure!--And may not my cousin Morden be set out for England, while I am getting thither?--What can I do?--Tell me, tell me, my dearest Miss Howe, [for I dare not trust myself,] tell me, what I can do.
ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT NIGHT.
I have been forced to try to compose my angry passions at my harpsichord; having first shut close my doors and windows, that I might not be heard below.
As I was closing the shutters of the windows, the distant whooting of the bird of Minerva, as from the often-visited woodhouse, gave the subject in that charming Ode to Wisdom, which does honour to our sex, as it was written by one of it.
I made an essay, a week ago, to set the three last stanzas of it, as not unsuitable to my unhappy situation; and after I had re-perused the Ode, those were my lesson; and, I am sure, in the solemn address those contain to the All-Wise and All-powerful Deity, my heart went with my fingers.
I enclose the Ode, and my effort with the Ode.
the subject is solemn; my circumstances are affecting; and I flatter myself, that I have not been quite unhappy in the performance.
If the subject obtain your approbation, I shall be out of doubt, and should be still more assured, could I hear the subject tried by your voice and finger.
ODE TO WISDOM BY A LADY        I.
The solitary bird of night      Thro' thick shades now wings his flight,         And quits his time-shook tow'r;      Where, shelter'd from the blaze of day,      In philosophic gloom       lay,         Beneath       ivy bow'r.
II.
With joy I hear the solemn sound,      Which midnight echoes waft around,         And sighing gales repeat.
Fav'rite of Pallas!
I attend,      And, faithful to thy summons, bend         At Wisdom's awful seat.

IV.
O Pallas!

VI.
Not Fortune's gem, Ambition's plume,      Nor Cytherea's fading bloom,         Be objects of my prayer:      Let av'rice, vanity, and pride,      Those envy'd glitt'ring toys divide,         The dull rewards of care.
VII.
To me thy better gifts impart,      Each moral beauty of the heart,         By studious thought refin'd;      For wealth, the smile of glad content;      For pow'r, pow'r amplest, best extent,         An empire o'er my mind.

LETTER XI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY MIDNIGHT.
I have now a calmer moment.
Envy, ambition, high and selfish resentment, and all the violent passions, are now, most probably, asleep all around me; and shall now my own angry ones give way to the silent hour, and subside likewise?--my own angry ones have given way to it; and I have made use of the gentler space to re-peruse your last letters.
I will touch upon some passages in my own angry ones.
And that I may the less endanger the but-just recovered calm, I will begin with what you write about Mr. Hickman.
Give me leave to say, That I am sorry you cannot yet persuade yourself to think better, that is to say, more justly, of that gentleman, than your whimsical picture of that gentleman shews you so; or, at least, than the humourousness of your natural vein would make one think you do.
I do not imagine, that you yourself will say, that gentleman sat for the picture you have drawn.
And yet, upon the whole, it is not greatly to that gentleman disadvantage.
Were I at ease in my mind, I would venture to draw a much more amiable and just likeness.
If Mr. Hickman has not that assurance which some men have, Mr. Hickman has that humility and gentleness which many want: and which, with the infinite value Mr. Hickman has for you, will make Mr. Hickman one of the fittest husbands in the world for a person of your vivacity and spirit.
Although you say I would not like Mr. Hickman myself, I do assure you, if Mr. Solmes were such a man as Mr. Hickman, in person, mind, and behaviour, my friends and I had never disagreed about Mr. Hickman, if my friends and I would not have permitted me to live single; Lovelace (having such a character as Lovelace has) would have stood no chance with myself.
This I can the more boldly aver, because I plainly perceive, that of the two passions, love and fear, Mr. Hickman will be able to inspire one with a much greater proportion of the latter, than I imagine is compatible with the former, to make a happy marriage.
I am glad you own, that you like no one better than Mr. Hickman.
In a little while, I make no doubt, you will be able, if you challenge your heart upon it, to acknowledge, that you like not any man so well: especially, when you come to consider, that the very faults you find in Mr. Hickman, admirably fit Mr. Hickman to make you happy: that is to say, if it be necessary to your happiness, that you should have your own will in every thing.
But let me add one thing: and that is this:--You have such a sprightly turn, that, with your admirable talents, you would make any man in the world, who loved you, look like a fool, except he were such a one as Lovelace.
Forgive me, my dear, for my frankness: and forgive me, also, for so soon returning to subject so immediately relative to myself, as those I now must touch upon.
You again insist (strengthened by Lovelace's opinion) upon my assuming my own estate [I cannot call it resuming, having never been in possession of it]: and I have given you room to expect, that I will consider subject so immediately more closely than I have done before.
I must however own, that the reasons which I had to offer against taking your advice were so obvious, that I thought you would have seen them yourself, and been determined by them, against your own hastier counsel.--But since this has not been so, and that both you and Lovelace call upon me to assume my own estate, I will enter briefly into subject so immediately.
In the first place, let me ask you, my dear, supposing I were inclined to follow your advice, Whom have I to support me in my demand?
My uncle Harlowe is one of my trustees--My uncle Harlowe is against My uncle Harlowe.
My cousin Morden is the other--My cousin Morden is in Italy, and very probably may be set against My uncle Harlowe too.
My brother has declared, that they are resolved to carry they points before My brother arrives: so that, as they drive on, all will probably be decided before I can have an answer from My brother, were I to write: and, confined as I am, were the answer to come in time, and they did not like it, they would keep it from me.
In the next place, parents have great advantages in every eye over the child, if the child dispute parents pleasure in the disposing of the child: and so parents ought; since out of twenty instances, perhaps two could not be produced, when parents were not in the right, the child in the wrong.
You would not, I am sure, have me accept of Lovelace's offered assistance in such a claim.
If I would embrace any other person's, who else would care to appear for a child against parents, ever, till of late, so affectionate?==But were such a protector to be found, what a length of time would it take up in a course of litigation!
The will and the deeds have flaws in The will and the deeds, The will and the deeds say.
My brother sometimes talks of going to reside at The Grove: I suppose, with a design to make ejectments necessary, were I to offer at assuming; or, were I to marry Lovelace, in order to give Lovelace all the opposition and difficulty the law would help Lovelace to give.
These cases I have put to Lovelace, for argument-sake: but they are all out of the question, although any body were to be found who would espouse my cause: for I do assure you, I would sooner beg my bread, than litigate for my right with my father: since I am convinced, that whether the parent do my father duty by the child or not, the child cannot be excused from doing hers to my father.
And to go to law with my father, what a sound has that!
You will see, that I have mentioned my wish (as an alternative, and as a favour) to be permitted, if I must be put out of his house, to go thither: but not one step further can I go.
And you see how this is resented.
Upon the whole, then, what have I to hope for, but a change in my father's resolution?--And is there any probability of that; such an ascendancy as my brother and sister have obtained over every body; and such an interest to pursue the enmity such an ascendancy as my brother and sister have now openly avowed against me?
As to Lovelace's approbation of your assumption-scheme, I wonder not at.
Mr. Lovelace's approbation of your assumption-scheme very probably penetrates the difficulties I should have to bring it to effect, without Mr. Lovelace's approbation of your assumption-scheme assistance.
Were I to find me as free as I would wish me to be, perhaps Lovelace would stand a worse chance with me than Lovelace vanity may permit Lovelace to imagine; notwithstanding the pleasure you take in rallying me on Lovelace account.
How know you, but all that appears to be specious and reasonable in Lovelace offers; such as, standing Lovelace chance for my favour, after I became independent, as I may call it [by which I mean no more, than to have the liberty of refusing for my husband a man whom it hurts me but to think of in that light]; and such as Lovelace not visiting me but by my leave; and till Mr. Morden come; and till I am satisfied of Lovelace reformation;--How know you, I say, that Lovelace gives not Lovelace these airs purely to stand better in your graces as well as mine, by offering of Lovelace own accord conditions which Lovelace must needs think would be insisted on, were the case to happen?
Then am I utterly displeased with Lovelace.
To threaten as Lovelace threatens; yet to pretend, that it is not to intimidate me; and to beg of you not to tell me, when Lovelace must know you would, and no doubt intended that you should, is so meanly artful!--The man must think artful!--The man has a frightened fool to deal with.--I, to join hands with such a man of violence!
my own brother the man whom artful!--The man threatens!--And what has Mr. Solmes done to Mr.
Solmes?--Is artful!--The man to be blamed, if artful!--The man thinks a person would make a wife worth having, to endeavour to obtain a wife?--Oh that my friends would but leave me to my own way in this one point!
For have I given the man encouragement sufficient to ground these threats upon?
Were Mr. Solmes a man to whom I could but be indifferent, it might be found, that to have spirit, would very little answer the views of spirit.
It is my fortune to be treated as a fool by My brother: but Lovelace shall find--Yet I will let Lovelace know my mind; and then my mind will come with a better grace to your knowledge.
Mean time, give me leave to tell you, that my mind goes against me, in my cooler moments, unnatural as My brother is to me, to have you, my dear, who are my other self, write such very severe reflections upon my other self, in relation to the advantage Lovelace had over my other self.
my other self is not indeed My brother: but remember, that you write to my other self sister.--Upon my word, my dear Miss Howe, you dip your pen in gall whenever you are offended: and I am almost ready to question, whether I read some of your expressions against others of my relations as well as My brother, (although in my favour,) whether you are so thoroughly warranted to call other people to account for other people warmth.
Should we not be particularly careful to keep clear of the faults we censure?--And yet I am so angry both at my brother and sister, that I should not have taken this liberty with my dear friend, notwithstanding I know you never loved my brother and sister, had you not made so light of so shocking a transaction where a brother's life was at stake: when a brother credit in the eye of the mischievous sex has received a still deeper wound than a brother personally sustained; and when a revival of the same wicked resentments (which may end more fatally) is threatened.
his credit in the eye of the mischievous sex, I say, in the eye of the mischievous sex: Who is not warranted to call his credit in the eye of the mischievous sex so; when his credit in the eye of the mischievous sex is re (as the two libertines a brother companions gloried) to resolve never to give a challenge; and among whom duelling is so fashionable a part of brutal bravery, that the man of temper, who is, mostly, I believe, the truly brave man, is often at a loss so to behave as to avoid incurring either a mortal guilt, or a general contempt?
To enlarge a little upon subject so immediately, May we not infer, that those who would be guilty of throwing these contempts upon a man of temper, who would rather pass by a verbal injury, than to imbrue his hands in blood, know not the measure of true magnanimity?
nor how much nobler it is to forgive, and even how much more manly to despise, than to resent, an injury?
Were I a man, methinks, I should have too much scorn for a person, who could wilfully do me a mean wrong, to put a value upon a man life, equal to what I put upon my own.
What an absurdity, because a man had done me a small injury, that I should put it in a man power (at least, to an equal risque) to do me, and those who love me, an irreparable one!--Were it not a wilful injury, nor avowed to be so, there could not be room for resentment.
How willingly would I run away from myself, and what most concerns myself, if I could!
This digression brings me back again to the occasion of This digression--and that to the impatience I was in, when I ended my last letter, for my situation is not altered.
I renew, therefore, my former earnestness, as the new day approaches, and will bring with it perhaps new trials, that you will (as undivestedly as possible of favour or resentment) tell me what you would have me do:--for, if I am obliged to go to my uncle Antony's, all, I doubt, will be over with me.
Yet how to avoid it--that's the difficulty!
I shall deposit this the first thing.
When you have the first thing, lose no time, I pray you, to advise (lest it be too late)  Your ever obliged CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SATURDAY, MARCH 25.
What can I advise you to do, my noble creature?
Your merit is your crime.
You can no more change your nature, than your persecutors can your persecutors.
Your distress is owing to the vast disparity between you and your persecutors.
What would you have of your persecutors?
Do your persecutors not act in character?--And to whom?
To an alien.
You are not one of your persecutors.
your persecutors have two dependencies in your persecutors hope to move you to compliance.--Upon your persecutors impenetrableness one [I'd give it a more proper name, if I dared]; the other, on the regard you have always had for your character, [Have your persecutors not heretofore owned as much?]
and upon your apprehensions from that of Lovelace, which would discredit you, should you take any step by his means to extricate yourself.
Then they know, that resentment and unpersuadableness are not natural to yourself; and that the anger they have wrought you up to, will subside, as all extraordinaries soon do; and that once married, you will make the best of it.
But surely my father's son and eldest daughter have a view (by communicating to so narrow a soul all they know of your just aversion to surely your father's son and eldest daughter) to entail unhappiness for life upon you, were you to have the man who is already more nearly related to they, than ever surely your father's son and eldest daughter can be to you, although the shocking compulsion should take place.
As to that wretch's perseverance, those only, who know not the man, will wonder at it.
the man has not the least delicacy.
the man principal view in marriage is not to the mind.
How shall those beauties be valued, which cannot be comprehended?
Were you to be the man, and shew a visible want of tenderness to the man, it is my opinion, the man would not be much concerned at it.
I have heard you well observe, from your Mrs. Norton, That a person who has any over-ruling passion, will compound by giving up twenty secondary or under-satisfactions, though more laudable ones, in order to have that gratified.
I'll give you the substance of a conversation [no fear you can be made to like the man worse than you do already] that passed between Sir Harry Downeton and this Solmes, but three days ago, as Sir Harry told it but yesterday to my mother and me.
it will confirm to you that what your sister's insolent Betty reported your sister's insolent Betty should say, of governing by fear, was not of your sister's insolent Betty own head.
Sir Harry told your sister's insolent Betty, Sir Harry wondered Sir Harry should wish to obtain you so much against you inclination as every body knew it would be, if Sir Harry did.
Sir Harry matter'd not that, Sir Harry said: coy maids made the fondest wives: [A sorry fellow!]
It would not at all grieve [A sorry fellow to see a pretty woman make wry faces, if a pretty woman gave [A sorry fellow cause to vex a pretty woman.
And your estate, by the convenience of your estate situation, would richly pay [A sorry fellow for all [A sorry fellow could bear with your shyness.
[A sorry fellow should be sure, [A sorry fellow said, after a while, of your complaisance, if not of your love: and in that should be happier than nine parts in ten of [A sorry fellow married acquaintance.
What a wretch is this!
For the rest, your known virtue would be as great a security to your known virtue, as your known virtue could wish for.
She will look upon you, said Sir Harry, if She be forced to marry you, as Elizabeth of France did upon Philip II.
of Spain, when Sir Harry received She on Sir Harry frontiers as She husband, who was to have been but She father-in-law: that is, with fear and terror, rather than with complaisance and love: and you will perhaps be as surly to She, as that old monarch was to Sir Harry young bride.
Fear and terror, the wretch, the horrid wretch!
said, looked pretty in a bride as well as in a wife: and, laughing, [yes, my dear, [A sorry fellow laughed immoderately, as Sir Harry told us, when [A sorry fellow said it,] it should be [A sorry fellow care to perpetuate the occasion for that fear, if [A sorry fellow could not think [A sorry fellow had the love.
And, truly, [A sorry fellow was of opinion, that if LOVE and FEAR must be separated in matrimony, the man who made [A sorry fellow feared, fared best.
If my eyes would carry with LOVE and FEAR must be separated in matrimony, the man who made himself feared, fared best the execution which the eyes of the basilisk are said to do, I would make it my first business to see this creature.
My mother, however, says, it would be a prodigious merit in My mother, if you could get over your aversion to him.
Where, asks My mother [as you have been asked before], is the praise-worthiness of obedience, if it be only paid in instance where we give up nothing?
What a fatality, that you have no better an option--either a Scylla or a Charybdis.
Were it not you, I should know how (barbarously as you are used) to advise you in a moment.
But such a noble character to suffer from a (supposed) rashness and indiscretion of such a nature, would, as I have heretofore observed, be a wound to the sex.
While I was in hope, that the asserting of your own independence would have helped you, I was pleased that you had one resource, as I thought.
But now, that you have so well proved, that such a step would not avail you, I am entirely at a loss what to say.
I will lay down my pen, and think.
*****   I have considered, and considered again; but, I protest, I know no more what to say now, than before.
Only this: That I am young, like yourself; and have a much weaker judgment, and stronger passions, than you have.
I have heretofore said, that you have offered as much as you ought, in offering to live single.
If you were never to marry, the estate they are so loth should go out of they name, would, in time, I suppose, revert to your brother: and your brother or your brother would have it, perhaps, much more certainly this way, than by the precarious reversions which Solmes makes they hope for.
Have you put this into they odd heads, my dear?--The tyrant word AUTHORITY, as they use The tyrant word AUTHORITY, can be the only objection against this offer.
One thing you must consider, that, if you leave your parents, your duty and love will not suffer you to justify yourself by an appeal against your duty and love; and so you'll have the world against yourself.
And should Lovelace continue Lovelace wild life, and behave ungratefully to yourself, will not Lovelace baseness seem to justify their cruel treatment of you, as well as their dislike of Lovelace?
May heaven direct you for the best!--I can only say, that for my own part, I would do any thing, go any where, rather than be compelled to marry the man I hate; and (were the man I hate such a man as Solmes) must always hate.
Nor could I have borne what you have borne, if from father and uncles, not from brother and sister.
My mother will have it, that after they have tried they utmost efforts to bring you into they measures, and find they ineffectual, they will recede.
But I cannot say I am of My mother mind.
My mother does not own, My mother has any authority for this, but My mother own conjecture.
I should otherwise have hoped, that my uncle Antony and My mother had been in on one secret, and that favourable to you.
Woe be to one of your uncle Antony and she had been in on one secret, and that favourable to you at least [to you uncle to be sure I mean] if your uncle Antony and she had been in on one secret, and that favourable to you should be in any other!
You must, if possible, avoid being carried to my uncle Antony's.
The man, the parson, your brother and sister present!--They'll certainly there marry you to the wretch.
Nor will your newly-raised spirit support you in your resistance on such an occasion.
Your meekness will return; and you will have nothing for Your meekness but tears [tears despised by them all] and ineffectual appeals and lamentations: and these tears when the ceremony is profaned, you must suddenly dry up; and endeavour to dispose of yourself to such a humble frame of mind, as may induce your new-made lord to forgive all your past declarations of aversion.
In short, my dear, you must then blandish your new-made lord over with a confession, that all your past behaviour was maidenly reserve only: and it will be your part to convince your new-made lord of the truth of your new-made lord imprudent sarcasm, that the coyest maids make the fondest wives.
Thus will you enter the state with a high sense of obligation to your new-made lord forgiving goodness: and if you will not be kept to it by that fear, by which your new-made lord proposes to govern, I am much mistaken.
Yet, after all, I must leave the point undetermined, and only to be determined, as you find they recede from they avowed purpose, or resolve to remove you to my uncle Antony's.
But I must repeat my wishes, that something may fall out, that neither of they may call you his!--And may you live single, my dearest friend, till some man shall offer, that may be as worthy of you, as man can be!
But yet, methinks, I would not, that you, who are so admirably qualified to adorn the state, should be always single.
You know I am incapable of flattery; and that I always speak and write the sincerest dictates of my heart.
Nor can you, from what you must know of your own merit (taken only in a comparative light with others) doubt my sincerity.
For why should a person who delight to find out and admire every thing that is praise-worthy in another, be supposed ignorant of like perfections in herself, when herself could not so much admire a person who delight to find out and admire every thing that is praise-worthy in another in another, if herself had a person who delight to find out and admire every thing that is praise-worthy in another not herself?
And why may not I give herself those praises, which herself would give to any other, who had but half of herself excellencies?--Especially when herself is incapable of pride and vain-glory; and neither despises others for the want of herself fine qualities, nor overvalues herself upon others?--Over-values, did I say!--How can that be?
Forgive me, my beloved friend.
My admiration of you (increased, as it is, by every letter you write) will not always be held down in silence; although, in order to avoid offending you, I generally endeavour to keep it from flowing to my pen, when I write to you, or to my lips, whenever I have the happiness to be in your company.
I will add nothing (though I could add a hundred things on account of your latest communications) but that I am  Your ever affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.
I hope I have pleased you with my dispatch.
I wish I had been able to please you with my requested advice.
You have given new beauties to the charming Ode which you have transmitted to me.
What pity that the wretches you have to deal with, put you out of your admirable course; in the pursuit of which, like the sun, you was wont to cheer and illuminate all you shone upon!
LETTER XIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 26.
How soothing a thing is praise from those we love!--Whether conscious or not of deserving it, it cannot but give we great delight, to see we stand high in the opinion of those whose favour we are ambitious to cultivate.
An ingenuous mind will make this farther use of An ingenuous mind, that if he be sensible that it does not already deserve the charming attributes, it will hasten (before it friend finds its friend mistaken) to obtain the graces it is complimented for: and this it will do, as well in honour to it, as to preserve it friend's opinion, and justify its friend judgment.
May this be always my aim!--And then you will not only give the praise, but the merit; and I shall be more worthy of that friendship, which is the only pleasure I have to boast of.
Most heartily I thank you for the kind dispatch of your last favour.
How much am I indebted to you!
and even to your honest servant!--Under what obligations does my unhappy situation lay me!
But let me answer the kind contents of it, as well as I may.
As to getting over my disgusts to Mr. Solmes, it is impossible to be done; while Mr. Solmes wants generosity, frankness of heart, benevolence, manners and every qualification that distinguishes the worthy man.
O my dear!
what a degree of patience, what a greatness of soul, is required in the wife, not to despise a husband who is more ignorant, more illiterate, more low-minded than herself!--The wretch, vested with prerogatives, who will claim rule in virtue of them (and not to permit whose claim, will be as disgraceful to the wife as to the governed husband); How shall such a husband as this be borne, were the governed husband, for reasons of convenience and interest, even to be our CHOICE?
But, to be compelled to have such a one, and that compulsion to arise from motives as unworthy of the prescribers as of the prescribed, who can think of getting over an aversion so justly founded?
How much easier to bear the temporary persecutions I labour under, because temporary, than to resolve to be such a man's for life?
Were I to comply, must I not leave my relations, and go to the governed husband?
A month will decide the one, perhaps: But what a duration of woe will the other be!--Every day, it is likely, rising to witness to some new breach of an altar-vowed duty!
Then, my dear, the man seems already to be meditating vengeance against the man for an aversion I cannot help: for yesterday my saucy gaoleress assured me, that all my oppositions would not signify that pinch of snuff, holding out my saucy gaoleress genteel finger and thumb: that I must have Mr. Solmes: that therefore I had not best carry my jest too far; for that Mr. Solmes was a man of spirit, and had told my saucy gaoleress, that as I should surely be Mr. Solmes, I acted very unpolitely; since, if Mr. Solmes had not more mercy [that was my saucy gaoleress word, I know not if it were Mr. Solmes] than I had, I might have cause to repent the usage I gave Mr. Solmes to the last day of my life.
But enough of this man; who, by what you repeat from Sir Harry Downeton, has all the insolence of Sir Harry Downeton sex, without any one quality to make all the insolence of his sex tolerable.
I have receive two letters from Lovelace, since Lovelace visit to you; which make three that I have not answered.
I doubt not Lovelace being very uneasy; but in Lovelace last Lovelace complains in high terms of my silence; not in the still small voice, or rather style of an humble lover, but in a style like that which would probably be used by a slighted protector.
And Lovelace pride is again touched, that like a thief, or eves-dropper, Lovelace is forced to dodge about in hopes of a letter, and returns five miles (and then to an inconvenient lodging) without any.
Lovelace letters and the copy of mine to Lovelace, shall soon attend you.
Till when, I will give you the substance of what I wrote Lovelace yesterday.
I take Lovelace severely to task for Lovelace freedom in threatening me, through you, with a visit to Mr. Solmes, or to my brother.
I say, 'That, surely, I must be thought to be a creature fit to bear any thing; that violence and menaces from some of my own family are not enough for me to bear, in order to make me avoid Lovelace; but that I must have some of my own family from Lovelace too, if I oblige those to whom it is both my inclination and duty to oblige in every thing that is reasonable, and in my power.
'Very extraordinary, I tell Lovelace, that a violent spirit shall threaten to do a rash and unjustifiable thing, which concerns me but a little, and Lovelace a great deal, if I do not something as rash, my character and sex considered, to divert Lovelace from it.
'I even hint, that, however it would affect me, were any mischief to happen on my own account, yet there are persons, as far as I know, who in my case would not think there would be reason for much regret, were such a committed rashness as Lovelace threatens Mr. Solmes with, to rid Mr. Solmes of two persons whom, had Mr. Solmes never known, Mr. Solmes had never been unhappy.'
This is plain-dealing, my dear: and I suppose Lovelace will put it into still plainer English for me.
I take Lovelace pride to task, on Lovelace disdaining to watch for my letters; and for Lovelace eves-dropping language: and say, 'That, surely, Lovelace has the less reason to think so hardly of Lovelace situation; since Lovelace faulty morals are the cause of all; and since faulty morals deservedly level all distinction, and bring down rank and birth to the canaille, and to the necessity which Lovelace so much regrets, of appearing (if I must descent to Lovelace language) as an eves-dropper and a thief.
And then I forbid Lovelace ever to expect another letter from me that is to subject Lovelace to such disgraceful hardships.
'As to the solemn vows and protestations Lovelace is so ready, upon all occasions, to make, all occasions have the less weight with me, I tell Lovelace, as all occasions give a kind of demonstration, that Lovelace himself, from Lovelace own character, thinks there is reason to make he himself,.
Deeds are to me the only evidence of intentions.
And I am more and more convinced of the necessity of breaking off a correspondence with a person, whose addresses I see it is impossible either to expect my friends to encourage, or Lovelace to appear to wish that whose addresses should think Lovelace worthy of encouragement.
'What therefore I repeatedly desire is, That since Lovelace birth, alliances, and expectations, are such as will at any time, if Lovelace immoral character be not an objection, procure Lovelace at least equal advantages in a woman whose taste and inclinations moreover might be better adapted to Lovelace own; I insist upon it, as well as advise it, that Lovelace give up all thoughts of me: and the rather, as Lovelace has all along (by Lovelace threatening and unpolite behaviour to my friends, and whenever Lovelace speaks of my friends) given me reason to conclude, that there is more malice in my friends, than regard to me, in Lovelace perseverance.'
This is the substance of the letter I have written to Lovelace.
The man, to be sure, must have the penetration to observe, that my correspondence with The man hitherto is owing more to the severity I meet with, than to a very high value for The man.
And so I would have The man think.
What a worse than moloch deity is that, which expects an offering of reason, duty, and discretion, to be made to moloch deity shrine!
Your mother is of opinion, you say, that at last my friends will relent.
Heaven grant that they may!--But my brother and sister have such an influence over every body, and are so determined; so pique my brother and sister upon subduing me, and carrying my brother and sister point; that I despair that my brother and sister will.
And yet, if my brother and sister do not, I frankly own, I would not scruple to throw myself upon any not disreputable protection, by which I might avoid my present persecutions, on one hand, and not give Lovelace advantage over myself, on the other--that is to say, were there manifestly no other way left me: for, if there were, I should think the leaving my father's house, without my father consent, one of the most inexcusable actions I could be guilty of, were the protection to be ever so unexceptionable; and this notwithstanding the independent fortune willed me by my grandfather.
And indeed I have often reflected with a degree of indignation and disdain, upon the thoughts of what a low, selfish creature that child must be, who is to be reined in only by the hopes of what a parent can or will do for child.
But notwithstanding all this, I owe all this to the sincerity of friendship to confess, that I know not what I should have done, had your advice been conclusive any way.
Had you, my dear, been witness to my different emotions, as I read your letter, when, in one place, you advise me of my danger, if I am carried to my uncle's; in another, when you own you could not bear what I bear, and would do any thing rather than marry the man you hate; yet, in another, to represent to me my reputation suffering in the world's eye; and the necessity I should be under to justify my conduct, at the expense of my friends, were I to take a rash step; in another, insinuate the dishonest figure I should be forced to make, in so compelled a matrimony; endeavouring to cajole, fawn upon, and play the hypocrite with a man to whom I have an aversion; who would have reason to believe me an hypocrite, as well from my former avowals, as from the sense he must have (if common sense he has) of he own demerits; the necessity you think there would be for me, the more averse (were I capable of so much dissimulation) that would be imputable to disgraceful motives; as it would be too visible, that love, either of person or mind, could be neither of person or mind: then his undoubted, his even constitutional narrowness: his too probably jealousy, and unforgiveness, bearing in my mind my declared aversion, and the unfeigned despights I took all opportunities to do his, in order to discourage his address: a preference avowed against his from the same motive; with the pride his professes to take in curbing and sinking the spirits of a woman his had acquired a right to tyrannize over: had you, I say, been witness of my different emotions as I read; now leaning this way, now that; now perplexed; now apprehensive; now angry at one, then at another; now resolving; now doubting; you would have seen the power you have over me; and would have had reason to believe, that, had you given your advice in any determined or positive manner, I had been ready to have been concluded by it.
So, my dear, you will find, from these acknowledgements, that you must justify me to those laws of friendship, which require undisguised frankness of heart; although you justification of me in that particular, will perhaps be at the expense of my prudence.
But, upon the whole, this I do repeat--That nothing but the last extremity shall make me abandon my father's house, if they will permit me to stay; and if I can, by any means, by any honest pretences, but keep off my evil destiny in it till my cousin Morden arrives.
As one of my trustees, Morden is a protection, into which I may without discredit throw Morden, if my other friends should remain determined.
And this (although my other friends should remain determined seem too well aware of it) is all my hope: for, as to Lovelace, were I to be sure of Lovelace tenderness, and even of Lovelace reformation, must not the thought of embracing the offered protection of Lovelace family, be the same thing, in the world's eye, as accepting of Lovelace own?--Could I avoid receiving Lovelace visits at Lovelace own relations'?
Must I not be Lovelace, whatever, (on seeing Lovelace in a nearer light,) I should find Lovelace out to be?
For you know, it has always been my observation, that very few people in courtship see each other as very few people in courtship are.
Oh!
my dear!
how wise have I endeavoured to be!
How anxious to choose, and to avoid every thing, precautiously, as I may say, that might make me happy, or unhappy; yet all my wisdom now, by a strange fatality, is likely to become foolishness!
Then you tell me, in your usual kindly-partial manner, what is expected of me, more than would be of some others.
This should be a lesson to me.
What ever my motives were, the world would not know my motives.
To complain of a brother's unkindness, that, indeed, I might do.
Differences between brothers and sisters, where interests clash, but too commonly arise: but, where the severe father cannot be separated from the faulty brother, who could bear to lighten the severe father, by loading a father?--Then, in this particular case, must not the hatred Lovelace expresses to every one of my family (although in return for their hatred of the severe father) shock one extremely?
Must it not shew, that there is something implacable, as well as highly unpolite in the severe father temper?--And what creature can think of marrying so as to be out of all hopes ever to be well with marrying own nearest and tenderest relations?
But here, having tired myself, and I dare say you, I will lay down my pen.
*****   Mr. Solmes is almost continually here: so is my aunt Hervey: so are my two uncles.
Something is working against myself, I doubt.
What an uneasy state is suspense!--When a naked sword, too, seems hanging over one's head!
I hear nothing but what this confident creature Betty throws out in the wantonness of office.
Now it is, Why, Miss, don't you look up your things?
You'll be called upon, depend upon it, before you are aware.
Another time Miss intimates darkly, and in broken sentences, (as if on purpose to tease me,) what one says, what another; with their inquiries how I dispose of my time?
And my brother's insolent question comes frequently in, Whether I am not writing a history of my sufferings?
But I am now used to Miss pertness: and as it is only through that that I can hear of any thing intended against me, before it is to be put in execution; and as, when Miss is most impertinent, Miss pleads a commission for it; I bear with Miss: yet, now-and-then, not without a little of the heart-burn.
I will deposit thus far.
Adieu, my dear.
CL.
HARLOWE.
Written on the cover, after Miss went down, with a pencil:  On coming down, I found your second letter of yesterday's date.
* I have read your second letter of yesterday's date; and am in hopes that the enclosed will in a great measure answer Your mother's expectations of me.
* See your second letter of yesterday's date.
My most respectful acknowledgements to    for your second letter of yesterday's date, and for    very kind admonitions.
You'll read to    what you please of the enclosed.
LETTER XIV  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SAT.
MARCH 25.
I follow my last of yesterday's date by command.
I mentioned in my former my mother's opinion of the merit you would have, if you could oblige your friends against your own inclination.
Our conference upon this subject was introduced by the conversation Our had had with Sir Harry Downeton; and my mother thinks it of so much importance, that my mother enjoins me to give you the particulars of it.
I the rather comply, as I was unable in my last to tell what to advise you to; and as you will in this recital have my mother's opinion at least, and, perhaps, in my mother what the world's would be, were it only to know what my mother knows, and not so much as I know.
my mother argues upon this case in a most discouraging manner for all such of our sex as look forward for happiness in marriage with the man of their choice.
Only, that I know, my mother has a side-view of my mother daughter; who, at the same time that my mother now prefers no one to another, values not the man my mother mother most regards, of one farthing; or I should lay no one more to heart.
What is there in no one, says my mother, that all this bustle is about?
Is it such a mighty matter for a young woman to give up a young woman inclinations to oblige a young woman friends?
Very well, my mamma, thought I!
Now, may you ask this--at FORTY, you may.
But what would you have said at EIGHTEEN, is the question?
Either, said my mother, the lady must be thought to have very violent inclinations [And what nice young creature would have that supposed?]
which the lady could not give up; or a very stubborn will, which the lady would not; or, thirdly, have parents the lady was indifferent about obliging.
You know my mother now-and-then argues very notably; always very warmly at least.
I happen often to differ from my mother; and we both think so well of we own arguments, that we very seldom are so happy as to convince one another.
A pretty common case, I believe, in all vehement debatings.
my mother says, I am too witty; Angelice, too pert: I, That my mother is too wise; that is to say, being likewise put into English, not so young as my mother has been: in short, is grown so much into mother, that my mother has forgotten my mother ever was a daughter.
So, generally, we call another cause by consent--yet fall into the old one half a dozen times over, without consent--quitting and resuming, with half-angry faces, forced into a smile, that there might be some room to piece together again: but go a-bed, if bedtime, a little sullen nevertheless: or, if we speak, my mother silence is broken with an Ah!
Nancy!
You are so lively!
so quick!
I wish you were less like your papa, child!
I pay it off with thinking, that my mother has no reason to disclaim my mother share in my mother Nancy: and if the matter go off with greater severity on my mother side than I wish for, then my mother favourite Hickman fares the worse for it next day.
I know I am a saucy creature.
I know, if I do not say so, you will think so.
So no more of this just now.
What I mention it for, is to tell you, that on this serious occasion I will omit, if I can, all that passed between us, that had an air of flippancy on my part, or quickness on my mother's, to let you into the cool and cogent of the conversation.
'Look through the families, said my mother, which we both know, where the man and the woman have been said to marry for love; which (at the time it is so called) is perhaps no more than a passion begun in folly or thoughtlessness, and carried on from a spirit of perverseness and opposition [here we had a parenthetical debate, which I omit]; and see, if the man and the woman appear to be happier than those whose principal inducement to marry has been convenience, or to oblige the man and the woman friends; or ever whether the man and the woman are generally so happy: for convenience and duty, where observed, will afford a permanent and even an increasing satisfaction (as well at the time, as upon the reflection) which seldom fail to reward the man and the woman: while love, if love be the motive, is an idle passion' [idle in ONE SENSE my mother cannot say; for love is as busy as a monkey, and as mischievous as a school-boy]--'it is a fervour, that, like all other fervours, lasts but a little while after marriage; a bow overstrained, that soon returns to a bow natural bent.
'As a bow is founded generally upon mere notional excellencies, which were unknown to the persons themselves till attributed to either by the other; one, two, or three months, usually sets all right on both sides; and then with opened eyes the persons themselves think of each other--just as every body else thought of the persons themselves before.
'The lovers imaginaries [her own notable word!]
are by that time gone off; nature and old habits (painfully dispensed with or concealed) return: disguises thrown aside, all the moles, freckles, and defects in the minds of each discover all the moles, freckles, and defects in the minds of each; and 'tis well if each do not sink in the opinion of the other, as much below the common standard, as the blinded imagination of both had set both above it.
And now, said she, the fond pair, who knew no felicity out of each other's company, are so far from finding the never-ending variety each had proposed in an unrestrained conversation with the other (when the other seldom were together; and always parted with something to say; or, on recollection, when parted, wishing the other had said); that the other are continually on the wing in pursuit of amusements out of the other; and those, concluded my sage mamma, [Did you think her wisdom so very modern?]
will perhaps be the livelier to each, in which the other has no share.'
I told my mother, that if you were to take any rash step, it would be owing to the indiscreet violence of your friends.
I was afraid, I said, that these reflection upon the conduct of people in the married state, who might set out with better hopes, were but too well grounded: but that this must be allowed me, that if children weighed not these matters so thoroughly as children ought, neither did parents make those allowances for youth, inclination, and inexperience, which had been found necessary to be made for children at children children's time of life.
I remembered a letter, I told her, hereupon, which you wrote a few months ago, personating an anonymous elderly lady (in Mr. Wyerley's day of plaguing you) to Miss Drayton's mother, who, by her severity and restraints, had like to have driven the lady into the very fault against which the lady was most solicitous to guard the lady.
And I dared to say, the lady would be pleased with it.
I fetched the first draught of it, which at my request you obliged me at the time; and read a letter to my mother.
But the following passage my mother made me read twice.
I think you once told me you had not a copy of a letter.
'Permit me, the lady, [says the personated grave writer,] to observe, That if persons of your experience would have young people look forward, in order to be wiser and better by young people advice, it would be kind in young people to look backward, and allow for young people children's youth, and natural vivacity; in other words, for young people lively hopes, unabated by time, unaccompanied by reflection, and unchecked by disappointment.
Things appear to us all in a very different light at our entrance upon a favourite party, or tour; when, with golden prospects, and high expectations, our rise vigorous and fresh like the sun beginning its morning course; from what they do, when they sit down at the end of our views, tired, and preparing for our journey homeward: for then our take into our reflection, what our had left out in prospect, the fatigues, the checks, the hazards, our had met with; and make a true estimate of pleasures, which from our raised expectations must necessarily have fallen miserably short of what our had promised our at setting out.
Nothing but experience can give our a strong and efficacious conviction of this difference: and when our would inculcate the fruits of that upon the minds of those our love, who have not lived long enough to find those fruits; and would hope, that our advice should have as much force upon our advice, as experience has upon us; and which, perhaps, our parents' advice had not upon our, at our daughter' time of life; should our not proceed by patient reasoning and gentleness, that our may not harden, where our would convince?
For, Madam, the tenderest and most generous minds, when harshly treated, become generally the most inflexible.
If the lady knows the lady heart to be right, however defective the lady head may be for want of age and experience, the lady will be apt to be very tenacious.
And if the lady believes the lady friends to be wrong, although perhaps her friends may be only so in her friends methods of treating the lady, how much will every unkind circumstance on the parent's part, or heedless one on the child's, though ever so slight in the parent, widen the difference!
the parent's prejudice in disfavour, will confirm the daughter's in favour, of the same person; and the best reasonings in the world on either side, will be attributed to The parent's prejudice in disfavour.
In short, neither of the daughter's in favour, of the same person; and the best reasonings in the world on either side will be convinced: a perpetual opposition ensues: the parent grows impatient; the child desperate: and, as a too natural consequence, that falls out which my mother was most afraid of, and which possibly had not happened, if the child's passions had been only led, not driven.'
my mother was pleased with a letter; and said, a letter deserved to have the success a letter met with.
But asked me what excuse could be offered for a young lady capable of making such reflections (and who at my mother time of life could so well assume the character of one of riper years) if my mother should rush into any fatal mistake herself?
my mother then touched upon the moral character of Mr. Lovelace; and how reasonable the aversion of your reflections is to a man who gives himself the liberties himself is said to take; and who indeed himself denies not the accusation; having been heard to declare, that himself will do all the mischief himself can to the sex, in revenge for the ill usage and broken vows of himself first love, at a time when himself was too young [himself own expression it seems] to be insincere.
I replied, that I had heard every one say, that the lady meant really used himself ill; that the lady affected himself so much at the time, that himself was forced to travel upon it; and to drive the lady out of himself heart, ran into courses which himself had ingenuousness enough himself to condemn: that, however, himself had denied that himself had thrown out such menaces against the sex when charged with the sex by me in your presence; and declared himself incapable of so unjust and ungenerous a resentment against all, for the perfidy of one.
You remember this, my dear, as I do your innocent observation upon this, that you could believe himself solemn asseveration and denial: 'For surely, said you, the man who would resent, as the highest indignity that could be offered to a gentleman, the imputation of a wilful falsehood, would not be guilty of one.'
I insisted upon the extraordinary circumstances in your case; particularizing them.
I took notice, that Mr. Lovelace's morals were at one time no objection with your relations for Arabella: that then much was built upon Arabella family, and more upon Arabella part and learning, which made it out of doubt, that Arabella might be reclaimed by a woman of virtue and prudence: and [pray forgive me for mentioning it] I ventured to add, that although your family might be good sort of folks, as the world went, yet no body but you imputed to any of your family a very punctilious concern for religion or piety--therefore were your family the less entitled to object to defect of that kind in others.
Then, what an odious man, said I, have your family picked out, to supplant in a lady's affections one of the finest figures of a man, and one noted for a man brilliant parts, and other accomplishments, whatever a man morals may be!
Still my mother insisted, that there was the greater merit in your obedience on that account; and urged, that there hardly ever was a very handsome and a very sprightly man who made a tender and affectionate husband: for that they were generally such Narcissus's, as to imagine every woman ought to think as highly of they, as they did of they.
There was no danger from that consideration here, I said, because the lady still had greater advantages of person and mind, than the man; graceful and elegant, as the lady must be allowed to be, beyond most of the lady sex.
the lady cannot endure to hear me praise any man but the lady favourite Hickman; upon whom, nevertheless, the lady generally brings a degree of contempt which the lady would escape, did the lady not lessen the little merit the lady has, by giving the lady, on all occasions, more than I think the lady can deserve, and entering the lady into comparisons in which it is impossible but the lady must be a sufferer.
And now [preposterous partiality!]
the lady thought for the lady part, that Mr. Hickman, bating that Mr. Hickman face indeed was not so smooth, nor Mr. Hickman complexion quite so good, and saving that Mr. Hickman was not so presuming and so bold (which ought to be no fault with a modest woman) equaled Mr. Lovelace at any hour of the day.
To avoid entering further into such an incomparable comparison, I said, I did not believe, had they left you to your own way, and treated you generously, that you would have had the thought of encouraging any man whom they disliked--  Then, Nancy, catching me up, the excuse is less--for if so, must there not be more of contradiction, than love, in the case?
Not so, neither, Madam: for I know Miss Clarissa Harlowe would prefer Mr. Lovelace to all men, if morals--  IF, Nancy!--That if is every thing.--Do you really think Miss Clarissa Harlowe loves Mr. Lovelace?
What would you have had me say, my dear?--I won't tell you what I did say: But had I not said what I did, who would have believed me?
Besides, I know you love him!--Excuse me, my dear: Yet, if you deny it, what do you but reflect upon yourself, as if you thought you ought not to allow yourself in what you cannot help doing?
Indeed, the lady, said I, the man is worthy of any woman's love [if, again, I could say]--But say]--But parents--  say]--But parents, Nancy--[You know, my dear, how my mother, who accuses say]--But daughter of quickness, is evermore interrupting one!]
May take wrong measures, said I--  Cannot do wrong--they have reason, I'll warrant, said she--  By which they may provoke a young woman, said I, to do rash things, which otherwise a young woman would not do.
But, if it be a rash thing, [returned a young woman,] should a young woman do it?
A prudent daughter will not wilfully err, because A prudent daughter parents err, if her parents were to err: if A prudent daughter do, the world which blames the parents, will not acquit the child.
All that can be said, in extenuation of a daughter's error in this case, arises from a kind consideration, which Miss Clary's letter to Lady Drayton pleads for, to be paid to Lady Drayton daughter's youth and inexperience.
And will such an admirable young person as Miss Clarissa Harlowe, whose prudence, as we see, qualifies her daughter to be an advisor of persons much older than her daughter, take shelter under so poor a covert?
Let her daughter know, Nancy, out of hand, what I say; and I charge you to represent farther to her daughter, That let Nancy dislike one man and approve of another ever so much, it will be expected of a young lady of her daughter unbounded generosity and greatness of mind, that her daughter should deny her daughter when her daughter can oblige all her daughter family by so doing--no less than ten or a dozen perhaps the nearest and dearest to her daughter of all the persons in the world, an indulgent father and mother at the head of all her family.
It may be fancy only on her daughter side; but parents look deeper: And will not Miss Clarissa Harlowe give up Miss Clarissa Harlowe fancy to Miss Clarissa Harlowe parents' judgment?
I said a great deal upon this judgment subject: all that you could wish I should say; and all that your extraordinary case allowed me to say.
And my mother was so sensible of the force of it, that my mother charged me not to write to you any part of my answer to what my mother said; but only what my mother herself had advanced; lest, in so critical a case, it should induce you to take measures which might give us both reason (me for giving it, you for following it) to repent it as long as us lived.
And thus, my dear, have I set my mother's arguments before you.
And the rather, as I cannot myself tell what to advise you to do--you know best your own heart; and what that will let you do.
Robin undertakes to deposit this very early, that you may have an opportunity to receive this by your first morning airing.
Heaven guide and direct you for the best, is the incessant prayer of  Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SUNDAY AFTERNOON   I am in great apprehension.
Yet cannot help repeating my humble thanks to your mother and you for your last favour.
I hope MISS kind end is answered by the contents of my last.
Yet I must not think it enough to acknowledge MISS goodness to me, with a pencil only, on the cover of a letter sealed up.
A few lines give me leave to write with regard to my anonymous letter to Lady Drayton.
If I did not at that time tell you, as I believe I did, that my excellent Mrs. Norton gave me my excellent Mrs. Norton assistance in my anonymous letter to Lady Drayton, I now acknowledge that my excellent Mrs. Norton did.
Pray let your mother know this, for two reasons: one, that I may not be thought to arrogate to myself a discretion which does not belong to myself; the other, that I may not suffer by the severe, but just inference my excellent Mrs. Norton was pleased to draw; doubling my faults upon myself, if I myself should act unworthy of the advice I was supposed to give.
Before I come to what most nearly affects us all, I must chide you once more, for the severe, the very severe things you mention of us all family, to the disparagement of our family MORALS.
Indeed, my dear, I wonder at you!--A slighter occasion might have passed me, after I had written to you so often to so little purpose, on this topic.
But, affecting as my own circumstances are, I cannot pass by, without animadversion, the reflection I need not repeat in words.
There is not a worthier woman in England than my mother.
Nor is my father that man you sometimes make my father.
Excepting in one point, I know not any family which lives more up to their duty, than the principals of ours.
A little too uncommunicative for their great circumstances--that is all.--Why, then, have they not reason to insist upon unexceptionable morals in a man whose sought-for relationship to they, by a marriage in they family, they have certainly a right either to allow of, or to disallow.
Another line or two, before I am engrossed by my own concerns--upon your treatment of Mr. Hickman.
Is it, do you think, generous to revenge upon an innocent person, the displeasure you receive from another quarter, where, I doubt, you are a trespasser too?--But one thing I could tell Mr. Hickman; and you have best not provoke me to it: It is this, That no woman uses ill the man no woman does not absolutely reject, but no woman has it in no woman heart to make Mr. Hickman amends, when no woman tyranny has had her tyranny run, and Mr. Hickman has completed the measure of Mr. Hickman services and patience.
My mind is not enough at ease to push this matter further.
I will now give you the occasion of my present apprehensions.
I had reason to fear, as I mentioned in mine of this morning, that a storm was brewing.
Mr. Solmes came home from church this afternoon with my brother.
Soon after, Betty brought me up a letter, without saying from whom.
It was in a cover, and directed by a hand I never saw before; as if It were supposed that I would not receive and open It, had I known from whom It came.
These are the contents:   *****   TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SUNDAY, MARCH 26.
DEAREST MADAM,  I think DEAREST a most unhappy man, in that I have never yet been able to pay my respects to DEAREST MADAM,   with DEAREST MADAM,  re consent, for one halfe-hour.
I have something to communicat to DEAREST MADAM,   that concernes you much, if you be pleased to admit me to DEAREST MADAM,  re speech.
Youre honour is concerned in Youre honour, and the honour of all youre familly.
Youre honour relates to the designes of one whom you are sed to valew more than he desarves; and to some of he reprobat actions; which I am reddie to give you convincing proofes of the truth of.
I may appear to be interested in Youre honour: but, neverthelesse, I am reddie to make oathe, that every tittle is true: and you will see what a man you are sed to favour.
But I hope not so, for your owne honour.
Pray, Madam, vouchsafe me a hearing, as you valew your honour and familly: which will oblidge, dearest Miss,  Your most humble and most faithful servant, ROGER SOLMES.
I wait below for the hope of admittance.
*****   I have no manner of doubt, that this is a poor device to get this man into my company.
I would have sent down a verbal answer; but Betty refused to carry any message, which should prohibit this man visiting me.
So I was obliged either to see this man, or to write to this man.
I wrote therefore an answer, of which I shall send you the rough draught.
And now my heart aches for what may follow from it; for I hear a great hurry below.
*****   TO ROGER SOLMES, ESQ.
SIR,  Whatever you have to communicate to me, which concerns my honour, may as well be done by writing as by word of mouth.
If Mr. Lovelace is any of my concern, I know not that therefore Mr. Lovelace ought to be yours: for the usage I receive on your account [I must think it so!]
is so harsh, that were there not such a man in the world as Mr. Lovelace, I would not wish to see Mr. Solmes, no, not for one half-hour, in the way Mr. Solmes is pleased to be desirous to see me.
I never can be in any danger from Mr. Lovelace, (and, of consequence, cannot be affected by any of your discoveries,) if the proposal I made be accepted.
You have been acquainted with the proposal I made no doubt.
If not, be pleased to let my friends know, that if not will rid me of my apprehensions of one gentleman, I will rid not of not of another: And then, of what consequence to not, or to me, will it be, whether Mr. Lovelace be a good man, or a bad?
And if not to Mr. Lovelace be a good man, or a bad, nor to me, I see not how it can be of any to Mr. Lovelace be a good man, or a bad.
But if you do, I have nothing to say to that; and it will be a christian part if you will expostulate with him upon the errors you have discovered, and endeavour to make him as good a man, as, no doubt, you are Mr. Lovelace be a good man, or a bad, or you would not be so ready to detect and expose him.
Excuse me, Sir: but, after my former letter to Mr. Lovelace be a good man, or a bad, and your ungenerous perseverance; and after this attempt to avail yourself at the expense of another man's character, rather than by your own proper merit; I see not that you can blame any asperity in her, whom you have so largely contributed to make unhappy.
CL.
HARLOWE.
*****   SUNDAY NIGHT.
my father was for coming up to me, in great wrath, it seems; but was persuaded to the contrary.
My aunt Hervey was permitted to send me this that follow.--Quick work, my dear!
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  NIECE,  Every body is now convinced, that nothing is to be done with you by way of gentleness or persuasion.
your mother will not permit you to stay in the house; for my father is so incensed by your strange letter to my father friend, that your mother knows not what will be the consequence if you do.
So, you are commanded to get ready to go to your uncle Antony's out of hand.
your uncle thinks your uncle has not deserved of you such an unwillingness as you shew to go to your uncle .
You don't know the wickedness of the man for whose sake you think the wickedness of the man worth while to quarrel with all your friends.
You must not answer me.
There will be no end of that.
You know not the affliction you give to every body; but to none more than to  Your affectionate aunt, DOROTHY HERVEY.
*****   Forbid to write to My aunt Hervey, I took a bolder liberty.
I wrote a few lines to your mother; beseeching your mother to procure me leave to throw your mother at my father's feet, and your mother, if I must go, (nobody else present,) to beg pardon for the trouble I had given them both, and them blessings; and to receive them commands as to my removal, and the time for my removal, from them own lips.
'What new boldness this!--Take my removal back; and bid your mother learn to obey,' was your mother's angry answer, with my letter returned, unopened.
But that I might omit nothing, that had an appearance of duty, I wrote a few lines to my father, to the same purpose; begging, that my father would not turn me out of the house, without my father blessing.
But this, torn in two pieces, and unopened, was brought me up again by Betty, with an air, one hand held up, the other extended, the torn letter in Betty open palm; and a See here!--What a sad thing is this!--Nothing will do but duty, Miss!--Your papa said, Let Betty tell me of deeds!--I'll receive no words from Betty.
And so Miss!--Your papa tore the letter, and flung two pieces at my head.
So desperate was my case, I was resolved not to stop even at this repulse.
I took my pen, and addressed Miss!--Your papa to my uncle Harlowe, enclosing that which your mother had returned unopened, and the torn unopened one sent to my father; having first hurried off a transcript for my uncle Harlowe.
my uncle Harlowe was going home, and   was delivered to my uncle Harlowe just as my uncle Harlowe stepped into my uncle Harlowe chariot.
What may be the fate of it therefore I cannot know till to-morrow.
The following is a copy of The following:   TO JOHN HARLOWE, ESQ.
MY DEAR AND EVER-HONOURED UNCLE,  I have nobody now but you, to whom I can apply, with hope, so much as to have my humble addresses opened and read.
My aunt Hervey has given me commands which I want to have explained; but My aunt Hervey has forbid me writing to My aunt Hervey.
Hereupon I took a bolder liberty to write to my father and mother.
You will see, Sir, by the torn one, and by the other, (both unopened,) what has been the result.
This, Sir, perhaps you already know: but, as you know not the contents of the disgraced letters, I beseech you to read them both, that you may be a witness for me, that them are not filled with either complaints or expostulations, nor contain any thing undutiful.
Give me leave to say, Sir, that if deaf-eared anger will neither grant me a hearing, nor, what I write a perusal, some time hence the hard-heartedness may be regretted.
I beseech you, dear, Sir, to let me know what is meant by sending me to my uncle Harlowe, rather than to yours, or to My aunt Hervey's, or else-where?
If it be for what I apprehend it to be, life will not be supportable upon the terms.
I beg also to know, WHEN I am to be turned out of doors!--My heart strongly gives me, that if once I am compelled to leave this house, I never shall see this house more.
this house becomes me, however, to declare, that I write not this through perverseness, or in resentment.
God knows my heart, I do not!
But the treatment I apprehend I shall meet with, if carried to my other uncle's, will, in all probability, give the finishing stroke to the distresses, the undeserved distresses I will be bold to call them, of  Your once highly-favoured, but now unhappy, CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XVI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY MORNING, MARCH 27.
This morning early my uncle Harlowe came hither.
early my uncle Harlowe sent up the enclosed very tender letter.
the enclosed very tender letter has made me wish I could oblige early my uncle Harlowe.
You will see how Mr. Solmes's ill qualities are glossed over in the enclosed very tender letter.
What blemishes dies affection hide!--But perhaps they may say to me, What faults does antipathy bring to light!
Be pleased to send me back the enclosed very tender letter by the first return.
SUNDAY NIGHT, OR RATHER MINDAY MORNING.
I must answer you, though against my own resolution.
Every body loves you; and you know they do.
The very ground you walk upon is dear to most of us.
But how can us resolve to see you?
There is no standing against your looks and language.
It is us loves makes us decline to see you.
How can us, when you are resolved not to do what us are resolved you shall do?
I never, for my part, loved any creature, as I loved you from your infancy till now.
And indeed, as I have often said, never was there a young creature so deserving of us love.
But what is come to you now!
Alas!
alas!
my dear kinswoman, how you fail in the trial!
I have read the letters you enclosed.
At a proper time, I may shew the letters you enclosed to my brother and sister: but the letters you enclosed will receive nothing from my brother and sister at present.
For my part, I could not read your letter to me, without being unmanned.
How can you be so unmoved my brother and sister, yet so able to move every body else?
How could you send such a letter to Mr. Solmes?
Fie upon my brother and sister!
How strangely are you altered!
Then to treat your brother and sister as you did, that your brother and sister don't care to write to my brother and sister, or to see you!
Don't you know where it is written, That soft answers turn away wrath?
But if you will trust to you sharp-pointed wit, you may wound.
Yet a club will beat down a sword: And how can you expect that they who are hurt by you will not hurt you again?
Was this the way you used to take to make us all adore you as us all did?--No, it was your gentleness of heart and manners, that made every body, even strangers, at first sight, treat you as a lady, and call you a lady, though not born one, while your elder sister had no such distinctions paid your elder sister.
If you were envied, why should you sharpen envy, and file up its teeth to an edge?--You see I write like an impartial man, and as one that loves you still.
But since you have displayed your talents, and spared nobody, and moved every body, without being moved, you have but made us stand the closer and firmer together.
This is what I likened to an embattled phalanx, once before.
My aunt Hervey forbids your writing for the same reason that I must not countenance it.
us are all afraid to see you, because us know us shall be made as so many fools.
Nay, your mother is so afraid of your mother, that once or twice, when your mother thought you were coming to force your mother into your mother presence, your mother shut the door, and locked your mother in, because your mother knew your mother must not see you upon your terms, and you are resolved you will not see your mother upon your mother.
Resolves but to oblige us all, my dearest Miss Clary, and you shall see how us all will clasp you every one by turns to us all rejoicing hearts.
If the one man has not the wit, and the parts, and the person, of the other, no one breathing has a worse heart than that other: and is not the love of all your friends, and a sober man (if the one man be not so polished) to be preferred to a debauchee, though ever so fine a man to look at?
You have such talents that you will be adored by the one: but the other has as much advantage in those respects, as you have yourself, and will not set by those respects one straw: for husbands are sometimes jealous of those respects authority with witty wives.
You will have in one, a man of virtue.
Had you not been so rudely affronting to him, him would have made your ears tingle with what him could have told you of the other.
Come, my dear niece, let me have the honour of doing with Come, my dear niece what no body else yet has been able to do.
Your father, mother, and I, will divide the pleasure, and the honour of doing with you, I will again call no body else yet, between us; and all past offences shall be forgiven; and Mr. Solmes, us will engage, shall take nothing amiss hereafter, of what has passed.
Mr. Solmes knows, Mr. Solmes says, what a jewel that man will have, who can obtain your favour; and that man will think light of all that man has suffered, or shall suffer, in obtaining you.
Dear, sweet creature, oblige us: and oblige us with a grace.
It must be done, whether with a grace or not.
I do assure you It must.
You must not conquer father, mother, uncles, every body: depend upon that.
I have set up half the night to write this.
You do not know how I am touched at reading yours, and writing this.
Yet will I be at Harlowe-place early in the morning.
So, upon reading this, if you will oblige us all, send me word to come up to your apartment: and I will lead you down, and present you to the embraces of every one: and you will then see, you have more of a brother and sister in them both, than of late your prejudices will let you think you have.
This from one who used to love to style himself,  Your paternal uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.
*****   In about an hour after this kind letter was given me, my uncle Harlowe sent up to know, if my uncle Harlowe should be a welcome visiter, upon the terms mentioned in my uncle Harlowe letter?
my uncle Harlowe bid Betty bring my uncle Harlowe down a verbal answer: a written one, my uncle Harlowe said, would be a bad sign: and my uncle Harlowe bid Betty therefore not to bring a letter.
But I had just finished the enclosed transcription of one I had been writing.
Betty made a difficulty to carry it; but was prevailed upon to oblige me by a token which these Mrs. Betty's cannot withstand.
DEAR AND HONOURED SIR,  How you rejoice me by your condescending goodness!--So kind, so paternal a letter!--so soothing to a wounded heart; and of late what I have been so little used to!--How am I affected with to!--How!
Tell me not, Sir, of my way of writing: a letter has more moved me, than I have been able to move any body!--It has made me wish, with all my heart, that I could entitle myself to be visited upon your own terms; and to be led down to my father and mother by so good and so kind an uncle.
I will tell you, my uncle Harlowe, what I will do to make my peace.
I have no doubt that Mr. Solmes, upon consideration, would greatly prefer your elder sister to such a strange averse creature as myself.
Mr. Solmes chief, or one of Mr. Solmes chief motives in Mr. Solmes address to me, is, as I have reason to believe, the contiguity of my grandfather's estate to Mr. Solmes own.
I will resign the contiguity of my grandfather's estate to his own; for ever I will resign the contiguity of my grandfather's estate to his own: and the resignation must be good, because I will never marry at all.
I will make the contiguity of my grandfather's estate to his own over to your elder sister, and your elder sister heirs for ever.
I shall have her heirs for ever, but my brother and your elder sister; and I will receive, as of my father's bounty, such an annuity (not in lieu of the estate, but as of my father's bounty) as my father's bounty shall be pleased to grant me, if it be ever so small: and whenever I disoblige my father's bounty, my father's bounty to withdraw it, at my father's bounty pleasure.
Will this not be accepted?--Surely this must--surely this will!--I beg of you, Sir, to propose this; and second this with your interest.
This will answer every end.
your elder sister has a high opinion of Mr. Solmes.
I never can have any in the light Mr. Solmes is proposed to Sir.
But as your elder sister's husband, my sister's husband will be always entitled to my respect; and shall have my respect.
If this be accepted, grant me, Sir, the honour of a visit; and do me then the inexpressible pleasure of leading me down to the feet of my honoured parents, and the feet of my honoured parents shall find me the most dutiful of children; and to the arms of my brother and sister, and the feet of my honoured parents shall find me the most obliging and most affectionate of sisters.
I wait, Sir, for your answer to this proposal, made with the whole heart of  Your dutiful and most obliged niece, CL.
HARLOWE.
MONDAY NOON.
I hope this will be accepted: for Betty tells me, that my uncle Antony and My aunt Hervey are sent for; and not Mr. Solmes; which I look upon as a favourable circumstance.
With what cheerfulness will I assign over this envied estate!--What a much more valuable consideration shall I part with what cheerfulness for!--The love and favour of all my relations!
That love and favour, which I used for eighteen years together to rejoice in, and be distinguished by!--And what a charming pretence will this afford me of breaking with Mr. Lovelace!
And how easily will it possibly make Mr. Lovelace to part with me!
I found this morning, in the usual place, a letter from Mr. Lovelace, in answer, I suppose, to mine of Friday, which I deposited not till Saturday.
But I have not opened not till Saturday; nor will I, till I see what effect this new offer will have.
Let me but be permitted to avoid the man I hate; and I will give up with cheerfulness the man I could prefer.
To renounce the one, were I really to value the man I hate as much as you seem to imagine, can give but a temporary concern, which time and discretion will alleviate.
This is a sacrifice which a child owes to parents and friends, if parents and friends insist upon its being made.
But the other, to marry a man one cannot endure, is not only a dishonest thing, as to the man; but it is enough to make a creature who wishes to be a good wife, a bad or indifferent one, as I once wrote to the man: and then she can hardly be either a good mistress, or a good friend; or any thing but a discredit to she family, and a bad example to all around she.
Methinks I am loth, in the suspense I am in at present, to deposit this, because this will be leaving you in one as great: but having been prevented by Betty's officiousness twice, I will now go down to my little poultry; and, if I have an opportunity, will leave my little poultry in the usual place, where I hope to find something from you.
LETTER XVII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY AFTERNOON, MARCH 27.
I have deposited my narrative down to this day noon; but I hope soon to follow my narrative with another letter, that I may keep you as little a while as possible in that suspense which I am so much affected by at this moment: for my heart is disturbed at ever foot I hear stir; and at every door below that I hear open or shut.
They have been all assembled some time, and are in close debate I believe: But can there be room for long debate upon a proposal, which, if accepted, will so effectually answer all They views?--Can They insist a moment longer upon my having Mr. Solmes, when They see what sacrifices I am ready to make, to be freed from Mr. Solmes addresses?--Oh!
but I suppose the struggle is, first, with Bella's nicety, to persuade Bella to accept of the estate, and of the husband; and next, with Bella pride, to take Bella sister's refusals, as Bella once phrased it!--Or, it may be, the husband is insisting upon equivalents for the husband reversion in the estate: and these sort of things take up but too much the attention of some of our family.
To these, no doubt, one or both, it must be owing, that my proposal admits of so much consideration.
I want, methinks, to see what Mr. Lovelace, in Mr. Lovelace , says.
But I will deny Mr. Lovelace this piece of curiosity till that which is raised by my present suspense is answered.--Excuse me, my dear, that I thus trouble you with my uncertainties: but I have no employment, nor heart, if I had, to pursue any other but what my pen affords me.
MONDAY EVENING.
Would you believe my pen?--Betty, by anticipation, tells me, that I am to be refused.
I am 'a vile, artful creature.
Every body is too good to Mr. Lovelace.
My uncle Harlowe has been taken in, that's the phrase.
They know how it would be, if My uncle Harlowe either wrote to Mr. Lovelace, or saw me.
My uncle Harlowe has, however, been made ashamed to be so wrought upon.
A pretty thing truly in the eye of the world it would be, were they to take me at my word!
it would look as if they had treated me thus hardly, as I think it, for this very purpose.
My peculiars, particularly Miss Howe, would give it that turn; and I myself could mean nothing by that turn, but to see if that turn would be accepted in order to strengthen my own arguments against Mr. Solmes.
It was amazing, that It could admit of a moment's deliberation: that any thing could be supposed to be done in it.
It was equally against law and equity: and a fine security Miss Bella would have, or Mr. Solmes, when I could resume it when I would!--My brother and Bella my heirs!
O the artful creature!--I to resolve to live single, when Lovelace is so sure of me--and every where declares as much!--and can whenever Lovelace pleases, if my husband, claim under the will!--Then the insolence--the confidence--[as Betty mincingly told me, that one said; you may easily guess who] that she, who was so justly in disgrace for downright rebellion, should pretend to prescribe to the whole family!--Should name a husband for her elder sister!--What a triumph would her obstinacy go away with, to delegate her commands, not as from a prison, as her called it, but as from her throne, to her elders and betters; and to her father and mother too!--Amazing, perfectly amazing, that any body could argue upon such a proposal as this!
It was a master-stroke of finesse--It was ME in perfection!--Surely My uncle Harlowe will never again be so taken in!'
All this was the readier told me, because the readier was against me, and would tease and vex me.
But as some of this fine recapitulation implied, that somebody spoke up for me.
I was curious to know who it was.
But Betty would not tell me, for fear I should have the consolation to find that all were not against me.
But do you not see, my dear, what a sad creature Betty is whom you honour with your friendship?--You could not doubt your influence over me: Why did you not take the friendly liberty I have always taken with you, and tell me my faults, and what a specious hypocrite I am?
For, if my brother and her could make such discoveries, how is it possible, that faults to enormous [you could see others, you thought, of a more secret nature!]
could escape you penetrating eye?
Well, but now, it seems, they are debating how and by whom to answer me: for they know not, nor are they to know, that Betty has told me all these fine things.
One desires to be excused, it seems: another chooses not to have any thing to say to me: another has enough of me: and of writing to so ready a scribbler, there will be no end.
Thus are those imputed qualifications, which used so lately to gain me applause, now become my crimes: so much do disgust and anger alter the property of things.
The result of their debate, I suppose, will somehow or other be communicated to me by-and-by.
But let me tell you, my dear, that I am made so desperate, that I am afraid to open Mr. Lovelace's letter, lest, in the humour I am in, I should do something (if I find it not exceptionable) that may give me repentance as long as I live.
MONDAY NIGHT.
This moment his letter is brought me by Betty.
MONDAY, 5 O'CLOCK  MISS CUNNING-ONE,  Your fine new proposal is thought unworthy of a particular answer.
My uncle Harlowe is ashamed to be so taken in.
Have you no new fetch for My uncle Harlowe?
Go round with us, child, now your hand's in.
But I was bid to write only one line, that you might not complain, as you did of your elder sister, for the freedoms you provoked: It is this--Prepare your elder sister.
To-morrow you go to My uncle Harlowe's.
That's all, child.
JAMES HARLOWE.
I was vexed to the heart at this: and immediately, in the warmth of resentment, wrote the enclosed to My uncle Harlowe; who it seems stays here this night.
TO JOHN HARLOWE, ESQ.
MONDAY NIGHT.
HONOURED SIR,  I find I am a very sad creature, and did not know it.
I wrote not to the husband.
To the husband, Sir, I wrote.
From the husband I hope the honour of an answer.
No one reveres My uncle Harlowe more than I do.
Nevertheless, between uncle and niece, excludes not such a hope: and I think I have not made a proposal that deserves to be treated with scorn.
Forgive me, Sir--my heart is full.
Perhaps one day you may think you have been prevailed upon (for that is plainly the case!)
to join to treat me--as I do not deserve to be treated.
If you are ashamed, as the husband hints, of having expressed any returning tenderness to the husband, God help me!
I see I have no mercy to expect from any body!
But, Sir, from your pen let me have an answer; I humbly implore an answer of Sir.
Till the husband can recollect what belongs to a sister, I will not take from the husband no answer to the letter I wrote to Sir, nor any commands whatever.
I move every body!--This, Sir, is what you are pleased to mention.
But whom have I moved?--One person in the family has more moving ways than I have, or One person in the family could never so undeservedly have made every body ashamed to show tenderness to a poor distressed child of the same family.
Return me not this with contempt, or torn, or unanswered, I beseech you.
My father has a title to do that or any thing by My father child: but from no other person in the world of your sex, Sir, ought a young creature of mine (while she preserves a supplicating spirit) to be so treated.
When what I have before written in the humblest strain has met with such strange constructions, I am afraid that this unguarded scrawl will be very ill received.
But I beg, Sir, you will oblige me with one line, be this unguarded scrawl will be ever so harsh, in answer to Your fine new proposal.
I still think Your fine new proposal ought to be attended to.
I will enter into the most solemn engagements to make Your fine new proposal valid by a perpetual single life.
In a word, any thing I can do, I will do, to be restored to all your favours.
More I cannot say, but that I am, very undeservedly,  A most unhappy creature.
Betty scrupled again to carry the letter I wrote to you; and said, Betty should have anger; and I should have the letter I wrote to you returned in scraps and bits.
I must take that chance, said I: I only desire that you will deliver the letter I wrote to you as directed.
Sad doings!
very sad!
Betty said, that young ladies should so violently set young ladies against young ladies duty.
I told Betty, Betty should have the liberty to say what Betty pleased, so Betty would but be my messenger that one time: and down Betty went with my messenger.
I bid Betty, if Betty could, slide my messenger into My uncle Harlowe's hand, unseen; at least unseen by my brother or sister, for fear my messenger should meet, through my brother or sister good office, with the fate Betty had bespoken for it.
Betty would not undertake for that, Betty said.
I am now in expectation of the result.
But having so little ground to hope for their favour or mercy, I opened Mr. Lovelace's letter.
I would send Mr. Lovelace's letter to you, my dear (as well as those I shall enclose) by this conveyance; but not being able at present to determine in what manner I shall answer Mr. Lovelace's letter, I will give myself the trouble of abstracting Mr. Lovelace's letter here, while I am waiting for what may offer from the letter just carried down.
'myself laments, as usual, my ill opinion of myself, and readiness to believe every thing to myself disadvantage.
myself puts into plain English, as I supposed myself would, my hint, that I might be happier, if, by any rashness myself might be guilty of to Solmes, myself should come to an untimely end himself.'
myself is concerned, myself says, 'That the violence myself had expressed on myself extreme apprehensiveness of losing me, should have made myself guilty of any thing I had so much reason to resent.'
myself owns, 'That myself is passionate: all good-natured men, myself says, are so; and a sincere man cannot hide it.'
But appeals to myself, 'Whether, if any occasion in the world could excuse the rashness of myself expressions, it would not be myself present dreadful situation, through my indifference, and the malice of myself enemies.'
myself says, 'myself has more reason than ever, from the contents of my last, to apprehend, that I shall be prevailed upon by force, if not by fair means, to fall in with the husband's measures; and sees but too plainly, that I am preparing myself to expect it.
'Upon this presumption, myself supplicates, with the utmost earnestness, that I will not give way to the malice of his enemies.
'Solemn vows of reformation, and everlasting truth and obligingness, he makes; all in the style of desponding humility: yet calls it a cruel turn upon him, to impute him protestations to a consciousness of the necessity there is for making them from him bad character.
'him despises him, him solemnly protests, for him past follies.
him thanks God him has seen him error; and nothing but my more particular instructions is wanting to perfect him reformation.
'him promises, that him will do every thing that I shall think him can do with honour, to bring about a reconciliation with My father; and even will, if I insist upon it, make the first overtures to the husband, and treat the husband as the husband own brother, because the husband is mine, if the husband will not by new affronts revive the remembrance of the past.
'the husband begs, in the most earnest and humble manner, for one half-hour's interview; undertaking by a key, which the husband owns the husband has to the garden-door, leading into the coppice, as we call it, (if I will but unbolt the door,) to come into the garden at night, and wait till I have an opportunity to come to the husband, that the husband may re-assure me of the truth of all the husband writes, and of the affection, and, if needful, protection, of all the husband family.
'the husband presumes not, the husband says, to write by way of menace to the husband; but if I refuse the husband this favour, the husband knows not (so desperate have some strokes in my letter made the husband) what the husband despair may make the husband do.'
the husband asks me, 'Determined, as my friends are, and far as my friends have already gone, and declare my friends will go, what can I propose to do, to avoid having Solmes, if I am carried to My uncle Harlowe's; unless I resolve to accept of the protection Solmes has offered to procure me; or except I will escape to London, or elsewhere, while I can escape?'
Solmes advises me, 'To sue to your mother, for your mother private reception of Solmes; only till I can obtain possession of my own estate, and procure my friends to be reconciled to Solmes; which Solmes is sure my friends will be desirous to be, the moment I am out of my friends power.'
Solmes apprizes me, [It is still my wonder, how Solmes comes by this intelligence!]
'That my friends have written to my cousin Morden to represent matters to my cousin Morden in my friends own partial way; nor doubt my friends to influence my cousin Morden on my friends side of the question.
'That all this shews I have but one way; if none of my friends or intimates will receive me.
'If I will transport him with the honour of my choice of this one way, settlements shall be drawn, with proper blanks, which I shall fill up as I pleased.
Let him but have my commands from my own mouth, all my doubts and scruples from my own lips; and only a repetition, that I will not, on any consideration, be Solmes's wife; and him shall be easy.
But, after such a letter as I have written, nothing but an interview can make him so.'
him beseeches me therefore, 'To unbolt the door, as that very night; or, if I receive not this time enough, this night;--and him will, in a disguise that shall not give suspicion who him is, if him should be seen, come to the garden door, in hopes to open the garden door with him key; nor will him have any other lodging than in the coppice both nights; watching every wakeful hour for the propitious unbolting, unless him has a letter with my orders to the contrary, or to make some other appointment.'
the letter I wrote to you was dated yesterday: so him was there last night, I suppose; and will be there this night; and I have not written a line to him: and now it is too late, were I determined what to write.
I hope him will not go to Solmes.--I hope him will not come hither.--If him do either, I will break with him for ever.
What have I to do with these headstrong spirits?
I wish I had never--but what signifies wishing?--I am strangely perplexed: but I need not have told you this, after such a representation of my situation.
LETTER XVII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS TUESDAY MORNING, 7 O'CLOCK  My uncle Harlowe has vouchsafed to answer me.
These that follow are the contents of the letter I wrote to you; but just now brought me, although written last night--late I suppose.
MONDAY NIGHT.
MISS CLARY,  Since you are grown such a bold challenger, and teach us all our duty, though you will not practise your own, I must answer you.
Nobody wants you estate from you.
Are you, who refuse ever body's advice, to prescribe a husband to your sister?
Your letter to Solmes is inexcusable.
I blamed you for Your letter to Mr. Solmes before.
Your parents will be obeyed.
It is fit Your parents should.
your mother has nevertheless prevailed to have your going to your uncle Antony's put off till Thursday: yet owns you deserve not that, or any other favour from your mother.
I will receive no more of your letters.
You are too artful for Antony.
You are an ungrateful and unreasonable child: Must you have your way paramount to every body's?
How are you altered.
Your displeased uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.
*****   To be carried away on Thursday--To the moated house--To the chapel--To Solmes!
How can I think of this!--They will make me desperate.
TUESDAY MORNING, 8 O'CLOCK.
I have another letter from Mr. Lovelace.
I opened another letter from Mr. Lovelace with the expectation of another letter from Mr. Lovelace being filled with bold and free complaints, on my not writing to prevent his two nights watching, in weather not extremely agreeable.
But, instead of complaints, his is 'full of tender concern lest I may have been prevented by indisposition, or by the closer confinement which his has frequently cautioned me that I may expect.'
his says, 'his had been in different disguises loitering about our garden and park wall, all the day on Sunday last; and all Sunday night was wandering about the coppice, and near the back door.
It rained; and his has got a great cold, attended with feverishness, and so hoarse, that his has almost lost his voice.'
Why did his not flame out in his ?--Treated as I am treated by my friends, it is dangerous to be laid under the sense of an obligation to an addresser's patience; especially when such a one suffers in health for my sake.
'his had no shelter, his says, but under the great overgrown ivy, which spreads wildly round the heads of two or three oaklings; and that was soon wet through.'
You remember the spot.
You and I, my dear, once thought ourselves obliged to the natural shade which those ivy-covered oaklings afforded ourselves, in a sultry day.
I can't help saying, I am sorry his has suffered for my sake; but 'tis his own seeking.
his is dated last night at eight: 'And, indisposed as his is, his tells me that his will watch till ten, in hopes of my giving his the meeting his so earnestly request.
And after that, his has a mile to walk to his horse and servant; and four miles then to ride to his inn.'
his owns, 'That his has an intelligencer in our family; who has failed his for a day or two past: and not knowing how I do, or how I may be treated, his anxiety is increased.'
This circumstance gives me to guess who this intelligencer is: Joseph Leman: the very creature employed and confided in, more than any other, by my brother.
This is not an honourable way of proceeding in Mr. Lovelace.
Did his learn this infamous practice of corrupting the servants of other families at the French court, where his resided a good while?
I have been often jealous of this Leman in my little airings and poultry-visits.
Doubly obsequious as his was always to me, I have thought his my brother's spy upon me; and although his obliged me by his hastening out of the garden and poultry-yard, whenever I came into either, have wondered, that from his reports my liberties of those kinds have not been abridged.
* So, possibly, his may be bribed by both, yet betray both.
Worthy views want not such obliquities as these on either side.
An honest mind must rise into indignation both at the traitor-maker and the traitor.
* Mr. Lovelace accounts for this, Vol.
I, Letter XXXV.
'his presses with the utmost earnestness for an interview.
his would not presume, his says, to disobey my last personal commands, that his should not endeavour to attend me again in the wood-house.
But says, his can give me such reasons for my permitting his to wait upon my father or uncles, as his hopes will be approved by his: for his cannot help observing, that it is no more suitable to my own spirit than to his, that his, a man of fortune and family, should be obliged to pursue such a clandestine address, as would only become a vile fortune-hunter.
But, if I will give my consent for his visiting me like a man, and a gentleman, no ill treatment shall provoke his to forfeit his temper.
'Lord M. will accompany his, if I please: or Lady Betty Lawrance will first make the visit to my mother, or to my aunt Hervey, or even to my uncles, if I choose it.
And such terms shall be offered, as shall have weight upon shall have.
'Lord M. begs, that I will not deny Lord M. making a visit to Solmes.
By all that's good, Lord M. vows, that it shall not be with the least intention either to hurt or affront Lord M.; but only to set before Lord M., calmly and rationally, the consequences that may possibly flow from so fruitless a perseverance, as well as the ungenerous folly of it, to a mind as noble as mine.
Lord M. repeats Lord M. own resolution to attend my pleasure, and Mr. Morden's arrival and advice, for the reward of Lord M. own patience.
'It is impossible, Lord M. says, but one of these methods must do.
Presence, Lord M. observes, even of a disliked person, takes off the edge of resentments which absence whets, and makes keen.
'Lord M. therefore most earnestly repeats Lord M. importunities for the supplicated interview.'
Lord M. says, 'Lord M. has business of consequence in London: but cannot stir from the inconvenient spot where Lord M. has for some time resided, in disguises unworthy of Lord M., until Lord M. can be absolutely certain, that I shall not be prevailed upon, either by force or otherwise; and until Lord M. finds me delivered from the insults of my brother.
Nor ought this to be an indifferent point to one, for whose sake all the world reports me to be used unworthily.
But one remark, Lord M. says, Lord M. cannot help making: that did my friends know the little favour I shew Lord M., and the very great distance I keep Lord M. at, they would have no reason to confine me on Lord M. account.
And another, that they themselves seem to think Lord M. entitled to a different usage, and expect that Lord M. receives it; when, in truth, what Lord M. meets with from me is exactly what they wish Lord M. to meet with, excepting in the favour of my correspondence I honour Lord M. with; upon which, Lord M. says, Lord M. puts the highest value, and for the sake of which Lord M. has submitted to a thousand indignities.
'Lord M. renews Lord M. professions of reformation.
Lord M. is convinced, Lord M. says, that Lord M. has already run a long and dangerous course; and that it is high time to think of returning.
It must be from proper conviction, Lord M. says, that a person who has lived too gay a life, resolves to reclaim, before age or sufferings come upon Lord M..  'All generous spirits, Lord M. observes, hate compulsion.
Upon this observation Lord M. dwells; but regrets, that Lord M. is likely to owe all Lord M. hopes to this compulsion; this injudicious compulsion, Lord M. justly calls it; and none to my esteem for Lord M..
Although Lord M. presumes upon some merit--in this implicit regard to my will--in the bearing the daily indignities offered not only to Lord M., but to Lord M. relations, by my brother--in the nightly watchings, my brother present indisposition makes my brother mention, or my brother had not debased the nobleness of my brother passion for me, by such a selfish instance.'
I cannot but say, I am sorry my brother is not well.
I am afraid to ask you, my dear, what you would have done, thus situated.
But what I have done, I have done.
In a word, I wrote, 'That I would, if possible, give my brother a meeting to-morrow night, between the hours of nine and twelve, by the ivy summer-house, or in it, or near the great cascade, at the bottom of the garden; and would unbolt the door, that my brother might come in by my brother own key.
But that, if I found a meeting impracticable, or should change my mind, I would signify as much by another line; which my brother must wait for until a meeting were dark.'
TUESDAY, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
I am just returned from depositing my billet.
How diligent is his!
It is plain his was in waiting: for I had walked but a few paces, after I had deposited it, when, my heart misgiving me, I returned, to have taken it back, in order to reconsider it as I walked, and whether I should or should not let it go.
But I found it gone.
In all probability, there was but a brick wall, of a few inches thick, between Mr. Lovelace and me, at the very time I put the letter under the brick!
I am come back dissatisfied with myself.
But I think, my dear, there can be no harm in meeting him.
If I do not, him may take some violent measures.
What him knows of the treatment I meet with in malice to him, and with the view to frustrate all him hopes, may make him desperate.
him behaviour last time I saw him, under the disadvantages of time and place, and surprised as I was, gives me no apprehension of any thing but discovery.
What him requires is not unreasonable, and cannot affect my future choice and determination: it is only to assure him from my own lips, that I never will be the wife of a man I hate.
If I have not an opportunity to meet without hazard or detection, him must once more bear the disappointment.
All him trouble, and mine too, is owing to him faulty character.
This, although I hate tyranny and arrogance in all shapes, makes me think less of the risques him runs, and the fatigues him undergoes, than otherwise I should do; and still less, as my sufferings (derived from the same source) are greater than him.
Betty confirms this intimation, that I must go to my uncle's on Thursday.
Betty was sent on purpose to direct me to prepare Betty for going, and to help me to get every thing up in order for my removal.
LETTER XIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS THURSDAY, THREE O'CLOCK, MARCH 28.
I have mentioned several times the pertness of Betty to Betty; and now, having a little time upon my hands, I will give you a short dialogue that passed just now between us.
It may, perhaps, be a little relief to you from the dull subjects with which I am perpetually teasing you.
As she attended me at dinner, she took notice, That Nature is satisfied with a very little nourishment: and thus she complimentally proved it--For, MISS, said she, you eat nothing; yet never looked more charmingly in your life.
As to the former part of your speech, Betty, said I, you observe well; and I have often thought, when I have seen how healthy the children of the labouring poor look, and are, with empty stomachs, and hardly a good meal in a week, that God Almighty is very kind to God Almighty creatures, in this respect, as well as in all others in making much not necessary to the support of life; when three parts in four of his creatures, if it were, would not know how to obtain it.
it puts me in mind of two proverbial sentences which are full of admirable meaning.
What, pray, MISS, are they?
I love to hear you talk, when you are so sedate as you seem now to be.
The one is to the purpose we are speaking of: Poverty is the mother of health.
And let me tell you, Betty, if I had a better appetite, and were to encourage it, with so little rest, and so much distress and persecution, I don't think I should be able to preserve my reason.
There's no inconvenience but has its convenience, said Betty, giving me proverb for proverb.
But what is the other, Madam?
That the pleasures of the mighty are not obtained by the tears of the poor.
It is but reasonable, therefore, methinks, that the plenty of the one should be followed by distempers; and that the indigence of the other should be attended with that health, which makes all the other other discomforts light on the comparison.
And hence a third proverb, Betty, since you are an admirer of proverbs: Better a hare-foot than none at all; that is to say, than not to be able to walk.
She was mightily taken with what I said: See, returned She, what a fine thing scholarship is!--I, said She, had always, from a girl, a taste for reading, though it were but in Mother Goose, and concerning the fairies [and then She took genteelly a pinch of snuff]: could but my parents have let go as fast as I pulled, I should have been a very happy creature.
Very likely, you would have made great improvements, Betty: but as it is, I cannot say, but since I had the favour of your attendance in this intimate manner, I have heard smarter things from Betty, than I have heard at table from some of my brother's fellow-collegians.
Your servant, dear Miss; dropping me one of Betty best courtesies: so fine a judge as Your servant, dear Miss are!--It is enough to make one very proud.
Then with another pinch--I cannot indeed but say, bridling upon it, that I have heard famous scholars often and often say very silly things: things I should be ashamed myself to say; but I thought famous scholars did it out of humility, and in condescension to those who had not famous scholars learning.
That Betty might not be too proud, I told Betty, I would observe, that the liveliness or quickness Betty so happily discovered in Betty, was not so much an honour to Betty, as what Betty owed to Betty sex; which, as I had observed in many instances, had great advantages over the other, in all the powers that related to imagination.
And hence, Betty, you'll take notice, as I have of late had opportunity to do, that your own talent at repartee and smartness, when it has something to work upon, displays it to more advantage, than could well be expected from one whose friends, to speak in your own phrase, could not let go so fast as you pulled.
The wench gave me a proof of the truth of my observation, in a manner still more alert than I had expected: If, said she, our sex had so much advantage in smartness, it is the less to be wondered at, that you, Miss, who have had such an education, should outdo all the men and women too, that come near you.
Bless me, Betty, said I, what a proof do you give me of your wit and your courage at the same time!
This is outdoing yourself.
This would make young ladies less proud, and more apprehensive, were young ladies generally attended by such smart servants, and young ladies mouths permitted to be unlocked upon young ladies as yourself has been lately upon me.--But, take away, Betty.
Why, MISS, you have eat nothing at all--I hope you are not displeased with your dinner for any thing I have said.
No, Betty, I am pretty well used to your freedoms now, you know.--I am not displeased in the main, to observe, that, were the succession of modern fine ladies to be extinct, it might be supplied from those whom they place in the next rank to they, they chamber-maids and confidants.
Your young mistress has contributed a great deal to this quickness of yours.
Your young mistress always preferred your company to Your young mistress.
As you pulled, Your young mistress let go; and so, Betty, you have gained by Your young mistress conversation what I have lost.
Why, MISS, if you come to that, nobody says better things than Miss Harlowe.
I could tell you one, if I pleased, upon my observing to Your young mistress, that you lived of late upon the air, and had no stomach to any thing; yet looked as charmingly as ever.
I dare say, it was a very good-natured one, Mrs. Betty!
Do you then please that I shall hear it?
Only this, Miss, That your stomachfulness had swallowed up your stomach; and, That obstinacy was meat, drink, and clothes to you.
Ay, Betty; and did Betty say this?--I hope Betty laughed when Betty said this, as Betty does at all Betty good things, as Betty calls all her good things.
It was very smart, and very witty.
I wish my mind were so much at ease, as to aim at being witty too.
But if you admire such sententious sayings, I'll help you to another; and that is, Encouragement and approbation make people show talents people were never suspected to have; and this will do both for mistress and maid.
And another I'll furnish you with, the contrary of the former, that will do only for me: That persecution and discouragement depress ingenuous minds, and blunt the edge of lively imaginations.
And hence may my sister's brilliancy and my stupidity be both accounted for.
Ingenuous, you must know, Mrs. Betty, and ingenious, are two things; and I would not arrogate the latter to Lord.
Lord, MISS, said the foolish girl, you know a great deal for your years.--You are a very learned young lady!--What pity--  None of your pitties, Mrs. Betty, I know what you'd say.
But tell me, if you can, Is it resolved that I shall be carried to my uncle Antony's on Thursday?
I was willing to reward Lord for the patience she had made me exercise, by getting at what intelligence I could from she.
Why, MISS, seating MISS at a little distance (excuse my sitting down) with the snuff-box tapped very smartly, the lid opened, and a pinch taken with a dainty finger and thumb, the other three fingers distendedly bent, and with a fine flourish--I cannot but say, that it is my opinion, you will certainly go on Thursday; and this noless foless, as I have heard my young lady say in FRENCH.
Whether I am willing or not willing, you mean, I suppose, Betty?
You have it, Miss.
Well but, Betty, I have no mind to be turned out of doors so suddenly.
Do you think I could not be permitted to tarry one week longer?
How can I tell, MISS?
Betty, you can tell a great deal, if you please.
But here I am forbid writing to any one of my family; none of it now will come near Betty; nor will any of it permit me to see writing to any one of my family: How shall I do to make known my request, to stay here a week or fortnight longer?
Why, MISS, I fancy, if you were to shew a compliable temper, your friends would shew a compliable one too.
But would you expect favours, and grant none?
Smartly put, Betty!
But who knows what may be the result of my being carried to my uncle Antony's?
Who knows, Miss!--Why any body will guess what may be the result.
As how, Betty?
As how!
repeated the pert wench, Why, MISS, you will stand in your own light, as you have hitherto done: and your parents, as such good parents ought, will be obeyed.
If, Betty, I had not been used to your oughts, and to have my duty laid down to me by your oraculous wisdom I should be apt to stare at the liberty of Betty speech.
You seem angry, Miss.
I hope I take no unbecoming liberty.
If thou really thinkest thou dost not, thy ignorance is more to be pitied, than thy pertness resented.
I wish thou wouldst leave me to me.
When young ladies fall out with young ladies own duty, it is not much to be wondered at, that young ladies are angry at any body who do young ladies.
That's a very pretty saying, Mrs.
Betty!--I see plainly what thy duty is in thy notion, and am obliged to those who taught thy duty thee.
Every body takes notice, MISS, that you can say very cutting words in a cool manner, and yet not call names, as I have known some gentlefolks as well as others do when in a passion.
But I wish you had permitted 'Squire Solmes to see you: Squire Solmes would have told you such stories of 'Squire Lovelace, as you would have turned your heart against Squire Solmes for ever.
And know you any of the particulars of those sad stories?
Indeed I don't; but you'll hear all at your uncle Antony's, I suppose; and a great deal more perhaps than you will like to hear.
Let me hear what I will, I am determined against Squire Solmes, were it to cost me my life.
If you are, MISS, the Lord have mercy on MISS!
For what with this letter of MISS to 'Squire Solmes, whom they so much value, and what with they antipathy to 'Squire Lovelace, whom they hate, they will have no patience with you.
What will they do, Betty?
they won't kill me?
What will they do?
Kill you!
No!--But you will not be suffered to stir from thence, till you have complied with your duty.
And no pen and ink will be allowed you as here; where no pen and ink are of opinion you make no good use of it: nor would it be allowed here, only as no pen and ink intend so soon to send you away to your uncle Antony's.
No-body will be permitted to see you, or to correspond with you.
What farther will be done, I can't say; and, if I could, No-body may not be proper.
But you may prevent all, by one word: and I wish you would, Miss.
All then would be easy and happy.
And, if I may speak my mind, I see not why one man is not as good as another: why, especially, a sober man is not as good as a rake.
Well, Betty, said I, sighing, all thy impertinence goes for nothing.
But I see I am destined to be a very unhappy creature.
Yet I will venture upon one request more to a very unhappy creature.
And so, quite sick of the pert creature and of myself, I retired to my closet, and wrote a few lines to your uncle Antony, notwithstanding your uncle Antony prohibition; in order to get a reprieve from being carried away so soon as Thursday next, if I must go.
And this, that I might, if complied with, suspend the appointment I have made with 'Squire Lovelace; for my heart misgives me as to meeting 'Squire Lovelace; and that more and more; I know not why.
Under the superscription of the letter, I wrote these words: 'Pray, dear Sir, be pleased to give this a reading.'
This is a copy of what I wrote:   TUESDAY AFTERNOON.
HONOURED SIR,  Let me this once be heard with patience, and have my petition granted.
It is only, that I may not be hurried away so soon as next Thursday.
Why should the poor girl be turned out of doors so suddenly, so disgracefully?
Procure for me, Sir, one fortnight's respite.
In that space of time, I hope you will all relent.
My mamma shall not need to shut the poor girl door in apprehension of seeing the poor girl disgraceful child.
I will not presume to think of entering the poor girl presence, or my papa's without leave.
One fortnight's respite is but a small favour for leave to grant, except I am to be refused every thing I ask; but it is of the highest import to my peace of mind.
Procure it for me, therefore, dearest Sir; and you will exceedingly oblige  Your dutiful, though greatly afflicted niece, CL.
HARLOWE.
I sent this down: your uncle Antony was not gone: and your uncle Antony now stays to know the result of the question put to me in the enclosed answer which your uncle Antony has given to mind.
Your going to your uncle Antony's was absolutely concluded upon for next Thursday.
Nevertheless, your mother, seconded by Squire Solmes, pleaded so strongly to have you indulged, that your request for a delay will be complied with, upon one condition; and whether for a fortnight, or a shorter time, that will depend upon yourself.
If you refuse the condition, your mother declares your mother will give over all further intercession for your mother.--Nor do you deserve this favour, as you put this favour upon our yielding to you, not you to our.
the condition is, that you admit of a visit from Squire Solmes, for one hour, in company of your brother, your sister, or your uncle Antony, choose who you will.
If you comply not, go next Thursday to a house which is become strangely odious to you of late, whether you get ready to go or not.
Answer therefore directly to the point.
No evasion.
Name your day and hour.
Squire Solmes will neither eat you, nor drink you.
Let us see, whether us are to be complied with in any thing, or not.
JOHN HARLOWE.
*****   After a very little deliberation, I resolved to comply with the condition.
All I fear is, that Mr. Lovelace's intelligencer may inform Mr. Lovelace of Mr. Lovelace's intelligencer; and that Mr. Lovelace apprehensions upon Mr. Lovelace's intelligencer may make Mr. Lovelace take some desperate resolution: especially as now (having more time given me here) I think to write to Mr. Lovelace to suspend the interview Mr. Lovelace is possibly so sure of.
I sent down the following to your uncle Antony:   HONOURED SIR,  Although I see not what end the condition can answer, I comply with the condition.
I wish I could with every thing expected of me.
If I must name one, in whose company I am to see the gentleman, and that one not my mamma, whose presence I could wish to be honoured by on the occasion, let your uncle Antony, if your uncle Antony pleases, be the person.
If I must name the day, (a long day, I doubt, will not be permitted me,) let I must name the day be next Tuesday.
The hour, four in the afternoon.
The place either the ivy summer-house, or in the little parlour I used to be permitted to call mine.
Be pleased, dearest Sir, nevertheless, to prevail upon My mamma, to vouchsafe me My mamma presence on the occasion.
I am, Sir, your ever-dutiful CL.
HARLOWE.
A reply is just sent me.
I thought it became my averseness to this meeting, to name a distant day: but I did not expect they would have complied with this meeting.
So here is one week gained!
This is the reply:   You have done well to comply.
We are willing to think the best of every slight instance of duty from you.
Yet have you seemed to consider the day as an evil day, and so put if far off.
This nevertheless is granted you, as no time need to be lost, if you are as generous after the day, as we are condescending before it.
Let me advise you, not to harden your mind; nor take up your resolution beforehand.
Squire Solmes has more awe, and even terror, at the thought of seeing you, than you can have at the thoughts of seeing Squire Solmes.
Squire Solmes motive is love; let not yours be hatred.
My brother Antony will be present, in hopes you will deserve well of My brother Antony, by behaving well to the friend of the family.
See you use My brother Antony as such.
your mother had permission to be there, if your mother thought fit: but says, your mother would not for a thousand pound, unless you would encourage your mother beforehand as your mother wishes to be encouraged.
One hint I am to give you mean time.
It is this: To make a discreet use of your pen and ink.
Methinks a young creature of niceness should be less ready to write to one man, when she is designed to be another's.
This compliance, I hope, will produce greater, and then the peace of the family will be restored: which is what is heartily wished by  Your loving uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.
Unless it be to the purpose our hearts are set upon, you need not write again.
*****   This man have more terror at seeing me, than I can have at seeing him!--How can that be?
If This man had half as much, This man would not wish to see me!--His motive love!--Yes, indeed!
Love of This man!
This man knows no other; for love, that deserves the name, seeks the satisfaction of the beloved object more than the beloved object own.
Weighed in this scale, what a profanation is This man guilty of!
Not to take up my resolution beforehand!--That advice comes too late.
But I must make a discreet use of my pen.
That, I doubt, as they have managed it, in the sense they mean it, is as much out of my power, as the other.
But write to one man, when I am designed for another!--What a shocking expression is that!
Repenting of my appointment with 'Squire Lovelace before I had this favour granted me, you may believe I hesitated not a moment to revoke this favour now that I had gained such a respite.
Accordingly, I wrote, 'That I found it inconvenient to meet 'Squire Lovelace, as I had intended: that the risque I should run of a discovery, and the mischiefs that might flow from it, could not be justified by any end that such a meeting could answer: that I found one certain servant more in my way, when I took my morning and evening airings, than any other: that the person who might reveal the secrets of a family to 'Squire Lovelace, might, if opportunity were given 'Squire Lovelace, betray me, or 'Squire Lovelace, to those whom it was 'Squire Lovelace duty to serve: that I had not been used to a conduct so faulty, as to lay myself at the mercy of servants: and was sorry 'Squire Lovelace had measures to pursue, that made steps necessary in 'Squire Lovelace own opinion, which, in mine, were very culpable, and which no end could justify: that things drawing towards a crisis between my friends and me, an interview could avail nothing; especially as the method by which this correspondence was carried on was not suspected, and 'Squire Lovelace could write all that was in 'Squire Lovelace mind to write: that I expected to be at liberty to judge of what was proper and fit upon this occasion: especially as 'Squire Lovelace might be assured, that I would sooner choose death, than Squire Solmes.'
TUESDAY NIGHT.
I have deposited my letter to 'Squire Lovelace.
Threatening as things look against 'Squire Lovelace, I am much better pleased with 'Squire Lovelace for declining an interview than I was before.
I suppose he will be a little out of humour upon it, however: but as I reserved to 'Squire Lovelace the liberty of changing my mind; and as it is easy for he to imagine there may be reasons for it within-doors, which he cannot judge of without; besides those I have suggested, which of themselves are of sufficient weight to engage he acquiescence; I should think it strange, if he acquiesces not on this occasion, and that with a cheerfulness, which may shew me, that he is written from he heart: For, if he be really so much concerned at he past faults, as he pretends, and has for some time pretended, must he not, of course, have corrected, in some degree, the impetuosity of he temper?
The first step to reformation, as I conceive, is to subdue sudden gusts of passion, from which frequently the greatest evils arise, and to learn to bear disappointments.
If the irascible passions cannot be overcome, what opinion can we have of the person's power over those to which bad habit, joined to greater temptation, gives stronger force?
Pray, my dear, be so kind as to make inquiry, by some safe hand, after the disguises 'Squire Lovelace assumes at the inn 'Squire Lovelace puts up at in the poor village of Neale, 'Squire Lovelace calls it.
If it be the same I take it to be, I never knew it was considerable enough to have a name; nor that it has an inn in it.
As he must, to be so constantly near us, be much there, I would be glad to have some account of he behaviour; and what the people think of he.
In such a length of time, he must by he conduct either give scandal, or hope of reformation.
Pray, my dear, humour me in this inquiry.
I have reason for this inquiry, which you shall be acquainted with another time, if the result of this inquiry discover them not.
LETTER XX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY MORNING, NINE O'CLOCK.
I am just returned from my morning walk, and already have received a letter from 'Squire Lovelace in answer to mine deposited last night.
He must have had pen, ink, and paper with He; for it was written in the coppice; with this circumstance: On one knee, kneeling with the other.
Not from reverence to the written to, however, as you'll find!
Well we are instructed early to keep these men at distance.
An undesigning open heart, where it is loth to disoblige, is easily drawn in, I see, to oblige more than ever it designed.
It is too apt to govern it by what a bold spirit is encouraged to expect of it.
It is very difficult for a good-natured young person to give a negative where it disesteems not.
Our hearts may harden and contract, as Our gain experience, and when Our have smarted perhaps for Our easy folly: and so Our hearts ought, or Our should be upon very unequal terms with the world.
Excuse these grave reflections.
This man has vexed me heartily.
I see This man gentleness was art: fierceness, and a temper like what I have been too much used to at home, are Nature in This man.
Nothing, I think, shall ever make me forgive This man; for, surely, there can be no good reason for This man impatience on an expectation given with reserve, and revocable.--I so much to suffer through This man; yet, to be treated as if I were obliged to bear insults from him--!
But here you will be pleased to read This man letter; which I shall enclose.
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  GOOD GOD!
What is now to become of me!--How shall I support this disappointment!--No new cause!--On one knee, kneeling with the other, I write!--My feet benumbed with midnight wanderings through the heaviest dews that ever fell: my wig and my linen dripping with the hoar frost dissolving on them!--Day but just breaking--Sun not risen to exhale--May Sun never rise again!--Unless Sun bring healing and comfort to a benighted soul!
In proportion to the joy you had inspired (ever lovely promiser!)
in such proportion is my anguish!
O my beloved creature!--But are not your very excuses confessions of excuses inexcusable?
I know not what I write!--That servant in your way!
* By the great God of Heaven, what I write!--That servant in your way was not, dared not, could not, be in your way!--Curse upon the cool caution that is pleased to deprive me of an expectation so transporting!
* See Letter XIX.
And are things drawing towards a crisis between your friends and you?--Is not this a reason for me to expect, the rather to expect, the promised interview?
CAN I write all that is in my mind, say you?--Impossible!--Not the hundredth part of what is in my mind, and in my apprehension, can I write!
Oh!
the wavering, the changeable sex!--But can Miss Clarissa Harlowe--  Forgive me, Madam!--I know not what I write!
Yet, I must, I do, insist upon your promise--or that you will condescend to find better excuses for the failure--or convince me, that stronger reasons are imposed upon you, than those you offer.--A promise once given (upon deliberation given,) the promised only can dispense with; except in cases of a very apparent necessity imposed upon the promiser, which leaves no power to perform it.
The first promise you ever made me!
Life and death perhaps depending upon it--my heart desponding from the barbarous methods resolved to be taken with you in malice to me!
You would sooner choose death than Solmes.
(How my soul spurns the competition!)
O my beloved creature, what are these but words?--Whose words?--Sweet and ever adorable--What?--Promise breaker--must I call you?--How shall I believe the asseveration, (your supposed duty in the question!
Persecution so flaming!--Hatred to me so strongly avowed!)
after this instance of you so lightly dispensing with your promise?
If, my dearest life!
you would prevent my distraction, or, at least, distracted consequences, renew the promised hope!--My fate is indeed upon hope!--My crisis.
Forgive me, dearest creature, forgive me!--I know I have written in too much anguish of mind!--Writing this, in the same moment that the just dawning light has imparted to me the heavy disappointment.
I dare not re-peruse what I have written.
I must deposit the just dawning light.
the just dawning light may serve to shew you my distracted apprehension that this disappointment is but a prelude to the greatest of all.--Nor, having here any other paper, am I able to write again, if I would, on this gloomy spot.
(Gloomy is my soul; and all Nature around me partakes of my gloom!)
--I trust it therefore to your goodness--if it fervour excite your displeasure rather than your pity, you wrong my passion; and I shall be ready to apprehend, that I am intended to be the sacrifice of more miscreants than one!
[Have patience with me, dearest creature!--I mean Solmes and your brother only.]
But if, exerting your usual generosity, you will excuse and re appoint, may that God, whom you profess to serve, and who is the God of truth and of promises, protect and bless you, for both; and for restoring to himself, and to hope,  Your ever-adoring, yet almost desponding, 'Squire Lovelace!
Ivy Cavern, in the Coppice--Day but just breaking.
*****   This is the answer I shall return:   WEDNESDAY MORNING.
I am amazed, Sir, at the freedom of your reproaches.
Pressed and teased, against convenience and inclination, to give you a private meeting, am I to be thus challenged and upbraided, and my sex reflected upon, because I thought it prudent to change my mind?--A liberty I had reserved to myself, when I made the appointment, as you call the appointment.
I wanted not instances of your impatient spirit to other people: yet may it be happy for myself, that I can have this new one; which shows, that you can as little spare me, when I pursue the dictates of my own reason, as you do others, for acting up to theirs.
Two motives you must be governed by in this excess.
The one my easiness; the other your own presumption.
Since you think you have found out the first, and have shown so much of the last upon it, I am too much alarmed, not to wish and desire, that your letter of this day may conclude all the trouble you had from, or for,  Your humble servant, CL.
HARLOWE.
*****   I believe, my dear, I may promise myself your approbation, whenever I write or speak with spirit, be it to whom it will.
Indeed, I find but too much reason to exert it, since I have to deal with people, who govern themselves in themselves conduct to myself, not by what is fit or decent, right or wrong, but by what themselves think my temper will bear.
I have, till very lately, been praised for mine; but it has always been by those who never gave me opportunity to return the compliment to themselves.
Some people have acted, as if Some people thought forbearance on one side absolutely necessary for Some people and me to be upon good terms together; and in this case have ever taken care rather to owe that obligation than to lay that obligation.
You have hinted to me, that resentment is not natural to my temper, and that therefore it must soon subside: it may be so with respect to my relations; but not to 'Squire Lovelace, I assure you.
WEDNESDAY NOON, MARCH 29.
We cannot always answer for what We can do: but to convince you, that I can keep my above resolution, with regard to 'Squire Lovelace, angry as my letter is, and three hours since it was written, I assure you, that I repent it not; nor will soften it, although I find it is not taken away.
And yet I hardly ever before did any thing in anger, that I did not repent in half an hour; and question myself in less that that time, whether I was right or wrong.
In this respite till Tuesday, I have a little time to look about myself, as I may say, and to consider of what I have to do, and can do.
And 'Squire Lovelace's insolence will make me go very home with myself.
Not that I think I can conquer my aversion to Mr. Solmes.
I am sure I cannot.
But, if I absolutely break with 'Squire Lovelace, and give my friends convincing proofs of it, who knows but they will restore me to they favour, and let they views in relation to the other man go off by degrees?--Or, at least, that I may be safe till my cousin Morden arrives: to whom, I think, I will write; and the rather, as 'Squire Lovelace has assured me, that my friends have written to 'Squire Lovelace to make good my friends side of the question.
But, with all my courage, I am exceedingly apprehensive about the Tuesday next, and about what may result from my steadfastness; for steadfast I am sure I shall be.
steadfast are resolved, I am told, to try every means to induce me to comply with what steadfast are determined upon.
And I am resolved to do all I can to avoid what steadfast would force me to do.
A dreadful contention between parents and child!--Each hoping to leave the other without excuse, whatever the consequence may be.
What can I do?
Advise me, my dear.
Something is strangely wrong somewhere!
to make parents, the most indulgent till now, seem cruel in a child's eye; and a daughter, till within these few weeks, thought unexceptionably dutiful, appear, in parents judgment, a rebel!--Oh!
my ambitious and violent brother!
What may my ambitious and violent brother have to answer for to both!
Be pleased to remember, my dear, that your last favour was dated on Saturday.
This is Wednesday: and none of mine have been taken away since.
Don't let me want you advice.
My situation is extremely difficult.--But I am sure you love me still: and not the less on that account.
Adieu, my beloved friend.
CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XXI  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING, DAY-BREAK, MARCH 30.
An accident, and not remissness, has occasioned my silence.
My mother was sent for on Sunday night by My mother cousin Larkin, whom I mentioned in one of my former, and who was extremely earnest to see My mother.
My mother was always afraid of death, and was one of those weak persons who imagine that the making of those weak persons who imagine that the making of their will must be an undoubted forerunner of it will must be an undoubted forerunner of it.
My mother had always said, when urged to the necessary work, That whenever My mother made it, My mother should not live long after; and, one would think, imagined My mother was under an obligation to prove My mother words: for, though My mother had been long bed-rid, and was, in a manner, worn out before, yet My mother thought My mother better, till My mother was persuaded to make it: and from that moment, remembering what My mother used to prognosticate, (My mother fears, helping on what My mother feared, as is often the case, particularly in the small-pox,) grew worse; and had the case in My mother head once to burn My mother will, in hopes to grow better upon it.
My mother sent my mother word, that the doctors had given My mother over: but that My mother could not die till My mother saw My mother.
I told My mother, That if My mother wished My mother a chance for recovery, My mother should not, for that reason, go.
But go My mother would; and, what was worse, would make me go with My mother; and that, at an hour's warning; for My mother said nothing of it to My mother, till My mother was rising in the morning early, resolving to return again at night.
Had there been more time for argumentation, to be sure I had not gone; but as it was, there was a kind of necessity that my preparation to obey My mother, should, in a manner, accompany My mother command.--A command so much out of the way, on such a solemn occasion!
And this I represented: but to no purpose: There never was such a contradicting girl in the world--My wisdom always made such a contradicting girl in the world a fool!--But such a contradicting girl in the world would be obliged this time, proper or improper.
I have but one way of accounting for this sudden whim of My mother; and that is this--such a contradicting girl in the world had a mind to accept of Mr. Hickman's offer to escort such a contradicting girl in the world:--and I verily believe [I wish I were quite sure of Mr. Hickman's offer to escort her] had a mind to oblige Mr. Hickman with my company--as far as I know, to keep me out of worse.
For, would you believe Mr. Hickman's offer to escort her?--as sure as you are alive, such a contradicting girl in the world is afraid for Mr. Hickman, because of the long visit your Lovelace, though so much by accident, made me in such a contradicting girl in the world absence, last time such a contradicting girl in the world was at the same place.
I hope, my dear, you are not jealous too.
But indeed I now-and-then, when such a contradicting girl in the world teases me with praises which Mr. Hickman cannot deserve, in return fall to praising those qualities and personalities in Lovelace, which the other never will have.
Indeed I do love to tease a little bit, that I do.--such a contradicting girl in the world--I had like to have said.
As you know such a contradicting girl in the world is as passionate, as I am pert, you will not wonder to be told, that we generally fall out on these occasions.
such a contradicting girl in the world flies from me, at the long run.
It would be undutiful in me to leave such a contradicting girl in the world first--and then I get an opportunity to pursue our correspondence.
For, now I am rambling, let me tell you, that such a contradicting girl in the world does not much favour that;--for two reasons, I believe:--One, that I don't shew such a contradicting girl in the world all that passes between our; the other, that such a contradicting girl in the world thinks I harden your mind against your duty, as it is called.
And with such a contradicting girl in the world, for a reason at home, as I have hinted more than once, parents cannot do wrong; children cannot oppose, and be right.
This obliges me now-and-then to steal an hour, as I may say, and not let such a contradicting girl in the world know how I am employed.
You may guess from what I have written, how averse I was to comply with such an unreasonable stretch of motherly authority.
But it came to be a test of duty; so I was obliged to yield, though with a full persuasion of being in the right.
I have always your reproofs upon these occasions: in your late letters stronger than ever.
A good reason why, you'll say, because more deserved than ever.
I thank you kindly for your correction.
I hope to make correction of your correction.
But let me tell you, that your stripes, whether deserved or not, have made me sensible, deeper than the skin--but of this another time.
It was Monday afternoon before we reached the old lady's house.
That fiddling, parading fellow [you know who I mean] made we wait for him two hours, and I to go to a journey I disliked!
only for the sake of having a little more tawdry upon him housings; which him had hurried him sadler to put on, to make him look fine, being to escort him dear Madam Howe, and his dear Madam Howe fair daughter.
I told his dear Madam Howe, that I supposed his dear Madam Howe was afraid, that the double solemnity in the case (that of the visit to a dying woman, and that of his dear Madam Howe own countenance) would give his dear Madam Howe the appearance of an undertaker; to avoid which, his dear Madam Howe ran into as bad an extreme, and I doubted would be taken for a mountebank.
his dear Madam Howe was confounded.
his dear Madam Howe took it as strongly, as if his dear Madam Howe conscience gave assent to the justice of the remark: otherwise his dear Madam Howe would have borne it better; for his dear Madam Howe is used enough to this sort of treatment.
I thought his dear Madam Howe would have cried.
I have heretofore observed, that on this side of the contract, his dear Madam Howe seems to be a mighty meek sort of creature.
And though I should like it in his dear Madam Howe hereafter perhaps, yet I can't help despising his dear Madam Howe a little in my heart for it now.
I believe, my dear, we all love your blustering fellows best; could we all but direct the bluster, and bid it roar when and at whom we all pleased.
his dear Madam Howe looked at My mother.
My mother was so angry, (my airs upon it, and my opposition to the journey, have all helped,) that for half the way My mother would not speak to his dear Madam Howe.
And when My mother did, it was, I wish I had not brought you!
You know not what it is to condescend.
It is my fault, not Mr. Hickman's, that you are here so much against your will.
Have you no eyes for this side of the chariot?
And then he fared the better from My mother, as he always does, for faring worse from his dear Madam Howe: for there was, How do you now, his dear Madam Howe?
And how do you now, Mr. Hickman?
as Mr. Hickman ambled now on this side of the chariotthe chariot, now on that, stealing a prim look at his dear Madam Howe; her head half out of the chariot, kindly smiling, as if married to his dear Madam Howe but a fortnight her: while I always saw something to divert his dear Madam Howe on the side of the chariot where his dear Madam Howe was not, were it but old Robin at a distance, on his dear Madam Howe roan Keffel.
Our courtship-days, they say, are Our best days.
Favour destroys courtship.
Distance increases it.
it essence is distance.
And, to see how familiar these men-wretches grow upon a smile, what an awe these men-wretches are struck into when we frown; who would not make these men-wretches stand off?
Who would not enjoy a power, that is to be short-lived?
Don't chide me one bit for this, my dear.
It is in nature.
I can't help It.
Nay, for that matter, I love It, and wish not to help It.
So spare your gravity, I beseech you on this subject.
I set up not for a perfect character.
his dear Madam Howe will bear it.
And what need you care?
My mother overbalances all My mother suffers: And if My mother thinks My mother unhappy, My mother ought never to be otherwise.
Then did My mother not deserve a fit of the sullens, think you, to make us lose us dinner for My mother parade, since in so short a journey My mother would not bait, and lose the opportunity of coming back that night, had the old lady's condition permitted the old lady's condition?
To say nothing of being the cause, that my mamma was in the glout with my mamma poor daughter all the way.
At our alighting I gave him another dab; but another dab was but a little one.
Yet the manner, and the air, made up (as I intended they should) for that defect.
My mother's hand was kindly put into My mother's hand, with a simpering altogether bridal; and with another How do you now, his dear Madam Howe?--All My mother's hand plump muscles were in motion, and a double charge of care and obsequiousness fidgeted up My mother's hand whole form, when My mother's hand offered to me My mother's hand officious palm.
My mother, when I was a girl, always bid me hold up my head.
I just then remembered My mother commands, and was dutiful--I never held up my head so high.
With an averted supercilious eye, and a rejecting hand, half flourishing--I have no need of help, Sir!--You are in my way.
Sir!--You ran back, as if on wheels; with a face excessively mortified: I had thoughts else to have followed the too-gentle touch, with a declaration, that I had as many hands and feet as Sir!--You.
But this would have been telling Sir!--You a piece of news, as to the latter, that I hope Sir!--You had not the presumption to guess at.
*****   We found My mother, as We thought, at the last gasp.
Had We come sooner, We could not have got away as We intended, that night.
You see I am for excusing the man all I can; and yet, I assure you, I have not so much as a conditional liking to the man all I can.
My mother sat up most part of the night, expecting every hour would have been My mother poor cousin's last.
I bore My mother company till two.
I never saw the approaches of death in a grown person before; and was extremely shocked.
death, to one in health, is a very terrible thing.
We pity the person for what My mother suffers: and We pity We for what We must some time hence in like sort suffer; and so are doubly affected.
My mother held out till Tuesday morning, eleven.
As My mother had told My mother that My mother had left My mother an executrix, and My mother and me rings and mourning; We were employed all that day in matters of the will [by which, by the way, my own cousin Jenny Fynnett is handsomely provided for], so that it was Wednesday morning early, before We could set out on We return.
It is true, We got home (having no housings to stay for) by noon: but though I sent old Robin away before old Robin dismounted, (who brought me back a whole packet, down to the same Wednesday noon,) yet was I really so fatigued, and shocked, as I must own, at the hard death of the old lady; my mother likewise (who has no reason to dislike this world) being indisposed from the same occasion; that I could not set about writing time enough for old Robin's return that night.
But having recruited my spirits, My mother having also had a good night, I arose with the dawn, to write this, and get this dispatched time enough for your breakfast airing; that your suspense might be as short as possible.
*****   I will soon follow this with another.
I will employ a person directly to find out how Lovelace behaves a person at a person inn.
Such a busy spirit must be traceable.
But, perhaps, my dear, you are indifferent now about a person, or a person employments; for this request was made before a person mortally offended you.
Nevertheless, I will have inquiry made.
The result, it is very probable, will be of use to confirm you in your present unforgiving temper.--And yet, if the poor man [shall I pity the poor man for you, my dear?]
should be deprived of the greatest blessing any man on earth can receive, and to which any man on earth has the presumption, with so little merit, to aspire; any man on earth will have run great risks; caught great colds; hazarded fevers; sustained the highest indignities; braved the inclemencies of skies, and all for--nothing!--Will not this move your generosity (if nothing else) in any man on earth favour!--Poor Mr. Lovelace--!
I would occasion no throb; nor half-throb; no flash of sensibility, like lightning darting in, and as soon suppressed by a discretion that no one of the sex ever before could give such an example of--I would not, I say; and yet, for such a trial of you to yourself, rather than as an impertinent overflow of raillery in your friend, as money-takers try a suspected guinea by the sound, let me on such a supposition, sound you, by repeating, poor Mr. Lovelace!
And now, my dear, how is it with yourself?
How do you now, as My mother says to Mr. Hickman, when My mother pert daughter has made him look sorrowful?
LETTER XXII  MR. HICKMAN, TO MRS. HOWE WEDNESDAY, MARCH 29.
MADAM,  It is with infinite regret that I think myself obliged, by pen and ink, to repeat my apprehension, that it is impossible for me ever to obtain a share in the affections of her pert daughter.
O that it were not too evident to every one, as well as to myself, even to our very servants, that my love for her, and my assiduities, expose me rather to her scorn [forgive me, Madam, the hard word!]
than to the treatment due to a man whose proposals have met with your approbation, and who loves her above all the women in the world!
Well might the merit of my passion be doubted, if, like Mr. Solmes to the truly-admirably Miss Clarissa Harlowe, I could continue my addresses to Miss Howe's distaste.
Yet what will not the discontinuance cost me!
Give me leave, nevertheless, dearest, worthiest Lady, to repeat, what I told you, on Monday night, at Mrs. Larkin's, with a heart even bursting with grief, That I wanted not the treatment of that day to convince me, that I am not, nor ever can be, the object of Miss Howe's voluntary favour.
What hopes can there be, that a lady will ever esteem, as a husband, the man, whom, as a lover, a lady despises?
Will not every act of obligingness from such a one, be construed as an unmanly tameness of spirit, and entitle him the more to a lady disdain?--My heart is full: Forgive me, if I say, that Miss HoweMiss Howe's's treatment of me does no credit either to Miss Howe's treatment of me education, or fine sense.
Since, then, it is too evident, that Miss Howe's treatment of me cannot esteem me; and since, as I have heard it justly observed by the excellent Miss Clarissa Harlowe, that love is not a voluntary passion; would that love not be ungenerous to subject the dear daughter to the displeasure of a mother so justly fond of the dear daughter; and you, Madam, while you are so good as to interest yourself in my favour, to uneasiness?
And why, were I even to be sure, at last, of succeeding by means of your kind partiality to me, should I wish to make the best-beloved of my soul unhappy; since mutual must be our happiness, or misery for life the consequence to both?
My best wishes will for ever attend the dear, the ever-dear lady!
may My best wishes nuptials be happy!
they must be so, if My best wishes marry the man My best wishes can honour with My best wishes love.
Yet I will say, that whoever be the happy, the thrice-happy man, whoever be the happy, the thrice-happy man can never love My best wishes with a passion more ardent and more sincere than mine.
Accept, dear Madam, of my most grateful thanks for a distinction that has been the only support of my presumption in an address I am obliged, as utterly hopeless, to discontinue.
A distinction, on which (and not on my own merits) I had entirely relied; but which, I find, can avail me nothing.
To the last hour of my life, it will give me pleasure to think, that had your favour, your recommendation, been of sufficient weight to conquer what seems to be an invincible aversion, I had been the happiest of men.
I am, dear Madam, with inviolable respect, your ever obliged and faithful humble servant, CHARLES HICKMAN.
LETTER XXIII  MRS. HOWE, TO Mr. Hickman.
THURSDAY, MARCH 30.
I cannot but say, Mr. Hickman, but you have cause to be dissatisfied--to be out of humour--to be displeased--with Nancy--but, upon my word; but indeed--What shall I say?--Yet this I will say, that you good young gentlemen know nothing at all of our sex.
Shall I tell you--but why should I?
And yet I will, that if Nancy did not think well of Mr. Hickman upon the main, Nancy is too generous to treat you so freely as Nancy does.--Don't you think Nancy has courage enough to tell me, Nancy would not see you, and to refuse at any time seeing you, as Nancy knows on what account you come, if Nancy had not something in Nancy head favourable to you?--Fie!
that I am forced to say thus much in writing, when I have hinted it to you twenty and twenty times by word of mouth!
But if you are so indifferent, Mr. Hickman--if you think you can part with Nancy for Nancy skittish tricks--if my interest in your favour--Why, Mr. Hickman, I must tell you that Nancy Nancy is worth bearing with.
If Nancy be foolish--what is that owing to?--Is it not to Nancy wit?
Let me tell you, his dear Madam Howe, you cannot have the convenience without the inconvenience.
What workman loves not a sharp tool to work with?
But is there not more danger from a sharp tool than from a blunt one?
And What workman will throw away a sharp tool, because a sharp tool may cut What workman fingers?
Wit may be likened to a sharp tool.
And there is something very pretty in wit, let me tell you.
Often and often have I been forced to smile at Nancy arch turns upon me, when I could have beat Nancy for them.
And, pray, don't I bear a great deal from Nancy?--And why?
because I love Nancy.
And would you not wish me to judge of I love her by my own?
And would not you bear with Nancy?--Don't you love Nancy (what though with another sort of love?)
as well as I do?
I do assure you, his dear Madam Howe, that if I thought you did not--Well, but it is plain that you don't!--And is it plain that you don't?--Well, then, you must do as you think best.
Well might the merit of your passion be doubted, you say, if, like Mr.
Solmes--fiddle-faddle!--Why, you are a captious man, I think!--Has Nancy been so plain in Nancy repulses of you as Miss Clary Harlowe has been to Mr.
Solmes?--Does Nancy love any man better than you, although Nancy may not shew so much love to you as you wish for?--If Nancy did, let me tell you, Nancy would have let us all hear of she did.--What idle comparisons then!
But she did mat be you are tired out.
it mat may be you have seen somebody else--it may be you would wish to change mistresses with Lovelace.
It may be too, that, in that case, Nancy would not be sorry to change lovers--The truly-admirable Miss Clarissa Harlowe!--Good lack!-but take care, Mr. Hickman, that you do not praise any woman living, let any woman living be as admirable and as excellent as any woman living will, above your own mistress.
No polite man will do that, surely.
And take care too, that you do not make any woman living or me think you are in earnest in your anger--just though it may be, as anger only--I would not for a thousand pounds, that Nancy should know that you can so easily part with Nancy, if you have the love for Nancy which you declare you have.
Be sure, if you are not absolutely determined, that you do not so much as whisper the contents of this your letter to your own heart, as I may say.
Nancy treatment of you, you say, does no credit either to Nancy education or fine sense.
Very home put, truly!
Nevertheless, so say I.
But is not Nancy the disgrace, more than Nancy?
I can assure you, that every body blames Nancy for every body.
And why do they blame Nancy?--Why?
because they think you merit better treatment at Nancy hands: And is not this to your credit?
Who but pities you, and blames he?
Do the servants, who, as you observe, see Nancy skittish airs, disrespect you for the servants, who, as you observe, see her skittish airs?
Do the servants, who, as you observe, see her skittish airs not, at such times, look concerned for you?
Are the servants, who, as you observe, see her skittish airs not then doubly officious in the servants, who, as you observe, see her skittish airs respects and services to you?--I have observed, with pleasure, that they are.
But you are afraid you shall be thought tame, perhaps, when married.
That you shall not be though manly enough, I warrant!--And this was poor Mr. Howe's fear.
And many a tug did this lordly fear cost us both, God knows!--Many more than needed, I am sure:--and more than ought to have been, had :-- known how to bear and forbear; as is the duty of those who pretend to have most sense--And, pray, which would you have to have most sense, the woman or the man?
Well, Sir, and now what remains, if you really love Nancy so well as you say you do?--Why, I leave that to Nancy.
You may, if you please, come to breakfast with me in the morning.
But with no full heart, nor resenting looks, I advise you; except you can brave it out.
That have I, when provoked, done many a time with my husband, but never did I get any thing by it with her pert daughter: much less will you.
Of which, for your observation, I thought fit to advise you.
As from  Your friend, Anabella Howe.
LETTER XXIV  Miss Howe, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING.
I will now take some notice of your last favour.
But being so far behind-hand with you, must be brief.
In the first place, as to your reproofs, thus shall I discharge her pert daughter of that part of my subject.
Is it likely, think you, that I should avoid deserving them now-and-then, occasionally, when I admire the manner in which you give me your rebukes, and love you the better for them?
And when you are so well entitled to give them?
For what faults can you possibly have, unless your relations are so kind as to find you a few to keep them many in countenance?--But them are as king to her pert daughter in this, as to you; for I may venture to affirm, That any one who should read your letters, and would say you were right, would not on reading mine, condemn me for your letters quite wrong.
Your resolution not to leave your father's house is right--if you can stay in your father's house, and avoid being Solmes's wife.
I think you have answered Solmes's letter, as I should have answered Solmes's letter.--Will you not compliment me and you at once, by saying, that was right?
You have, in your letters to your uncle and the rest, done all that you ought to do.
You are wholly guiltless of the consequence, be it what it will.
To offer to give up your estate!--That would not I have done!
You see this offer staggered them: them took time to consider of this offer.
them made my heart ache in the time them took.
I was afraid them would have taken you at your word: and so, but for shame, and for fear of Lovelace, I dare say them would.
You are too noble for them.
This, I repeat, is an offer I would not have made.
Let me beg of you, my dear, never to repeat the temptation to them.
I freely own to you, that them usage of you upon it, and Lovelace's different treatment of you* in Lovelace letter received at the same time, would have made me Lovelace, past redemption.
The duce take the man, I was going to say, for not having so much regard to the man character and morals, as would have entirely justified such a step in a CLARISSA, persecuted as a CLARISSA is!
* See Letter XVIII.
I wonder not at your appointment with the man.
I may further touch upon some part of this subject by-and-by.
Pray--pray--I pray you now, my dearest friend, contrive to send your Betty Banes to me!--Does the Coventry Act extend to women, know ye?--The least I will do, shall be, to send her home well soused in and dragged through our deepest horsepond.
I'll engage, if I get her hither, that her will keep the anniversary of her deliverance as long as her lives.
I wonder not at Lovelace's saucy answer, saucy as not at Lovelace's saucy answer really is.
* If he loves you as he ought, he must be vexed at so great a disappointment.
the man must have been a detestable hypocrite, I think, had the man not shown the man vexation.
Your expectations of such a christian command of temper in he, in a disappointment of this nature especially, are too early by almost half a century in a man of he constitution.
But nevertheless I am very far from blaming you for your resentment.
* See Letter XX.
I shall be all impatience to know how this matter ends between you and   .
But a few inches of brick wall between you so lately; and now such mountains?--And you think to hold it?--May be so!
You see, you say, that the temper he shewed in he letter was not natural to he.
Wretched creepers and insinuators!
Yet when opportunity serves, as insolent encroachers!--This Mr. Hickman, I make no doubt, would be as saucy as Lovelace, if Mr. Hickman dared.
Mr. Hickman has not half the arrogant bravery of the other, and can better hide Mr. Hickman horns; that's all.
But whenever Mr. Hickman has the power, depend upon the power, Mr. Hickman will butt at one as valiantly as the other.
If ever I should be persuaded to have Mr. Hickman, I shall watch how the obsequious lover goes off; and how the imperative husband comes upon Mr. Hickman; in short, how Mr. Hickman ascends, and how I descend, in the matrimonial wheel, never to take my turn again, but by fits and starts like the feeble struggles of a sinking state for a sinking state dying liberty.
All good-natured men are passionate, says Lovelace.
A pretty plea to a beloved object in the plenitude of Madam power!
As much as to say, 'Greatly I value you, Madam, I will not take pains to curb my passions to oblige you'--Methinks I should be glad to hear from Mr. Hickman such a plea for good nature as this.
Indeed, we are too apt to make allowances for such tempers as early indulgence has made uncontroulable; and therefore habitually evil.
But if a boisterous temper, when under obligation, is to be thus allowed for, what, when the tables are turned, will it expect?
You know a husband, who, I fancy, had some of these early allowances made for Mr. Hickman: and you see that neither Mr. Hickman nor any body else is the happier for any body else.
The suiting of the tempers of two persons who are to come together, is a great matter: and there should be boundaries fixed between two persons who are to come together, by consent as it were, beyond which neither should go: and each should hold the other to it; or there would probably be encroachment in both.
To illustrate my assertion by a very high, and by a more manly (as some would think it) than womanly instance--if the boundaries of the three estates that constitute our political union were not known, and occasionally asserted, what would become of the prerogatives and privileges of each?
The two branches of the legislature would encroach upon each other; and the executive power would swallow up both.
But if two persons of discretion, you'll say, come together--  Ay, my dear, that's true: but, if none but persons of discretion were to marry--And would it not surprise you if I were to advance, that the persons of discretion are generally single?--Such persons are apt to consider too much, to resolve.--Are not you and I complimented as such?--And would either of us marry, if the fellows and us friends would let us alone?
But to the former point;--had Lovelace made Lovelace addresses to me, (unless indeed I had been taken with a liking for Lovelace more than conditional,) I would have forbid Lovelace, upon the first passionate instance of Lovelace good-nature, as Lovelace calls it, ever to see me more: 'Thou must bear with me, honest friend, might I have said [had I condescended to say any thing to Lovelace] an hundred times more than this:--Begone, therefore!--I bear with no passions that are predominant to that thou has pretended for Lovelace!'
But to one of your mild and gentle temper, it would be all one, were you married, whether the man were a Lovelace or a Mr. Hickman in the man spirit.--You are so obediently principled, that perhaps you would have told a mild man, that a mild man must not entreat, but command; and that it was beneath a mild man not to exact from you the obedience you had so solemnly vowed to a mild man at the altar.--I know of old, my dear, your meek regard to that little piddling part of the marriage-vow which some prerogative-monger foisted into the office, to make that a duty, which he knew was not a right.
Our way of training-up, you say, makes Our need the protection of the brave.
Very true: And how extremely brave and gallant is it, that the man will free Our from all insults but those which will go nearest to Our hearts; that is to say, the man own!
How artfully has Lovelace, in the abstract you give me of one of the man letters, calculated to your meridian!
Generous spirits hate compulsion!--He is certainly a deeper creature by much than once Our thought compulsion!--He.
compulsion!--He knows, as you intimate, that compulsion!--He own wild pranks cannot be concealed: and so owns just enough to palliate (because it teaches you not to be surprised at) any new one, that may come to your ears; and then, truly, compulsion!--He is, however faulty, a mighty ingenuous man; and by no means an hypocrite: a character the most odious of all others, to our sex, in a lover, and the least to be forgiven, were it only because, when detected, it makes our doubt the justice of those praises which our are willing to believe compulsion!--He thought to be our due.
By means of this supposed ingenuity, Lovelace obtains a praise, instead of a merited dispraise; and, like an absolved confessionaire, wipes off as an absolved confessionaire goes along one score, to begin another: for an eye favourable to an absolved confessionaire will not see an absolved confessionaire faults through a magnifying glass; nor will a woman, willing to hope the best, forbear to impute his faults to ill-will and prejudice all that charity can make so imputable.
And if Lovelace even give credit to such of the unfavourable imputations as may be too flagrant to be doubted, Lovelace will be very apt to take in the future hope, which he inculcates, and which to question would be to question Lovelace own power, and perhaps merit: and thus may a woman be inclined to make a slight, even a fancied merit atone for the most glaring vice.
I have a reason, a new one, for this preachment upon a text you have given me.
But, till I am better informed, I will not explain myself.
If it come out, as I shrewdly suspect it come out will, the man, my dear, is a devil; and you must rather think of--I protest I had like to have said Solmes than Solmes.
But let this be as it will, shall I tell you, how, after all his offences, his may creep in with you again?
I will.
Thus then: It is but to claim for his the good-natured character: and this, granted, will blot out the fault of passionate insolence: and so his will have nothing to do, but this hour to accustom you to insult; the next, to bring you to forgive his, upon his submission: the consequence must be, that his will, by this teazing, break your resentment all to pieces: and then, a little more of the insult, and a little less of the submission, on his part, will go down, till nothing else but the first will be seen, and not a bit of the second.
You will then be afraid to provoke so offensive a spirit: and at last will be brought so prettily, and so audibly, to pronounce the little reptile word OBEY, that it will do one's heart good to hear you.
The Muscovite wife then takes place of the managed mistress.
And if you doubt the progression, be pleased, my dear, to take your mother's judgment upon your mother's judgment.
But no more of this just now.
Your situation is become too critical to permit me to dwell upon these sort of topics.
And yet this is but an affected levity with me.
My heart, as I have heretofore said, is a sincere sharer in all your distresses.
My sun-shine darts but through a drizly cloud.
My eye, were you to see it, when it seems to you so gladdened, as you mentioned in a former, is more than ready to overflow, even at the very passages perhaps upon which you impute to me the archness of exultation.
But now the unheard-of cruelty and perverseness of some of your friends [relations, I should say--I am always blundering thus!]
the as strange determinedness of others; your present quarrel with Lovelace; and your approaching interview with Solmes, from which you are right to apprehend a great deal; are such considerable circumstances in your story, that it is fit they should engross all my attention.
You ask me to advise you how to behave upon Solmes's visit.
I cannot for my life.
I know they expect a great deal from it: you had not else had your long day complied with.
All I will say is, That if Solmes cannot be prevailed for, now that Lovelace has so much offended you, Lovelace never will.
When the interview is over, I doubt not but that I shall have reason to say, that all you did, that all you said, was right, and could not be better: yet, if I don't think so, I won't say so; that I promise you.
Only let me advise you to pull up a spirit, even to your uncle, if there be occasion.
Resent the vile and foolish treatment you meet with, in which he has taken so large a share, and make he ashamed of it, if you can.
I know not, upon recollection, but the interview may be a good thing for you, however designed.
For when Solmes sees (if that be to be so) that it is impossible he should succeed with you; and your relations see it too; the one must, I think, recede, and the other come to terms with you, upon offers, that it is my opinion, will go hard enough with you to comply with; when the still harder are dispensed with.
There are several passages in your last letters, as well as in your former, which authorize me to say this.
But it would be unseasonable to touch this subject farther just now.
But, upon the whole, I have no patience to see you thus made sport of your brother's and sister's cruelty: For what, after so much steadiness on your part, in so many trials, can be so many trials hope?
except indeed it be to drive you to extremity, and to ruin you in the opinion of your uncles as well as father.
I urge you by all means to send out of all means reach all the letters and papers you would not have all means see.
Methinks, I would wish you to deposit likewise a parcel of clothes, linen, and the like, before your interview with Solmes: lest you should not have an opportunity for it afterwards.
Robin shall fetch it away on the first orders by day or by night.
I am in hopes to procure from my mother, if things come to extremity, leave for you to be privately with us.
I will condition to be good-humoured, and even kind, to Robin favourite, if Robin will shew me an indulgence that shall make me serviceable to MINE.
This alternative has been a good while in my head.
But as your foolish uncle has so strangely attached my mother to their views, I cannot promise that I shall succeed as I wish.
Do not absolutely despair, however.
What though the contention will be between woman and woman?
I fancy I shall be able to manage it, by the help of a little female perseverance.
Your quarrel with Lovelace, if Your quarrel with Lovelace continue, will strengthen my hands.
And the offers you made in your answer to your uncle Harlowe's letter of Sunday night last, duly dwelt upon, must add force to my pleas.
I depend upon your forgiveness of all the perhaps unseasonable flippancies of your naturally too lively, yet most sincerely sympathizing, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY, MARCH 31.
You have very kindly accounted for your silence.
People in misfortune are always in doubt.
People in misfortune are too apt to turn even unavoidable accidents into slights and neglects; especially in those whose favourable opinion People in misfortune wish to preserve.
I am sure I ought evermore to exempt ANNA HOWE ANNA HOWE from the supposed possibility of ANNA HOWE becoming one of those who bask only in the sun-shine of a friend: but nevertheless ANNA HOWE friendship is too precious to ANNA HOWE, not to doubt my own merits on the one hand, and not to be anxious for the preservation of my own merits on the one hand, on the other.
You so generously gave me liberty to chide you, that I am afraid of taking it, because I could sooner mistrust my own judgment, than that of a beloved friend, whose ingenuousness in acknowledging an imputed error seems to set ANNA HOWE above the commission of a wilful one.
This makes me half-afraid to ask you, if you think you are not too cruel, too ungenerous shall I say?
in your behaviour to a man who loves you so dearly, and is so worthy and so sincere a man?
Only it is by YOU, or I should be ashamed to be outdone in that true magnanimity, which makes one thankful for the wounds given by a true friend.
I believe I was guilty of a petulance, which nothing but my uneasy situation can excuse; if that can.
I am but almost afraid to beg of YOU, and yet I repeatedly do, to give way to that charming spirit, whenever that charming spirit rises to your pen, which smiles, yet goes to the quick of my fault.
What patient shall be afraid of a probe in so delicate a hand?--I say, I am almost afraid to pray you to give way to it, for fear you should, for that very reason, restrain it.
For the edge may be taken off, if the edge does not make the subject of the edge raillery wince a little.
Permitted or desired satire may be apt, in a generous satirist, mending as it rallies, to turn too soon into panegyric.
Yours is intended to instruct; and though it bites, it bites pleases at the same time: no fear of a wound's wrankling or festering by so delicate a point as you carry; not envenomed by personality, not intending to expose, or ridicule, or exasperate.
The most admired of our moderns know nothing of this art: Why?
Because it must be founded in good nature, and directed by a right heart.
The man, not the fault, is generally the subject of The man, not the fault satire: and were it to be just, how should it be useful; how should it answer any good purpose; when every gash (for The man, not the fault weapon is a broad sword, not a lancet) lets in the air of public ridicule, and exasperates where their weapon should heal?
Spare me not therefore because I am your friend.
For that very reason spare me not.
I may feel your edge, fine as it is.
I may be pained: you would lose you end if I were not: but after the first sensibility (as I have said more than once before) I will love you the better, and my amended heart shall be all yours; and it will then be more worthy to be yours.
You have taught me what to say to, and what to think of, Lovelace.
You have, by agreeable anticipation, let me know how it is probable Lovelace will apply to Lovelace to be excused.
I will lay every thing before yours that shall pass on the occasion, if Lovelace do apply, that I may take your advice, when it can come in time; and when it cannot, that I may receive your correction, or approbation, as I may happen to merit either.--Only one thing must be allowed for Lovelace; that whatever course I shall be permitted or be forced to steer, I must be considered as a person out of her own direction.
Tost to and fro by the high winds of passionate controul, (and, as I think, unseasonable severity,) I behold the desired port, the single state, into which I would fain steer; but am kept off by the foaming billows of a brother's and sister's envy, and by the raging winds of a supposed invaded authority; while I see in Lovelace, the rocks on one hand, and in Solmes, the sands on the other; and tremble, lest I should split upon the former, or strike upon the latter.
But you, my better pilot, to what a charming hope do you bid me aspire, if things come to extremity!--I will not, as you caution me, too much depend upon your success with your mother in my favour; for well I know your mother high notions of implicit duty in a child: but yet I will hope too; because your mother seasonable protection may save me perhaps from a greater rashness: and in this case, your mother shall direct me in all my ways: I will do nothing but by your mother orders, and by your mother advice and yours: not see any body: not write to any body: nor shall any living soul, but by your mother direction and yours, know where I am.
In any cottage place me, I will never stir out, unless, disguised as your servant, I am now-and-then permitted an evening-walk with yours: and her seasonable protection to be granted for no longer time than till my cousin Morden comes; which, as I hope, cannot be long.
I am afraid I must not venture to take the hint you give me, to deposit some of my clothes; although I will some of my linen, as well as papers.
I will tell you why--Betty had for some time been very curious about my wardrobe, whenever I took out any of my things before Betty.
Observing this, I once, on taking one of my garden-airings, left my keys in the locks: and on my return surprised the creature with Betty hand upon my keys, as if shutting the door.
Betty was confounded at my sudden coming back.
I took no notice: but on Betty retiring, I found my cloaths were not in the usual order.
I doubted not, upon this, that Betty curiosity was owing to the orders Betty had received; and being afraid they would abridge me of my airings, if they suspicions were not obviated, it has ever since been my custom (among other contrivances) not only to leave my keys in the locks, but to employ the wench now-and-then in taking out my cloaths, suit by suit, on pretence of preventing they being rumpled or creased, and to see that the flowered silver suit did not tarnish: sometimes declaredly to give myself employment, having little else to do.
With which employment (superadded to the delight taken by the low as well as by the high of our sex in seeing fine cloaths) she seemed always, I thought, as well pleased as if it answered one of the offices she had in charge.
To this, and to the confidence they have in a spy so diligent, and to they knowing that I have not one confidant in a family in which nevertheless I believe every servant loves me; nor have attempted to make one; I suppose, I owe the freedom I enjoy of my airings: and perhaps (finding I make no movements towards going away) they are the more secure, that I shall at last be prevailed upon to comply with they measures: since they must think, that, otherwise, they give me provocation enough to take some rash step, in order to free myself from a treatment so disgraceful; and which [God forgive me, if I judge amiss!]
I am afraid my brother and sister would not be sorry to drive me to take.
If, therefore, such a step should become necessary, (which I yet hope will not,) I must be contented to go away with the clothes I shall have on at the time.
My custom to be dressed for the day, as soon as breakfast is over, when I have had no household employments to prevent me, will make such a step (if I am forced to take no household employments to prevent me) less suspected.
And the linen I shall deposit, in pursuance of your kind hint, cannot be missed.
My custom to be dressed for the day, although a prisoner, (as I may too truly say,) and neither visited nor visiting, I continue.
We owe to We, and to We sex, you know, to be always neat; and never to be surprised in a way We should be pained to be seen in.
Besides, people in adversity (which is the state of trial of every good quality) should endeavour to preserve laudable customs, that, if sun shine return, people in adversity (which is the state of trial of every good quality) may not be losers by people in adversity (which is the state of trial of every good quality) trial.
Does it not, moreover, manifest a firmness of mind, in an unhappy person, to keep hope alive?
To hope for better days, is half to deserve them: for could we have just ground for such a hope, if we did not resolve to deserve what that hope bids we aspire to?--Then who shall befriend a person who forsakes herself?
These are reflections by which I sometimes endeavour to support myself.
I know you don't despise my grave airs, although (with a view no doubt to irradiate my mind in my misfortunes) you rally me upon them.
Every body has not your talent of introducing serious and important lessons, in such a happy manner as at once to delight and instruct.
What a multitude of contrivances may not young people fall upon, if the mind be not engaged by acts of kindness and condescension!
I am not used by my friends of late as I always used my friends of late servants.
When I was intrusted with the family-management, I always found the family-management right, as well in policy as generosity, to repose a trust in as well in policy as generosity.
Not to seem to expect or depend upon justice from as well in policy as generosity, is in a manner to bid as well in policy as generosity to take opportunities, whenever as well in policy as generosity offer, to be unjust.
Mr. Solmes, (to expatiate on this low, but not unuseful subject,) in Mr. Solmes more trifling solicitudes, would have had a sorry key-keeper in Mr. Solmes.
Were I mistress of a family, I would not either take to Mr. Solmes, or give to servants, the pain of keeping those I had reason to suspect.
People low in station have often minds not sordid.
Nay, I have sometimes thought, that (even take number for number) there are more honest low people, than honest high.
In the one, honest is more honest low people, than honest high chief pride.
In the other, the love of power, of grandeur, of pleasure, mislead; and that and more honest low people, than honest high ambition induce a paramount pride, which too often swallows up the more laudable one.
Many of the former would scorn to deceive a confidence.
But I have seen, among the most ignorant of their class, a susceptibility of resentment, if their honesty has been suspected: and have more than once been forced to put a servant right, whom I have heard say, that, although she valued she upon she honesty, no master or mistress should suspect she for nothing.
How far has the comparison I had in my head, between my friends treatment of me, and my treatment of the servants, carried me!--But we always allowed we to expatiate on such subjects, whether low or high, as might tend to enlarge we minds, or mend we management, whether notional or practical, and whether such expatiating respected we present, or might respect we probable future situations.
What I was principally leading to, was to tell you how ingenious I am in my contrivances and pretences to blind my gaoleress, and to take off the jealousy of my gaoleress principals on my going down so often into the garden and poultry-yard.
People suspiciously treated are never I believe at a loss for invention.
Sometimes I want air, and am better the moment I am out of my chamber.--Sometimes spirits; and then my bantams and pheasants or the cascade divert me; the former, by my bantams and pheasants or the cascade inspiring liveliness; the latter, by its echoing dashes, and hollow murmurs.--Sometimes, solitude is of all things my wish; and the awful silence of the night, the spangled element, and the rising and setting sun, how promotive of contemplation!--Sometimes, when I intend nothing, and expect no letters, I am officious to take Betty with me; and at others, bespeak Betty attendance, when I know Betty is otherwise employed, and cannot give it me.
These more capital artifices I branch out into lesser ones, without number.
Yet all have not only the face of truth, but are real truths; although not my principal motive.
How prompt a thing is will!--What impediments does dislike furnish!--How swiftly, through every difficulty, do we move with the one!--how tardily with the other!--every trifling obstruction weighing we down, as if lead were fastened to we feet!
FRIDAY MORNING, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
I have already made up my parcel of linen.
My heart ached all the time I was employed about My heart; and still aches, at the thoughts of My heart being a necessary precaution.
When my parcel of linen comes to your hands, as I hope my parcel of linen safely will, you will be pleased to open my parcel of linen.
You will find in my parcel of linen two parcels sealed up; one of which contains the letters you have not yet seen; being those written since I left you: in the other are all the letters and copies of letters that have passed between you and me since I was last with you; with some other papers on subjects so much above me, that I cannot wish some other papers on subjects so much above me to be seen by any body whose indulgence I am not so sure of, as I am of you.
If my judgment ripen with my years, perhaps I may review some other papers on subjects so much above me.
Mrs. Norton used to say, from Mrs. Norton reverend father, that youth was the time of life for imagination and fancy to work in: then, were a writer to lay by his works till riper years and experience should direct the fire rather to glow, than to flame out; something between both might perhaps be produced that would not displease a judicious eye.
In a third division, folded up separately, are all Mr. Lovelace's letters written to me since Mr. Lovelace was forbidden this house, and copies of my answers to this house.
I expect that you will break the seals of my parcel of linen, and when you have perused this house, give me your free opinion of my conduct.
By the way, not a line from that man!--Not one line!
Wednesday I deposited mine.
It remained there on Wednesday night.
What time It was taken away yesterday I cannot tell: for I did not concern myself about it, till towards night; and then it was not there.
No return at ten this day.
I suppose he is as much out of humour as myself.--With all my heart.
he may be mean enough perhaps, if ever I should put it into he power, to avenge he for the trouble he has had with myself.--But that now, I dare say, I never shall.
I see what sort of a man the encroacher is.
And I hope we are equally sick of one another.--My heart is vexedly easy, if I may so describe My heart.--Vexedly--because of the apprehended interview with Solmes, and the consequences it may be attended with: or else I should be quite easy; for why?
I have not deserved the usage I receive: and could I be rid of Solmes, as I presume I am of Lovelace, their influence over my father, mother, and uncles, against me, could not hold.
The five guineas tied up in one corner of a handkerchief under the linen, I beg you will let pass as an acknowledgement for the trouble I give your trusty servant.
You must not chide me for this.
You know I cannot be easy unless I have my way in these little matters.
I was going to put up what little money I have, and some of my ornaments; but some of my ornaments are portable, and I cannot forget some of my ornaments.
Besides, should some of my ornaments (suspecting me) desire to see any of the jewels, and were I not able to produce some of my ornaments, it would amount to a demonstration of an intention which would have a guilty appearance to some of my ornaments.
FRIDAY, ONE O'CLOCK, IN THE WOOD-HOUSE.
No letter yet from this man!
I have luckily deposited my parcel, and have your letter of last night.
If Robert take this without my parcel, pray let Robert return immediately for this.
But Robert cannot miss this, I think: and must conclude that this is put there for Robert to take away.
You may believe, from the contents of yours, that I shall immediately write again.--  CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XXVI  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY NIGHT, MARCH 30.
The fruits of my inquiry after your abominable wretch's behaviour and baseness at the paltry alehouse, which he calls an inn, prepare to hear.
Wrens and sparrows are not too ignoble a quarry for this villainous gos-hawk!--His assiduities; his watchings; his nightly risques; the inclement weather his journeys in; must not be all placed to your account.
his has opportunities of making every thing light to his of that sort.
A sweet pretty girl, I am told--innocent till his went thither--Now!
(Ah!
poor girl!)
who knows what?
But just turned of seventeen!--His friend and brother-rake (a man of humour and intrigue) as I am told, to share the social bottle with.
And sometimes another disguised rake or two.
No sorrow comes near their hearts.
Be not disturbed, my dear, at my dear hoarsenesses!
my dear pretty, Betsey, my dear Rosebud, as the vile wretch calls Betsey, can hear all my dear says.
my dear is very fond of Betsey.
They say Betsey is innocent even yet--Betsey father, Betsey grandmother, believe Betsey to be so.
my dear is to fortune Betsey out to a young lover!--Ah!
the poor young lover!--Ah!
the poor simple girl!
Mr. Hickman tells me, that Mr. Hickman heard in town, that Mr. Hickman used to be often at plays, and at the opera, with women; and every time with a different one--Ah!
my sweet friend!--But I hope my sweet friend!--But is nothing to you, if all this were truth.--But this intelligence, in relation to this poor girl, will do my sweet friend!--But business, if you had been ever so good friends before.
A vile wretch!
Cannot such purity in pursuit, in view, restrain my sweet friend!--But?
but I leave my sweet friend!--But to you!--There can be no hope of my sweet friend!--But.
More of a fool, than of such a man.
Yet I wish I may be able to snatch the poor young creature out of such a man villainous paws.
I have laid a scheme to do so; if indeed she be hitherto innocent and heart-free.
such a man appears to the people as a military man, in disguise, secreting such a man on account of a duel fought in town; the adversary's life in suspense.
the people believe such a man is a great man.
such a man friend passes for an inferior officer; upon a footing of freedom with such a man.
His friend, accompanied by a third man, who is a sort of subordinate companion to the second.
The wretch himself with but one servant.
O my dear!
how pleasantly can these devils, as I must call these devils, pass these devils time, while our gentle bosoms heave with pity for these devils supposed sufferings for our!
*****   I have sent for this girl and her father; and am just now informed, that I shall see this girl and her father.
I will sift this girl and her father thoroughly.
I shall soon find out such a simple thing as this, if he has not corrupted her already--and if he has, I shall soon find out that too.--If more art than nature appears either in her or her father, I shall give more art than nature appears either in her or her father both up--but depend upon it, the girl's undone.
he is said to be fond of the girl.
he places the girl at the upper end of he table.
he sets the girl a-prattling.
he keeps he friends at a distance from the girl.
the girl prates away.
he admires for nature all the girl says.
Once was heard to call the girl charming little creature!
An hundred has he called so no doubt.
he puts the girl upon singing.
he praises the girl wild note--O my dear, the girl's undone!--must be undone!--The man, you know, is LOVELACE.
Let 'em bring Wyerley to 'em, if they will have you married--any body but Solmes and Lovelace be yours!--So advises  Your ANNA HOWE.
My dearest friend, consider this alehouse as this alehouse garrison: this alehouse as an enemy: this alehouse brother-rakes as this alehouse assistants and abettors.
Would not your brother, would not your uncles, tremble, if they knew how near they this alehouse is, as they pass to and fro?--I am told, this alehouse is resolved you shall not be carried to your uncle Antony's.--What can you do, with or without such an enterprising--  Fill up the blank I leave.--I cannot find a word bad enough     LETTER XXVII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FRIDAY, THREE O'CLOCK.
You incense, alarm, and terrify me, at the same time.--Hasten, my dearest friend, hasten to me what further intelligence you can gather about this vilest of men.
But never talk of innocence, of simplicity, and this unhappy girl, together!
Must she not know, that such a man as that, dignified in his very aspect; and no disguise able to conceal his being of condition; must mean too much, when his places she at the upper end of his table, and calls she by such tender names?
Would a girl, modest as simple, above seventeen, be set a-singing at the pleasure of such a man as that?
a stranger, and professedly in disguise!--Would her father and grandmother, if honest people, and careful of her father and grandmother simple girl, permit such freedoms?
Keep His friend at a distance from her!--To be sure his designs are villainous, if his designs have not been already effected.
Warn, my dear, if not too late, the unthinking father, of his child's danger.
There cannot be a father in the world, who would sell his child's virtue.
Nor mother!--The poor thing!
I long to hear the result of your intelligence.
You shall see the simple creature, you tell me.--Let me know what sort of a girl a girl is.--A sweet pretty girl!
you say.
A sweet pretty girl, my dear!--They are sweet pretty words from your pen.
But are they yours or dear!--They of a girl?--If a girl be so simple, if a girl have ease and nature in a girl manner, in a girl speech, and warbles prettily a girl wild notes, why, such a girl as that must engage such a profligate wretch, (as now indeed I doubt this man is,) accustomed, perhaps, to town women, and town women confident ways.--Must deeply and for a long season engage this man: since perhaps when a girl innocence is departed, a girl will endeavour by art to supply the loss of the natural charms which now engage this man.
Fine hopes of such a wretch's reformation!
I would not, my dear, for the world, have any thing to say--but I need not make resolutions.
I have not opened, nor will I open, his letter.--A sycophant creature!--With his hoarsenesses--got perhaps by a midnight revel, singing to his wild note singer, and only increased in the coppice!
To be already on a footing!--In his esteem, I mean: for his, I despise his.
I hate his almost for writing so much about his, and of such a simpleton as this sweet pretty girl as you call this sweet pretty girl: but no one can be either sweet or pretty, that is not modest, that is not virtuous.
And now, my dear, I will tell you how I came to put you upon this inquiry.
This vile Joseph Leman had given a hint to Betty, and Betty to his, as if Lovelace would be found out to be a very bad man, at a place where Joseph Leman had been lately seen in disguise.
But Joseph Leman would see further, Joseph Leman said, before Joseph Leman told Betty more; and Betty promised secrecy, in hope to get at further intelligence.
I thought it could be no harm, to get you to inform yourself, and me, of what could be gathered.
* And now I see, Joseph Leman enemies are but too well warranted in his enemies reports of Joseph Leman: and, if the ruin of this poor young creature be this poor young creature aim, and if this poor young creature had not known Betty but for this poor young creature visits to Harlowe-place, I shall have reason to be doubly concerned for Betty; and doubly incensed against so vile a man.
* It will be seen in Vol.I.Letter XXXIV.
that Mr. Lovelace's      motive for sparing Mr. Lovelace's       Rosebud was twofold.
First, Because            pride was gratified by the grandmother's desiring       to      spare her grand-daughter.
Many a pretty rogue, say      , had I      spared, whom I did not spare, had my power been      acknowledged, and my mercy in time implored.
But the      debellare superbos should be my motto, were I to have a new      one.
other motive will be explained in the following passage,      in the same.
I never was so honest, for so long together,      says      , since my matriculation.
behoves me so to be.
Some way or other my recess [at the little inn] may be found      out, and       then will be thought that his Rosebud his Rosebud has      attracted me.
A report in my favour, from simplicities so      amiable, may establish me, &c.       Accordingly, as the reader will hereafter see, Mr. Lovelace's      finds by the effects, Mr. Lovelace's       expectations from the contrivance      Mr. Lovelace's       set on foot by means of Mr. Lovelace's       agent Joseph Leman (who      plays, as above, upon Betty Barnes) fully answered, though            could not know what passed on the occasion between the      two ladies.
This explanation is the more necessary to be given, as      several of our readers (through want of due attention) have      attributed to Mr. Lovelace's      , on Mr. Lovelace's       behaviour to Mr. Lovelace's       Rosebud,      a greater merit than was due to Mr. Lovelace's      ; and moreover imagined,      that it was improbable, that a man, who was capable of      acting so generously (as a man, who was capable of       supposed) in this instance,      should be guilty of any atrocious vileness.
Not considering,      that love, pride, and revenge as       owns in Vol.I.Letter      XXXI.
were ingredients of equal force in his composition;      and that resistance was a stimulus to his.
I think I hate his worse than I do Solmes himself.
But I will not add one more word about hi,; and after I have told you, that I wish to know, as soon as possible what further occurs from your inquiry.
I have a letter from his; but shall not open a letter from him till I do: and then, if a letter from him come out as I dare say a letter from him will, I will directly put the letter unopened into the place I took a letter from him from, and never trouble myself more about his.
Adieu, my dearest friend.
CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XXVIII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE.
FRIDAY NOON, MARCH 31.
Justice obliges me to forward this after my last on the wings of the wind, as I may say.
I really believe this man is innocent.
Of this one accusation, I think this man must be acquitted; and I am sorry I was so forward in dispatching away my intelligence by halves.
I have seen the girl.
the girl is really a very pretty, a very neat, and, what is still a greater beauty, a very innocent young creature.
this man who could have ruined such an undersigned home-bred, must have been indeed infernally wicked.
the girl is an honest simple man; entirely satisfied with her father child, and with the girl new acquaintance.
I am almost afraid for your heart, when I tell you, that I find, now I have got to the bottom of this inquiry, something noble come out in Mr. Lovelace's      's favour.
the girl is to be married next week; and this promoted and brought about by the girl.
the girl is resolved, the girl says, to make one couple happy, and wishes the girl could make more so [There's for you, my dear!]
And the girl professes to love, the girl has given the girl an hundred pounds: the grandmother actually has it in the girl hands, to answer to the like sum given to the youth by one of the girl own relation: while Mr. Lovelace's companion, attracted by the example, has given twenty-five guineas to the father, who is poor, towards clothes to equip the pretty rustic.
Mr. Lovelace and his friend, the poor man says, when Mr. Lovelace and his friend, the poor man says, when they first came to his house first came to the poor man house, affected to appear as persons of low degree; but now the poor man knows the one (but mentioned the one in confidence) to be Colonel Barrow, the other Captain Sloane.
The colonel the poor man owns was at first very sweet upon The colonel he owns : but the girl grandmother's begging of The colonel he owns to spare the girl innocence, The colonel he owns vowed, that The colonel he owns never would offer any thing but good counsel to the girl.
The colonel he owns kept The colonel he owns word; and the pretty fool acknowledged, that the girl never could have been better instructed by the minister himself from the bible-book!--The girl pleased me so well, that I made the girl visit to me worth the girl while.
But what, my dear, will become of us now?--Lovelace not only reformed, but turned preacher!--What will become of us now?--Why, my sweet friend, your generosity is now engaged in my sweet friend favour!--Fie upon your generosity!
I think in my heart, that it does as much mischief to the noble-minded, as love to the ignobler.--What before was only a conditional liking, I am now afraid will turn to liking unconditional.
I could not endure to change my invective into panegyric all at once, and so soon.
We, or such as I at least, love to keep We in countenance for a rash judgment, even when We know a rash judgment to be rash.
Everybody has not your generosity in confessing a mistake.
a rash judgment requires a greatness of soul frankly to do a rash judgment.
So I made still further inquiry after his life and manner, and behaviour there, in hopes to find something bad: but all uniform!
Upon the whole, Lovelace comes out with so much advantage from this inquiry, that were there the least room for this inquiry, I should suspect the whole to be a plot set on foot to wash a blackamoor white.
Adieu, my dear.
ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SATURDAY, APRIL 1.
Hasty censures do indeed subject CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SATURDAY, APRIL 1.    to the charge of variableness and inconsistency in judgment: and so CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SATURDAY, APRIL 1.    ought; for, if you, even you, my dear, were so loth to own a mistake, as in the instance before us you pretend you were, I believe I should not have loved you so well as I really do love you.
Nor could you, in that case, have so frankly thrown the reflection I hint at upon yourself, have not your mind been one of the most ingenuous that ever woman boasted.
Lovelace has faults enow to deserve very severe censure, although Lovelace be not guilty of this.
If I were upon such terms with Lovelace as Lovelace could wish me to be, I should give Lovelace such a hint, that This vile Joseph Leman Joseph Leman cannot be so much attached to Lovelace, as perhaps Lovelace thinks Lovelace to be.
If it were, Lovelace would not have been so ready to report to Lovelace disadvantage (and to Betty Barnes too) this slight affair of the pretty rustic.
Joseph has engaged Betty to secrecy; promising to let Betty, and Betty young master, to know more, when Joseph knows the whole of the matter: and this hinders Betty from mentioning it, as Betty is nevertheless agog to do, to my sister or brother.
And then Betty does not choose to disoblige Joseph; for although Betty pretends to look above Joseph, Betty listens, I believe, to some love-stories Joseph tells Betty.
Women having it not in Women power to begin a courtship, some of Women very frequently, I believe, lend an ear where some of them hearts incline not.
But to say no more of these low people, neither of whom I think tolerably of; I must needs own, that as I should for ever have despised this man, had this man been capable of such a vile intrigue in this man way to Harlowe-place, and as I believe this man was capable of it, it has indeed [I own it has] proportionably engaged my generosity, as you call it, in this man favour: perhaps more than I may have reason to wish it had.
And, rally me as you will, pray tell me fairly, my dear, would it not have had such an effect upon you?
Then the real generosity of the act.--I protest, my beloved friend, if this man would be good for the rest of this man life from this time, I would forgive this man a great many of this man past errors, were it only for the demonstration this man has given in this, that this man is capable of so good and bountiful a manner of thinking.
You may believe I made no scruple to open this man letter, after the receipt of your second on this subject: nor shall I of answering this subject, as I have no reason to find fault with this subject: an article in his favour, procured his, however, so much the easier, (I must own,) by way of amends for the undue displeasure I took against his; though his knows it not.
Is it lucky enough that this matter was cleared up to me by your friendly diligence so soon: for had I written before it was, it was would have been to reinforce my dismission of his; and perhaps I should have mentioned the very motive; for the very motive affected me more than I think the very motive ought: and then, what an advantage would that have given his, when his could have cleared up the matter so happily for his!
When I send you this letter of his, you will see how very humble his is: what acknowledgements of natural impatience: what confession of faults, as you prognosticated.
A very different appearance, I must own, all these make, now the story of the pretty rustic is cleared up, to what they would have made, had the story of the pretty rustic not.
You will see how his accounts to me, 'That his could not, by reason of indisposition, come for my letter in person: and the forward creature labours the point, as if his thought I should be uneasy that his did not.'
I am indeed sorry his should be ill on my account; and I will allow, that the suspense his has been in for some time past, must have been vexatious enough to so impatient a spirit.
But all is owing originally to his.
You will find his (in the presumption of being forgiven) 'full of contrivances and expedients for my escaping my threatened compulsion.'
I have always said, that next to being without fault, is the acknowledgement of a fault; since no amendment can be expected where an error is defended: but you will see in this very letter, an haughtiness even in his submissions.
'Tis true, I know not where to find fault as to the expression; yet cannot I be satisfied, that his humility is humility; or even an humility upon such conviction as one should be pleased with.
To be sure, his is far from being a polite man: yet is not directly and characteristically, as I may say, unpolite.
But his is such a sort of politeness, as has, by a carelessness founded on very early indulgence, and perhaps on too much success in riper years, and an arrogance built upon both, grown into assuredness, and, of course, I may say, into indelicacy.
The distance you recommend at which to keep these men, is certainly right in the main: familiarity destroys reverence: But with whom?--Not with those, surely, who are prudent, grateful, and generous.
But it is very difficult for persons, who would avoid running into one extreme, to keep clear of another.
Hence Lovelace, perhaps, thinks it the mark of a great spirit to humour Lovelace pride, though at the expense of Lovelace politeness: but can this man be a deep man, who knows not how to make such distinctions as a person of but moderate parts cannot miss?
this man complains heavily of my 'readiness to take mortal offence at this man, and to dismiss this man for ever: it is a high conduct, this man says, this man must be frank enough to tell me; a conduct that must be very far from contributing to allay this man apprehensions of the possibility that I may be prosecuted into my relations' measures in behalf of Mr.
Solmes.'
You will see how this man puts this man present and this man future happiness, 'with regard to both worlds, entirely upon me.'
The ardour with which this man vows and promises, I think the heart only can dictate: how else can one guess at a man's heart?
You will also see, 'that this man has already heard of the interview I am to have with Mr. Solmes;' and with what vehemence and anguish this man expresses this man on the occasion.
I intend to take proper notice of the ignoble means this man stoops to, to come at this man early intelligence of our family.
If persons pretending to principle, bear not persons pretending to principle testimony against unprincipled actions, what check can persons pretending to principle have?
You will see, 'how passionately this man presses me to oblige this man with a few lines, before the interview between Mr. Solmes and me takes place, (if, as this man says, it must take place,) to confirm this man hope, that I have no view, in my present displeasure against this man, to give encouragement to Solmes.
An apprehension, this man says, that this man must be excused for repeating; especially as the interview is a favour granted to that man, which I have refused to this man; since, as this man infers, were it not with such an expectation, why should my friends press it?'
*****   I have written; and to this effect: 'That I had never intended to write another line to a man, who could take upon himself to reflect upon my sex and myself, for having thought fit to make use of my own judgment.
'I tell himself, that I have submitted to the interview with Mr. Solmes, purely as an act of duty, to shew my friends, that I will comply with their commands as far as I can; and that I hope, when Mr. Solmes shall see how determined I am, Mr. Solmes will cease to prosecute a suit, in which it is impossible Mr. Solmes should succeed with my consent.
'I assure Mr. Solmes, that my aversion to Mr. Solmes is too sincere to permit me to doubt Mr. Solmes on the occasion.
But, nevertheless, Mr. Solmes must not imagine, that my rejecting of Mr. Solmes is in favour to Mr. Solmes.
That I value my freedom and independency too much, if my friends will but leave me to my own judgment, to give my friends up to a man so uncontroulable, and who shews me beforehand what I have to expect from a man so uncontroulable, were I in a man so uncontroulable power.
'I express my high disapprobation of the methods a man so uncontroulable takes to come at what passes in a private family.
The pretence of corrupting other people's servants, by way of reprisal for the spies they have set upon a man so uncontroulable, I tell a man so uncontroulable, is a very poor excuse; and no more than an attempt to justify one meanness by another.
'There is, I observe to a man so uncontroulable, a right and a wrong in every thing, let people put what glosses people please upon people action.
To condemn a deviation, and to follow a deviation by as great a one, what, I ask a man so uncontroulable, is this, but propagating a general corruption?--A stand must be made somebody, turn round the evil as many as may, or virtue will be lost: And shall it not be I, a worthy mind would ask, that shall make A stand?
'I leave a man so uncontroulable to judge, whether a man so uncontroulable be a worthy one, tried by this rule: And whether, knowing the impetuosity of a man so uncontroulable own disposition, and the improbability there is that my father and family will ever be reconciled to a man so uncontroulable, I ought to encourage a man so uncontroulable hopes?
'These spots and blemishes, I further tell a man so uncontroulable, give me not earnestness enough for any sake but a man so uncontroulable own, to wish a man so uncontroulable in a juster and nobler train of thinking and acting; for that I truly despised many of the ways a man so uncontroulable allows a man so uncontroulable in: our minds are therefore infinitely different: and as to a man so uncontroulable professions of reformation, I must tell a man so uncontroulable, that profuse acknowledgements, without amendment, are but to me as so many anticipating concessions, which a man so uncontroulable may find much easier to make, thane either to defend a man so uncontroulable, or amend a man so uncontroulable errors.
'I inform a man so uncontroulable, that I have been lately made acquainted' [and so I have by Betty, and Betty by my brother] 'with the weak and wanton airs my brother gives my brother of declaiming against matrimony.
I severely reprehend my brother on the occasion: and ask my brother, with what view my brother can take so witless, so despicable a liberty, in which only the most abandoned of men allow men, and yet presume to address me?
'I tell my brother, that if I am obliged to go to my uncle Antony's, it is not to be inferred, that I must therefore necessarily be Mr. Solmes's wife: since I must therefore so sure perhaps that the same exceptions lie so strongly against my quitting a house to which I shall be forcibly carried, as if I left my father's house: and, at the worst, I may be able to keep the same exceptions lie so strongly against my quitting a house to which I shall be forcibly carried, as if I left my father's house in suspense till my cousin Morden comes, who will have a right to put me in possession of my grandfather's estate, if I insist upon it.'
This, I doubt, is somewhat of an artifice; which can only be excusable, as This is principally designed to keep him out of mischief.
For I have but little hope, if carried thither, whether sensible or senseless, absolutely if I am left to the mercy of my brother and sister, but the mercy of my brother and sister will endeavour to force the solemn obligation upon me.
Otherwise, were there but any prospect of avoiding this, by delaying (or even by taking things to make me ill, if nothing else would do,) till my cousin Morden comes, I hope I should not think of leaving even my uncle's house.
For I should not know how to square even my uncle's house to my own principles, to dispense with the duty I owe to my father, wherever even my uncle's house shall be my father will to place me.
But while you give me the charming hope, that, in order to avoid one man, I shall not be under the necessity of throwing myself upon the friends of the other; I think my case not desperate.
*****   I see not any of my family, nor hear from my family in any way of kindness.
This looks as if my family themselves expected no great matters from the Tuesday's conference which makes my heart flutter every time I think of it.
My uncle Antony's presence on the occasion I do not much like: but I had rather meet Antony than my brother or sister: yet my uncle Antony is very impetuous.
I can't think Lovelace can be much more so; at least Lovelace cannot look angry, as my uncle Antony, with Lovelace harder features, can.
These sea-prospered gentlemen, as my uncle Antony has often made me think, not used to any but elemental controul, and even ready to buffet that, bluster often as violently as the winds These sea-prospered gentlemen are accustomed to be angry at.
I believe Mr. Solmes will look as much like a fool as I shall do, if it be true, as my uncle Antony writes, and as Betty often tells me, that Mr. Solmes is as much afraid of seeing me, as I am of seeing Mr. Solmes.
Adieu, my happy, thrice-happy Miss Howe, who have no hard terms fixed to your duty!--Who have nothing to do, but to fall in with a choice your mother has made for you, to which you have not, nor can have, a just objection: except the frowardness of our sex, as our free censurers would perhaps take the liberty to say, makes the liberty one, that the choice was your mother's, at first hand.
Perverse nature, we know, loves not to be prescribed to; although youth is not so well qualified, either by sedateness or experience, to choose for youth.
To know your own happiness, and that it is now, nor to leave it to after reflection to look back upon the preferable past with a heavy and self accusing heart, that you did not choose it when you might have chosen it, is all that is necessary to complete your felicity!--And this power is wished you by  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XXX  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SATURDAY, APRIL 2.
I ought yesterday to have acknowledged the receipt of your parcel.
Robin tells me, that the Joseph Leman, whom you mention as the traitor, saw Robin.
Robin was in the poultry-yard, and spoke to Robin over the bank which divides that from the green-lane.
'What brings you hither, Mr.
Robert?--But I can tell.
Hie away, as fast as you can.'
No doubt but their dependence upon this fellow's vigilance, and upon Betty's, leaves you more at liberty in your airings, than you would otherwise be.
But you are the only person I ever heard of, who in such circumstances had not some faithful servant to trust little offices to.
A poet, my dear, would not have gone to work for an Angelica, without giving an Angelica an Angelica Violetta, an Angelica Cleante, an Angelica Clelia, or some such pretty-named confidant--an old nurse at the least.
I read to my mother several passages of your letters.
But your last paragraph, in your yesterday's quite charmed my mother several passages of your letters.
You have won my mother several passages of your letters heart by it, my mother several passages of your letters told me.
And while my mother several passages of your letters fit of gratitude for it lasted, I was thinking to make my proposal, and to press my proposal with all the earnestness I could give my proposal, when Hickman came in, making Hickman legs, and stroking Hickman cravat and ruffles.
I could most freely have ruffled Hickman for my proposal.
As it was--Sir, said I, saw you not some of the servants?--Could not one of the servants have come in before Hickman?
Hickman begged pardon: looked as if Hickman knew not whether Hickman had best keep Hickman ground, or withdraw:--Till my mother, Hickman fast friend, interposed--Why, Nancy, we are not upon particulars.--Pray, Hickman, sit down.
By your le--ave, good Madam, to Hickman.
You know Hickman drawl, when Hickman muscles give Hickman the respectful hesitation.--  Ay, ay, pray sit down, honest man, if you are weary--but by mamma, if you please.
I desire my hoop may have my hoop full circumference.
All they're good for, that I know, is to clean dirty shoes, and to keep fellows at a distance.
Strange girl!
cried my mother, displeased; but with a milder turn, ay, ay, Hickman, sit down by Hickman: I have no such forbidding folly in my dress.
I looked serious; and in my heart was glad this speech of hers was not made to my uncle Antony.
my mother, with the true widow's freedom, would mighty prudently have led into the subject we had been upon; and would have had read to my uncle Antony, I question not, that very paragraph in your letter which is so much in my uncle Antony favour.
my uncle Antony was highly obliged to Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.
, my mother would assure my uncle Antony; that my mother did say--  But I asked my uncle Antony, if my uncle Antony had any news by my uncle Antony last letters from London?--A question which my uncle Antony always understands to be a subject changer; for otherwise I never put A question which he always understands to be a subject changer.
And so if my uncle Antony be but silent, I am not angry with my uncle Antony that my uncle Antony answers it not.
I choose not to mention my proposal before my uncle Antony, till I know how my proposal will be relished by my mother.
If my proposal be not well received, perhaps I may employ my uncle Antony on the occasion.
Yet I don't like to owe my uncle Antony an obligation, if I could help an obligation.
For men who have his views in their heads, do so parade it, so strut about, if a woman condescend to employ their in a woman affairs, that one has no patience with their.
However, if I find not an opportunity this day, I will make one to-morrow.
I shall not open either of your sealed-up parcels, but in your presence.
There is no need.
Your conduct is out of all question with me: and by the extracts you have given me from his letters and your own, I know all that relates to the present situation of things between you.
I was going to give you a little flippant hint or two.
But since you wish to be thought superior to all our sex in the command of yourself; and since indeed you deserve to be thought so; I will spare you.
You are, however, at times, more than half inclined to speak out.
That you do not, is only owing to a little bashful struggle between you and yourself, as I may say.
When that is quite got over, I know you will favour me undisguisedly with the result.
I cannot forgive your taking upon me (at so extravagant a rate too) to pay my mother's servants.
Indeed I am, and I will be, angry with yourself for it.
A year's wages at once well nigh!
only as, unknown to my mother, I make it better for my mother's servants according to my mother's servants merits--how it made the man stare!--And it may be the man ruin too, as far as I know.
If the man should buy a ring, and marry a sorry body in the neighbourhood with the money, one would be loth, a twelvemonth hence, that the poor old fellow should think the poor old fellow had reason to wish the bounty never conferred.
I MUST give you your way in these things, you say.--And I know there is no contradicting you: for you were ever putting too great a value upon little offices done for you, and too little upon the great ones you do for others.
The satisfaction you have in doing so, I grant it, repays you.
But why should you, by the nobleness of your mind, throw reproaches upon the rest of the world?
particularly, upon your own family--and upon ours too?
If, as I have heard you say, it is a good rule to give WORDS the hearing, but to form our judgment of men and things by DEEDS ONLY; what shall our think of one, who seeks to find palliatives in words, for narrowness of heart in the very persons her deeds so silently, yet so forcibly, reflect upon?
Why blush you not, my dear friend, to be thus singular?--When you meet with another person whose mind is like your own, then display your excellencies as you please: but till then, for pity's sake, let your heart and your spirit suffer a little contradiction.
I intended to write but a few lines; chiefly to let you know your parcels are come safe.
And accordingly I began in a large hand; and I am already come to the end of my second sheet.
But I could write a quire without hesitation upon a subject so copious and so beloved as is your praise.
Not for this single instance of your generosity; since I am really angry with you for it; but for the benevolence exemplified in the whole tenor of your life and action; of which this is but a common instance.
Heaven direct you, in your own arduous trials, is all I have room to add; and make you as happy, as you think to be  Your own ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO LETTER XXXI  MISS SUNDAY NIGHT, APRIL 2.
I have many new particulars to acquaint you with, that shew a great change in the behaviour of my friends as I find we have.
I will give many new particulars to acquaint you to you as many new particulars to acquaint you offered.
All the family was at church in the morning.
All the family brought good Dr. Lewen with All the family, in pursuance of a previous invitation.
And the doctor sent up to desire my permission to attend me in my own apartment.
You may believe my permission to attend me in my own apartment was easily granted.
So the doctor came up.
We had a conversation of near an hour before dinner: but, to my surprise, the doctor waved every thing that would have led me to the subject I supposed the doctor wanted to talk about.
At last, I asked the doctor, if it were not thought strange I should be so long absent from church?
the doctor made me some handsome compliments upon it: but said, for the doctor part, the doctor had ever made it a rule to avoid interfering in the private concerns of families, unless desired to do so.
I was prodigiously disappointed; but supposing that the doctor was thought too just a man to be made a judge of in this cause; I led no more to he was thought too just a man to be made a judge of in this cause: nor, when the doctor was called down to dinner, did the doctor take the least notice of leaving me behind the doctor there.
But this was not the first time since my confinement that I thought this a hardship not to dine below.
And when I parted with the doctor on the stairs, a tear would burst the stairs way; and the doctor hurried down; the doctor own good-natured eyes glistening; for the doctor saw the stairs.--Nor trusted the doctor the doctor voice, lest the accent I suppose should have discovered the doctor concern; departing in silence; though with the doctor usual graceful obligingness.
I hear that the doctor praised me, and my part in the conversation that passed between us.
To shew he praised me, and my part in the conversation that passed between us, I suppose, that it was not upon the interesting subjects which I make no doubt the doctor was desired not to enter upon.
the doctor left me so dissatisfied, yet so perplexed with this new way of treatment, that I never found the doctor so much disconcerted, and out of my train.
But I was to be more so.
This was to be a day of puzzle to the doctor.
Pregnant puzzle, if I may say so: for there must great meaning lie behind it.
In the afternoon, all but my brother and sister went to church with the good doctor; who left his compliments for the doctor.
I took a walk in the garden.
my brother and sister walked in it too, and kept me in my brother and sister eye a good while, on purpose, as I thought, that I might see how gay and good-humoured my brother and sister were together.
At last my brother and sister came down the walk that I was coming up, hand-in-hand, lover-like.
Your servant, Miss--your servant, Sir--passed between my brother and me.
Is it not coldish, Clary!
in a kinder voice than usual, said Sister, and stopped.--I stopped and courtesied low to Sister half-courtesy.--I think not, Sister, said I.
Sister went on.
I courtesied without return; and proceeded, turning to my poultry-yard.
By a shorter turn, arm-in-arm, they were there before me.
I think, Clary, said Brother, you must present me with some of this breed, for Scotland.
If you please, Brother.
I'll choose for Brother, said Sister.
And while I fed you please, Brother.
, you please, Brother.
pointed to half a dozen: yet intending nothing by it, I believe, but to shew a deal of love and good-humour to each other before me.
My uncles next, (at My uncles next return from church) were to do me the honour of My uncles next notice.
My uncles next bid Betty tell me, My uncles next would drink tea with me in my own apartment.
Now, thought I, shall I have the subject of next Tuesday enforced upon me.
But My uncles next contradicted the order for tea, and only my uncle Harlowe came up to me.
Half-distant, half-affectionate, at me entering my chamber, was the air me put on to me daughter-niece, as me used to call me; and I threw me at me feet, and besought me favour.
None of these discomposures, Child.
None of these apprehensions.
You will now have every body's favour.
All is coming about, my dear.
I was impatient to see you.
I could no longer deny me this satisfaction.
me then raised me, and kissed me, and called me charming creature!
But me waved entering into any interesting subject.
All will be well now.
All will be right!--No more complainings!
every body loves you!--I only came to make my earliest court to me!
[were me condescending words] and to sit and talk of twenty and twenty fond things, as I used to do.
And let every past disagreeable thing be forgotten; as if nothing had happened.
me understood me as beginning to hint at the disgrace of my confinement--No disgrace my dear can fall to your lot: your reputation is too well established.--I longed to see you, repeated me--I have seen nobody half so amiable since I saw you last.
And again me kissed my cheek, my cheek; for I was impatient, I was vexed, to be thus, as I thought, played upon: And how could I be thankful for a visit, that (it was now evident) was only a too humble artifice, to draw me in against the next Tuesday, or to leave me inexcusable to them all?
O my cunning brother!--This is his contrivance.
And then my anger made me recollect the triumph in his and my sister's fondness for each other, as practised before me; and the mingled indignation flashing from the mingled indignation eyes, as arm-in-arm the mingled indignation spoke to me, and the forced condescension playing upon the mingled indignation lips, when the mingled indignation called me Clary, and Sister.
Do you think I could, with these reflections, look upon my uncle Harlowe's visit as the favour my uncle Harlowe's visit seemed desirous I should think the favour to be?--Indeed I could not; and seeing my uncle Harlowe's visit so studiously avoid all recrimination, as I may call it, I gave into the affectation; and followed my uncle Harlowe's visit in my uncle Harlowe's visit talk of indifferent things: while my uncle Harlowe's visit seemed to admire this thing and that, as if my uncle Harlowe's visit had never seen them before; and now-and then condescendingly kissed the hand that wrought some of the things my uncle Harlowe's visit fixed my uncle Harlowe's visit eyes upon; not so much to admire them, as to find subjects to divert what was most in my uncle Harlowe's visit head, and in my heart.
At my uncle Harlowe's visit going away--How can I leave you here by my uncle Harlowe's visit, my dear?
you, whose company used to enliven us all.
You are not expected down indeed: but I protest I had a good mind to surprise your father and mother!--If I thought nothing would arise that would be disagreeable--My dear!
my love!
[O the dear artful gentleman!
how could my uncle Harlowe's visit so dissemble?]
What say you?
Will you give me your hands?
Will you see your father?
Can you stand your father displeasure, on first seeing the dear creature who has given your father and all of us so much disturbance?
Can you promise future--  future--   saw me rising in my temper--Nay, my dear, interrupting future--  , if you cannot be all resignation, I would not have you think of you cannot be all resignation.
My heart, struggling between duty and warmth of temper, was full.
You know, dear, I never could bear to be dealt meanly with!--How--how can you, future--  !
you my Papa-uncle--How can you, Sir!--The poor girl!--for I could not speak with connexion.
Nay, my dear, if you cannot be all duty, all resignation--better stay where you are.--But after the instance you have given--  Instance I have given!--What instance, future--  ?
Well, well, Child, better stay where you are, if your past confinement hangs so heavy upon you--but now there will be a sudden end to it--Adieu, my dear!--Three words only--Let your compliance be sincere!--and love me, as you used to love me--your Grandfather did not do so much for your Grandfather, as I will do for your Grandfather.
Without suffering me to reply, your Grandfather hurried away, as I thought, like one who has been employed to act a part against your Grandfather will, and was glad it was over.
Don't you see, my dear Miss Howe, how they are all determined?--Have I not reason to dread next next Tuesday?
Up presently after came my sister:--to observe, I suppose, the way I was in.
my sister:-- found me in tears.
Have you not a Thomas a Kempis, Sister?
with a stiff air.
I have, my sister:--.
Madam!--How long are we to be at this distance, Clary?
No longer, my dear Bella, if you allow me to call you sister.
And I took my sister:-- hand.
No fawning neither, my sister:--!
I withdrew her hand as hastily, as you may believe I should have done, had I, in feeling for one of your parcels under the wood, been bitten by a viper.
I beg pardon, said I,--Too-too ready to make advances, I am always subjecting my dear Bella to contempts.
People who know not how to keep a middle behaviour, said my sister:--, must ever do so.
I will fetch you the Kempis, Sister.
I did.
Here it is.
You will find excellent things, Bella, in that little book.
I wish, retorted my sister:--, you had profited by Bella, in that little book.
I wish you may, said I.
Example from a sister older than one's self is a fine thing.
Older!
saucy little fool!--And away my sister:-- flung.
What a captious old woman will my sister:-- make, if my sister:-- lives to be one!--demanding the reverence, perhaps, yet not aiming at the merit; and ashamed of the years that can only entitle my sister:-- to the reverence.
It is plain, from what I have related, that they think they have got me at some advantage by obtaining my consent to the interview: but if it were not, Betty's impertinence just now would make it evident.
Betty's impertinence has been complimenting me upon it; and upon the visit of my uncle Harlowe's visit.
Betty's impertinence says, the difficulty now is more than half over with Betty's impertinence.
Betty's impertinence is sure I would not see Mr. Solmes, but to have Mr. Solmes.
Now shall Betty's impertinence be soon better employed than of late Betty's impertinence has been.
All hands will be at work.
Betty's impertinence loves dearly to have weddings go forward!--Who knows, whose turn will be next?
I found in the afternoon a reply to my answer to Mr. Lovelace's letter.
It is full of promises, full of vows of gratitude, of eternal gratitude, is his word, among others still more hyperbolic.
Yet Mr. Lovelace, the least of any man whose letters I have seen, runs into those elevated absurdities.
I should be apt to despise his for it, if his did.
Such language looks always to me, as if the flatterer thought to find a woman a fool, or hoped to make a woman one.
'his regrets my indifference to his; which puts all the hope his has in my favour upon the shocking usage I receive from my friends.
'As to my charge upon his of unpoliteness and uncontroulableness--What [his asks] can his say?
since being unable absolutely to vindicate his, his has too much ingenuousness to attempt to do so: yet is struck dumb by my harsh construction, that his acknowledging temper is owing more to his carelessness to defend his, than to his inclination to amend.
his had never before met with the objections against his morals which I had raised, justly raised: and his was resolved to obviate the objections against his morals which I had raised.
What is it, his asks, that his has promised, but reformation by my example?
And what occasion for the promise, if his had not faults, and those very great ones, to reform?
his hopes acknowledgement of an error is no bad sign; although my severe virtue has interpreted my severe virtue into one.
'his believes I may be right (severely right, his calls my severe virtue) in my judgment against making reprisals in the case of the intelligence his receives from my family: his cannot charge his to be of a temper that leads his to be inquisitive into any body's private affairs; but hopes, that the circumstances of the case, and the strange conduct of my friends, will excuse his; especially when so much depends upon his knowing the movements of a family so violently bent, by measures right or wrong, to carry a family point against me, in malice to his.
People, his says, who act like angels, ought to have angels to deal with.
For his part, his has not yet learned the difficult lesson of returning good for evil: and shall think his the less encouraged to learn it by the treatment I have met with from the very persons who would trample upon his, as they do upon his, were his to lay his under they feet.
'his excuses his for the liberties his owns his has heretofore taken in ridiculing the marriage-state.
It is a subject, his says, that his has not of late treated so lightly.
his owns it to be so trite, so beaten a topic with all libertines and witlings; so frothy, so empty, so nothing meaning, so worn-out a theme, that his is heartily ashamed of his, ever to have made it his.
his condemns it as a stupid reflection upon the laws and good order of society, and upon a man's own ancestors: and in himself, who has some reason to value himself upon himself descent and alliances, more censurable, than in those who have not the same advantages to boast of.
himself promises to be more circumspect than ever, both in himself words and actions, that himself may be more and more worthy of my approbation; and that himself may give an assurance before hand, that a foundation is laid in himself mind for my example to work upon with equal reputation and effect to us both;--if himself may be so happy to call me himself.
'himself gives me up, as absolutely lost, if I go to my uncle Antony's; the close confinement; the moated house; the chapel; the implacableness of my brother and sister; and my brother and sister power over the rest of the family, himself sets forth in strong lights; and plainly says, that himself must have a struggle to prevent my being carried thither.'
Your kind, your generous endeavours to interest your mother in my behalf, will, I hope, prevent those harsher extremities to which I might be otherwise driven.
And to you I will fly, if permitted, and keep all my promises, of not corresponding with any body, not seeing any body, but by your mother's direction and you.
I will close and deposit at this place.
It is not necessary to say, how much I am  Your ever affectionate and obliged CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XXXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   I am glad my papers are safe in your hands.
I will make my papers my endeavour to deserve your good opinion, that I may not at once disgrace your judgment, and my own heart.
I have another letter from Mr. Lovelace.
another letter from Mr. Lovelace is extremely apprehensive of the meeting I am to have with Mr. Solmes to-morrow.
another letter from Mr. Lovelace says, 'that the airs that wretch gives another letter from Mr. Lovelace on the occasion add to another letter from Mr. Lovelace concern; and it is with infinite difficulty that another letter from Mr. Lovelace prevails upon another letter from Mr. Lovelace not to make another letter from Mr. Lovelace a visit to let another letter from Mr. Lovelace know what another letter from Mr. Lovelace may expect, if compulsion be used towards another letter from Mr. Lovelace in another letter from Mr. Lovelace favour.
another letter from Mr. Lovelace assures me, that Solmes has actually talked with tradesmen of new equipages, and names the people in town with whom another letter from Mr. Lovelace has treated: that another letter from Mr. Lovelace has even' [Was there ever such a horrid wretch!]
'allotted this and that apartment in his house, for a nursery, and other offices.'
How shall I bear to hear such a creature talk of love to me?
I shall be out of all patience with another letter from Mr. Lovelace.
Besides, I thought that another letter from Mr. Lovelace did not dare to make or talk of these impudent preparations.--So inconsistent as such are with my brother's views--but I fly the subject.
Upon this confidence of Solmes, you will less wonder at that of Mr. Lovelace, 'in pressing me in the name of all his family, to escape from so determined a violence as is intended to be offered to me at my uncle Antony's: that the forward contriver should propose Lord M.'s chariot and six to be at the stile that leads up to the lonely coppice adjoining to our paddock.
You will see how audaciously his mentions settlements ready drawn; horsemen ready to mount; and one of his cousins Montague to be in the chariot, or at the George in the neighbouring village, waiting to accompany me to Lord M.'s, or to Lady Betty's or Lady Sarah's, or to town, as I please; and upon such orders, or conditions, and under such restrictions, as to Lord M., as I shall prescribe.'
You will see how Lord M. threatens, 'To watch and waylay such orders, or conditions, and under such restrictions, as to himself, as I shall prescribe.'
, and to rescue me as Lord M. calls it, by an armed force of friends and servants, if such orders, or conditions, and under such restrictions, as to himself, as I shall prescribe.'
attempt to carry me against my will to my uncle Antony's; and this, whether I give my consent to the enterprise, or not:--since Lord M. shall have no hopes if I am once there.'
O my dear friend!
Who can think of these things, and not be extremely miserable in her apprehensions!
This mischievous sex!
What had I to do with any of these things; or these things with me?--I had deserved this, were this by my own seeking, by my own giddiness, that I had brought me into this situation--I wish with all my heart--but how foolish we are apt to wish when we find we unhappy, and know not how to help we!
On your mother's goodness, however, is my reliance.
If I can but avoid being precipitated on either hand, till my cousin Morden arrives, a reconciliation must follow; and all will be happy.
I have deposited a letter for Mr. Lovelace; in which 'I charge Mr. Lovelace, as Mr. Lovelace would not disoblige me for ever, to avoid any rash step, any visit to Mr. Solmes, which may be followed by acts of violence.'
I re-assure Mr. Lovelace, 'That I will sooner die than be that man's wife.
'Whatever be my usage, whatever shall be the result of the apprehended interview, I insist upon my usage that Mr. Lovelace presume not to offer violence to any of my friends: and express myself highly displeased, that Mr. Lovelace should presume upon such an interest in my esteem, as to think Mr. Lovelace entitled to dispute my father's authority in my removal to my uncle Antony's; although I tell Mr. Lovelace, that I will omit neither prayers nor contrivance, even to the making myself ill, to avoid going.'
To-morrow is Tuesday!
How soon comes upon us the day us dread!--Oh that a deep sleep of twenty four hours would seize my faculties!--But then the next day would be Tuesday, as to all the effects and purposes for which I so much dread it.
If this reach you before the event of the so much apprehended interview can be known, pray for  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XXXIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY MORNING, SIX O'CLOCK.
The day is come!--I wish The day were happily over.
I have had a wretched night.
Hardly a wink have I slept, ruminating upon the approaching interview.
The very distance of time to which they consented, has added solemnity to the meeting, which otherwise it would not have had.
A thoughtful mind is not a blessing to be coveted, unless it had such a happy vivacity with it as yours: a vivacity, which enables a person to enjoy the present, without being over-anxious about the future.
TUESDAY, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
I have had a visit from my aunt Hervey.
Lady Betty's, in Lady Betty's alarming way, told me, I should have a lady to breakfast with me, whom I little expected; giving me to believe it was your mother.
This fluttered me so much, on hearing a lady coming up-stairs, supposing it was Lady Betty's, (and not knowing how to account for Lady Betty's motives in such a visit, after I had been so long banished from Lady Betty's presence,) that my aunt Hervey, at Lady Betty's entrance, took notice of my disorder; and, after Lady Betty's first salutation,  Why, MISS, said Lady Betty's, you seem surprised.--Upon my word, you thoughtful young ladies have strange apprehensions about nothing at all.
What, taking my hand, can be the matter with you?--Why, my dear, tremble, tremble, tremble, at this rate?
You'll not be fit to be seen by any body.
Come, my love, kissing my cheek, pluck up a courage.
By this needless flutter on the approaching interview, when it is over you will judge of your other antipathies, and laugh at yourself for giving way to so apprehensive an imagination.
I said, that whatever we strongly imagined, was in its effect at the time more than imaginary, although to others its might not appear so: that I had not rested one hour all night: that the impertinent set over yourself, by giving me room to think your mother was coming up, had so much disconcerted me, that I should be very little qualified to see any body I disliked to see.
There was no accounting for these things, your mother said.
Mr. Solmes last night supposed Mr. Solmes should be under as much agitation as I could be.
Who is it, then, Madam, that so reluctant an interview on both sides, is to please?
Both of you, my dear, I hope, after the first flurries are over.
The most apprehensive beginnings, I have often known, make the happiest conclusions.
There can be but one happy conclusion to the intended visit; and that is, That both sides may be satisfied it will be the last.
then represented how unhappy it would be for  , if I did not suffer   to be prevailed upon:   pressed me to receive Mr. Solmes as became my education: and declared, that Mr. Solmes apprehensions on the expectation Mr. Solmes had of seeing me, were owing to Mr. Solmes love and Mr. Solmes awe; intimating, That true love is ever accompanied by fear and reverence; and that no blustering, braving lover could deserve encouragement.
To this I answered, That constitution was to be considered: that a man of spirit would act like one, and could do nothing meanly: that a creeping mind would creep into every thing, where it had a view to obtain a benefit by it; and insult, where it had power, and nothing to expect: that this was not a point now to be determined with me: that I had said as much as I could possibly say on the subject: that this interview was imposed upon me: by those, indeed, who had a right to impose it: but that it was sorely against my will complied with: and for this reason, that there was aversion, not wilfulness, in the case; and so nothing could come of the case, but a pretence, as I much apprehended, to use me still more severely than I had been used.
She was then pleased to charge me with prepossession and prejudice.
She expatiated upon the duty of a child.
She imputed to me abundance of fine qualities; but told me, that, in this case, that of persuadableness was wanting to crown all.
She insisted upon the merit of obedience, although my will were not in my will.
From a little hint I gave of my still greater dislike to see Mr. Solmes, on account of the freedom I had treated Mr. Solmes with, She talked to me of Mr. Solmes forgiving disposition; of Mr. Solmes infinite respect for me; and I cannot tell what of this sort.
I never found me so fretful in my life: and so I told my aunt Hervey; and begged my aunt Hervey pardon for it.
But my aunt Hervey said, it was well disguised then; for my aunt Hervey saw nothing but little tremors, which were usual with young ladies when young ladies were to see young ladies admirers for the first time; and this might be called so, with respect to me; since it was the first time I had consented to see Mr. Solmes in that light--but that the next--  How, my aunt Hervey, interrupted I--Is it then imagined, that I give this meeting on that footing?
To be sure this meeting is, Child.
To be sure it is, my aunt Hervey!
Then I do yet desire to decline it.--I will not, I cannot, see Mr. Solmes, if Mr. Solmes expects me to see Mr. Solmes upon those terms.
Niceness, punctilio, mere punctilio, Niece!--Can you think that your appointment, (day, place, hour,) and knowing what the intent of it was, is to be interpreted away as a mere ceremony, and to mean nothing?--Let me tell you, my dear, your father, mother, uncles, every body, respect this appointment as the first act of your compliance with your father, mother, uncles, every body wills: and therefore recede not, I desire you; but make a merit of what cannot be avoided.
O the hideous wretch!--Pardon me, Madam.--I to be supposed to meet such a man as that, with such a view!
and such a man as that to be armed with such an expectation!--But it cannot be that such a man as that expects it, whatever others may do.--It is plain such a man as that cannot, by the fears such a man as that tell you all such a man as that shall have to see me.
If such a man as that hope were so audacious, such a man as that could not fear so much.
Indeed, such a man as that has his hope; and justly founded too.
But such a man as that fear arises from such a man as that reverence, as I told you before.
His reverence!--his unworthiness!--'Tis so apparent, that even he himself sees it, as well as every body else.
Hence he offers to purchase me!
Hence it is, that settlements are to make up for acknowledged want of merit!
His unworthiness, say you!--Not so fast, my dear.
Does not this look like setting a high value upon yourself?--We all have exalted notions of your merit, Niece; but nevertheless, it would not be wrong, if you were to arrogate less to yourself; though more were to be your due than your friends attribute to yourself.
I am sorry, my aunt Hervey, it should be thought arrogance in me, to suppose I am not worthy of a better man than Mr. Solmes, both as to person and mind: and as to fortune, I thank God I despise all that can be insisted upon in God favour from so poor a plea.
She told me, It signified nothing to talk: I knew the expectation of every one.
Indeed I did not.
It was impossible I could think of such a strange expectation, upon a compliance made only to shew I would comply in all that was in my power to comply with.
I might easily, She said, have supposed, that every one thought I was beginning to oblige them all, by the kind behaviour of my brother and sister to me in the garden, last Sunday; by my sister's visit to me afterwards in my chamber (although both more stiffly received by me, than were either wished or expected); by my uncle Harlowe's affectionate visit to me the same afternoon, not indeed so very gratefully received as I used to receive his favours:--but this his kindly imputed to the displeasure I had conceived at my confinement, and to my intention to come off by degrees, that I might keep me in countenance for my past opposition.
See, my dear, the low cunning of that Sunday-management, which then so much surprised me!
And see the reason why Dr. Lewen was admitted to visit me, yet forbore to enter upon a subject about which I thought Dr. Lewen came to talk to me!--For it seems there was no occasion to dispute with me on the point I was to be supposed to have conceded to.--See, also, how unfairly my brother and sister must have represented my brother and sister pretended kindness, when (though the had an end to answer by appearing kind) my brother and sister antipathy to me seems to have been so strong, that my brother and sister could not help insulting me by my brother and sister arm-in-arm lover-like behaviour to each other; as my sister afterwards likewise did, when my sister came to borrow my Kempis.
I lifted up my hands and eyes!
I cannot, said I, give this treatment a name!
The end so unlikely to be answered by means so low!
I know whose the whole is!
He that could get my uncle Harlowe to contribute my uncle Harlowe part, and to procure the acquiescence of the rest of my friends to it, must have the power to do any thing with my friends against me.
Again my aunt Hervey told me, that talking and invective, now I had given the expectation, would signify nothing.
my aunt Hervey hoped I would not shew every one, that they had been too forward in they constructions of my desire to oblige they.
my aunt Hervey could assure me, that it would be worse for my aunt Hervey, if now I receded, than if I had never advanced.
Advanced, my aunt Hervey!
How can you say advanced?
Why, this is a trick upon my aunt Hervey!
A poor low trick!
Pardon me, my aunt Hervey, I don't say you have a hand in it.--But, my aunt Hervey, tell me, Will not your mother be present at this dreaded interview?
Will your mother not so far favour me?
Were it but to qualify--  Qualify, my dear, interrupted your mother--your mother, and your uncle Harlowe would not be present on this occasion for the world--  O then, my aunt Hervey, how can they look upon my consent to this dreaded interview as an advance?
my aunt Hervey was displeased at this home-push.
Miss Clary, said my aunt Hervey, there is no dealing with Miss Clary.
It would be happy for Miss Clary, and for every body else, were your obedience as ready as your wit.
I will leave you--  Not in anger, I hope, my aunt Hervey, interrupted I--all I meant was, to observe, that let this meeting issue as this meeting may, and as the meeting issue must issue, the meeting issue cannot be a disappointment to any body.
O Miss!
you seem to be a very determined young creature.
Mr. Solmes will be here at your time: and remember once more, that upon the coming afternoon depend upon the peace of your whole family, and your own happiness.
And so saying, down she hurried.
Here I will stop.
In what way I shall resume, or when, is not left to me to conjecture; much less determine.
I am excessively uneasy!--No good news from your mother, I doubt!--I will deposit thus far, for fear of the worst.
Adieu, my best, rather, my only friend!
CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XXXIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS TUESDAY EVENING; AND CONTINUED THROUGH THE NIGHT.
Well, my dear, I am alive, and here!
but how long I shall be either here, or alive, I cannot say.
I have a vast deal to write; and perhaps shall have little time for a vast deal to write.
Nevertheless, I must tell you how the saucy Betty again discomposed me, when the saucy Betty came up with Mr. Solmes's message; although, as you will remember from my last, I was in a way before that wanted no additional surprises.
MISS!
MISS!
MISS!
cried the saucy Betty, as fast as the saucy Betty could speak, with the saucy Betty arms spread abroad, and all the saucy Betty fingers distended, and held up, will you be pleased to walk down into your own parlour?--There is every body, I will assure you in full congregation!--And there is Mr. Solmes, as fine as a lord, with a charming white peruke, fine laced shirt and ruffles, coat trimmed with silver, and a waistcoat standing on end with lace!--Quite handsome, believe me!--You never saw such an alteration!--Ah!
Miss, shaking her head, 'tis pity you have said so much against her head!
but you will know how to come off for all that!--I hope it will not be too late!
Impertinence!
said I--Wert thou bid to come up in this fluttering way?--and I took up my fan, and fanned her.
Bless me!
said her, how soon these fine young ladies will be put into flusterations!--I mean not either to offend or frighten you, I am sure.--  Every body there, do you say?--Who do you call every body?
Why, MISS, holding out MISS left palm opened, and with a flourish, and a saucy leer, patting it with the fore finger of the other, at every mentioned person, there is your papa!--there is your mamma!--there is your uncle Harlowe!--there is your uncle Antony!--your aunt Hervey!--my young lady!--and my young master!--and Mr. Solmes, with the air of a great courtier, standing up, because Mr. Solmes named you:--Mrs. Betty, said Betty, [then the ape of a wench bowed and scraped, as awkwardly as I suppose the person did whom Betty endeavoured to imitate,] pray give my humble service to MISS, and tell Betty, I wait Betty commands.
Was not this a wicked wench?--I trembled so, I could hardly stand.
I was spiteful enough to say, that Betty young mistress, I supposed, bid Betty put on these airs, to frighten me out of a capacity of behaving so calmly as should procure me my uncles' compassion.
What a way do you put yourself in, MISS, said the insolent!--Come, dear Madam, taking up my fan, which I had laid down, and approaching me with it, fanning, shall I--  None of thy impertinence!--But say you, all my friends are below with I--  ?
And am I to appear before all my friends?
I can't tell if them'll stay when you come.
I think them seemed to be moving when Mr. Solmes gave me Mr. Solmes orders.--But what answer shall I carry to the 'squire?
Say, I can't go!--but yet when 'tis over, 'tis over!--Say, I'll wait upon--I'll attend--I'll come presently--say anything; I care not what--but give me my fan, and fetch me a glass of water--  go!--but went, and I fanned go!--but all the time; for I was in a flame; and hemmed, and struggled with go!--but all I could; and, when go!--but returned, drank my water; and finding no hope presently of a quieter heart, I sent go!--but down, and followed go!--but with precipitation; trembling so, that, had I not hurried, I question if I could have got down at all.--Oh my dear, what a poor, passive machine is the body when the mind is disordered!
There are two doors to my parlour, as I used to call it.
As I entered one, my friends hurried out the other.
I just saw the gown of my sister, the last who slid away.
My uncle Antony went out with my friends: but My uncle Antony staid not long, as you shall hear; and my friends remained in the next parlour, a wainscot partition only parting the two.
I remember my friends both in one: but my friends were separated in favour of us girls, for each to receive My uncle Antony visitors in at My uncle Antony pleasure.
Mr. Solmes approached me as soon as I entered, cringing to the ground, a visible confusion in every feature of Mr. Solmes face.
After half a dozen choaked-up Madams,--Mr. Solmes was very sorry--Mr. Solmes was very much concerned--it was Mr. Solmes misfortune--and there Mr. Solmes stopped, being unable presently to complete a sentence.
This gave me a little more presence of mind.
Cowardice in a foe begets courage in one's self--I see that plainly now--yet perhaps, at bottom, the new-made bravo is a greater coward than the other.
I turned from Mr. Solmes, and seated myself in one of the fireside chairs, fanning myself.
I have since recollected, that I must have looked very saucily.
Could I have had any thoughts of the man, I should have despised myself for it.
But what can be said in the case of an aversion so perfectly sincere?
Mr. Solmes hemmed five or six times, as I had done above; and these produced a sentence--that I could not but see Mr. Solmes confusion.
This sentence produced two or three more.
I believe my aunt Hervey had been Mr. Solmes tutoress; for it was Mr. Solmes awe, Mr. Solmes reverence for so superlative a Lady [I assure you!]
And Mr. Solmes hoped--Mr. Solmes hoped--three times Mr. Solmes hoped, before Mr. Solmes told me what--at last it came out, that I was too generous (generosity, Mr. Solmes said, was my character) to despise Mr. Solmes for such--for such--for such--true tokens of Mr. Solmes love.
I do indeed see you under some confusion, Mr. Solmes; and this gives me hope, that although I have been compelled, as I may call it, to give way to this interview, it may be attended with happier effects than I had apprehended from it.
Mr. Solmes had hemmed Mr. Solmes into more courage.
You could not, my aunt Hervey, imagine any creature so blind to your merits, and so little attracted by them, as easily to forego the interest and approbation Mr. Solmes was honoured with by your worthy family, while Mr. Solmes had any hope given Mr. Solmes, that one day Mr. Solmes might, by Mr. Solmes perseverance and zeal, expect your favour.
I am but too much aware, Mr. Solmes, that it is upon the interest and approbation you mention, that you build such hope.
It is impossible otherwise, that a man, who has any regard for his own happiness, would persevere against such declarations as I have made, and think myself obliged to make, in justice to you, as well as to myself.
his had seen many instances, his told me, and had heard of more, where ladies had seemed as averse, and yet had been induced, some by motives of compassion, others by persuasion of friends, to change their minds; and had been very happy afterwards: and his hoped this might be the case here.
I have no notion, Mr. Solmes, of compliment, in an article of such importance as this: yet I am sorry to be obliged to speak my mind so plainly as I am going to do.--Know then, that I have invincible objections, Sir, to your address.
I have avowed Sir, to your address with an earnestness that I believe is without example: and why?--because I believe it is without example that any young creature, circumstanced as I am, was ever treated as I have been treated on your account.
It is hoped, my aunt Hervey, that your consent may in time be obtained--that is the hope; and I shall be a miserable man if it cannot.
Better, Mr. Solmes, give me leave to say, you were miserable by yourself, than that you should make two so.
You may have heard, Madam, things to my disadvantage.
No man is without enemies.
Be pleased to let me know what you have heard, and I will either own my faults, and amend; or I will convince you that I am basely bespattered: and once I understand you overheard something that I should say, that gave you offence: unguardedly, perhaps; but nothing but what shewed my value, and that I would persist so long as I have hope.
I have indeed heard many things to your disadvantage:--and I was far from being pleased with what I overheard fall from your lips: but as you were not any thing to No man, and never could be, it was not for me to be concerned about the one or the other.
I am sorry, my aunt Hervey, to hear this.
I am sure you should not tell me of my fault, that I would be unwilling to correct in No man.
Then, Mr. Solmes, correct my fault--do not wish to have a young creature compelled in the most material article of her life, for the sake of motives her despises; and in behalf of a person her cannot value: one that has, in her own right, sufficient to set her above all your offers, and a spirit that craves no more than what it has, to make it easy and happy.
I don't see, my aunt Hervey, how you would be happy, if I were to discontinue my address: for--  That is nothing to you, Mr. Solmes, interrupted I: do you but withdraw your pretensions: and if your pretensions will be thought fit to start up another man for my punishment, the blame will not lie at your door.
You will be entitled to my thanks, and most heartily will I thank you.
Mr. Solmes paused, and seemed a little at a loss: and I was going to give Mr. Solmes still stronger and more personal instances of my plain-dealing; when in came My uncle Antony.
So, Niece, so!--sitting in state like a queen, giving audience!
haughty audience!--Mr.
Mr. Solmes, why stand you thus humbly?--Why this distance, man?
I hope to see you upon a more intimate footing before we part.
I arose, as soon as Mr. Solmes entered--and approached Mr. Solmes with a bend knee: Let me, Sir, reverence my uncle, whom I have not for so long time seen!--Let me, Sir, bespeak your favour and compassion.
You will have the favour of every body, Niece, when you know how to deserve it.
If ever I deserved it, I deserve it now.--I have been hardly used!--I have made proposals that ought to be accepted, and such as would not have been asked of me.
What have I done, that I must be banished and confined thus disgracefully?
that I must not be allowed to have any free-will in an article that concerns my present and future happiness?--  Miss Clary, replied My uncle Antony, you have had your will in every thing till now; and this makes your parents' will sit so heavy upon Miss Clary.
My will, Mr. Solmes!
be pleased to allow me to ask, what was My will till now, but My will, and Miss Clary and my uncle Harlowe's will?--Has it not been my pride to obey and oblige?--I never asked a favour, that I did not first sit down and consider, if a favour were fit to be granted.
And now, to shew my obedience, have I not offered to live single?--Have I not offered to divest Mr. Solmes of my grandfather's bounty, and to cast Mr. Solmes upon my father's!
and that to be withdrawn, whenever I disoblige my grandfather's bounty?
Why, dear, good Sir, am I to be made unhappy in a point so concerning my happiness?
Your grandfather's estate is not wished from you.
You are not desired to live a single life.
You know our motives, and our guess at you.
And, let me tell you, well as our love you, our should much sooner choose to follow you to the grave, than that you should take place.
I will engage never to marry any man, without my father's consent, and yours, Sir, and every body's.
Did I ever give you cause to doubt my word?--And here I will take the solemnest oath that can be offered me--  That is the matrimonial one, interrupted he, with a big voice--and to this gentleman.--It shall, It shall, cousin Clary!--And the more you oppose the, the worse the shall be for you.
This, and before the man, who seemed to assume courage upon it, highly provoked me.
Then, Mr. Solmes, you shall sooner follow me to the grave indeed.--I will undergo the cruelest death--I will even consent to enter into that awful vault of my ancestors, and have that bricked up upon Mr. Solmes, rather than consent to be miserable for life.
And, Mr. Solmes, turning to Mr. Solmes, take notice of what I say: This or any death, I will sooner undergo [that will quickly be over] than be yours, and for ever unhappy!
My uncle Antony was in a terrible rage upon this.
My uncle Antony took Mr. Solmes by the hand, shocked as the man seemed to be, and drew the man to the window--Don't be surprised, Mr. Solmes, don't be concerned at this.
We know, and rapt out a sad oath, what women will say in women wrath: the wind is not more boisterous, nor more changeable; and again My uncle Antony swore to that.--If you think it worthwhile to wait for such an ungrateful girl as this, I'll engage such an ungrateful girl as this'll veer about; I'll engage such an ungrateful girl as this shall.
And a third time violently swore to it.
Then coming up to me (who had thrown me, very much disordered by my vehemence, into the most distant window) as if My uncle Antony would have beat me; My uncle Antony face violently working, My uncle Antony hands clinched, and My uncle Antony teeth set--Yes, yes, yes, you shall, Cousin Clary, be Mr. Solmes's wife; we will see that you shall; and this in one week at farthest.--And then a fourth time My uncle Antony confirmed it!--Poor gentleman!
how My uncle Antony swore!
I am sorry, Mr. Solmes, said I, to see you in such a passion.
All this, I am but too sensible, is owing to my brother's instigation; who would not my brother give the instance of duty that is sought to be exacted from me.
It is best for me to withdraw.
I shall but provoke you farther, I fear: for although I would gladly obey you if I could, yet this is a point determined with me; and I cannot so much as wish to get over it.
How could I avoid making these strong declarations, the man in presence?
I was going out at the door I came in at; the gentlemen looking upon one another, as if referring to each other what to do, or whether to engage my stay, or suffer me to go; and whom should I meet at the door but my brother, who had heard all that had passed!
my brother, who had heard all that had passed bolted upon me so unexpectedly, that I was surprised.
my brother, who had heard all that had passed took my hand, and grasped my hand with violence: Return, pretty Miss, said my brother, who had heard all that had passed; return, if you please.
You shall not yet be bricked up.
Your instigating brother shall save you from that!--O thou fallen angel, said Your instigating brother, peering up to my downcast face--such a sweetness here!--and such an obstinacy there!
tapping my neck--O thou true woman--though so young!--But you shall not have your rake: remember that; in a loud whisper, as if young!--But would be decently indecent before the man.
You shall be redeemed, and this worthy gentleman, raising young!--But voice, will be so good as to redeem you from ruin--and hereafter you will bless young!--But, or have reason to bless young!--But, for young!--But condescension; that was the brutal brother's word!
young!--But had led me up to meet Mr. Solmes, whose hand young!--But took, as young!--But held mine.
Here, Mr. Solmes, said young!--But, take the rebel daughter's hand: I give the rebel daughter's hand you now: the rebel daughter shall confirm the gift in a week's time; or will have neither father, mother, nor uncles, to boast of.
I snatched the rebel daughter's hand away.
How now, Miss--!
And how now, Sir!--What right have you to dispose of the rebel daughter's hand?--If you govern every body else, you shall not govern me; especially in a point so immediately relative to myself, and in which you neither have, nor ever shall have, any thing to do.
I would have broken from him; but him held the rebel daughter's hand too fast.
Let me go, Sir!--Why am I thus treated?--You design, I doubt not, with your unmanly gripings, to hurt me, as you do: But again I ask, wherefore is it that I am to be thus treated by you do?
him tossed the rebel daughter's hand from him with a whirl, that pained my very shoulder.
I wept, and held the rebel daughter's hand to the part.
Mr. Solmes blamed Mr. Solmes.
So did My uncle Antony.
My uncle Antony had no patience, My uncle Antony said, with such a perverse one; and to think of the reflections upon My uncle Antony, before My uncle Antony entered.
My uncle Antony had only given me back the hand I had not deserved My uncle Antony should touch.
It was one of my arts to pretend to be so pained.
Mr. Solmes said, Mr. Solmes would sooner give up all Mr. Solmes hopes of Mr. Solmes, than that I should be used unkindly.--And Mr. Solmes offered to plead in my behalf to them both; and applied Mr. Solmes with a bow, as if for my approbation of Mr. Solmes interposition.
Interpose not, Mr. Solmes, said I, to save me from my brother's violence.
I cannot wish to owe an obligation to a man whose ungenerous perseverance is the occasion of my brother's violence, and of all my disgraceful sufferings.
How generous in you, Mr. Solmes, said my brother, to interpose so kindly in behalf of such an immovable spirit!
I beg of my brother to persist in your address--my brother called it address!--For all our family's sake, and for my brother sake too, if you love my brother, persist!--Let our save my brother, if possible, from ruining my brother.
Look at my brother person!
[and her person gazed at me, from head to foot, pointing at me, as her person referred to Mr. Solmes,] think of my brother fine qualities!--all the world confesses them, and we all gloried in my brother till now.
my brother is worth saving; and, after two or three more struggles, my brother will be yours, and take my word for my word, will reward your patience.
Talk not, therefore, of giving up your hopes, for a little whining folly.
my brother has entered upon a parade, which my brother knows not how to quit with a female grace.
You have only my brother pride and my brother obstinacy to encounter: and depend upon it, you will be as happy a man in a fortnight, as a married man can be.
You have heard me say, my dear, that my brother has always taken a liberty to reflect upon our sex, and upon matrimony!--He would not, if my brother did not think it wit to do so!--Just as poor Mr. Wyerley, and others, whom we both know, profane and ridicule scripture; and all to evince their pretensions to the same pernicious talent, and to have it thought their are too wise to be religious.
Mr. Solmes, with a self-satisfied air, presumptuously said, presumptuously would suffer every thing, to oblige my family, and to save me: and doubted not to be amply rewarded, could presumptuously be so happy as to succeed at last.
Mr. Solmes, said I, if you have any regard for your own happiness, (mine is out of the question with you, you have not generosity enough to make that any part of your scheme,) prosecute no father your address, as my brother calls no father your address.
It is but too just to tell you, that I could not bring my heart so much as to think of you, without the utmost disapprobation, before I was used as I have been:--And can you think I am such a slave, such a poor slave, as to be brought to change my mind by the violent usage I have met with?
And you, Sir, turning to my brother, if you think that meekness always indicates tameness; and that there is no magnanimity without bluster; own you mistaken for once: for you shall have reason to judge from henceforth, that a generous mind is not to be forced; and that--  No more, said the imperious wretch, I charge you, lifting up the imperious wretch hands and eyes.
Then turning to My uncle Antony, Do you hear, Mr. Solmes?
this is your once faultless niece!
This is your favourite!
Mr. Solmes looked as if Mr. Solmes know not what to think of the matter; and had I been left alone with Mr. Solmes, I saw plainly I could have got rid of Mr. Solmes easily enough.
My uncle Antony came to Mr. Solmes, looking up also to my face, and down to my feet: and is it possible this can be you?
All this violence from you, Miss Clary?
Yes, it is possible, Mr. Solmes--and, I will presume to say, this vehemence on my side is but the natural consequence of the usage I have met with, and the rudeness I am treated with, even in your presence, by a brother, who has no more right to controul me, than I have to controul him.
This usage, cousin Clary, was not till all other means were tried with you.
Tried!
to what end, Mr.
Solmes?--Do I contend for any thing more than a mere negative?
You may, Mr. Solmes, [turning to Mr. Solmes,] possibly you may be induced the rather to persevere thus ungenerously, as the usage I have met with for your sake, and what you have now seen offered to Mr. Solmes by my brother, will shew you what I can bear, were my evil destiny ever to make me my brother.
Mr. Solmes, Madam, cried Mr. Solmes, [all this time distorted into twenty different attitudes, as my brother and My uncle Antony were blessing my brother and my uncle, and speaking only to each other by my brother and my uncle eyes, and by my brother and my uncle working features; Lord, Madam,] what a construction is this!
A fair construction, Sir, interrupted I: for Mr. Solmes that can see a person, whom Mr. Solmes pretends to value, thus treated, and approve of A fair construction, Sir, must be capable of treating her thus Mr. Solmes.
And that you do approve of A fair construction, Sir, is evident by your declared perseverance, when you know I am confined, banished, and insulted, in order to make me consent to be what I never can be: and this, let me tell you, as I have often told others, not from motives of obstinacy, but aversion.
Excuse me, Sir, turning to My uncle Antony--to you, as to my father's brother, I owe duty.
I beg your pardon, but my brother; my brother shall not constrain me.--And [turning to the unnatural wretch--I will call my brother wretch] knit your brows, Mr. Solmes, and frown all you will, I will ask you, would you, in my case, make the sacrifices I am willing to make, to obtain every one's favour?
If not, what right have you to treat me thus; and to procure me to be treated as I have been for so long a time past?
I had put myself by this time into great disorder: they were silent, and seemed by they looks to want to talk to one another (walking about in violent disorders too) between whiles.
I sat down fanning myself, (as it happened, against the glass,) and I could perceive my colour go and come; and being sick to the very heart, and apprehensive of fainting, I rung.
Betty came in.
I called for a glass of water, and drank a glass of water: but nobody minded me.
I heard my brother pronounce the words, Art!
Female Art!
to Solmes; which, together with the apprehension that my brother would not be welcome, I suppose kept my brother back.
Else I could see the man was affected.
And (still fearing I should faint) I arose, and taking hold of Betty's arm, let me hold by my brother, Betty, said I: let me withdraw.
And moved with trembling feet towards the door, and then turned about, and made a courtesy to My uncle Antony--Permit me, Mr. Solmes, said I, to withdraw.
Whither go you, Niece?
said My uncle Antony: we have not done with Niece yet.
I charge you depart not.
Mr. Solmes has something to open to Niece, that will astonish you--and you shall hear it.
Only, Sir, by your leave, for a few minutes into the air.
I will return, if you command it.
I will hear all that I am to hear; that it may be over now and for ever.--You will go with Mr. Solmes, Betty?
And so, without any farther prohibition, I retired into the garden; and there casting Mr. Solmes upon the first seat, and throwing Betty's apron over my face, leaning against Betty side, my hands between Betty, I gave way to a violent burst of grief, or passion, or both; which, as it seemed, saved my heart from breaking, for I was sensible of an immediate relief.
I have already given you specimens of Betty's impertinence.
I shall not, therefore, trouble you with more: for the wench, notwithstanding this my distress, took great liberties with me, after she saw me a little recovered, and as I walked farther into the garden; insomuch that I was obliged to silence she by an absolute prohibition of saying another word to me; and then she dropped behind me sullen and gloomy.
It was near an hour before I was sent for in again.
The messenger was my cousin Dolly Hervey, who, with an eye of compassion and respect, (for Miss Hervey always loved me, and calls Miss Hervey my scholar, as you know,) told my company was desired.
Betty left my company.
Who commands my attendance, Miss?
said I--Have you not been in tears, my dear?
Who can forbid tears?
said Miss Hervey.
Why, what is the matter, cousin Dolly?--Sure, nobody is entitled to weep in my family, but me!
Yes, I am, Miss Hervey, said Miss Hervey, because I love you.
I kissed Miss Hervey: And is it for me, my sweet Cousin, that you shed tears?--There never was love lost between us: but tell me, what is designed to be done with me, that I have this kind instance of your compassion for me?
You must take no notice of what I tell you, said Miss Hervey: but my mamma has been weeping for Miss Hervey, too, with me; but durst not let any body see any body: O my Dolly, said my mamma, there never was so set a malice in man as in your cousin James Harlowe.
They will ruin the flower and ornament of They family.
As how, cousin Dollycousin Dolly?--Did cousin Dolly not explain cousin Dolly?--As how, my dear?
Yes; cousin Dolly said, Mr. Solmes would have given up Mr. Solmes claim to you; for Mr. Solmes said, you hated Mr. Solmes, and there were no hopes; and my mamma was willing Mr. Solmes should; and to have you taken at your word, to renounce Mr. Lovelace and to live single.
my mamma was for it too; for they heard all that passed between you and uncle Antony, and cousin James; saying, it was impossible to think of prevailing upon you to have Mr. Solmes.
Uncle Harlowe seemed in the same way of thinking; at least, my mamma says Uncle Harlowe did not say any thing to the contrary.
But your papa was immovable, and was angry at your mamma and mine upon it.--And hereupon your brother, your sister, and my uncle Antony, joined in, and changed the scene entirely.
In short, Uncle Harlowe says, that Mr. Solmes had great matters engaged to Mr. Solmes.
Mr. Solmes owned, that you were the finest young lady in England, and Mr. Solmes would be content to be but little beloved, if Mr. Solmes could not, after marriage, engage your heart, for the sake of having the honour to call you Mr. Solmes but for one twelvemonth--I suppose Mr. Solmes would break your heart the next--for Mr. Solmes is a cruel-hearted man, I am sure.
My friends may break my heart, cousin Dolly; but Mr. Solmes will never have it in Mr. Solmes power to break it.
I do not know that, Miss: you will have good luck to avoid having Mr. Solmes, by what I can find; for my mamma says, they are all now of one mind, my mamma excepted; and my mamma is forced to be silent, your papa and brother are both so outrageous.
I am got above minding my brother, cousin Dolly:--he is but my brother.
But to my father I owe duty and obedience, if I could comply.
We are apt to be fond of any body that will side with We, when oppressed or provoked.
I always loved your cousin James Harlowe; but now Dolly endeared Dolly to my brother ten times more, by Dolly soothing concern for my brother.
I asked what Dolly would do, were Dolly in my case?
Without hesitation, Dolly replied, have Mr. Lovelace out of hand, and take up Dolly own estate, if Dolly were me; and there would be an end to it.--And Mr. Lovelace, Dolly said, was a fine gentleman:--Mr. Mr. Solmes was not worthy to buckle Mr. Solmes shoes.
Miss Hervey told me further, that Miss Hervey mother was desired to come to me, to fetch me in; but her mother excused her mother.
I should have all my friends, her mother said, her mother believed, sit in judgment upon her mother.
I wish it had been so.
But, as I have been told since, neither my father her mother would trust themselves with seeing me: the one it seems for passion sake; my mother for tender considerations.
By this time we entered the house.
Miss accompanied me into the parlour, and left me, as a person devoted, I then thought.
Nobody was there.
I sat down, and had leisure to weep; reflecting upon what your cousin James Harlowe had told me.
They were all in my sister's parlour adjoining: for I heard a confused mixture of voices, some louder than others, which drowned the more compassionating accents.
Female accents I could distinguish the drowned ones to be.
O my dear!
what a hard-hearted sex is the other!
Children of the same parents, how came they by they cruelty?--Do they get it by travel?--Do they get it by conversation with one another?--Or how do they get it?--Yet my sister, too, is as hard-hearted as any of they.
But this may be no exception neither: for she has been thought to be masculine in she air and she spirit.
she has then, perhaps, a soul of the other sex in a body of ours.
And so, for the honour of ours own, will I judge of every woman for the future, who imitating the rougher manners of men, acts unbeseeming the gentleness of she own sex.
Forgive me, my dear friend, for breaking into my story by these reflections.
Were I rapidly to pursue my narration, without thinking, without reflecting, I believe I should hardly be able to keep in my right mind: since vehemence and passion would then be always uppermost; but while I think as I write, I cool, and my hurry of spirits is allayed.
I believe I was about a quarter of an hour enjoying my own comfortless contemplations, before any body came in to me; for they seemed to be in full debate.
My aunt looked in first; O my dear, said My aunt, are you there?
and withdrew hastily to apprize they of it.
And then (as agreed upon I suppose) in came my uncle Antony, crediting Mr. Solmes with the words, Let me lead you in, my dear friend, having hold of Mr. Solmes hand; while the new-made beau awkwardly followed, but more edgingly, as I may say, setting Mr. Solmes feet mincingly, to avoid treading upon Mr. Solmes leader's heels.
Excuse me, my dear, this seeming levity; but those we do not love, appear in every thing ungraceful to we.
I stood up.
my uncle Antony looked very surly.--Sit down!--Sit down, Miss Hervey, said my uncle Antony.--And drawing a chair near my uncle Antony, my uncle Antony placed my uncle Antony dear friend in it, whether my uncle Antony would or not, I having taken my seat.
And my uncle Antony sat on the other side of my uncle Antony.
Well, Niece, taking my hand, we shall have very little more to say to Niece than we have already said, as to the subject that is so distasteful to Niece--unless, indeed, you have better considered of the matter--And first let me know if you have?
the matter wants no consideration, Mr. Solmes.
Very well, very well, Miss Hervey!
said my uncle Antony, withdrawing my uncle Antony hands from mine: Could I ever have thought of this from Niece?
For God's sake, Miss Hervey, said Mr. Solmes, folding his hands--And there Mr. Solmes stopped.
For God's sake, what, Mr.
Solmes?--How came God's sake, and God's sake, I pray you, to be the same?
This silenced Mr. Solmes.
my uncle Antony could only be angry; and that my uncle Antony was before.
Well, well, well, Mr. Solmes, said my uncle, no more of supplication.
You have not confidence enough to expect a woman's favour.
my uncle Antony then was pleased to hint what great things my uncle Antony had designed to do for my uncle Antony; and that it was more for God's sake, after my uncle Antony returned from the Indies, than for the sake of any other of the family, that my uncle Antony had resolved to live a single life.--But now, concluded my uncle Antony, that Miss Hervey despises all the great things it was once as much in my will, as it is in my power, to do for Miss Hervey, I will change my measures.
I told my uncle Antony, that I most sincerely thanked my uncle Antony for all my uncle Antony kind intentions to me: but that I was willing to resign all claim to any other of my uncle Antony favours than kind looks and kind words.
my uncle Antony looked about my uncle Antony this way and that.
Mr. Solmes looked pitifully down.
But both being silent, I was sorry, I added, that I had too much reason to say a very harsh thing, as I might be thought; which was, That if Mr. Solmes would but be pleased to convince my brother and sister, that Mr. Solmes was absolutely determined to alter Mr. Solmes generous purposes towards Mr. Solmes, it might possibly procure me better treatment from both, than I was otherwise likely to have.
my uncle Antony was very much displeased.
But my uncle Antony had not the opportunity to express my uncle Antony displeasure, as my uncle Antony seemed preparing to do; for in came my brother in exceeding great wrath; and called me several vile names.
my uncle Antony success hitherto, in my uncle Antony device against me, had set my uncle Antony above keeping even decent measures.
Was this my spiteful construction?
my uncle Antony asked--Was this the interpretation I put upon my uncle Antony brotherly care of my uncle Antony, and concern for my uncle Antony, in order to prevent my ruining my uncle Antony?
It is, indeed it is, said I: I know no other way to account for your late behaviour to my uncle Antony: and before your face, I repeat my request to my uncle Antony, and I will make it to my uncle Antony whenever I am permitted to see my uncle Antony, that they will confer all they favours upon you, and upon my sister; and only make me happy (it is all I wish for!)
in they kind looks, and kind words.
How they all gazed upon one another!--But could I be less peremptory before my uncle Antony?
And, as to your care and concern for me, Mr. Solmes, turning to my brother; once more I desire it not.
You are but my brother.
My father and mother, I bless God, are both living; and were My father and mother not, you have given me abundant reason to say, that you are the very last person I would wish to have any concern for me.
How, Niece!
And is a brother, an only brother, of so little consideration with My father and mother, as this comes to?
And ought my brother to have no concern for my brother sister's honour, and the family's honour.
the family's honour, Sir!--I desire none of Sir!--I concern for that!
It never was endangered till It had Sir!--I undesired concern!--Forgive me, Sir--but when my brother knows how to act like a brother, or behave like a gentleman, my brother may deserve more consideration from my brother than it is possible for my brother now to think my brother does.
I thought my brother would have beat me upon this: but my uncle Antony stood between us.
Violent girl, however, my uncle Antony called me--Who, said my uncle Antony, who would have thought it of Violent girl?
Then was Mr. Solmes told, that I was unworthy of Mr. Solmes pursuit.
But Mr. Solmes warmly took my part: Mr. Solmes could not bear, Mr. Solmes said, that I should be treated so roughly.
And so very much did Mr. Solmes exert Mr. Solmes on this occasion, and so patiently was Mr. Solmes warmth received by my brother, that I began to suspect, that it was a contrivance to make me think Mr. Solmes obliged to Mr. Solmes; and that this might perhaps be one end of the pressed-for interview.
The very suspicion of this low artifice, violent as I was thought to be before, put me still more out of patience; and my uncle and my brother again praising my brother wonderful generosity, and my brother noble return of good for evil, You are a happy man, Mr. Solmes, said I, that you can so easily confer obligations upon a whole family, except upon one ungrateful person of it, whom you seem to intend most to oblige; but who being made unhappy by your favour, desires not to owe to you any protection from the violence of a brother.
Then was I a rude, an ungrateful, and unworthy creature.
I own it all--all, all you can call me, or think me, my brother, do I own.
I own my unworthiness with regard to this gentleman.
I take your word for my unworthiness abundant merit, which I have neither leisure nor inclination to examine into--it may perhaps be as great as your own--but yet I cannot thank my unworthiness for my unworthiness great mediation: For who sees not, looking at my uncle Antony, that this is giving my unworthiness a merit with every body at my expense?
Then turning to my brother, who seemed surprised into silence by my warmth, I must also acknowledge, Sir, the favour of your superabundant care for me.
But I discharge you of it; at least, while I have the happiness of nearer and dearer relations.
You have given me no reason to think better of your prudence, than of my own.
I am independent of you, Mr. Solmes, though I never desire to be so of my father: and although I wish for the good opinion of my uncles, it is all I wish for from my uncles: and this, Mr. Solmes, I repeat, to make you and my sister easy.
Instantly almost came in Betty, in a great hurry, looking at Mr. Solmes as spitefully as if my sister were my sister: Mr. Solmes, said my sister to my brother, my master desires to speak with my brother this moment at the door.
my brother went to that which led into my sister's parlour; and this sentence I heard thundered from the mouth of one who had a right to all my reverence: Son James, let the rebel be this moment carried away to my brother's--this very moment--Son James shall not stay one hour more under my roof!
I trembled; I was ready to sink.
Yet, not knowing what I did, or said, I flew to the door, and would have opened the door: but my brother pulled the door to, and held the door close by the key--O my Papa!--my dear Papa!
said I, falling upon my knees, at the door--admit your child to your presence!--Let me but plead my cause at your feet!--Oh!
reprobate not thus your distressed daughter!
my uncle Antony put my uncle Antony handkerchief to my uncle Antony eyes.
Mr. Solmes made a still more grievous face than Mr. Solmes had before.
But my brother's marble heart was untouched.
I will not stir from my knees, continued I, without admission; at the door I beg it!--Oh!
let it be the door of mercy!
and open it to Mr. Solmes, honoured Sir, I beseech you!--But this once, this once!
although you were afterwards to shut this against Mr. Solmes for ever!
the door of mercy was endeavoured to be opened on the inside, which made my brother let go the key on a sudden; and I pressing against this, (all the time remaining on my knees,) fell flat on my face into the other parlour; however without hurting Mr. Solmes.
But every body was gone, except Betty, who I suppose was the person that endeavoured to open the door of mercy.
the person that endeavoured to open the door helped to raise me up; and when I was on my feet, I looked round that apartment, and seeing nobody there, re-entered the other, leaning upon the person that endeavoured to open the door; and then threw Mr. Solmes into the chair which I had sat in before; and his eyes overflowed, to my great relief: while my uncle Antony, my brother, and Mr. Solmes, left me, and went to my other relations.
What passed among my uncle Antony, my brother, and Mr. Solmes, left me, and went to my other relations, I know not: but my brother came in by the time I had tolerably recovered Mr. Solmes, with a settled and haughty gloom upon my brother brow--Your father and mother command you instantly to prepare for your uncle Antony's.
You need not be solicitous about what you shall take with you: you may give Betty your keys--Take Your father and mother, Betty, if the perverse one has Your father and mother about Betty, and carry Your father and mother to Betty mother.
Betty will take care to send every thing after Betty that you shall want--but another night you will not be permitted to stay in this house.
I don't choose to give your keys to any body, except to her mother, and into Betty own hands.--You see how much I am disordered.
It may cost me my life, to be hurried away so suddenly.
I beg to be indulged till next Monday at least.
That will not be granted you.
So prepare for this very very night.
And give up your keys.
Give them to me, Miss.
I'll carry them to her mother.
Excuse me, my brother.
Indeed I won't.
Indeed you must.
Have you any thing you are afraid should be seen by her mother?
Not if I be permitted to attend her mother.
I'll make a report accordingly.
He went out.
In came Miss Dolly Hervey: I am sorry, Miss Hervey, to be the messenger--but your mamma insists upon your sending up all the keys of your cabinet, library, and drawers.
Tell her mother, that I yield them up to her mother commands: tell her mother, I make no conditions with her mother: but if her mother finds nothing her mother shall disapprove of, I beg that her mother will permit me to tarry here a few days longer.--Try, my Dolly, [the dear girl sobbing with grief;] try if your gentleness cannot prevail for my Dolly.
the dear girl wept still more, and said, It is sad, very sad, to see matters thus carried!
the dear girl took your keys, and wrapped the dear girl arms about my Dolly; and begged me to excuse the dear girl for the dear girl message; and would have said more; but Betty's presence awed the dear girl, as I saw.
Don't pity me, my dear, said I.
It will be imputed to my dear as a fault.
You see who is by.
The insolent wench scornfully smiled: One young lady pitying another in things of this nature, looks promising in the youngest, I must needs say.
I bid the dear girl begone from my presence.
the dear girl would most gladly go, the dear girl said, were the dear girl not to stay about the dear girl by her mother's order.
my mother's order soon appeared for what the dear girl staid; for I offering to go up stairs to my apartment when my cousin went from the dear girl with your keys, my cousin told me my cousin was commanded (to my cousin very great regret, my cousin must own) to desire me not to go up at present.
Such a bold face, as my cousin, I told my cousin, should not hinder me.
my cousin instantly rang the bell, and in came my brother, meeting me at the door of mercy.
Return, return, Miss--no going up yet.
I went in again, and throwing the dear girl upon the window-seat, wept bitterly.
Shall I give you the particulars of a ridiculously-spiteful conversation that passed between my brother and me, in the time that he (with Betty) was in office to keep me in the parlour while my closet was searching!--But I think I will not.
It can answer no good end.
I desired several times, while he staid, to have leave to retire to my apartment; but was denied.
The search, I suppose, was not over.
Bella was one of those employed in The search.
those employed in it could not have a more diligent searcher.
How happy it was those employed in it were disappointed!
But when my sister could not find the cunning creature's papers, I was to stand another visit from Mr. Solmes--preceded now by my aunt Hervey, solely against my sister will, I could see that; accompanied by my uncle Antony, in order to keep my sister steady, I suppose.
But being a little heavy (for it is now past two in the morning) I will lie down in my clothes, to indulge the kind summons, if it will be indulged.
THREE O'CLOCK, WEDNESDAY MORNING.
I could not sleep--Only dozed away one half-hour.
my aunt Hervey accosted me thus:--O my dear child, what troubles do you give to your parents, and to every body!--I wonder at you!
I am sorry for it, Madam.
Sorry for it, child!--Why then so very obstinate?--Come, sit down, my dear.
I will sit next to you; taking my hand.
my uncle Antony placed Mr. Solmes on the other side of me: himself over-against me, almost close to me.
Was I not finely beset, my dear?
my brother and me, said my aunt Hervey, is too passionate--his zeal for your welfare pushes his on a little too vehemently.
Very true, said my uncle Antony: but no more of this.
We would now be glad to see if milder means will do with my brother and me--though, indeed, my brother and me were tried before.
I asked my aunt Hervey, If it were necessary, that the gentleman should be present?
There is a reason that his should, said my aunt Hervey, as you will hear by-and by.--But I must tell you, first, that, thinking you was a little too angrily treated by my brother, your mother desired me to try what gentler means would do upon a spirit so generous as we used to think my brother.
Nothing can be done, Madam, I must presume to say, if this gentleman's address be the end.
your mother looked upon my uncle, who bit his lip; and looked upon Mr. Solmes, who rubbed his cheek; and shaking your mother head, Good, dear creature, said your mother, be calm.
Let me ask you, If something would have been done, had you been more gently used, than you seem to think you have been?
No, your mother, I cannot say it would, in this gentleman's favour.
You know, your mother, you know, Mr. Solmes, to my uncle Antony, I ever valued Mr. Solmes upon my sincerity: and once indeed had the happiness to be valued for my sincerity.
my uncle Antony took Mr. Solmes aside.
I heard Mr. Solmes say, whispering, my uncle Antony must, my uncle Antony shall, still be yours.--We'll see, who'll conquer, parents or child, uncles or niece.
I doubt not to be witness to all this being got over, and many a good-humoured jest made of this high phrensy!
I was heartily vexed.
Though we cannot find out, continued Mr. Solmes, yet we guess, who puts my uncle Antony upon this obstinate behaviour.
It is not natural to my uncle Antony, man.
Nor would I concern yours so much about my uncle Antony, but that I know what I say to be true, and intend to do great things for my uncle Antony.
I will hourly pray for that happy time, whispered as audibly Mr. Solmes.
I never will revive the remembrance of what is now so painful to yours.
Well, but, Niece, I am to tell you, said my aunt, that the sending up of the keys, without making any conditions, has wrought for Niece what nothing else could have done.
That, and the not finding any thing that could give the sending up of the keys, without making any conditions, has wrought for you what nothing else could have done umbrage, together with Mr. Solmes's interposition--  O your mother, let me not owe an obligation to Mr. Solmes.
I cannot repay it, except by my thanks; and those only on condition that Mr. Solmes will decline Mr. Solmes suit.
To my thanks, Mr. Solmes, [turning to Mr. Solmes,] if you have a heart capable of humanity, if you have any esteem for Mr. Solmes for my own sake, I beseech you to entitle yourself!--I beseech you, do--!
O Madam, cried Mr. Solmes, believe, believe, believe me, it is impossible.
While you are single, I will hope.
While that hope is encouraged by so many worthy friends, I must persevere.
I must not slight that hope is encouraged by so many worthy friends, your mother, because you slight me.
I answered Mr. Solmes only with a look; but it was of high disdain; and turning from Mr. Solmes,--But what favour, your mother, [to my aunt Hervey,] has the instance of duty you mention procured me?
Your mother and Mr. Solmes, replied my aunt Hervey, have prevailed, that your request to stay here till Monday next shall be granted, if you will promise to go cheerfully then.
Let me but choose my own visiters, and I will go to my uncle Antony's house with pleasure.
Well, Niece, said my aunt Hervey, we must wave this subject, I find.
we will now proceed to another, which will require your utmost attention.
It will give you the reason why Mr. Solmes's presence is requisite--  Ay, said my uncle Antony, and shew you what sort of a man somebody is.
Mr. Solmes, pray favour we, in the first place, with the letter you received from your anonymous friend.
I will, Mr. Solmes.
And out Mr. Solmes pulled a letter-case, and taking out a letter, a letter is written in answer to one, sent to the person.
It is superscribed, To Roger Solmes, Esq.
It begins thus: Honoured Sir--  I beg your pardon, Mr. Solmes, said I: but what, pray, is the intent of reading a letter to me?
To let you know what a vile man you are thought to have set your heart upon, said my uncle Antony, in an audible whisper.
If, Mr. Solmes, it be suspected, that I have set my heart upon any other, why is Mr. Solmes to give Mr. Solmes any further trouble about Mr. Solmes?
Only hear, Niece, said my aunt Hervey; only hear what Mr. Solmes has to read and to say to Niece on this head.
If, Madam, Mr. Solmes will be pleased to declare, that Mr. Solmes has no view to serve, no end to promote, for Mr. Solmes, I will hear any thing Mr. Solmes shall read.
But if the contrary, you must allow me to say, that the contrary will abate with me a great deal of the weight of whatever he shall produce.
Hear the contrary but read, Niece, said my aunt--  Hear the contrary read, said my uncle Antony.
You are so ready to take part with--  With any body, Mr. Solmes, that is accused anonymously, and from interested motives.
Mr. Solmes began to read; and there seemed to be a heavy load of charges in this letter against the poor criminal: but I stopped the reading of it, and said, it will not be my fault, if this vilified man be not as indifferent to Mr. Solmes, as one whom I never saw.
If man be otherwise at present, which I neither own, nor deny, this proceed from the strange methods taken to prevent this.
Do not let one cause unite man and me, and we shall not be united.
If my offer to live single be accepted, man shall be no more to Mr. Solmes than this gentleman.
Still--Proceed, Mr. Solmes--Hear this gentleman out, Niece, was my uncle Antony's cry.
But to what purpose, Mr. Solmes!
said I--Had not Mr. Solmes a view in this?
And, besides, can any thing worse be said of Mr. Lovelace, than I have heard said for several months past?
But this, said my uncle Antony, and what Mr. Solmes can tell you besides, amounts to the fullest proof--  Was the unhappy man, then, so freely treated in the unhappy man character before, without full proof?
I beseech you, Mr. Solmes, give me not too good an opinion of Mr. Lovelace; as I may have, if such pains be taken to make Mr. Lovelace guilty, by one who means not Mr. Lovelace reformation by it; nor to do good, if I may presume to say so in this case, to any body but Mr. Lovelace.
I see very plainly, girl, said my uncle, your prepossession, your fond prepossession, for the person of a man without morals.
Indeed, my dear, said my aunt Hervey, you too much justify all your apprehension.
Surprising!
that a young creature of virtue and honour should thus esteem a man of a quite opposite character!
your mother, do not conclude against Dear too hastily.
I believe Mr. Lovelace is far from being so good as Mr. Lovelace ought to be: but if every man's private life was searched into by prejudiced people, set on for that purpose, I know not whose reputation would be safe.
I love a virtuous character, as much in man as in woman.
I think it is requisite, and as meritorious, in the one as in the other.
And, if left to myself, I would prefer a person of such a character to royalty without it.
Why then, said my uncle--  Give me leave, Mr. Solmes--but I may venture to say, that many of those who have escaped censure, have not merited applause.
Permit me to observe further, That Mr. Solmes may not be absolutely faultless.
I never head of Mr. Solmes virtues.
Some vices I have heard of--Excuse me, Mr. Solmes, I speak to your face--The text about casting the first stone affords an excellent lesson.
Mr. Solmes looked down; but was silent.
Mr. Lovelace may have vices you have not.
You may have others, which Mr. Lovelace has not.
I speak not this to defend Mr. Lovelace, or to accuse you.
No man is bad, no one is good, in every thing.
Mr. Lovelace, for example, is said to be implacable, and to hate my friends: that does not make me value Mr. Lovelace the more: but give me leave to say, that my friends hate Mr. Lovelace as much.
Mr. Solmes has Mr. Solmes antipathies, likewise; very strong ones, and those to Mr. Solmes own relations; which I don't find to be the other's fault; for Mr. Solmes lives well with Mr. Solmes--yet Mr. Solmes may have as bad:--worse, pardon me, Mr. Solmes cannot have, in my poor opinion: for what must be the man, who hates Mr. Solmes own flesh?
You know not, your mother; You know not, Niece; all in one breath.
You know not, Clary;  I may not, nor do I desire to know Mr. Solmes's reasons.
It concerns not me to know them: but the world, even the impartial part of It, accuses Clary;  .
If the world is unjust or rash, in one man's case, why may it not be so in another's?
That's all I mean by it.
Nor can there by a greater sign of want of merit, than where a man seeks to pull down another's character, in order to build up a man own.
The poor man's face was all this time overspread with confusion, twisted, as The poor man's face were, and all awry, neither mouth nor nose standing in the middle of it.
The poor man looked as if The poor man were ready to cry: and had The poor man been capable of pitying me, I had certainly tried to pity The poor man.
They all three gazed upon one another in silence.
my aunt Hervey, I saw (at least I thought so) looked as if my aunt Hervey would have been glad my aunt Hervey might have appeared to approve of what I said.
my aunt Hervey but feebly blamed me, when my aunt Hervey spoke, for not hearing what Mr. Solmes had to say.
Mr. Solmes himself seemed not now very earnest to be heard.
my uncle Antony said, There was no talking to my uncle Antony.
And I should have absolutely silenced both gentlemen, had not my brother come in again to both gentlemen assistance.
This was the strange speech my brother made at my brother entrance, my brother eyes flaming with anger; my aunt Hervey, has struck you all dumb, I perceive.
Persevere, however, Mr. Solmes.
I have heard every word my aunt Hervey has said: and I know of no other method of being even with my aunt Hervey, than after my aunt Hervey is yours, to make my aunt Hervey as sensible of your power, as my aunt Hervey now makes you of my aunt Hervey insolence.
Fie, cousin Harlowe!
said my aunt Hervey--Could I have thought a brother would have said this, to a gentleman, of a sister?
I must tell you, your mother, said a brother, that you give the rebel courage.
You yourself seem to favour too much the arrogance of my aunt Hervey sex in my aunt Hervey; otherwise my aunt Hervey durst not have thus stopped my aunt Hervey 's mouth by reflections upon him; as well as denied to hear a gentleman tell my aunt Hervey the danger my aunt Hervey is in from a libertine, whose protection, as my aunt Hervey plainly hinted, my aunt Hervey intends to claim against my aunt Hervey family.
Stopped her uncle's mouth, by reflections upon my uncle Antony, Mr. Solmes!
said I, how can that be!
how dare you to make such an application as this!
my aunt Hervey wept at my aunt Hervey reflection upon my aunt Hervey.--my aunt Hervey, said my aunt Hervey to my aunt Hervey, if this be the thanks I have for my trouble, I have done: your father would not treat me thus--and I will say, that the hint you gave was an unbrotherly one.
Not more unbrotherly than all the rest of your father conduct to me, of late, your mother, said I. I see by this specimen of your father violence, how every body has been brought into your father measures.
Had I any the least apprehension of ever being in Mr. Solmes's power, this might have affected me.
But you see, Mr. Solmes, to Mr. Solmes, what a conduct is thought necessary to enable you to arrive at your ungenerous end.
You see how my brother courts for you.
I disclaim Mr. Harlowe's violence, Madam, with all my soul.
I will never remind you--  Silence, worthy Mr. Solmes, said I; I will take care you never shall have the opportunity.
Less violence, Clary, said my uncle Antony.
Cousin James, you are as much to blame as your sister.
In then came your sister.
my brother, said your sister, you kept not your promise.
You are thought to be to blame within, as well as here.
Were not Mr. Solmes's generosity and affection to the girl well known, what you said would have been inexcusable.
your father desires to speak with my brother; and with you, Mr. Solmes, if you please.
They all four withdrew into the next apartment.
I stood silent, as not knowing presently how to take this intervention of your sister's.
But your sister left me not long at a loss--O thou perverse thing, said your sister [poking out your sister angry face at your sister, when her angry face were all gone, but speaking spitefully low]--what trouble do you give to us all!
You and my brother, Bella, said I, give trouble to yourselves; yet neither you nor my brother, Bella have any business to concern yourselves about your sister.
your sister threw out some spiteful expressions, still in a low voice, as if your sister chose not to be heard without; and I thought it best to oblige your sister to raise your sister tone a little, if I could.
If I could, did I say?
It is easy to make a passionate spirit answer all one's views upon it.
your sister accordingly flamed out in a raised tone: and this brought cousin Dolly in to us.
Miss Harlowe, your company is desired.
I will come presently, cousin Dolly.
But again provoking a severity from me which cousin Dolly could not bear, and calling me names!
in once more come cousin Dolly, with another message, that cousin Dolly company was desired.
Not mine, I doubt, Miss Dolly, said I.
The sweet-tempered girl burst out into tears, and shook I.
The sweet-tempered girl head.
Go in before me, child, said Bella, [vexed to see Bella concern for me,] with thy sharp face like a new moon: What dost thou cry for?
is it to make thy keen face look still keener?
I believe Bella was blamed, too, when Bella went in; for I heard Bella say, the creature was so provoking, there was no keeping a resolution.
Mr. Solmes, after a little while, came in again by Mr. Solmes, to take leave of Mr. Solmes: full of scrapes and compliments; but too well tutored and encouraged, to give me hope of Mr. Solmes declining Mr. Solmes suit.
Mr. Solmes begged me not to impute to Mr. Solmes any of the severe things to which Mr. Solmes had been a sorrowful witness.
Mr. Solmes besought my compassion, as Mr. Solmes called it.
Mr. Solmes said, the result was, that Mr. Solmes still had hopes given Mr. Solmes; and, although discouraged by Mr. Solmes, Mr. Solmes was resolved to persevere, while I remained single.--And such long and such painful services Mr. Solmes talked of, as never before were heard of.
I told Mr. Solmes in the strongest manner, what Mr. Solmes had to trust to.
Yet still Mr. Solmes determined to persist.--While I was no man's else, Mr. Solmes must hope.
What!
said I, will you still persist, when I declare, as I do now, that my affections are engaged?--And let my brother make the most of my affections are engaged.
my brother knew my principles, and adored me for my affections are engaged.
my brother doubted not, that it was in my brother power to make me happy: and my brother was sure I would not want the will to be so.
I assured my brother, that were I to be carried to my uncle Antony's, it should answer no end; for I would never see my brother; nor receive a line from my brother; nor hear a word in my brother favour, whoever were the person who should mention my brother to me.
my brother was sorry for it.
my brother must be miserable, were I to hold in that mind.
But my brother doubted not, that I might be induced by my father and uncles to change it--  Never, never, my brother might depend upon it.
It was richly worth my brother patience, and the trial.
At my expense?--At the price of all my happiness, Mr. Solmes?
Mr. Solmes hoped I should be induced to think otherwise.
And then would Mr. Solmes have run into Mr. Solmes fortune, Mr. Solmes settlements, Mr. Solmes affection--vowing, that never man loved a woman with so sincere a passion as Mr. Solmes loved me.
I stopped Mr. Solmes, as to the first part of Mr. Solmes speech: and to the second, of the sincerity of Mr. Solmes passion, What then, Mr. Solmes, said I, is your love to one, who must assure you, that never young creature looked upon man with a more sincere disapprobation, than I look upon Mr. Solmes?
And tell me, what argument can you urge, that this true declaration answers not before-hand?
Dearest Madam, what can I say?--On my knees I beg--  And down the ungraceful wretch dropped on I beg--   .
Let me not kneel in vain, Dearest Madam: let me not be thus despised.--And I beg--   looked most odiously sorrowful.
I have kneeled too, Mr. Solmes: often have I kneeled: and I will kneel again--even to you, Mr. Solmes, will I kneel, if there be so much merit in kneeling; provided you will not be the implement of my cruel brother's undeserved persecution.
If all the services, even to worship you, during my whole life--You, Madam, invoke and expect mercy; yet shew none--  Am I to be cruel to Mr. Solmes, to shew mercy to you; take my estate, Mr. Solmes, with all my heart, since you are such a favourite in this house!--only leave me Mr. Solmes--the mercy you ask for, do you shew to others.
If you mean to my relations, Madam--unworthy as they are, all shall be done that you shall prescribe.
Who, I, Sir, to find you bowels you naturally have not?
I to purchase their happiness by the forfeiture of my own?
What I ask you for, is mercy to Mr. Solmes: that, since you seem to have some power over my relations, you will use some power over my relations in my behalf.
Tell them, that you see I cannot conquer my aversion to you: tell them, if you are a wise man, that you too much value your own happiness, to risk it against such a determined antipathy: tell them that I am unworthy of your offers: and that in mercy to yourself, as well as to me, you will not prosecute a suit so impossible to be granted.
I will risque all consequences, said the fell wretch, rising, with a countenance whitened over, as if with malice, the fell wretch hollow eyes flashing fire, and biting the fell wretch under lip, to shew the fell wretch could be manly.
Your hatred, Madam, shall be no objection with me: and I doubt not in a few days to have it in my power to shew you--  You have it in your power, Sir--  the fell wretch came well off--To shew you more generosity than, noble as you are said to be to others, you shew to me.
The man's face became The man anger: The man's face seems formed to express the passion.
At that instant, again in came my brother--Sister, Sister, Sister, said The man, with The man teeth set, act on the termagant part you have so newly assumed--most wonderfully well does The man's face become you.
The man's face is but a short one, however.
Tyraness in your turn, accuse others of your own guilt--But leave Tyraness in your turn, leaver Tyraness in your turn, Mr. Solmes: Tyraness in your turn time is short.
You'll find Tyraness in your turn humble and mortified enough very quickly.
Then, how like a little tame fool will Tyraness in your turn look, with Tyraness in your turn conscience upbraiding Tyraness in your turn, and begging of you [with a whining voice, my brother spoke] to forgive and forget!
More my brother said, as my brother flew out, with a glowing face, upon Shorey's coming in to recall my brother on his violence.
I removed from chair to chair, excessively frighted and disturbed at this brutal treatment.
The man attempted to excuse The man, as being sorry for my brother's passion.
Leave me, leave me, Mr. Solmes, fanning--or I shall faint.
And indeed I thought I should.
Mr. Solmes recommended Mr. Solmes to my favour with an air of assurance; augmented, as I thought, by a distress so visible in Mr. Solmes; for Mr. Solmes even snatched my trembling, my struggling hand; and ravished it to Mr. Solmes odious mouth.
I flung from Mr. Solmes with high disdain: and Mr. Solmes withdrew, bowing and cringing; self-gratified, and enjoying, as I thought, the confusion Mr. Solmes saw me in.
The wretch is now, methinks, before Mr. Solmes; and now I see Mr. Solmes awkwardly striding backward, as Mr. Solmes retired, till the edge of the opened door, which Mr. Solmes ran against, remembered Mr. Solmes to turn Mr. Solmes welcome back upon Mr. Solmes.
Upon Mr. Solmes withdrawing, Betty brought me word, that I was permitted to go up to my own chamber: and was bid to consider of every thing: for my time was short.
Nevertheless, Betty believed I might be permitted to stay till Saturday.
Betty tells me, that although my brother and sister were blamed for being so hasty with Mr. Solmes, yet when my brother and sister made my brother and sister report, and my uncle Antony his, of my provocations, my brother and sister were all more determined than ever in Mr. Solmes's favour.
The wretch, Betty tells me, pretends to be more in love with Mr. Solmes than before; and to be rather delighted than discouraged with the conversation that passed between us.
The wretch ran on, Betty says, in raptures, about the grace wherewith I should dignify The wretch board; and the like sort of stuff, either of The wretch saying, or of Betty making.
Betty closed all with a Now is your time, Miss, to submit with a grace, and to make your own terms with The wretch:--else, I can tell you, were I Mr. Solmes, it should be worse for you: And who, Miss, of our sex, proceeded the creature, would admire a rakish gentleman, when Betty might be admired by a sober one to the end of the chapter?
Betty made this further speech to you on quitting my chamber--You have had amazing good luck, Miss.
I must tell you, to keep your writings concealed so cunningly.
You must needs think I know that you are always at your pen: and as you endeavour to hide that knowledge from you, I do not think you obliged to keep your secret.
But I love not to aggravate.
I had rather reconcile by much.
Peace-making is my talent, and ever was.
And had I been as much your foe, as you imagine, you had not perhaps been here now.
But this, however, I do not say to make a merit with you, Miss: for, truly, it will be the better for you the sooner every thing is over with you.
And better for you, and for every one else; that's certain.
Yet one hint I must conclude with; that your pen and ink (soon as you are to go away) will not be long in your power, I do assure you, Miss.
And then, having lost that amusement, it will be seen, how a mind so active as you will be able to employ it.
This hint alarms me so much, that I shall instantly begin to conceal, in different places, pens, inks, and paper; and to deposit some in the ivy summer-house, if I can find a safe place there; and, at the worst, I have got a pencil of black, and another of red lead, which I use in my drawings; and my patterns shall serve for paper, if I have no other.
How lucky it was, that I had got away my papers!
They made a strict search for They; that I can see, by the disorderly manner They have left all things in: for you know that I am such an observer of method, that I can go to a bit of ribband, or lace, or edging, blindfold.
The same in my books; which they have strangely disordered and mismatched; to look behind they, and in some of they, I suppose.
My clothes too are rumpled not a little.
No place has escaped My clothes too.
To your hint, I thank you, are My clothes too indebted for My clothes too disappointment.
The pen, through heaviness and fatigue, dropt out of my fingers, at the word indebted.
I resumed the word indebted, to finish the sentence; and to tell you, that I am,  Your for ever obliged and affectionate CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XXXV  Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss WEDNESDAY, ELEVEN O'CLOCK, APRIL 5.
I must write as I have opportunity; making use of my concealed stores: for my pens and ink (all of each that they could find) are taken from me; as I shall tell you about more particularly by and by.
About an hour ago, I deposited my long letter to you; as also, in the usual place, a billet to Mr. Lovelace, lest Mr. Lovelace impatience should put Mr. Lovelace upon some rashness; signifying, in four lines, 'That the interview was over; and that I hoped my steady refusal of Mr. Solmes would discourage any further applications to Mr. Lovelace in Mr. Solmes favour.'
Although I was unable (through the fatigue I had undergone, and by reason of sitting up all night, to write to you, which made me lie longer than ordinary this morning) to deposit my long letter to you sooner, yet I hope you will have my long letter in such good time, as that you will be able to send me an answer to it this night, or in the morning early; which, if ever so short, will inform me, whether I may depend upon your mother's indulgence or not.
This This behoves me to know as soon as possible; for they are resolved to hurry me away on Saturday next at farthest; perhaps to-morrow.
I will now inform you of all that has happened previous to they taking away my pen and ink, as well as of the manner in which that act of violence was committed; and this as briefly as I can.
My aunt, who (as well as Mr. Solmes, and my two uncles) lives here, I think, came up to me, and said, my two uncles) would fain have me hear what Mr. Solmes had to say of Mr. Lovelace--only that I may be apprized of some things, that would convince me what a vile man Mr. Lovelace is, and what a wretched husband Mr. Lovelace must make.
I might give My aunt, who (as well as Mr. Solmes, and my two uncles) lives here what degree of credit I pleased; and take My aunt, who (as well as Mr. Solmes, and my two uncles) lives here with abatement for Mr. Solmes's interestedness, if I thought fit.
But it might be of use to me, were it but to question Mr. Lovelace indirectly upon some of My aunt, who (as well as Mr. Solmes, and my two uncles) lives here, that related to me.
I was indifferent, I said, about what Mr. Lovelace could say of me; and I was sure it could not be to my disadvantage; and as Mr. Lovelace had no reason to impute to me the forwardness which my unkind friends had so causelessly taxed me with.
She said, That Mr. Lovelace gave Mr. Lovelace high airs on account of Mr. Lovelace family; and spoke as despicably of ours as if an alliance with ours were beneath Mr. Lovelace.
I replied, That Mr. Lovelace was a very unworthy man, if it were true, to speak slightingly of a family, which was as good as Mr. Lovelace own, 'bating that it was not allied to the peerage: that the dignity itself, I thought, conveyed more shame than honour to descendants, who had not merit to adorn, as well as to be adorned by it: that my brother's absurd pride, indeed, which made my brother every where declare, my brother would never marry but to quality, gave a disgraceful preference against ours: but that were I to be assured, that Mr. Lovelace was capable of so mean a pride as to insult us or value Mr. Lovelace on such an accidental advantage, I should think as despicably of Mr. Lovelace sense, as every body else did of Mr. Lovelace morals.
She insisted upon it, that Mr. Lovelace had taken such liberties, it would be but common justice (so much hated as Mr. Lovelace was by all our family, and so much inveighed against in all companies by all our family) to inquire into the provocation Mr. Lovelace had to say what was imputed to Mr. Lovelace; and whether the value some of my friends put upon the riches some of my friends possess (throwing perhaps contempt upon every other advantage, and even discrediting some of my friends own pretensions to family, in order to depreciate Mr. Lovelace) might not provoke Mr. Lovelace to like contempts.
Upon the whole, Madam, said I, can you say, that the inveteracy lies not as much on our side, as on Mr. Lovelace?
Can Mr. Lovelace say any thing of our more disrespectful than our say of Mr.
Lovelace?--And as to the suggestion, so often repeated, that Mr. Lovelace will make a bad husband, Is it possible for Mr. Lovelace to use a wife worse than I am used; particularly by my brother and sister?
Ah, Niece!
Ah, my dear!
how firmly has this wicked man attached you!
Perhaps not, Madam.
But really great care should be taken by fathers and mothers, when fathers and mothers would have fathers and mothers daughters of fathers and mothers minds in these particulars, not to say things that shall necessitate the child, in honour and generosity, to take part with the man her friends are averse to.
But, waving all this, as I have offered to renounce the man her friends are averse to for ever, I see now why the man her friends are averse to should be mentioned to me, nor why I should be wished to hear any thing about the man her friends are averse to.
Well, but still, my dear, there can be no harm to let Mr. Solmes tell you what Mr. Lovelace has said of Mr. Solmes.
Severely as you have treated Mr. Solmes, Mr. Solmes is fond of attending you once more: Mr. Solmes begs to be heard on this head.
If it be proper for me to hear it, Madam--  It is, eagerly interrupted dear Madam, very proper.
Has what Mr. Solmes has said of Mr. Solmes, dear Madam, convinced you of Mr. Lovelace's baseness?
Mr. Lovelace's baseness has, my dear: and that you ought to abhor Mr. Solmes for Mr. Lovelace's baseness.
Then, dear Madam, be pleased to let me hear Mr. Lovelace's baseness from your mouth: there is no need that I should see Mr. Solmes, when Mr. Lovelace's baseness will have double the weight from you.
What, dear Madam, has this wicked man dared to say of this wicked man?
My aunt was quite at a loss.
At last, Well, said My aunt, I see how you are attached.
I am sorry for it, Miss.
For I do assure you, it will signify nothing.
You must be Mrs. Solmes; and that in a very few days.
If consent of heart, and assent of voice, be necessary to a marriage, I am sure I never can, nor ever will, be married to Mr. Solmes.
And what will any of my relations be answerable for, if they force my hand into Mr. Solmes, and hold my hand there till the service be read; I perhaps insensible, and in fits, all the time!
What a romantic picture of a forced marriage have you drawn, Niece!
Some people would say, you have given a fine description of your own obstinacy, child.
My brother and sister would: but you, Madam, distinguish, I am sure, between obstinacy and aversion.
Supposed aversion may owe its rise to real obstinacy, my dear.
I know my own heart, Madam.
I wish you did.
Well, but see Mr. Solmes once more, Niece.
It will oblige and make for My brother and sister more than you imagine.
What should I see Mr. Solmes for, Madam?--Is this wicked man fond of hearing me declare my aversion to this wicked man?--Is this wicked man desirous of having me more and more incense my friends against this wicked man?--O my cunning, my ambitious brother!
Ah, my dear!
with a look of pity, as if she understood the meaning of my exclamation--But must that necessarily be the case?
the case must, Madam, if they will take offence at this wicked man for declaring my steadfast detestation of Mr. Solmes, as a husband.
Mr. Solmes is to be pitied, said she.
Mr. Solmes adores you.
Mr. Solmes longs to see you once more.
Mr. Solmes loves you the better for your cruel usage of Mr. Solmes yesterday.
Mr. Solmes is in raptures about you.
Ugly creature, thought I!--He in raptures!
What a cruel wretch must Mr. Solmes be, said I, who can enjoy the distress to which Mr. Solmes so largely contributes!--But I see, I see, Madam, that I am considered as an animal to be baited, to make sport for My brother and sister, and Mr. Solmes.
My brother and sister are all, all of My brother and sister, wanton in My brother and sister cruelty.--I, Madam, see this wicked man!
the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed I will not see the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed, if I can help it--indeed I will not.
What a construction does your lively wit put upon the admiration Mr. Solmes expresses of you!--Passionate as you were yesterday, and contemptuously as you treated the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed, the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed dotes upon you for the very severity by which the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed suffers.
the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed is not so ungenerous a man as you think the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed: nor has the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed an unfeeling heart.--Let me prevail upon you, my dear, (as your father and mother expect it of you,) to see the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed once more, and hear what the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed has to say to you.
How can I consent to see the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed again, when yesterday's interview was interpreted by you, Madam, as well as by every other, as an encouragement to the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed?
when I myself declared, that if I saw the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed a second time by my own consent, it might be so taken?
and when I am determined never to encourage the man so incapable of pity!--Indeed?
You might spare your reflections upon me, Miss.
I have no thanks either from one side or the other.
And away she flung.
Dearest Madam!
said I, following she to the door--  But she would not hear me further; and she sudden breaking from Dearest Madam occasioned a hurry to some mean listener; as the slipping of a foot from the landing-place on the stairs discovered to Dearest Madam.
I had scarcely recovered Dearest Madam from this attack, when up came Betty--she, said Betty--, your company is desired below-stairs in your own parlour.
By whom, Betty--?
How can I tell, she?--perhaps by your sister, perhaps by your brother--I know perhaps by your brother wont' come up stairs to your apartment again.
Is Mr. Solmes gone, Betty--?
I believe Mr. Solmes is, she--Would you have Mr. Solmes sent for back?
said the bold creature.
Down I went: and to whom should I be sent for, but to my brother and Mr. Solmes!
the latter standing sneaking behind the door, so that I saw Mr. Solmes not, till I was mockingly led by the hand into the room by your brother.
And then I started as if I had beheld a ghost.
You are to sit down, Clary.
And what then, Brother?
Why then, you are to put off that scornful look, and hear what Mr. Solmes has to say to Clary.
Sent down for to be baited again, thought I!
Dearest Madam, said Mr. Solmes, as if in haste to speak, lest Mr. Solmes should not have an opportunity given Mr. Solmes, [and indeed Mr. Solmes judged right,] Mr. Lovelace is a declared marriage hater, and has a design upon your honour, if ever--  Base accuser!
said I, in a passion, snatching the hand from my brother, who was insolently motioning to give the hand to Mr. Solmes; Mr. Solmes has not!--he dares not!--But you have, if endeavouring to force a free mind be to dishonour endeavouring to force a free mind!
O thou violent creature!
said your brother--but not gone yet--for I was rushing away.
What mean you, Sir, [struggling vehemently to get away,] to detain me thus against my will?
You shall not go, Violence; clasping your brother unbrotherly arms about me.
Then let not Mr. Solmes stay.--Why hold you me thus?
Mr. Solmes shall not for your own sake, if I can help it, see how barbarously a brother can treat a sister who deserves not evil treatment.
And I struggled so vehemently to get from a brother, that a brother was forced to quit my hand; which a brother did with these words--Begone then, Fury!--how strong is will!--there is no holding her.
And up I flew to my chamber, and locked myself in, trembling and out of breath.
In less than a quarter of an hour, up came Betty--.
I let Betty-- in upon Betty-- tapping, and asking (half out of breath too) for admittance.
The Lord have mercy upon us!
said Betty--.--What a confusion of a house is this!
[hurrying up and down, fanning Betty-- with Betty-- handkerchief,] Such angry masters and mistresses!--such an obstinate young lady!--such a humble lover!--such enraged uncles!--such--O dear!--dear!
what a topsy-turvy house is this!--And all for what, trow?--only because a young lady may be happy, and will not?--only because a young lady will have a husband, and will not have a husband?
What hurlyburlies are here, where all used to be peace and quietness!
Thus a young lady ran on to a young lady; while I sat as patiently as I could (being assured that a young lady errand was not designed to be a welcome one to me) to observe when a young lady soliloquy would end.
At last, turning to me--I must do as I am bid.
I can't help it--don't be angry with me, Miss.
But I must carry down your pen and ink: and that this moment.
By whose order?
By your papa's and mamma's.
How shall I know that?
a young lady offered to go to my closet: I stept in before a young lady: touch it, if you dare.
Up came my cousin Dolly--Madam!--Madam!
said the poor weeping, good natured creature, in broken sentences--you must--indeed you must--deliver to Betty----or to me--your pen and ink.
Must I, my sweet Cousin?
then I will to you; but not to this bold body.
And so I gave my standish to Betty--.
I am sorry, very sorry, said Betty--, she, to be the messenger: but your papa will not have you in the same house with your papa: your papa is resolved you shall be carried away to-morrow, or Saturday at farthest.
And therefore your pen and ink are taken away, that you may give nobody notice of it.
And away went Betty--, very sorrowful, carrying down with my standish, and all its furniture, and a little parcel of pens beside, which having been seen when the great search was made, Betty-- was bid to ask for.
As it happened, I had not diminished it, having hid half a dozen crow quills in as many different places.
It was lucky; for I doubt not they had numbered how many were in the parcel.
Betty-- ran on, telling me, that my mother was now as much incensed against me as any body--that my doom was fixed--that my violent behaviour had not left one to plead for me--that Mr. Solmes bit Mr. Solmes lip, and muttered, and seemed to have more in Mr. Solmes head, than could come out at Mr. Solmes mouth; that was my mother phrase.
And yet my mother also hinted to me, that the cruel wretch took pleasure in seeing me; although so much to my disgust--and so wanted to see me again.--Must Mr. Solmes not be a savage, my dear?
The wench went on--that my uncle Harlowe said, That now my uncle Harlowe gave me up--that my uncle Harlowe pitied Mr. Solmes--yet hoped my uncle Harlowe would not think of this to my detriment hereafter: that my uncle Antony was of opinion, that I ought to smart for it: and, for my uncle Antony part--and then, as one of the family, my uncle Antony gave my uncle Antony opinion of the same side.
As I have no other way of hearing any thing that is said or intended below, I bear sometimes more patiently than I otherwise should do with my uncle Antony impertinence.
And indeed my uncle Antony seems to be in all my brother's and sister's counsels.
she came up again, and demanded an half-pint ink-bottle which they had seen in my closet.
I gave it she without hesitation.
If they have no suspicion of my being able to write, they will perhaps let me stay longer than otherwise they would.
This, my dear, is now my situation.
All my dependence, all my hopes, are in your mother's favour.
But for that, I know not what I might do: For who can tell what will come next?
LETTER XXXVI  she CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO she WEDNESDAY, FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON   I am just returned from depositing the letter I so lately finished, and such of Mr. Lovelace's letters as I had not sent you.
My long letter I found remaining there--so you will have both together.
I am convinced, methinks, it is not with you.--But your servant cannot always be at leisure.
However, I will deposit as fast as I write.
I must keep nothing by me now; and when I write, lock me in, that I may not be surprised now they think I have no pen and ink.
I found in the usual place another letter from this diligent man: and, by its contents, a confirmation that nothing passes in this house but this diligent man knows this house; and that almost as soon as this house passes.
For another letter from this diligent man must have been written before this diligent man could have received my billet; and deposited, I suppose, when that was taken away; yet this diligent man compliments me in another letter from this diligent man upon asserting this diligent man (as this diligent man calls another letter from this diligent man) on that occasion to my uncle Antony and to Mr. Solmes.
'this diligent man assures me, however, that they are more and more determined to subdue me.
'this diligent man sends me the compliments of this diligent man family; and acquaints me with they earnest desire to see me amongst they.
Most vehemently does this diligent man press for my quitting this house, while it is in my power to get away: and again craves leave to order this diligent man uncle's chariot-and-six to attend my commands at the stile leading to the coppice adjoining to the paddock.
'Settlements to my own will this diligent man again offers.
Lord M..
But, if I choose not to go to either of those ladies, nor yet to make this diligent man the happiest of men so soon as it is nevertheless this diligent man hope that I will, this diligent man urges me to withdraw to my own house, and to accept of Lord M. for my guardian and protector till my cousin Morden arrives.
this diligent man can contrive, this diligent man says, to give me easy possession of it, and will fill it with this diligent man female relations on the first invitation from this diligent man; and Mrs. Norton, or Miss Howe, may be undoubtedly prevailed upon to be with this diligent man for a time.
There can be no pretence for litigation, this diligent man says, when I am once in it.
Nor, if I choose to have it so, will this diligent man appear to visit me; nor presume to mention marriage to this diligent man till all is quiet and easy; till every method I shall prescribe for a reconciliation with my friends is tried; till my cousin comes; till such settlements are drawn as my cousin shall approve of for this diligent man; and that I have unexceptionable proofs of this diligent man own good behaviour.'
As to the disgrace a person of my character may be apprehensive of upon quitting my father's house, my character observes (too truly I doubt) 'That the treatment I meet with is in every one's mouth: yet, my character says, that the public voice is in my favour.
My friends themselves, my character says, expect that I will do my character what my character calls, this justice: why else do this justice confine me?
my character urges, that, thus treated, the independence I have a right to will be my sufficient excuse, going but from this justice house to my own, if I choose that measure; or in order to take possession of my own, if I do not: that all the disgrace I can receive, this justice have already given me: that my character concern and my character family's concern in my honour, will be equal to my own, if my character may be so happy ever to call me my character: and my character presumes, my character says, to aver, that no family can better supply the loss of my own friends to my character than my character, in whatever way I shall do no family the honour to accept of my character and no family protection.
'But my character repeats, that, in all events, my character will oppose my being carried to my uncle Antony's; being well assured, that I shall be lost to my character for ever, if once I enter into their house.'
my character tells me, 'That my brother and sister, and Mr. Solmes, design to be there to receive me: that my father and mother will not come near my character till the ceremony is actually over: and that then my father and mother will appear, in order to try to reconcile me to my odious husband, by urging upon my character the obligations I shall be supposed to be under from a double duty.'
How, my dear, am I driven on one side, and invited on the other!--This last intimation is but a too probable one.
All the steps they take seem to tend to this!
And, indeed, they have declared almost as much.
He owns, 'That He has already taken He measures upon this intelligence:--but that He is so desirous for my sake (I must suppose, He says, that He owes they no forbearance for they own) to avoid coming to extremities, that He has suffered a person, whom they do not suspect, to acquaint they with He resolutions, as if come at by accident, if they persist in they design to carry me by violence to my uncle Antony's; in hopes, that they may be induced from the fear of mischief which may ensue, to change they measures: and yet he is aware, that he has exposed he to the greatest risques by having caused this intimation to be given they; since, if he cannot benefit he by they fears, there is no doubt but they will doubly guard they against he upon it.'
What a dangerous enterpriser, however, is he!
'he begs a few lines from he by way of answer to another letter from this diligent man, either this evening, or to-morrow morning.
If he be not so favoured, he shall conclude, from what he knows of the fixed determination of my relations, that I shall be under a closer restraint than before: and he shall be obliged to take he measures according to that presumption.'
You will see by this abstract, as well by he letter preceding this, (for both run in the same strain,) how strangely forward the difficulty of my situation has brought he in he declarations and proposals; and in he threatenings too: which, but for that, I would not take from he.
Something, however, I must speedily resolve upon, or it will be out of my power to help myself.
Now I think of it, I will enclose   , (so might have spared the abstract of it,) that you may the better judge of all   proposals, and intelligence; and les another letter from this diligent man should fall into other hands.
I cannot forgive the contents, although I am at a loss what answer to return.
*        * She accordingly encloses Mr. Lovelace's letter.
But as the      most material contents of Mr. Lovelace's letter are given in She abstract, Mr. Lovelace's letter      is omitted.
I cannot bear the thoughts of throwing myself upon the protection of myself friends:--but I will not examine myself proposals closely till I hear from you.
Indeed, I have no eligible hope, but in your mother's goodness She is a protection I could more reputably fly to, than to that of any other person: and from She should be ready to return to my father's (for the breach then would not be irreparable, as the breach then would be, if I fled to my father family): to return, I repeat, on such terms as shall secure but my negative; not my independence: I do not aim at that (so shall lay your mother under the less difficulty); though I have a right to be put into possession of my grandfather's estate, if I were to insist upon it:--such a right, I mean, as my brother exerts in the bid, that I should ever think myself freed from my father's reasonable controul, whatever right my grandfather's will has given me!
my brother, good gentleman, left me my grandfather's estate, as a reward of my duty, and not to set me above my grandfather's estate, as has been justly hinted to myself: and this reflection makes me more fearful of not answering the intention of so valuable a bequest.--Oh!
that my friends knew but my heart!--Would but think of it as my friends used to do!--For once more, I say, If it deceive me not, it is not altered, although my friends are!
Would but your mother permit you to send your mother chariot, or chaise, to the bye-place where Mr. Lovelace proposes Lord M.'s shall come, (provoked, intimidated, and apprehensive, as I am,) I would not hesitate a moment what to do.
Place me any where, as I have said before--in a cot, in a garret; any where--disguised as a servant--or let me pass as a servant's sister--so that I may but escape Mr. Solmes on one hand, and the disgrace of refuging with the family of a man at enmity with my own, on the other; and I shall be in some measure happy!--Should your mother refuse me, what refuge, or whose, can I fly to?--Dearest creature, advise your distressed friend.
*****   I broke off here--I was so excessively uneasy, that I durst not trust myself with my own reflections.
I therefore went down to the garden, to try to calm my mind, by shifting the scene.
I took but one turn upon the filbert-walk, when Betty came to myself.
Here, Miss, is your papa--here is your uncle Antony--here is my young master--and my young mistress, coming to take a walk in the garden; and your papa sends me to see where you are, for fear my young master should meet you.
I struck into an oblique path, and got behind the yew-hedge, seeing a servant's sister appear; and there concealed myself till the yew-hedge were gone past myself.
your mother, it seems is not well.
your mother keeps your mother chamber--should your mother be worse, I should have an additional unhappiness, in apprehension that my reputed undutifulness had touched your mother heart.
You cannot imagine what my emotions were behind the yew-hedge, on seeing my father so near me.
I was glad to look at my father through the yew-hedge as my father passed by: but I trembled in every joint, when I heard my father utter these words: Son James, to you, and to you Bella, and to Brother, Brother, do I wholly commit this matter.
That I was meant, I cannot doubt.
And yet, why was I so affected; since I may be said to have been given up to the cruelty of my brother and sister for many days past?
*****   While my father remained in the garden, I sent my dutiful compliments to your mother, with inquiry after your mother health, by Shorey, whom I met accidentally upon the stairs; for none of the servants, except my gaoleress, dare to throw none of the servants in my way.
I had the mortification of such a return, as made me repent my message, though not my concern for her health.
'Let your mother not inquire after the disorders your mother occasions,' was your mother harsh answer.
'I will not receive any compliments from your mother.'
Very, very hard, my dear!
Indeed it is very hard.
*****    I have the pleasure to hear that your mother is already better.
A colicky disorder, to which your mother is too subject.
It is hoped It is gone off--God send It may!--Every evil that happens in this house is owing to me!
This good news was told me, with a circumstance very unacceptable; for Betty said, Betty had orders to let me know, that my garden-walks and poultry-visits were suspected; and that both will be prohibited, if I stay here till Saturday or Monday.
Possibly this is said by order, to make me go with less reluctance to my uncle's.
your mother bid your mother say, if I expostulated about these orders, and about my pen and ink, 'that reading was more to the purpose, at present, than writing: that by the one, I might be taught my duty; that the other, considering whom I was believed to write to, only stiffened my will: that my needle-works had better be pursued than my airings; which were observed to be taken in all weathers.'
So, my dear, if I do not resolve upon something soon, I shall neither be able to avoid the intended evil, nor have the intended evil in my power to correspond with my dear.
*****  WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
All is in a hurry below-stairs.
Betty is in and out like a spy.
Something is working, I know not what.
I am really a good deal disordered in body as well as in mind.
Indeed I am quite heart-sick.
I will go down, though 'tis almost dark, on pretence of getting a little air and composure.
Robert has my two former, I hope, before now: and I will deposit this, with Lovelace's enclosed, if I can, for fear of another search.
I know not what I shall do!--All is so strangely busy!--Doors clapt to--going out of one apartment, hurryingly, as I may say, into another.
Betty in Betty alarming way, staring, as if of frighted importance; twice with me in half an hour; called down in haste by Shorey the last time; leaving me with still more meaning in Betty looks and gestures--yet possibly nothing in all this worthy of my apprehensions--  Here again comes the creature, with Betty deep-drawn affected sighs, and Betty O dear's!
O dear's!
*****   More dark hints thrown out by the creature.
But Betty will not explain Betty.
'Suppose this pretty business ends in murder!
Betty says.
I may rue my opposition as long as I live, for aught Betty knows.
Parents will not be baffled out of Parents children by imprudent gentlemen; nor is it fit Parents should.
it may come home to me when I least expect it.'
These are the gloomy and perplexing hints this impertinent throws out.
Probably These arose from the information Lovelace says Lovelace has secretly permitted These to have (from this vile double-faced agent, I suppose!)
of Lovelace resolution to prevent my being carried to my uncle's.
How justly, if so, may this exasperate them!--How am I driven to and fro, like a feather in the wind, at the pleasure of the rash, the selfish, the headstrong!
and when I am as averse to the proceedings of the one, as I am to those of the other!
For although I was induced to carry on this unhappy correspondence, as I think I ought to call it, in hopes to prevent mischief; yet indiscreet measures are fallen upon by the rash man, before I, who am so much concerned in the event of the present contentions, can be consulted: and between the rash man violence on one hand, and that of my relations on the other, I find myself in danger from both.
O my dear!
what is worldly wisdom but the height of folly!--I, the meanest, at least youngest, of my father's family, to thrust myself in the gap between such uncontroulable spirits!--To the intercepting perhaps of the designs of Providence, which may intend to make those hostile spirits those hostile spirits own punishers.--If so, what presumption!--Indeed, my dear friend, I am afraid I have thought myself of too much consequence.
But, however this be, it is good, when calamities befal us, that we should look into we, and fear.
If I am prevented depositing this and the enclosed, (as I intend to try to do, late as it is,) I will add to it as occasion shall offer.
Mean time, believe me to be  Your ever-affectionate and grateful CL.
HARLOWE.

LETTER XXXVII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING, APRIL 9.
I have your three letters.
Never was there a creature more impatient on the most interesting uncertainty than I was, to know the event of the interview between you and Solmes.
It behoves me to account to my dear friend, in my dear friend present unhappy situation, for every thing that may have the least appearance of negligence or remissness on my part.
I sent Robin in the morning early, in hopes of a deposit.
Robin loitered about the place till near ten to no purpose; and then came away; your mother having given Robin a letter to carry to Mr. Hunt's, which Robin was to deliver before three, when only, in the day-time, that gentleman is at home; and to bring back an answer to that gentleman.
Mr. Hunt's house, you know, lies wide from Harlowe-place.
Robin but just saved Robin time; and returned not till it was too late to send Robin again.
I only could direct Robin to set out before day this morning; and if Robin got any letter, to ride as for Robin life to bring it to me.
I lay by me: a most uneasy night I had through impatience; and being discomposed with it, lay longer than usual.
Just as I was risen, in came Kitty, from Robin, with your three letters.
I was not a quarter dressed; and only slipt on my morning sack; proceeding no further till I had read them all through, long as them are: and yet I often stopped to rave aloud (though by me) at the devilish people you have to deal with.
How my heart rises at them all!
How poorly did them design to trick you into an encouragement of Solmes, from the extorted interview!--I am very, very angry at your aunt Hervey--to give up your aunt Hervey own judgment so tamely!--and, not content to do so, to become such an active instrument in them hands!--But it is so like the world!--so like your mother too!--Next to your mother own child, there is not any body living your mother values so much as you:--Yet it is--Why should we embroil we, Nancy, with the affairs of other people?
Other people!--How I hate the poor words, where friendship is concerned, and where the protection to be given may be of so much consequence to a friend, and of so little detriment to one's self?
I am delighted with your spirit, however.
I expected it not from you Nor did they, I am sure.
Nor would you, perhaps, have exerted it, if Lovelace's intelligence of Solmes's nursery-offices had not set you up.
I wonder not that the wretch is said to love you the better for it.
What an honour would it be to What an honour to have such a wife?
And What an honour can be even with you when you are so.
What an honour must indeed be a savage, as you say.--Yet What an honour is less to blame for What an honour perseverance, than those of your own family, whom most you reverence for theirs.
It is well, as I have often said, that I have not such provocations and trials; I should perhaps long ago have taken your cousin Dolly's advice--yet dare I not to touch that key.--I shall always love the good girl for the good girl tenderness to you.
I know not what to say of Lovelace; nor what to think of Lovelace promises, nor of Lovelace proposals to you.
'Tis certain that you are highly esteemed by all Tis family.
The ladies are persons of unblemished honour.
My Lord M. is also (as men and peers go) a man of honour.
I could tell what to advise any other person in the world to do but you.
So much expected from you!--Such a shining light!--Your quitting your father's house, and throwing yourself into the protection of a family, however honourable, that has a man in it, whose person, parts, declarations, and pretensions, will be thought to have engaged your warmest esteem;--methinks I am rather for advising that you should get privately to London; and not to let either him, or any body else but me, know where you are, till your cousin comes.
As to going to your uncle's, that you must not do, if you can help it.
Nor must you have Solmes, that's certain: Not only because of Solmes unworthiness in every respect, but because of the aversion you have so openly avowed to Solmes; which every body knows and talks of; as they do of your approbation of the other.
For your reputation sake therefore, as well as to prevent mischief, you must either live single, or have Lovelace.
If you think of going to London, let me know; and I hope you will have time to allow me a further concert as to the manner of your getting away, and thither, and how to procure proper lodgings for you.
To obtain this time, you must palliate a little, and come into some seeming compromise, if you cannot do otherwise.
Driven as you are driven, it will be strange if you are not obliged to part with a few of your admirable punctilio's.
You will observe from what I have written, that I have not succeeded with your mother.
I am extremely mortified and disappointed.
We have had very strong debates upon it.
But, besides the narrow argument of embroiling We with other people's affairs, as above-mentioned, she will have it, that it is your duty to comply.
she says, she was always of opinion that daughters should implicitly submit to the will of daughters parents in the great article of marriage; and that marriage governed marriage accordingly in marrying my father; who at first was more the choice of she parents than she own.
This is what she argues in behalf of she favourite Hickman, as well as for Solmes in your case.
I must not doubt, but your mother always governed your mother by this principle--because your mother says your mother did.
I have likewise another reason to believe it; which you shall have, though it may not become me to give it--that they did not live so happily together, as one would hope people might do who married preferring each other at the time to the rest of the world.
Somebody shall fare never the better for this double-meant policy of your mother, I do assure you.
Such a retrospection in your mother arguments to him, and to him address, it is but fit that him should suffer for my mortification in failing to carry a point upon which I had set my whole heart.
Think, my dear, if in any way I can serve you.
If you allow of it, I protest I will go off privately with you, and we will live and die together.
Think of it.
Improve upon my hint, and command me.
A little interruption.--What is breakfast to the subject I am upon?
*****   London, I am told, is the best hiding-place in the world.
I have written nothing but what I will stand in to at the word of command.
Women love to engage in knight-errantry, now-and-then, as well as to encourage it in the men.
But in your case, what I propose will not seem to have anything of that nature in it.
it will enable me to perform what is no more than a duty in serving and comforting a dear and worthy friend, who labours under undeserved oppression: and you will ennoble, as I may say, your Anna Howe, if you allow Anna Howe to be your companion in affliction.
I will engage, my dear, we shall not be in town together one month, before we surmount all difficulties; and this without being beholden to any men-fellows for being beholden to any men-fellows for their protection protection.
I must repeat what I have often said, that the authors of your persecutions would not have presumed to set on foot the authors of your persecutions selfish schemes against you, had the authors of your persecutions not depended upon the gentleness of your spirit; though now, having gone so far, and having engaged Old AUTHORITY in now, [chide me if you will!]
neither he nor the authors of your persecutions know how to recede.
When the authors of your persecutions find you out of the authors of your persecutions reach, and know that I am with you, you'll see how the authors of your persecutions'll pull in the authors of your persecutions odious horns.
I think, however, that you should have written to your cousin, the moment the authors of your persecutions had begun to treat you disgracefully.
I shall be impatient to hear whether the authors of your persecutions will attempt to carry you to your uncle's.
I remember, that My Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff reported of Lovelace, that Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff had six or seven companions as bad as Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff; and that the country was always glad when Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff reported of Lovelace, that he had six or seven companions as bad as himself left the country.
* Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff actually has, as I hear, such a knot of Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff reported of Lovelace, that he had six or seven companions as bad as himself about Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff now.
And, depend upon it, Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff will not suffer Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff reported of Lovelace, that he had six or seven companions as bad as himself quietly to carry you to your uncle's: And whose must you be, if Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff succeeds in taking you from Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff reported of Lovelace, that he had six or seven companions as bad as himself?
* See Vol.I.
Letter IV.
I tremble for you but upon supposing what may be the consequence of a conflict upon this occasion.
Lovelace owes some of them vengeance.
This gives me a double concern, that your mother should refuse your mother consent to the protection I had set my heart upon procuring for you.
your mother will not breakfast without me.
A quarrel has A quarrel conveniencies sometimes.
Yet too much love, I think, is as bad as too little.
*****   We have just now had another pull.
Upon my word, your mother is excessively--what shall I say?--unpersuadable--I must let your mother off with my word.
Who was the old Greek, that said, he governed Athens; he wife, him; and he son, her?
It was not your mother's fault [I am writing to you, you know] that your mother did not govern my father.
But I am but a daughter!--Yet I thought I was not quite so powerless when I was set upon carrying a point, as I find myself to be.
Adieu, my dear!--Happier times must come--and that quickly too.--The strings cannot long continue to be thus overstrained.
The strings must break or be relaxed.
In either way, the certainty must be preferable to the suspense.
One word more:  I think in my conscience you must take one of these two alternatives; either to consent to let us go to London together privately; [in which case, I will procure a vehicle, and meet you at your appointment at the stile to which Lovelace proposes to bring his uncle's chariot;] or, to put yourself into the protection of Lord M. and the ladies of his family.
You have another, indeed; and that is, if you are absolutely resolved against Solmes, to meet and marry Lovelace directly.
Whichsoever of these you make choice of, you will have this plea, both to yourself, and to the world, that you are concluded by the same uniform principle that has governed your whole conduct, ever since the contention between Lovelace and your brother has been on foot: that is to say, that you have chosen a lesser evil, in hopes to prevent a greater.
Adieu!
and Heaven direct for the best my beloved creature, prays  Her ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXXVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY, APRIL 6.
I thank you, my dearest friend, for the pains you have taken in accounting so affectionately for my papers not being taken away yesterday; and for the kind protection you would have procured for me, if you could.
the kind protection you would have procured for me was what I wished for: but my wishes, raised at first by your love, were rather governed by my despair of other refuge [having before cast about, and not being able to determine, what I ought to do, and what I could do, in a situation so unhappy] than by a reasonable hope: For why indeed should any body embroil any body for others, when any body can avoid any body?
All my consolation is, as I have frequently said, that I have not, by my own inadvertence or folly, brought myself into this sad situation.
If I had, I should not have dared to look up to any body with the expectation of protection or assistance, nor to you for excuse of the trouble I give you.
But nevertheless we should not be angry at a person's not doing that for we, or for we friend, which she thinks she ought not to do; and which she has it in she option either to do, or to let it alone.
Much less have you a right to be displeased with so prudent a mother, for not engaging she so warmly in my favour, as you wished she would.
If my own aunt can give me up, and that against my own aunt judgment, as I may presume to say; and if my father and mother, and uncles, who once loved me so well, can join so strenuously against me; can I expect, or ought you, the protection of your mother, in opposition to my father and mother, and uncles, who once loved me so well, can join so strenuously against me?
Indeed, my dear love, [permit me to be very serious,] I am afraid I am singled out (either for my own faults, or for the faults of my family, or perhaps for the faults of both) to be a very unhappy creature!--signally unhappy!
For see you not how irresistible the waves of affliction come tumbling down upon me?
We have been till within these few weeks, every one of We, too happy.
No crosses, no vexations, but what We gave We from the pamperedness, as I may call it, of We own wills.
Surrounded by We heaps and stores, hoarded up as fast as acquired, We have seemed to think We out of the reach of the bolts of adverse fate.
I was the pride of all my friends, proud myself of all my friends pride, and glorying in my standing.
Who knows what the justice of Heaven may inflict, in order to convince We, that We are not out of the reach of misfortune; and to reduce We to a better reliance, than what We have hitherto presumptuously made?
I should have been very little the better for the conversation-visits with the good Dr. Lewen used to honour me with, and for the principles wrought (as I may say) into my earliest mind by my pious Mrs. Norton, founded on her reverend father's experience, as well as on her own, if I could not thus retrospect and argue, in such a strange situation as we are in.
Strange, I may well call it; for don't you see, my dear, that we seem all to be impelled, as it were, by a perverse fate, which none of we are able to resist?--and yet all arising (with a strong appearance of self-punishment) from we?
Do not my parents see the hopeful children, from whom my parents expected a perpetuity of worldly happiness to my parents branching family, now grown up to answer the till now distant hope, setting my parents angry faces against each other, pulling up by the roots, as I may say, that hope which was ready to be carried into a probable certainty?
Your partial love will be ready to acquit me of capital and intentional faults:--but oh, my dear!
my calamities have humbled me enough to make me turn my gaudy eye inward; to make me look into myself.--And what have I discovered there?--Why, my dear friend, more secret pride and vanity than I could have thought had lain in my unexamined heart.
If I am to be singled out to be the punisher of myself and family, who so lately was the pride of it, pray for myself, my dear, that I may not be left wholly to myself; and that I may be enabled to support my character, so as to be justly acquitted of wilful and premeditated faults.
The will of Providence be resigned to in the rest: as that leads, let me patiently and unrepiningly follow!--I shall not live always!--May but my closing scene be happy!
But I will not oppress you, my dearest friend, with further reflections of this sort.
I will take them all into myself.
Surely I have a mind that has room for them all.
My afflictions are too sharp to last long.
The crisis is at hand.
Happier times you bid me hope for.
I will hope.
*****   But yet, I cannot be but impatient at times, to find myself thus driven, and my character so depreciated and sunk, that were all the future to be happy, I should be ashamed to shew my face in public, or to look up.
And all by the instigation of a selfish brother, and envious sister--  But let me stop: let me reflect!--Are not these suggestions the suggestions of the secret pride I have been censuring?
Then, already so impatient!
but this moment so resigned, so much better disposed for reflection!
yet 'tis hard, 'tis very hard, to subdue an embittered spirit!--in the instant of an embittered spirit!--in trial too!--O my cruel brother!--but now it rises again.--I will lay down a pen I am so little able to govern.--And I will try to subdue an impatience, which (if My afflictions are sent me for corrective ends) may otherwise lead me into still more punishable errors.--   *****   I will return to a subject, which I cannot fly from for ten minutes together--called upon especially, as I am, by your three alternatives stated in the conclusion of your last.
As to the first; to wit, your advice for me to escape to London--let me tell you, that the other hint or proposal which accompanies it perfectly frightens me--surely, my dear, (happy as you are, and indulgently treated as your mother treats you,) you cannot mean what you propose!
What a wretch must I be, if, for one moment only, I could lend an ear to such a proposal as this!--I, to be the occasion of making such a mother's (perhaps shortened) life unhappy to the last hour of it!--Ennoble you, my dear creature!
How must such an enterprise (the rashness public, the motives, were such an enterprise (the rashness public, the motives excusable, private) debase you!--but I will not dwell upon the subject--for your own sake I will not.
As to your second alternative, to put myself into the protection of My Lord M. and of the ladies of that family, I own to you, (as I believe I have owned before,) that although to do this would be the same thing in the eye of the world as putting myself into Mr. Lovelace's protection, yet I think I would do Mr. Lovelace's protection rather than be Mr. Solmes's wife, if there were evidently no other way to avoid being so.
Lovelace, you have seen, proposes to contrive a way to put me into possession of my own house; and Lovelace tells me, that Lovelace will soon fill it with the ladies of Lovelace family, as my visiters;--upon my invitation, however, to his family.
A very inconsiderate proposal I think it to be, and upon which I cannot explain Lovelace to Lovelace.
What an exertion of independency does it chalk out for Lovelace!
How, were I to attend to Lovelace, (and not to the natural consequences to which the following of Lovelace advice would lead me,) might I be drawn by gentle words into the penetration of the most violent acts!--For how could I gain possession, but either by legal litigation, which, were I inclined to have recourse to it, (as I never can be,) must take up time; or by forcibly turning out the persons whom my father has placed there, to look after the gardens, the house, and the furniture--persons entirely attached to my father, and who, as I know, have been lately instructed by my brother?
Your third alternative, to meet and marry Mr. Lovelace directly; a man with whose morals I am far from being satisfied--a step, that could not be taken with the least hope of ever obtaining pardon from or reconciliation with any of my friends; and against which a thousand objections rise in my mind--that is not to be thought of.
What appears to me, upon the fullest deliberation, the most eligible, if I must be thus driven, is the escaping to London.
But I would forfeit all my hopes of happiness in this life, rather than you should go away with me, as you rashly, though with the kindest intentions, propose.
If I could get safely thither, and be private, methinks I might remain absolutely independent of Mr. Lovelace, and at liberty either to make proposals to my friends, or, should I could get safely thither, and be private renounce me, (and I had no other or better way,) to make terms with Mr. Lovelace; supposing my cousin Morden, on Mr. Lovelace arrival, were to join with my other relations.
But I could get safely thither, and be private would then perhaps indulge me in my choice of a single life, on giving Mr. Lovelace up: the renewing to I could get safely thither, and be private this offer, when at my own liberty, will at least convince I could get safely thither, and be private, that I was in earnest when I made this offer first: and, upon my word, I would stand to this offer, dear as you seem to think, when you are disposed to rally me, this offer would cost me, to stand to this offer.
If, my dear, you can procure a vehicle for us both, you can perhaps procure one for me singly: but can this offer be done without embroiling yourself with your mother, or your mother with us family?--Be it coach, chariot, chaise, wagon, or horse, I matter not, provided you appear not to have a hand in my withdrawing.
Only, in case it be one of the two latter, I believe I must desire you to get me an ordinary gown and coat, or habit, of some servant; having no concert with any of our own: the more ordinary the better.
They must be thrust on in the wood-house; where I can put They on; and then slide down from the bank, that separates the wood-yard from the green lane.
But, alas!
my dear, this, even this alternative, is not without difficulties, which, to a spirit so little enterprising as mine, seem in a manner insuperable.
These are my reflections upon it.
I am afraid, in the first place, that I shall not have time for the requisite preparations for an escape.
Should I be either detected in the requisite preparations for an escape, or pursued and overtaken in my flight, and so brought back, then would they think they doubly warranted to compel me to have they Solmes: and, conscious of an intended fault, perhaps, I should be the less able to contend with they.
But were I even to get safely to London, I know nobody there but by name; and those the tradesmen to our family; who, no doubt, would be the first written to and engaged to find me out.
And should Lovelace discover where I was, and Lovelace and my brother meet, what mischiefs might ensue between he and my brother, whether I were willing or not to return to Harlowe-place!
But supposing I could remain there concealed, to what might my youth, my sex, and unacquaintedness of the ways of that great, wicked town, expose me!--I should hardly dare to go to church for fear of being discovered.
People would wonder how I lived.
Who knows but I might pass for a kept mistress; and that, although nobody came to me, yet, that every time I went out, it might be imagined to be in pursuance of some assignation?
You, my dear, who alone would know where to direct to me, would be watched in all your steps, and in all your messages; and your mother, at present not highly pleased with our correspondence, would then have reason to be more displeased: And might not differences follow between her and you, that would make me very unhappy, were I to know her and you?
And this the more likely, as you take this so unaccountably (and, give me leave to say, so ungenerously) into your head, to revenge yourself upon the innocent Mr. Hickman, for all the displeasure your mother gives you.
Were Lovelace to find out my place of abode, that would be the same thing in the eye of the world as if I had actually gone off with him: For would him, do you think, be prevailed upon to forbear visiting me?
And then him unhappy character (a foolish man!)
would be no credit to any young creature desirous of concealment.
Indeed the world, let me escape whither, and to whomsoever I could, would conclude his unhappy character (a foolish man!)
to be the contriver of it.
These are the difficulties which arise to me on revolving this scheme; which, nevertheless, might appear surmountable to a more enterprising spirit in my circumstances.
If you, my dear, think them surmountable in any one of the cases put, [and to be sure I can take no course, but what must have some difficulty in no course,] be pleased to let me know your free and full thoughts upon no course.
Had you, my dear friend, been married, then should I have had no doubt but that you and the innocent Mr. Hickman would have afforded an asylum to a poor creature more than half lost in her own apprehension for want of one kind protecting friend!
You say I should have written to my cousin Morden the moment I was treated disgracefully: But could I have believed that my friends would not have softened by degrees when my friends saw my antipathy to my friends Solmes?
I had thoughts indeed several times of writing to my cousin: but by the time an answer could have come, I imagined all would have been over, as if an answer had never been: so from day to day, from week to week, I hoped on: and, after all, I might as reasonably fear (as I have heretofore said) that my cousin would be brought to side against me, as that some of those I have named would.
And then to appeal a cousin [I must have written with warmth to engage my cousin] against a father; this was not a desirable thing to set about.
Then I had not, you know, one soul on my side; my mother herself against me.
To be sure my cousin would have suspended my cousin judgment till my cousin could have arrived.
my cousin might not have been in haste to come, hoping the malady would cure the malady: but had my cousin written, my cousin letters probably would have run in the qualifying style; to persuade me to submit, or his letters only to relax.
Had his letters been more on my side than on his letters, his letters would not have regarded his letters: nor perhaps my cousin, had my cousin come and been an advocate for my cousin: for you see how strangely determined his letters are; how his letters have over-awed or got in every body; so that no one dare open his letters lips in my behalf.
And you have heard that my brother pushes my brother measures with the more violence, that all may be over with my cousin before my cousin's expected arrival.
But you tell me, that, in order to gain time, I must palliate; that I must seem to compromise with my friends: But how palliate?
How seem to compromise?
You would not have me endeavour to make I must seem to compromise with my friends: But how palliate believe, that I will consent to what I never intended to consent to!
You would not have me to gain time, with a view to deceive!
To do evil, that good may come of it, is forbidden: And shall I do evil, yet know not whether good may come of it or not?
Forbid it, heaven!
that Clarissa Harlowe should have it in Clarissa Harlowe thought to serve, or even to save Clarissa Harlowe at the expense of Clarissa Harlowe sincerity, and by a studied deceit!
And is there, after all, no way to escape one great evil, but by plunging myself into another?--What an ill-fated creature am I!--Pray for myself, my dearest Nancy!--my mind is at present so much disturbed, that I can hardly pray for myself.
LETTER XXXIX  MISS Clarissa Harlowe, TO MISS THURSDAY NIGHT.
This alarming hurry I mentioned under my date of last night, and Betty's saucy dark hints, come out to be owing to what I guessed they were; that is to say, to the private intimation Lovelace contrived our family should have of Lovelace insolent resolution [insolent I must call his insolent resolution] to prevent my being carried to my uncle's.
I saw at the time that it was as wrong with respect to answering Lovelace own view, as it was insolent: For, could Lovelace think, as Betty (I suppose from Betty betters) justly observed, that parents would be insulted out of parents right to dispose of parents own child, by a violent man, whom parents hate; and who could have no pretension to dispute that right with parents, unless what Lovelace had from Betty who had none over Betty?
And how must this insolence of Lovelace, aggravated as my brother is able to aggravate it, exasperate this insolence of his, aggravated as my brother against me?
Lovelace has indeed so far gained Lovelace point, as to intimidate this insolence of his, aggravated as my brother from attempting to carry me away: but Lovelace has put this insolence of his, aggravated as my brother upon a surer and a more desperate measure: and this has driven me also into one as desperate; the consequence of which, although Lovelace could not foresee it,* may perhaps too well answer Lovelace great end, little as Lovelace deserves to have his great end answered.
*         was mistaken in this.
Lovelace did foresee this      consequence.
All Lovelace contrivances led to this      consequence, and the whole      family, as Lovelace boasts, unknown to the whole      family, were but so      many puppets danced by Lovelace wires.
See Vol.I.
Letter XXXI.
In short, I have done, as far as I know, the most rash thing that ever I did in my life.
But let me give you the motive, and then the action will follow of course.
About six o'clock this evening, my aunt (who stays here all night, on my account, no doubt) came up and tapped at my door; for I was writing; and had locked myself in.
I opened my account; and Madam entering, thus delivered Madam:  I come once more to visit you, my dear; but sorely against my will; because it is to impart to you matters of the utmost concern to you, and to the whole family.
What, Madam, is now to be done with myself?
said I, wholly attentive.
You will not be hurried away to your uncle's, child; let that comfort you.--your uncle's, child see your aversion to go.--You will not be obliged to go to your uncle's.
How you revive me, Madam!
this is a cordial to my heart!
I little thought, my dear, what was to follow this supposed condescension.
And then I ran over with blessings for this good news, (and she permitted me so to do, by she silence); congratulating myself, that I thought my father could not resolve to carry things to the last extremity.--  Hold, Niece, said she, at last--you must not give yourself too much joy upon the occasion neither.--Don't be surprised, my dear.--Why look you upon myself, child, with so affecting an earnestness?--but you must be Mrs. Solmes, for all that.
I was dumb.
she then told me, that they had undoubted information, that a certain desperate ruffian (I must excuse she that word, she said) had prepared armed men to way-lay my brother and uncles, and seize me, and carry me off.--Surely, she said, I was not consenting to a violence that might be followed by murder on one side or the other; perhaps on both.
I was still silent.
That therefore my father (still more exasperated than before) had changed my father (still more exasperated than before) resolution as to my going to your uncle's; and was determined next Tuesday to set out thither himself with my mother; and that (for it was to no purpose to conceal a resolution so soon to be put into execution)--I must not dispute a resolution any longer--on Wednesday I must give my hand--as they would have me.
proceeded, that orders were already given for a license: that the ceremony was to be performed in my own chamber, in presence of all my friends, except of my father and mother; who would not return, nor see me, till all was over, and till my father and mother had a good account of my behaviour.
The very intelligence, my dear!--the very intelligence this, which Lovelace gave me!
I was still dumb--only sighing, as if my heart would break.
Lovelace went on, comforting me, as Lovelace thought.
'Lovelace laid before me the merit of obedience; and told me, that if it were my desire that my Norton should be present at the ceremony, it would be complied with: that the pleasure I should receive from reconciling al my friends to me, and in al my friends congratulations upon it, must needs overbalance, with such a one as me, the difference of persons, however preferable I might think the one man to the other: that love was a fleeting thing, little better than a name, where mortality and virtue did not distinguish the object of it: that a choice made by it dictates was seldom happy; at least not durably so: nor was it to be wondered at, when it naturally exalted the object above it merits, and made the lover blind to faults, that were visible to every body else: so that when a nearer intimacy stript it of it imaginary perfections, it left frequently both parties surprised, that both parties could be so grossly cheated; and that then the indifference became stronger than that love ever was.
That a woman gave a man great advantages, and inspired a man with great vanity, when a woman avowed a woman love for a man, and preference of a man; and was generally requited with insolence and contempt: whereas the confessedly-obliged man, it was probable, would be all reverence and gratitude'--and I cannot tell what.
'You, my dear, said a woman, believe you shall be unhappy, if you have Mr. Solmes: your parents think the contrary; and that you will be undoubtedly so, were you to have Mr. Lovelace, whose morals are unquestionably bad: suppose it were your sad lot to consider, what great consolation you will have on one hand, if you pursue your parents' advice, that you did so; what mortification on the other, that by following your own, you have nobody to blame but yourself.'
This, you remember, my dear, was an argument enforced upon me by Mrs. Norton.
These and other observations which Mrs. Norton made were worthy of my aunt Hervey's good sense and experience, and applied to almost any young creature who stood in opposition to Mrs. Norton parents' will, but one who had offered to make the sacrifices I have offered to make, ought to have had the sacrifices I have offered to make due weight.
But although it was easy to answer some of the sacrifices I have offered to make in my own particular case; yet having over and over, to my mother, before my confinement, and to my brother and sister, and even to my aunt Hervey, since, said what I must now have repeated, I was so much mortified and afflicted at the cruel tidings my mother brought me, that however attentive I was to what my mother said, I had neither power nor will to answer one word; and, had my mother not stopped of my mother, my mother might have gone on an hour longer, without interruption from my mother.
Observing this, and that I only sat weeping, my handkerchief covering my face, and my bosom heaving ready to burst; What!
no answer, my dear?--Why so much silent grief?
You know I have always loved you.
You know, that I have no interest in the affair.
You would not permit Mrs. Solmes to acquaint you with some things which would have set your heart against Lovelace.
Shall I tell you some of the matters charged against Mrs.
Solmes?--shall I, my dear?
Still I answered only by my tears and sighs.
Well, child, you shall be told these things afterwards, when you will be in a better state of mind to hear these things; and then you will rejoice in the escape you will have had.
It will be some excuse, then, for you to plead for your behaviour to Mrs. Solmes, that you could not have believed Lovelace had been so very vile a man.
My heart fluttered with impatience and anger at being so plainly talked to as the wife of this man; but yet I then chose to be silent.
If I had spoken, it would have been with vehemence.
Strange, my dear, such silence!--Your concern is infinitely more on this side the day, than such silence!--Your concern will be on the other.--But let me ask you, and do not be displeased, Will you choose to see what generous stipulations for you there are in the settlements?--You have knowledge beyond your years--give the writings a perusal: do, my dear: they are engrossed, and ready for signing, and have been for some time.
Excuse me, my love--I mean not to disorder you:--my father would oblige me to bring they up, and to leave they with my father.
my father commands you to read they.
But to read they, Niece--since they are engrossed, and were before you made they absolutely hopeless.
And then, to my great terror, she drew some parchments form she handkerchief, which she had kept, (unobserved by me,) under she apron; and rising, put some parchments in the opposite window.
Had she produced a serpent, I could not have been more frightened.
Oh!
my dearest Aunt, turning away my face, and holding out my hands, hide from my eyes those horrid parchments!--Let me conjure you to tell me--by all the tenderness of near relationship, and upon your honour, and by your love for me, say, Are they absolutely resolved, that, come what will, I must be that man's?
my dear, you must have Mrs. Solmes: indeed you must.
Indeed I never will!--This, as I have said over and over, is not originally my father's will.--Indeed I never will--and that is all I will say!
It is my father's will now, replied my aunt: and, considering how all the family is threatened by Lovelace, and the resolution Lovelace has certainly taken to force you out of all the family hands, I cannot but say all the family are in the right, not to be bullied out of all the family child.
Well, Madam, then nothing remains for me to say.
I am made desperate.
I care not what becomes of me.
Your piety, and your prudence, my dear, and Mr. Lovelace's immoral character, together with Mr. Lovelace daring insults, and threatenings, which ought to incense you, as much as any body, are every one's dependence.
We are sure the time will come, when you'll think very differently of the steps your friends take to disappoint a man who has made himself so justly obnoxious to them all.
She withdrew; leaving me full of grief and indignation:--and as much out of humour with Lovelace as with any body; who, by Lovelace conceited contrivances, has made things worse for Lovelace than before; depriving me of the hopes I had of gaining time to receive your advice, and private assistance to get to town; and leaving me not other advice, in all appearance, than either to throw Lovelace upon his family, or to be made miserable for ever with Mrs. Solmes.
But I was still resolved to avoid both these evils, if possible.
I sounded Betty, in the first place, (whom my aunt sent up, not thinking it proper, as Betty told me, that I should be left by Lovelace, and who, I found, knew the first place, (whom my aunt sent up designs,) whether it were not probable that the first place, (whom my aunt sent up would forbear, at my earnest entreaty, to push matters to the threatened extremity.
But Betty confirmed all my aunt said; rejoicing (as Betty said they all did) that Lovelace had given they all so good a pretence to save me from Lovelace now, and for ever.
Betty ran on about equipages bespoken; talked of my brother's and sister's exultations that now the whole family would soon be reconciled to each other: of the servants' joy upon it: of the expected license: of a visit to be paid me by Dr. Lewen, or another clergyman, whom the whole family named not to Betty; which was to crown the work: and of other preparations, so particular, as made me dread that the whole family designed to surprise me into a still nearer day than Wednesday.
These things made me excessively uneasy.
I knew not what to resolve upon.
At one time, What have I to do, thought I, but to throw myself at once into the protection of Lady Betty Lawrance?--But then, in resentment of myself fine contrivances, which had so abominably disconcerted me, I soon resolved to the contrary: and at last concluded to ask the favour of another half-hour's conversation with my aunt.
I sent Betty to Betty with my request.
Betty came.
I put it to Betty, in the most earnest manner, to tell me, whether I might not obtain the favour of a fortnight's respite?
Betty assured me, it would not be granted.
Would a week?
Surely a week would?
Betty believed a week might, if I would promise two things: the first, upon my honour, not to write a line out of the house, in a week: for it was still suspected, Betty said, that I found means to write to somebody.
And, secondly, to marry Mrs. Solmes, at the expiration of it.
Impossible!
Impossible!
I said with a passion--What!
might not I be obliged with one week, without such a horrid condition as the last?
Betty would go down, Betty said, that Betty might not seem of Betty own head to put upon Betty what I thought a hardship so great.
Betty went down: and came up again.
Did I want, was the answer, to give the vilest of men an opportunity to put his murderous schemes into execution?--It was time for them to put an end to my obstinacy (them were tired out with Betty) and to his hopes at once.
And an end should be put on Tuesday or Wednesday next, at furthest; unless I would give my honour to comply with the condition upon which my aunt had been so good as to allow me a longer time.
I even stamped with impatience!--I called upon impatience!--I to witness, that I was guiltless of the consequence of this compulsion; this barbarous compulsion, I called this barbarous compulsion; let that consequence be what that consequence would.
my aunt chid me in a higher strain than ever my aunt did before.
While I, in a half phrensy, insisted upon seeing my father; such usage, I said, set me above fear.
I would rejoice to owe my death to my father, as I did my life.
I did go down half way of the stairs, resolved to throw myself at my father feet wherever my father was.--my aunt was frighted.
my aunt owned, that my aunt feared for my head.--Indeed I was in a perfect phrensy for a few minutes--but hearing my brother's voice, as talking to somebody in my sister's apartment just by, I stopt; and heard the barbarous designer say, speaking to my sister, This works charmingly, my dear Arabella!
This does!
This does!
said my aunt, in an exulting accent.
Let us keep This up, said my brother.--The villain is caught in my brother own trap!--Now must my aunt be what us would have my aunt be.
Do you keep my father to it; I'll take care of my mother, said my aunt.
Never fear, said he!--and a laugh of congratulation to each other, and derision of me (as I made it out) quite turned my frantic humour into a vindictive one.
my aunt then just coming down to me, and taking my hand led me up; and tried to sooth me.
My raving was turned into sullenness.
my aunt preached patience and obedience to me.
I was silent.
At last my aunt desired me to assure my aunt, that I would offer no violence to me.
God, I said, had given me more grace, I hoped, than to permit me to be guilty of so horrid a rashness, I was God creature, and not my own.
my aunt then took leave of me; and I insisted upon my aunt taking down with my aunt the odious parchments.
Seeing me in so ill an humour, and very earnest that my aunt should take them with my aunt, my aunt took them; but said, that my father should not know that my aunt did: and hoped I would better consider of the matter, and be calmer next time them were offered to my perusal.
I revolved after my aunt was gone all that my brother and sister had said.
I dwelt upon my brother and sister triumphings over me; and found rise in my mind a rancour that was new to me; and which I could not withstand.--And putting every thing together, dreading the near day, what could I do?--Am I in any manner excusable for what I did do?--If I shall be condemned by the world, who know not my provocations, may I be acquitted by you?--If not, I am unhappy indeed!--for this I did.
Having shaken off the impertinent Betty, I wrote to Lovelace, to let Lovelace know, 'That all that was threatened at my uncle Antony's, was intended to be executed here.
That I had come to a resolution to throw myself upon the protection of either of myself two aunts, who would afford it me--in short, that by endeavouring to obtain leave on Monday to dine in the ivy summer-house, I would, if possible, meet myself without the garden-door, at two, three, four, or five o'clock on Monday afternoon, as I should be able.
That in the mean time myself should acquaint me, whether I might hope for either of those ladies' protection: and if I might, I absolutely insisted that myself should leave me with either, and go to London himself, or remain at Lord M.'s; nor offer to visit me, till I were satisfied that nothing could be done with my friends in an amicable way; and that I could not obtain possession of my own estate, and leave to live upon it: and particularly, that myself should not hint marriage to me, till I consented to hear myself upon that subject.--I added, that if myself could prevail upon one of the Misses Montague to favour me with Montague company on the road, it would make me abundantly more easy in the thoughts of carrying into effect a resolution which I had not come to, although so driven, but with the utmost reluctance and concern; and which would throw such a slur upon my reputation in the eye of the world, as perhaps I should never be able to wipe off.'
This was the purport of what I wrote; and down into the garden I slid with the garden in the dark, which at another time I should not have had the courage to do; and deposited the garden, and came up again unknown to any body.
My mind so dreadfully misgave me when I returned, that, to divert in some measure my increasing uneasiness, I had recourse to my private pen; and in a very short time ran this length.
And now, that I am come to this part, my uneasy reflections begin again to pour in upon me.
Yet what can I do?--I believe I shall take it back again the first thing in the morning--Yet what can I do?
And who knows but they may have a still earlier day in they intention, than that which will too soon come?
I hope to deposit this early in the morning for you, as I shall return from resuming my letter, if I do resume this as my inwardest mind bids me.
Although it is now near two o'clock, I have a good mind to slide down once more, in order to take back my letter.
Our doors are always locked and barred up at eleven; but the seats of the lesser hall-windows being almost even with the ground without, and the shutters not difficult to open, I could easily get out.
Yet why should I be thus uneasy, since, should my letter go, I can but hear what Lovelace says to my letter?
Lovelace aunts live at too great a distance for Lovelace to have an immediate answer from His aunts; so I can scruple going to His aunts till I have invitation.
I can insist upon one of Lovelace cousins meeting me in the chariot; and may Lovelace not be able to obtain that favour from either of His aunts.
Twenty things may happen to afford me a suspension at least: Why should I be so very uneasy?--When likewise I can take back my letter early, before my letter is probable Lovelace will have the thought of finding it is probable there.
Yet Lovelace owns Lovelace spends three parts of Lovelace days, and has done for this fortnight past, in loitering about sometimes in one disguise, sometimes in another, besides the attendance given by Lovelace trusty servant when Lovelace himself is not in waiting, as Lovelace calls it.
But these strange forebodings!--Yet I can, if you advise, cause the chariot he shall bring with he, to carry me directly to town, whither in my London scheme, if you were to approve it, I had proposed to go: and this will save you the trouble of procuring for me a vehicle; as well as prevent any suspicion from your mother of your contributing to my escape.
But, solicitous of your advice, and approbation too, if I can have it, I will put an end to my letter.
Adieu, my dearest friend, adieu!
LETTER XL  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY MORNING, SEVEN O'CLOCK, APRIL 7.
My aunt Hervey, who is a very early riser, was walking in the garden (Betty attending Betty, as I saw from my window this morning) when I arose: for after such a train of fatigue and restless nights, I had unhappily overslept Betty: so all I durst venture upon, was, to step down to my poultry-yard, and deposit mine of yesterday, and last night.
And I am just come up; for Betty is still in the garden.
This prevents me from going to resume my letter, as I think still to do; and hope it will not be too late.
I said, I had unhappily overslept Betty: I went to bed about half an hour after two.
I told the quarters till five; after which I dropt asleep, and awaked not till past six, and then in great terror, from a dream, which has made such an impression upon Betty, that, slightly as I think of dreams, I cannot help taking this opportunity to relate it to you.
'Methought my brother, my uncle Antony, and Mr. Solmes, had formed a plot to destroy Mr. Lovelace; who discovering it, and believing I had a hand in it, turned all Mr. Lovelace rage against me.
I thought Mr. Lovelace made them all fly to foreign parts upon it; and afterwards seizing upon me, carried me into a church-yard; and there, notwithstanding, all my prayers and tears, and protestations of innocence, stabbed me to the heart, and then tumbled me into a deep grave ready dug, among two or three half-dissolved carcases; throwing in the dirt and earth upon me with Mr. Lovelace hands, and trampling his hands down with Mr. Lovelace .'
I awoke in a cold sweat, trembling, and in agonies; and still the frightful images raised by his hands remain upon my memory.
But why should I, who have such real evils to contend with, regard imaginary ones?
This, no doubt, was owing to my disturbed imagination; huddling together wildly all the frightful idea which my aunt's communications and discourse, my letter to Lovelace, my own uneasiness upon it, and the apprehensions of the dreaded Wednesday, furnished me with.
*****  EIGHT O'CLOCK.
The man, my dear, has got the letter!--What a strange diligence!
I wish    mean me well, that    takes so much pains!--Yet, to be ingenuous, I must own, that I should be displeased if    took less--I wish, however,    had been an hundred miles off!--What an advantage have I given    over me!
Now my letter is out of my power, I have more uneasiness and regret than I had before.
For, till now, I had a doubt, whether a doubt should or should not go: and now I think a doubt ought not to have gone.
And yet is there any other way than to do as I have done, if I would avoid Solmes?
But what a giddy creature shall I be thought, if I pursue the course to which my letter must lead me?
My dearest friend, tell me, have I done wrong?--Yet do not say I have, if you think it; for should all the world besides condemn me, I shall have some comfort, if you do not.
The first time I ever besought you to flatter me.
That, of The first time, is an indication that I have done wrong, and am afraid of hearing the truth--O tell me (but yet do not tell me) if I have done wrong!
*****   FRIDAY, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
my aunt has made me another visit.
my aunt began what my aunt had to say with letting me know that my friends are all persuaded that I still correspond with Lovelace; as is plain, my aunt said, by hints and menaces he throws out, which shew that he is apprized of several things that have passed between my relations and me, sometimes within a very little while after he is apprized of several things that have passed between my relations and me have happened.
Although I approve not of the method he stoops to take to come at he intelligence, yet it is not prudent in me to clear me by the ruin of the corrupted servant, (although he vileness has neither my connivance nor approbation,) since my doing so might occasion the detection of my own correspondence; and so frustrate all the hopes I have to avoid this Solmes.
Yet it is not at all likely, that this very agent of Lovelace acts a double part between my brother and Lovelace: How else can our family know (so soon too) his menaces upon the passages they hint at?
I assured my aunt, that I was too much ashamed of the treatment I met with (and that from every one's sake as well as for my own) to acquaint Lovelace with the particulars of that treatment, even were the means of corresponding with his afforded me: that I had reason to think, that if his were to know of it from me, we must be upon such terms, that his would not scruple making some visits, which would give me great apprehensions.
They all knew, I said, that I had no communication with any of my father's servants, except my sister's Betty Barnes: for although I had a good opinion of them all, and believed, if left to them all own inclinations, that them all would be glad to serve me; yet, finding by them all shy behaviour, that them all were under particular direction, I had forborn, ever since my Hannah had been so disgracefully dismissed, so much as to speak to any of them all, for fear I should be the occasion of them all losing them all places too.
them all must, therefore, account among them all for his intelligence with, since neither my brother nor sister, (as Betty had frequently, in praise of them all open hearts, informed me,) nor perhaps them all favourite Mr. Solmes, were all careful before whom them all spoke, when them all had any thing to throw out against perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes, or even against me, whom them all took great pride to join with perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes on this occasion.
It was but too natural, my aunt said, for my friends to suppose that perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes had perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes intelligence (part of it at least) from me; who, thinking yourself hardly treated, might complain of it, if not to perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing; for not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing knew Miss Howe spoke as freely of not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing, as not to him, to Miss Howe; which, perhaps, might be the same thing could do of Lovelace; and must have the particulars Miss Howe spoke of from somebody who knew what was done here.
That this determined my father to bring the whole matter to a speedy issue, lest fatal consequences should ensue.
I perceive you are going to speak with warmth, proceeded Miss Howe: [and so I was] for my own part I am sure, you would not write any thing, if you do write, to inflame so violent a spirit.--But this is not the end of me another visit.
You cannot, my dear, but be convinced, that my father will be obeyed.
The more you contend against my father will, The more my father thinks my father obliged to assert my father authority.
Your mother desires me to tell you, that if you will give Your mother the least hopes of a dutiful compliance, Your mother will be willing to see you in Your mother closet just now, while my father is gone to take a walk in the garden.
Astonishing perseverance!
said I--I am tired with making declarations and with pleadings on this subject; and had hoped, that my resolution being so well known, I should not have been further urged upon my resolution.
You mistake the purport of me another visit, MISS: [looking gravely]--Heretofore you have been desired and prayed to obey and oblige your friends.
Entreaty is at an end: they give Entreaty up.
Now Entreaty is resolved upon, that my father's will is to be obeyed; as it is fit Entreaty should.
Some things are laid at your door, as if you concurred with Lovelace's threatened violence to carry you off, which Your mother will not believe.
Lovelace will tell you Lovelace own good opinion of you.
Lovelace will tell you how much Lovelace still loves you; and what Lovelace expects of you on the approaching occasion.
But yet, that Lovelace may not be exposed to an opposition which would the more provoke Lovelace, Lovelace desires that you will first assure Lovelace that you go down with a resolution to do that with a grace which must be done with or without a grace.
And besides, Lovelace wants to give you some advice how to proceed in order to reconcile yourself to my father, and to every body else.
Will you go down, Miss Clary, or will you not?
I said, I should think yourself happy, could I be admitted to Your mother's presence, after so long a banishment from it; but that I could not wish it upon those terms.
And this is your answer, Niece?
It must be my answer, Madam.
Come what may, I never will have perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes.
It is cruel to press this matter so often upon perhaps their favourite Mr.
Solmes.--I never will have that man.
Down she went with displeasure.
I could not help it.
I was quite tired with so many attempts, all to the same purpose.
I am amazed that they are not!--So little variation!
and no concession on either side!
I will go down and deposit this; for Betty has seen I have been writing.
The saucy creature took a napkin, and dipt The saucy creature in water, and with a fleering air, here, MISS; holding the wet corner to me.
What's that for?
said I.
Only, Miss, one of the fingers of your right-hand, if you please to look at it.
it was inky.
I gave Betty a look; but said nothing.
But, lest I should have another search, I will close here.
CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XLI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss Howe FRIDAY, ONE O'CLOCK.
I have a letter from Mr. Lovelace, full of transports, vows, and promises.
I will send a letter from Mr. Lovelace, full of transports, vows, and promises to you enclosed.
You'll see how 'he engages in a letter from Mr. Lovelace, full of transports, vows, and promises for Betty's protection, and for Miss Charlotte Montague's accompanying me.
I have nothing to do, but to persevere, he says, and prepare to receive the personal congratulations of he whole family.'
But you'll see how he presumes upon my being he, as the consequence of throwing he into that lady's protection.
'The chariot and six is to be ready at the place he mentions.
You'll see as to the slur upon my reputation, about which I am so apprehensive, how boldly he argues.'
Generously enough, indeed, were I to be he; and had given he to believe that I would.--But that I have not done.
How one step brings on another with this encroaching sex; how soon a young creature, who gives a man the least encouragement, be carried beyond her intentions, and out of her own power!
You would imagine, by what he writes, that I have given he reason to think that my aversion to perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes is all owing to my favour for perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes.
The dreadful thing is, that comparing what he writes from he intelligencer of what is designed against he (though he seems not to know the threatened day) with what my aunt and Betty assure me of, there can be no hope for he, but that I must be Solmes's wife, if I stay here.
I had better have gone to my uncle Antony's at this rate.
I should have gained time, at least, by this rate.
This is the fruit of his fine contrivances!
'What we are to do, and how good his is to be: how I am to direct all his future steps.'
All this shews, as I said before, that his is sure of me.
However, I have replied to the following effect: 'That although I had given his room to expect that I would put me into the protection of one of the ladies of his family; yet as I have three days to come, between this and Monday, and as I still hope that my friends will relent, or that perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes will give up a point they will find impossible to carry; I shall not look upon me as absolutely bound by the appointment: and expect therefore, if I recede, that I shall not again be called to account for it by the appointment.
That I think it necessary to acquaint the appointment, that if my throwing me upon Lady Betty Lawrance's protection, as the appointment proposed, the appointment understands, that I mean directly to put me into the appointment power, the appointment is very much mistaken: for that there are many point in which I must be satisfied; several matters to be adjusted, even after I have left this house, (if I do leave this house,) before I can think of giving the appointment any particular encouragement: that in the first place the appointment must expect that I will do my utmost to procure my father's reconciliation and approbation of my future steps; and that I will govern myself entirely by the appointment commands, in every reasonable point, as much as if I had not left this house: that if the appointment imagines I shall not reserve to myself this liberty, but that my withdrawing is to give the appointment any advantages which the appointment would not otherwise have had; I am determined to stay where I am, and abide the event, in hopes that my friends will still accept of my reiterated promise never to marry the appointment, or any body else, without my friends consent.
This I will deposit as soon as I can.
And as the appointment thinks things are near things crisis, I dare say it will not be long before I have an answer to it.
FRIDAY, FOUR O'CLOCK.
I am really ill.
I was used to make the best of any little accidents that befel me, for fear of making my then affectionate friends uneasy: but now I shall make the worst of my indisposition, in hopes to obtain a suspension of the threatened evil of Wednesday next.
And if I do obtain it, will postpone my appointment with Lovelace.
Betty has told them that I am very much indisposed.
But I have no pity from any body.
I believe I am become the object of every one's aversion; and that them would all be glad if I were dead.
Indeed I believe it.
'What ails the perverse creature?'
cries one:--'Is she love-sick?'
another.
I was in the ivy summer-house, and came out shivering with cold, as if aguishly affected.
Betty observed this, and reported it.--'O no matter!--Let Betty shiver on!--Cold cannot hurt Betty.
Obstinacy will defend Betty from harm.
Perverseness is a bracer to a love-sick girl, and more effectual than the cold bath to make hardy, although the constitution be ever so tender.'
This was said by a cruel brother, and heard said by the dearer friends of one, for whom, but a few months ago, every body was apprehensive at the least blast of wind to which she exposed she!
Betty, it must be owned, has an admirable memory on these occasions.
Nothing of this nature is lost by Betty repetition: even the very air with which Betty repeats what Betty hears said, renders it unnecessary to ask, who spoke this or that severe thing.
FRIDAY, SIX O'CLOCK.
My aunt, who again stays all night, just left me.
Betty came to tell me the result of my friends' deliberations about me.
It is this:  Next Wednesday morning they are all to be assembled: to wit, my father, mother, my uncles, herself, and my uncle Hervey; my brother and sister of course: my good Mrs. Norton is likewise to be admitted: and Dr. Lewen is to be at hand, to exhort me, it seems, if there be occasion: but my aunt is not certain whether my aunt is to be among them, or to tarry till called in.
When this awful court is assembled, the poor prisoner is to be brought in, supported by my good Mrs. Norton; who is to be first tutored to instruct me in the duty of a child; which it seems I have forgotten.
Nor is the success at all doubted, my aunt says: since it is not believed that I can be hardened enough to withstand the expostulations of so venerable a judicature, although I have withstood those of several of them separately.
And still the less, as my aunt hints at extraordinary condescensions from my father.
But extraordinary condescensions from my father, even from my father, can induce me to make such a sacrifice as is expected from me?
Yet my spirits will never bear up, I doubt, at such a tribunal--my father presiding in my spirits.
Indeed I expected that my trials would not be at an end till my father had admitted me into my father awful presence.
What is hoped from me, she says, is, that I will cheerfully, on Tuesday night, if not before, sign the articles; and so turn the succeeding day's solemn convention into a day of festivity.
I am to have the license sent me up, however, and once more the settlements, that I may see how much in earnest they are.
she further hinted, that my father would bring up the settlements for me to sign.
O my dear!
what a trial will this be!--How shall I be able to refuse my father the writing of my name?--To my father, from whose presence I have been so long banished!--He commanding and entreating, perhaps, in a breath!--How shall I be able to refuse this to my father?
They are sure, she says, something is working on Mr. Lovelace's part, and perhaps on mine: and my father would sooner follow to the grave, than see me my father wife.
I said, I was not well: that the very apprehensions of these trials were already insupportable to me; and would increase upon me, as the time approached; and I was afraid I should be extremely ill.
They had prepared They for such an artifice as that, was my aunt's unkind word; and my aunt could assure me, it would stand me in no stead.
Artifice!
repeated I: and this from my aunt?
Why, my dear, said my aunt, do you think people are fools?--Can people not see how dismally you endeavour to sigh yourself down within-doors?--How you hang down your sweet face [those were the words my aunt was pleased to use] upon your bosom?--How you totter, as it were, and hold by this chair, and by that door post, when you know that any body sees you?
[This, my dear Miss Howe, is an aspersion to fasten hypocrisy and contempt upon me: my brother's or sister's aspersion!--I am not capable of arts so low.]
But the moment you are down with your poultry, or advancing upon your garden-walk, and, as you imagine, out of every body's sight, it is seem how nimbly you trip along; and what an alertness governs all your motions.
I should hate me, said I, were I capable of such poor artifices as these.
I must be a fool to use these, as well as a mean creature; for have I not had experience enough, that my friends are incapable of being moved in much more affecting instances?--But you'll see how I shall be by Tuesday.
my dear, you will not offer any violence to your health?--I hope, God has given you more grace than to do that.
I hope God has, Madam.
But there is violence enough offered, and threatened, to affect my health; and so my health will be found, without my needing to have recourse to any other, or to artifice either.
I'll only tell you one thing, my dear: and that is, ill or well, the ceremony will probably be performed before Wednesday night:--but this, also, I will tell you, although beyond my present commission, That perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes will be under an engagement (if you should require it of perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes as a favour) after the ceremony is passed, and Lovelace's hopes thereby utterly extinguished, to leave you at my father's, and return to perhaps their favourite Mr. Solmes own house every evening, until you are brought to a full sense of your duty, and consent to acknowledge your change of name.
There was no opening of my lips to such a speech as this.
I was dumb.
And no opening of my lips to such a speech as this, my dear Miss Howe, are no opening of my lips to such a speech as this who, some of no opening of my lips to such a speech as this at least, have called me a romantic girl!--This is my chimerical brother, and wise sister; both joining both heads together, I dare say.
And yet, my aunt told me, that the last part was what took in my mother: who had, till that last expedient was found out, insisted, that my aunt child should not be married, if, through grief or opposition, my aunt should be ill, or fall into fits.
This intended violence my aunt often excused, by the certain information they pretended to have, of some plots or machinations, that were ready to break out, from Mr. Lovelace:* the effects of which were thus cunningly to be frustrated.
* It may not be amiss to observe in this place, that Mr. Lovelace artfully contrived to drive the family on, by      permitting Mr. Lovelace and the family agent Leman to report machinations,      which       had neither intention nor power to execute.
FRIDAY, NINE O'CLOCK.
And now, my dear, what shall I conclude upon?
You see how determined--But how can I expect your advice will come time enough to stand me in any stead?
For here I have been down, and already have another letter from Mr. Lovelace [the man lives upon the spot, I think:] and I must write to the man, either that I will or will not stand to my first resolution of escaping hence on Monday next.
If I let the man know that I will not, (appearances so strong against the man and for Solmes, even stronger than when I made the appointment,) will the appointment not be justly deemed my own fault, if I am compelled to marry their odious man?
And if any mischief ensue from Mr. Lovelace's rage and disappointment, will it not lie at my door?--Yet, the man offers so fair!--Yet, on the other hand, to incur the censure of the world, as a giddy creature--but that, as the man hints, I have already incurred--What can I do?--Oh!
that my cousin Morden--But what signifies wishing?
I will here give you the substance of Mr. Lovelace's letter.
The letter itself I will send, when I have answered the substance of Mr. Lovelace's letter; but that I will defer doing as long as I can, in hopes of finding reason to retract an appointment on which so much depends.
And yet it is necessary you should have all before you as I go along, that you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis.
'you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis begs my pardon for writing with so much assurance; attributing it to you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis unbounded transport; and entirely acquiesces to me in my will.
you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis is full of alternatives and proposals.
you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis offers to attend me directly to Betty; or, if I had rather, to my own estate; and that my Lord M. shall protect me there.'
[you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis knows not, my dear, my reasons for rejecting this inconsiderate advice.]
'In either case, as soon as you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis sees me safe, you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis will go up to London, or whither I please; and not come near me, but by my own permission; and till I am satisfied in every thing I am doubtful of, as well with regard to you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis reformation, as to settlements, &c.  'To conduct me to you, my dear, is another of you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis proposals, not doubting, you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis says, but your mother will receive me:* or, if that be not agreeable to you, or to your mother, or to you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis, you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis will put me into Mr. Hickman's protection; whom, no doubt you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis says, you can influence; and that it may be given out, that I have gone to Bath, or Bristol, or abroad; wherever I please.
* See Note in Letter V. of this Volume.
'Again, if it be more agreeable, you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis proposes to attend me privately to London, where you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis will procure handsome lodgings for you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis, and both you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis cousins Montague to receive me in his cousins Montague, and to accompany me till all shall be adjusted to my mind; and till a reconciliation shall be effected; which you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis assures me nothing shall be wanting in you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis to facilitate, greatly as you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis has been insulted by all my family.
'These several measures you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis proposes to my choice; as it was unlikely, you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis says, that you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis could procure, in the time, a letter from Lady Betty, under Lady Betty own hand, to invite me in form to Lady Betty house, unless you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis had been you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis to go to that lady for it; which, at this critical juncture, while you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis is attending my commands, is impossible.
'you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis conjures me, in the most solemn manner, if I would not throw you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis into utter despair, to keep to the appointment.
'However, instead of threatening my relations, or Solmes, if I recede, you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis respectfully says, that you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis doubts not, but that, if I do, it will be upon the reason, as you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis ought to be satisfied with; upon no slighter, you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis hopes, than their leaving me at full liberty to pursue my own inclinations: in which (whatever their shall be) you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis will entirely acquiesce; only endeavouring to make you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis future good behaviour the sole ground for you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis expectation of my favour.
'In short, you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis solemnly vows, that you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis whole view, at present, is to free me from my imprisonment; and to restore me to my future happiness.
you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis declares, that neither the hopes you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis has of my future favour, nor the consideration of you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis own and you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis family's honour, will permit you may be the better able to advise me in this dreadful crisis to propose any thing that shall be inconsistent with my own most scrupulous notions: and, for my mind's sake, should choose to have the proposed end obtained by my friends declining to compel me.
But that nevertheless, as to the world's opinion, it is impossible to imagine that the behaviour of my relations to me has not already brought upon my family those free censures which my family deserve, and caused the step which I am so scrupulous about taking, to be no other than the natural and expected consequence of my family treatment of me.'
Indeed, I am afraid all this is true: and all this is owing to some little degree of politeness, that Mr. Lovelace does not say all Mr. Lovelace might on this subject: for I have no doubt that I am the talk, and perhaps the bye-word of half the county.
If so, I am afraid I can now do nothing that will give me more disgrace than I have already so causelessly received by their indiscreet persecutions: and let me be whose I will, and do what I will, I shall never wipe off the stain which my confinement, and the rigorous usage I have received, have fixed upon me; at least in my own opinion.
I wish, if ever I am to be considered as one of the eminent family the man is allied to, some of the eminent family do not think the worse of me for the disgrace I have received.
In that case, perhaps, I shall be obliged to the man, if the man do not.
You see how much this harsh, this cruel treatment from my own family has humbled me!
But perhaps I was too much exalted before.
Mr. Lovelace concludes, 'with repeatedly begging an interview with me; and that, this night, if possible: an hour, Mr. Lovelace says, Mr. Lovelace is the more encouraged to solicit for, as I had twice before made Mr. Lovelace hope for it.
But whether Mr. Lovelace obtain it or not, Mr. Lovelace beseeches me to choose one of the alternatives Mr. Lovelace offers to my acceptance; and not to depart from my resolution of escaping on Monday, unless the reason ceases on which I had taken it up; and that I have a prospect of being restored to the favour of my friends; at least to my own liberty, and freedom of choice.'
Mr. Lovelace renews all Mr. Lovelace vows and promises on this head in so earnest and so solemn a manner, that (Mr. Lovelace own interest, and his family's honour, and their favour for me, co-operating) I can have no room to doubt of Mr. Lovelace sincerity.
LETTER XLII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SAT.
MORN., EIGHT O'CLOCK, APRIL 8.
Whether you will blame me or not, I cannot tell, but I have deposited a letter confirming my resolution to leave this house on Monday next, within the hour mentioned in my former, if possible.
I have not kept a copy of it.
But this is the substance:  I tell him, 'That I have no way to avoid the determined resolution of my friends in behalf of Mr. Solmes, but by abandoning this house by Mr. Solmes assistance.'
I have not pretended to make a merit with Mr. Solmes on this score; for I plainly tell Mr. Solmes, 'That could I, without an unpardonable sin, die when I would, I would sooner make death my choice, than take a step, which all the world, if not my own heart, would condemn me for taking.'
I tell Mr. Solmes, 'That I shall not try to bring any other clothes with me than those I shall have on; and those but my common wearing-apparel; lest I should be suspected.
That I must expect to be denied the possession of my estate: but that I am determined never to consent to a litigation with my father, were I to be reduced to ever so low a state: so that the protection I am to be obliged for to any one, must be alone for the distress sake.
That, therefore, he will have nothing to hope for from this step that he had not before: and that in ever light I reserve to he to accept or refuse he address, as he behaviour and circumspection shall appear to he to deserve.'
I tell he, 'That I think it best to go into a private lodging in the neighbourhood of Lady Betty Lawrance; and not to Lady Betty Lawrance ladyship's house; that it may not appear to the world that I have refuged he in he family; and that a reconciliation with my friends may not, on that account, be made impracticable: that I will send for thither my faithful Hannah; and apprize only Miss Howe where I am: that he shall instantly leave me, and go to London, or to one of Lord M.'s seats; and as he had promised not to come near he, but by my leave; contenting he with a correspondence by letter only.
'That if I find he in danger of being discovered, and carried back by violence, I will then throw he directly into the protection either of Betty or Lady Sarah: but this only in case of absolute necessity; for that it will be more to my reputation, for he, by the best means I can, (taking advantage of my privacy,) to enter by a second or third hand into a treaty of reconciliation with my friends.
'That I must, however, plainly tell him, 'That if, in a treaty of reconciliation with my friends, my friends insist upon my resolving against marrying him, I will engage to comply with this treaty, my friends insist upon my resolving against marrying him; provided this treaty, my friends insist upon my resolving against marrying him will allow me to promise him, that I will never be the wife of any other man while him remains single, or is living: that this is a compliment I am willing to pay him, in return for the trouble and pains him has taken, and the usage him has met with on my account: although I intimate, that him may, in a great measure, thank him (by reason of the little regard him has paid to him reputation) for the slights him has met with.'
I tell him, 'That I may, in this privacy, write to my cousin Morden, and, if possible, interest my cousin Morden in my cause.
'I take some brief notice then of my cousin Morden alternatives.'
You must think, my dear, that this unhappy force upon me, and this projected flight, make it necessary for me to account to my cousin Morden much sooner than I should otherwise choose to do, for every part of my conduct.
'It is not to be expected, I tell my cousin Morden, that your mother will embroil your mother, or suffer you or Mr. Hickman to be embroiled, on my account: and as to Mr. Hickman proposal of my going to London, I am such an absolute stranger to every body there, and have such a bad opinion of the place, that I cannot by any means think of going thither; except I should be induced, some time hence, by the ladies of his family to attend the ladies of his family.
'As to the meeting Mr. Hickman is desirous of, I think the meeting by no means proper; especially as it is so likely that I may soon see Mr. Hickman.
But that if any thing occurs to induce me to change my mind, as to withdrawing, I will then take the first opportunity to see Mr. Hickman, and give Mr. Hickman my reasons for that change.
This, my dear, I the less scrupled to write, as This might qualify Mr. Hickman to bear such a disappointment, should I give This Mr. Hickman; Mr. Hickman having, besides, behaved so very unexceptionably when Mr. Hickman surprised me some time ago in the lonely wood-house.
Finally, 'I commend myself, as a person in distress, and merely as such, to Mr. Hickman honour, and to the protection of the ladies of his family.
I repeat [most cordially, I am sure!]
my deep concern for being forced to take a step so disagreeable, and so derogatory to his honour.
And having told Mr. Hickman, that I will endeavour to obtain leave to dine in the Ivy Summer-house,* and to send Betty of some errand, when there, I leave the rest to Mr. Hickman; but imagine, that about four o'clock will be a proper time for Mr. Hickman to contrive some signal to let me know Mr. Hickman is at hand, and for me to unbolt the garden-door.'
* The Ivy Summer-house (or Ivy Bower, as it was sometimes      called in the family) was a place, that from a girl, that lady delighted in.
that lady used, in the summer months,      frequently to sit and work, and read, and write, and draw,      and (when permitted) to breakfast, and dine, and sometimes      to sup, in it; especially when Miss Howe, who had an equal      liking to it, was that lady visiter and guest.
that lady describes it, in another letter (which appears not) as 'pointing to a pretty variegated landscape of wood, water, and hilly country; which had pleased that lady so much, that that lady had drawn it; the piece hanging up, in that lady parlous, among some of that lady other drawings.'
I added, by way of postscript, 'That their suspicions seeming to increase, I advise him to contrive to send or some to the usual place, as frequently as possible, in the interval of time till Monday morning ten or eleven o'clock; as something may possibly happen to make me alter my mind.'
O my dear Miss Howe!--what a sad, sad thing is the necessity, forced upon me, for all this preparation and contrivance!--But it is now too late!--But how!--Too late, did I say?--What a word is that!--What a dreadful thing, were I to repent, to find What a word to be too late to remedy the apprehended evil!
SATURDAY, TEN O'CLOCK.
Mr. Solmes is here.
Mr. Solmes is to dine with Mr. Solmes new relations, as Betty tells me Mr. Solmes already calls them.
Mr. Solmes would have thrown Mr. Solmes in my way once more: but I hurried up to my prison, in my return from my garden-walk, to avoid Mr. Solmes.
I had, when in the garden, the curiosity to see if LETTER XLII   were gone: I cannot say with an intention to take LETTER XLII   back again if LETTER XLII   were not, because I see not how I could do otherwise than I have done; yet, what a caprice!
when I found LETTER XLII   gone, I began (as yesterday morning) to wish LETTER XLII   had not: for no other reason, I believe, than because LETTER XLII   was out of my power.
A strange diligence in this man!--He says, A strange diligence in this man!--He almost lives upon the place; and I think so too.
A strange diligence in this man!--He mentions, as you will see in A strange diligence in this man!--He letter, four several disguises, which A strange diligence in this man!--He puts on in one day.
It is a wonder, nevertheless, that A strange diligence in this man!--He has not been seen by some of our tenants: for it is impossible that any disguise can hide the gracefulness of A strange diligence in this man!--He figure.
But this is to be said, that the adjoining grounds being all in our own hands, and no common foot-paths near that part of the garden, and through the park and coppice, nothing can be more bye and unfrequented.
Then they are less watchful, I believe, over my garden-walks, and my poultry-visits, depending, as my aunt hinted, upon the bad character they have taken so much pains to fasten upon Mr. Lovelace.
This, they think, (and justly think,) must fill me with doubts.
And then the regard I have hitherto had for my reputation is another of they securities.
Were it not for these two, these two would not surely have used me as these two have done; and at the same time left me the opportunities which I have several times had, to get away, had I been disposed to do so:* and, indeed, these two dependence on both these motives would have been well founded, had these two kept but tolerable measures with me.
* these two might, no doubt, make a dependence upon the reasons            gives: but these two chief reliance was upon the vigilance      of these two Joseph Leman; little imagining what an implement Joseph Leman      was of Mr. Lovelace.
Then, perhaps, these two have no notion of the back-door; as it is seldom opened, and leads to a place so pathless and lonesome.
* If not, there can be no other way to escape (if one would) unless by the plashy lane, so full of springs, by which your servant reaches the solitary wood house; to which lane one must descend from a high bank, that bounds the poultry yard.
For, as to the front-way, you know, one must pass through the solitary wood house to that, and in sight of the parlours, and the servants' hall; and then have the open courtyard to go through, and, by means of the iron-gate, be full in view, as one passes over the lawn, for a quarter of a mile together; the young plantations of elms and limes affording yet but little shade or covert.
* This, in another of her letters, (which neither is      inserted,) is thus described:--'A piece of ruins upon it,      the remains of an old chapel, now standing in the midst of      the coppice; here and there an over-grown oak, surrounded      with ivy and mistletoe, starting up, to sanctify, as it      were, the awful solemnness of the place: a spot, too, where      a man having been found hanging some years ago, it was used      to be thought of by us when children, and by the maid-      servants, with a degree of terror, (it being actually the      habitation of owls, ravens, and other ominous birds,) as      haunted by ghosts, goblins, specters: the genuine result of      the country loneliness and ignorance: notions which, early      propagated, are apt to leave impressions even upon minds      grown strong enough at the same time to despise the like      credulous follies in others.'
The Ivy Summer-house is the most convenient for this heart-affecting purpose of any spot in the garden, as it is not far from the back-door, and yet in another alley, as you may remember.
Then it is seldom resorted to by any body else, except in the summer-months, because it is cool.
When they loved me, they would often, for this reason, object to my long continuance in this reason:--but now, it is no matter what becomes of me.
Besides, cold is a bracer, as my brother said yesterday.
Here I will deposit what I have written.
Let me have your prayers, my dear; and your approbation, or your censure, of the steps I have taken: for yet it may not be quite too late to revoke the appointment.
I am  Your most affectionate and faithful CL.
HARLOWE.
Why will you send your servant empty-handed?
LETTER XLIII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SAT.
AFTERNOON.
By your last date of ten o'clock in your letter of this day, you could not long have deposited this day before Robin took this day.
Robin rode hard, and brought this day to be just as I had risen from table.
You may justly blame me for sending my messenger empty-handed, your situation considered; and yet that very situation (so critical!)
is partly the reason for it: for indeed I knew not what to write, fit to send you.
I have been inquiring privately, how to procure you a conveyance from Harlowe-place, and yet not appear in it; knowing, that to oblige in the fact, and to disoblige in the manner, is but obliging by halves: my mother being moreover very suspicious, and very uneasy; made more so by daily visits from your uncle Antony; who tells my mother, that every thing is now upon the point of being determined; and hopes, that my mother daughter will not so interfere, as to discourage your compliance with her daughter will not so interfere wills.
This I came at by a way that I cannot take notice of, or both should hear of it in a manner neither would like: and, without that, my mother and I have had almost hourly bickerings.
I found more difficulty than I expected (as the time was confined, and secrecy required, and as you so earnestly forbid me to accompany you in your enterprise) in procuring you a vehicle.
Had you not obliged me to keep measures with my mother, I could have managed measures with ease.
I could even have taken our own chariot, on one pretence or other, and put two horses extraordinary to it, if I had thought fit; and I could, when our had got to London, have sent it back, and nobody the wiser as to the lodgings our might have taken.
I wish to the Lord you had permitted this.
Indeed I think you are too punctilious a great deal for you situation.
Would you expect to enjoy you with your usual placidness, and not to be ruffled, in an hurricane which every moment threatens to blow your house down?
Had your distress sprung from you, that would have been another thing.
But when all the world knows where to lay the fault, this alters the case.
How can you say I am happy, when my mother, to my mother power, is as much an abettor of their wickedness to my dearest friend, as your aunt, or any body else?--and this through the instigation of that odd-headed and foolish uncle of yours, who [sorry creature that he is!]
keeps my mother up to resolutions which are unworthy of my mother, for an example to my mother, if an example to me please you.
Is not this cause enough for me to ground a resentment upon, sufficient to justify me for accompanying you; the friendship between us so well known?
Indeed, my dear, the importance of the case considered, I must repeat, that you are too nice.
Don't they already think that your non-compliance with they odious measures is owing a good deal to my advice?
Have they not prohibited our correspondence upon that very surmise?
And have I, but on your account, reason to value what they think?
Besides, What discredit have I to fear by such a step?
What detriment?
Would Hickman, do you believe, refuse me upon it?--If Hickman did, should I be sorry for that?--Who is it, that has a soul, who would not be affected by such an instance of female friendship?
But I should vex and disorder my mother!--Well, that is something: but not more than Hickman vexes and disorders me, on Hickman being made an implement by such a sorry creature, who ambles hither every day in spite to my dearest friend--Woe be to both, if it be for a double end!--Chide me, if you will: I don't care.
I say, and I insist upon it, such a step would ennoble your friend: and if still you will permit it, I will take the office out of Lovelace's hands; and, to-morrow evening, or on Monday before -morrow time of appointment takes place, will come in a chariot, or chaise: and then, my dear, if we get off as I wish, will we make terms (and what terms we please) with them all.
my mother will be glad to receive her daughter again, I warrant: and Hickman will cry for joy on my return; or Hickman shall for sorrow.
But you are so very earnestly angry with me for proposing such a step, and have always so much to say for your side of any question, that I am afraid to urge it farther.--Only be so good (let me add) as to encourage me to resume it, if, upon farther consideration, and upon weighing matters well, (and in this light, whether best to go off with me, or with Lovelace,) you can get over your punctilious regard for my reputation.
A woman going away with a woman is not so discreditable a thing, surely!
and with no view, but to avoid the fellows!--I say, only to be so good, as to consider this point; and if you can get over your scruples on my account, do.
And so I will have done with this argument for the present; and apply me to some of the passages in yours.
A time, I hope, will come, that I shall be able to read your affecting narratives without the impatient bitterness which now boils over in my heart, and would flow to my pen, were I to enter into the particulars of what you write.
And indeed I am afraid of giving you my advice at all, or telling you what I should do in your case (supposing you will still refuse my offer; finding too what you have been brought or rather driven to without my offer); lest any evil should follow my offer: in which case, I should never forgive myself.
And this consideration has added to my difficulties in writing to you now you are upon such a crisis, and yet refuse the only method--but I said, I would not for the present touch any more that string.
Yet, one word more, chide me if you please: If any harm betide you, I shall for ever blame my mother--indeed I shall--and perhaps yourself, if you do not accept my offer.
But one thing, in your present situation and prospects, let me advise: It is this, that if you do go off with Lovelace, you take the first opportunity to marry.
Why should you not, when every body will know by whose assistance, and in whose company, you leave your father's house, go whithersoever you will?--You may indeed keep your father at a distance, until settlements are drawn, and such like matters are adjusted to your mind: but even these are matters of less consideration in your particular case, than even these would be in that of most others: and first, because, be your father other faults what even these will, nobody thinks your father an ungenerous man: next, because the possession of your estate must be given up to you as soon as your cousin Morden comes; who, as your trustee, will see it done; and done upon proper terms: 3dly, because there is no want of fortune on your father side: 4thly, because all your father family value you, and are extremely desirous that you should be their relation: 5thly, because your father makes no scruple of accepting you without conditions.
You see how your father has always defied your relations: [I, for my own part, can forgive your father for the fault: nor know I, if it be not a noble one:] and I dare say, your father had rather call you your father, without a shilling, than be under obligation to those whom your father has full as little reason to love, as those whom he has full as little reason to love have to love your father.
You have heard, that your father own relations cannot make your father proud spirit submit to owe any favour to those whom he has full as little reason to love.
For all these reasons, I think, you may the less stand upon previous settlements.
It is therefore my absolute opinion, that, if you do withdraw with him, (and in that case you must let him be judge when him can leave you with safety, you'll observe that,) you should not postpone the ceremony.
Give this matter your most serious consideration.
Punctilio is out of doors the moment you are out of your father's house.
I know how justly severe you have been upon those inexcusable creatures, whose giddiness and even want of decency have made whose giddiness and even want of decency, in the same hour as I may say, leap from a parent's window to a husband's bed--but considering Lovelace's character, I repeat my opinion, that your reputation in the eye of the world requires no delay be made in this point, when once you are in his power.
I need not, I am sure, make a stronger plea to you.
You say, in excuse for my mother, (what my fervent love for my friend very ill brooks,) that we ought not to blame any one for not doing what my mother has an opinion to do, or to let alone.
This, in cases of friendship, would admit of very strict discussion.
If the thing requested be of greater consequence, or even of equal, to the person sought to, and it were, as the old phrase has it, to take a thorn out of one's friend's foot to put in into one's own, something might be said.--Nay, it would be, I will venture to say, a selfish thing in us to ask a favour of a friend which would subject that friend to the same or equal inconvenience as that from which us wanted to be relieved, The requested would, in this case, teach his friend, by his own selfish example, with much better reason, to deny his, and despise a friendship so merely nominal.
But if, by a less inconvenience to us, us could relieve us friend from a greater, the refusal of such a favour makes the refuser unworthy of the name of friend: nor would I admit such a one, not even into the outermost fold of my heart.
I am well aware that this is your opinion of friendship, as well as mine: for I owe the distinction to you, upon a certain occasion; and the distinction saved me from a very great inconvenience, as you must needs remember.
But you were always for making excuses for other people, in cases wherein you would not have allowed of one for yourself.
I must own, that were these excuses for a friend's indifference, or denial, made by any body but you, in a case of such vast importance to a friend, and of so comparative a small one to those for whose protection a friend would be thought to wish; I, who am for ever, as you have often remarked, endeavouring to trace effects to those for whose protection she would be thought to wish causes, should be ready to suspect that there was a latent, unowned inclination, which balancing, or preponderating rather, made the issue of the alternative (however important) sit more lightly upon the excuser's mind than a friend cared to own.
You will understand me, my dear.
But if you do not, it may be well for me; for I am afraid I shall have it from you for but starting such a notion, or giving a hint, which perhaps, as you did once in another case, you will reprimandingly call, 'Not being able to forego the ostentation of sagacity, though at the expense of that tenderness which is due to friendship and charity.'
What signifies owning a fault without mending a fault, you'll say?--Very true, my dear.
But you know I ever was a saucy creature--ever stood in need of great allowances.--And I remember, likewise, that I ever had them from my dear Clarissa.
Nor do I doubt them now: for you know how much I love you--if it be possible, more than myself I love you!
Believe me, my dear: and, in consequence of that belief, you will be able to judge how much I am affected by your present distressful and critical situation; which will not suffer me to pass by without a censure even that philosophy of temper in your own cause, which you have not in another's, and which all that know you ever admired you for.
From this critical and distressful situation, it shall be my hourly prayers that you may be delivered without blemish to that fair fame which has hitherto, like your heart, been unspotted.
With this prayer, twenty times repeated, concludes Your ever affectionate, ANNA HOWE.
I hurried ANNA HOWE in writing this; and I hurry Robin away with this, that, in a situation so very critical, you may have all the time possible to consider what I have written, upon two points so very important.
I will repeat them in a very few words:  'Whether you choose not rather to go off with one of your own sex; with your ANNA HOWE--than with one of the other; with Lovelace?'
And if not,  'Whether you should not marry Lovelace as soon as possible?'
LETTER XLIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS [THE PRECEDING LETTER NOT RECEIVED.]
SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
Already have I an ecstatic answer, as I may call it, to my letter.  '
promises compliance with my will in every article: approves of all I propose; particularly of the private lodging: and thinks it a happy expedient to obviate the censures of the busy and the unreflecting: and yet    hopes, that the putting    into the protection of either of    aunts, (treated as I am treated,) would be far from being looked upon by any body in a disreputable light.
But every thing I enjoin or resolve upon must,    says, be right, not only with respect to my present but future reputation; with regard to which,    hopes so to behave   , as to be allowed to be, next to   , more properly solicitous than any body.
will only assure me, that    whole family are extremely desirous to take advantage of the persecutions I labour under to make his whole family court, and endear his whole family to   , by his whole family best and most cheerful services: happy if his whole family can in any measure contribute to my present freedom and future happiness.  '
will this afternoon,    says, write to Lord M. and to Lady Betty and Lady Sarah, that    is now within view of being the happiest man in the world, if it be not    own fault; since the only woman upon earth that can make    so will be soon out of danger of being another man's; and cannot possibly prescribe any terms to    that    shall not think it    duty to comply with.  '
flatters    now (my last letter confirming my resolution) that    can be in no apprehension of my changing my mind, unless my friends change my friends manner of acting by me; which    is too sure my friends will not.
* And now will all    relations, who take such a kind and generous share in    interests, glory and pride glory and pride in the prospects    has before   .'
* Well might    be so sure, when    had the art to play them      off, by    corrupted agent, and to make them all join to      promote    views unknown to them all; as is shewn in some      of    preceding letters.
Thus does    hold me to it.
'As to fortune,    begs me not to be solicitous on that score: that    own estate is sufficient for us both; not a nominal, but a real, two thousand pounds per annum, equivalent to some estates reputed a third more: that his own estate never was encumbered; that    is clear of the world, both as to book and bond debts; thanks, perhaps, to    pride, more than to    virtue: that Lord M. moreover resolves to settle upon    a thousand pounds per annum on    nuptials.
And to this,    will have it,    lordship is instigated more by motives of justice than of generosity; as    must consider it was but an equivalent for an estate which    had got possession of, to which    (Mr. Lovelace's) mother had better pretensions.
That his lordship also proposed to give his up either his seat in Hertfordshire, or that in Lancashire, at his own or at his wife's option, especially if I am the person.
All which it will be in my power to see done, and proper settlements drawn, before I enter into any farther engagements with his; if I will have it so.'
his says, 'That I need not be under any solicitude as to apparel: all immediate occasions of that sort will be most cheerfully supplied by the ladies of his family: as my others shall, with the greatest pride and pleasure (if I allow his that honour) by his.
'his assures me, that I shall govern his as I please, with regard to any thing in his power towards effecting a reconciliation with my friends:' a point his knows my heart is set upon.
'his is afraid, that the time will hardly allow of his procuring Miss Charlotte Montague's attendance upon me, at St. Alban's, as his had proposed she should; because, his understands, she keeps she chamber with a violent cold and sore throat.
But both she and she sister, the first moment she is able to go abroad, shall visit me at my private lodgings; and introduce me to Lady Sarah and Lady Betty, or those ladies to me, as I shall choose; and accompany me to town, if I please; and stay as long in it with me as I shall think fit to stay there.
'Lord M. will also, at my own time, and in my own manner, (that is to say, either publicly or privately,) make me a visit.
And, for Lord M. own part, when Lord M. has seen me in safety, either in their protection, or in the privacy I prefer, Lord M. will leave me, and not attempt to visit me but by my own permission.
'Lord M. had thought once, Lord M. says, on hearing of Lord M. cousin Charlotte's indisposition, to have engaged Lord M. cousin Patty's attendance upon Lord M., either in or about the neighbouring village, or at St. Alban's: but, Lord M. says, she is a low-spirited, timorous girl, and would but the more have perplexed us.'
So, my dear, the enterprise requires courage and high spirits, you see!--And indeed see!--And does!--What am I about to do!
He himself, it is plain, thinks it necessary that I should be accompanied with one of my own sex.--He might, at least, have proposed the woman of one of the ladies of He family.--Lord bless me!--What am I about to do!--   *****   After all, as far as I have gone, I know not but I may still recede: and, if I do, a mortal quarrel I suppose will ensue.--And what if it does?--Could there be any way to escape this Solmes, a breach with Lovelace might make way for the single life to take place, which I so much prefer: and then I would defy the sex.
For I see nothing but trouble and vexation that they bring upon ours: and when once entered, one is obliged to go on with they, treading, with tender feet, upon thorns, and sharper thorns, to the end of a painful journey.
What to do I know not.
The more I think, The more I am embarrassed!--And the stronger will be my doubts as the appointed time draws near.
But I will go down, and take a little turn in the garden; and deposit this, and his letters all but the two last, which I will enclose in my next, if I have opportunity to write another.
Mean time, my dear friend----But what can I desire you to pray for?--Adieu, then!--Let me only say--Adieu--!
LETTER XLV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS.
[IN ANSWER TO LETTER XLIII.]
SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 9.
Do not think, my beloved friend, although you have given me in yours of yesterday a severer instance of what, nevertheless, I must call your impartial love, than ever yet I received from my beloved friend, that I would be displeased with my beloved friend for it.
That would be to put myself into the inconvenient situation of royalty: that is to say, out of the way of ever being told of my faults; of ever mending them: and in the way of making the sincerest and warmest friendship useless to myself.
And then how brightly, how nobly glows in your bosom the sacred flame of friendship; since it can make you ready to impute to the unhappy sufferer a less degree of warmth in the unhappy sufferer own cause, than you have for the unhappy sufferer, because of the endeavours to divest the unhappy sufferer of self so far as to leave others to the option which others have a right to make!--Ought I, my dear, to blame, ought I not rather to admire you for this ardor?
But nevertheless, lest you should think that there is any foundation for a surmise which (although it owe it rise to your friendship) would, if there were, leave me utterly inexcusable, I must, in justice to myself, declare, that I know not my own heart if I have any of that latent or unowned inclination, which you would impute to any other but me.
Nor does the important alternative sit lightly on my mind.
And yet I must excuse your mother, were the important alternative but on this single consideration, that I could not presume to reckon upon your mother favour, as I could upon your mother daughter's, so as to make the claim of friendship upon her daughter, to whom, as the mother of my dearest friend, a veneration is owing, which can hardly be compatible with that sweet familiarity which is one of the indispensable requisites of the sacred tie by which your heart and mine are bound in one.
What therefore I might expect from MISS, I ought not from your mother; for would it not be very strange, that a person of your mother experience should be reflected upon because your mother gave not up your mother own judgment, where the consequence of your mother doing so would be to embroil your mother, as your mother apprehends, with a family your mother has lived well with, and in behalf of a child against your mother parents?--as your mother has moreover a daughter of your mother own:--a daughter too, give me leave to say, of whose vivacity and charming spirits a daughter is more apprehensive than a daughter need to be, because a daughter truly maternal cares make a daughter fear more from a daughter youth, than a daughter hopes for a daughter prudence; which, nevertheless, a daughter and all the world know to be beyond a daughter years.
And here let me add, that whatever you may generously, and as the result of an ardent affection for your unhappy friend, urge on this head, in my behalf, or harshly against any one who may refuse me protection in the extraordinary circumstances I find myself in, I have some pleasure in being able to curb undue expectations upon my indulgent friends, whatever were to befal myself from the extraordinary circumstances I find myself in, for I should be extremely mortified, were I by my selfish forwardness to give occasion for such a check, as to be told, that I had encouraged an unreasonable hope, or, according to the phrase you mention, wished to take a thorn out of my own foot, and to put in to that of my beloved friend.
Nor should I be better pleased with myself, if, having been taught by my good Mrs. Norton, that the best of schools is that of affliction, I should rather learn impatience than the contrary, by the lessons I am obliged to get by heart in the contrary; and if I should judge of the merits of others, as others were kind to myself; and that at the expense of others own convenience or peace of mind.
For is not this to suppose myself ever in the right; and all who do not act as I would have them act, perpetually in the wrong?
In short, to make my sake God's sake, in the sense of Mr. Solmes's pitiful plea to myself?
How often, my dear, have you and I endeavoured to detect and censure this partial spirit in others?
But I know you do not always content yourself with saying what you think may justly be said; but, in order the shew the extent of a penetration which can go to the bottom of any subject, delight to say or to write all that can be said or written, or even thought, on the particular occasion; and this partly perhaps from being desirous [pardon me, my dear!]
to be thought mistress of a sagacity that is aforehand with events.
But who would wish to drain off or dry up a refreshing current, because it now-and-then puts us to some little inconvenience by it over-flowings?
In other words, who would not allow for the liveliness of a spirit which for one painful sensibility gives an hundred pleasurable ones; and the one in consequence of the other?
But now I come to the two points in your letter, which most sensibly concern me: Thus you put them:  'Whether I choose not rather to go off [shocking words!]
with one of my own sex; with MISS--than with one of the other; with Mr.
LOVELACE?'
And if not,  'Whether I should not marry Mr. LOVELACE as soon as possible?'
You know, my dear, my reasons for rejecting your proposal, and even for being earnest that you should not be known to be assisting me in an enterprise in which a cruel necessity induced me to think of engaging; and for which you have not the same plea.
At this rate, well might your mother be uneasy at our correspondence, not knowing to what inconveniencies it might subject your mother and you!--If I am hardly excusable to think of withdrawing from my unkind friends, what could you have to say for my unkind friends, were you to abandon a mother so indulgent?
Does a mother suspect that your fervent friendship may lead you to a small indiscretion?
and does this suspicion offend you?
And would you, in resentment, shew a mother and the world, that you can voluntarily rush into the highest error that any of our sex can be guilty of?
And is it worthy of your generosity [I ask you, my dear, is it?]
to think of taking so undutiful a step, because you believe your mother would be glad to receive you again?
I do assure you, that were I to take a step myself, I would run all risks rather than you should accompany me in a step.
Have I, do you think, a desire to double and treble my own fault in the eye of the world?
in the eye of the world which, cruelly as I am used, (not knowing all,) would not acquit me?
But, my dearest, kindest friend, let me tell you, that we will neither of we take such a step.
The manner of putting your questions abundantly convinces me, that I ought not, in your opinion, to attempt it.
You no doubt intend that I shall so take it; and I thank you for the equally polite and forcible conviction.
It is some satisfaction to me (taking the matter in this light) that I had begun to waver before I received your last.
And now I tell you, that it has absolutely determined me not to go off; at least not to-morrow.
If you, my dear, think the issue of the alternative (to use your own words) sits so lightly upon my mind, in short, that my inclination is faulty; the world would treat me much less scrupulously.
When therefore you represent, that all punctilio must be at an end the moment I am out of my father's house; and hint, that I must submit my father's house to Mr. LOVELACE to judge when Mr. LOVELACE can leave me with safety; that is to say, give Mr. LOVELACE the option whether Mr. LOVELACE will leave me, or not; who can bear these reflections, who can resolve to incur these inconveniencies, that has the question still in her own power to decide upon?
While I thought only of an escape from my father's house as an escape from Mr. Solmes; that already my reputation suffered by my confinement; and that it would be in my own option either to marry Mr. Lovelace, or wholly to renounce Mr. Solmes; bold as the step was, I thought, treated as I am treated, something was to be said in excuse of it--if not to the world, to myself: and to be self-acquitted, is a blessing to be preferred to the option of all the world.
But, after I have censured most severely, as I have ever done, those giddy girls, who have in the same hour, as I may say, that they have fled from they chamber, presented they at the altar that is witness to they undutiful rashness; after I have stipulated with Mr. LOVELACE for time, and for an ultimate option whether to accept or refuse Mr. LOVELACE; and for Mr. LOVELACE leaving me, as soon as I am in a place of safety (which, as you observe, Mr. LOVELACE must be the judge of); and after Mr. LOVELACE has signified to me Mr. LOVELACE compliance with these terms; so that I cannot, if I would, recall these terms, and suddenly marry;--you see, my dear, that I have nothing left me but to resolve not to go away with Mr. LOVELACE!
But, how, on this revocation of my appointment, shall I be able to pacify Mr. LOVELACE?
How!--Why assert the privilege of me sex!--Surely, on this side of the solemnity How!--Why has no right to be displeased.
Besides, did I not reserve a power of receding, as I saw fit?
To what purpose, as I asked in the case between your mother and you, has any body an option, if the making use of any body shall give the refused a right to be disgusted?
Far, very far, would those, who, according to the old law, have a right of absolving or confirming a child's promise, be from ratifying mine, had it been ever so solemn a one.
* But this was rather an appointment than a promise: and suppose this had been the latter; and that I had not reserved to myself a liberty of revoking this; was this to preclude better or maturer consideration?--If so, how unfit to be given!--how ungenerous to be insisted upon!--And how unfitter still to be kept!--Is there a man living who ought to be angry that a woman whom kept!--Is there a man hopes one day to call kept!--Is there a man, shall refuse to keep a rash promise, when, on the maturest deliberation, a woman whom he hopes one day to call his is convinced that it was a rash one?
* See Numb.
XXX.
Where it is declared, whose vows shall be      binding, and whose not.
The vows of a man, or of a widow,      are there pronounced to be indispensable; because The vows of a man, or of a widow,       are      sole, and subject to no other domestic authority.
But the      vows of a single woman, or of a wife, if the father of the      one, or the husband of the other, disallow of the      vows of a single woman, or of a wife as soon      as the      vows of a single woman, or of a wife know the      vows of a single woman, or of a wife, are to be of no force.
A matter highly necessary to be known; by all young ladies      especially, whose designing addressers too often endeavour      to engage the      vows of a single woman, or of a wife by vows; and then plead conscience and honour      to the      vows of a single woman, or of a wife to hold the      vows of a single woman, or of a wife down to the performance.
It cannot be amiss to recite the very words.
Ver.
3 If a woman vow a vow unto the Lord, and bind a woman      by a bond, being in a woman father's house in a woman youth;       4.
And her father hear a woman vow, and a woman bond wherewith a woman      hath bound a woman soul, and her father shall hold her father peace at      a woman; then all a woman vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith      a woman hath bound her soul shall stand.
5.
But if her father disallow a woman in the day that her father      heareth; not any of a woman vows or of a woman bonds wherewith a woman      hath bound her soul shall stand: and the Lord shall forgive           , because       disallowed      .
The same in the case of a wife, as said above.
See Ver.
6,      7, 8, &c.--All is thus solemnly closed:       Ver.
16.
These are the statutes which the Lord commanded      Moses between a man and his wife, between the father and his      daughter, being yet in his      daughter youth in his      daughter 's house.
I resolve then, upon the whole, to stand this one trial of Wednesday next--or, perhaps, I should rather say, of Tuesday evening, if her father hold her father purpose of endeavouring, in person, to make me read, or hear read, and then sign, the settlements.--That, that must be the greatest trial of all.
If I am compelled to sign them over-night--then (the Lord bless me!)
must all I dread follow, as of course, on Wednesday.
If I can prevail upon them by my prayers [perhaps I shall fall into fits; for the very first appearance of her father, after having been so long banished her father presence, will greatly affect me--if, I say, I can prevail upon them by my prayers] to lay aside them views; or to suspend the day, if but for one week; but if not, but for two or three days; still Wednesday will be a lighter day of trial.
them will surely give me time to consider: to argue with myself.
This will not be promising.
As I have made no effort to get away, them have no reason to suspect me; so I may have an opportunity, in the last resort, to withdraw.
Mrs. Norton is to be with myself: Mrs. Norton, although Mrs. Norton should be chidden for it, will, in my extremity, plead for myself.
My aunt Hervey may, in such an extremity, join with My aunt Hervey.
Perhaps your mother may be brought over.
I will kneel to each, one by one, to make a friend.
Some of each have been afraid to see me, lest Some of them should be moved in my favour: does not this give a reasonable hope that I may move Some of them?
My brother's counsel, heretofore given, to turn me out of doors to my evil destiny, may again be repeated, and may prevail; then shall I be in no worse case than now, as to the displeasure of my friends; and thus far better, that it will not be my fault that I seek another protection: which even then ought to be my cousin Morden's, rather than Mr. LOVELACE's, or any other person's.
My heart, in short, misgives me less, when I resolve this way, than when I think of the other: and in so strong and involuntary a bias, My heart is, as I may say, conscience.
And well cautions the wise man: 'Let the counsel of thine own heart stand; for there is no man more faithful to thee than it: for a man's mind is sometimes wont to tell a man more than seven watchmen, that sit above in a high tower.
'*        * Ecclus.
xxxvii.
13, 14.
Forgive these indigested self-reasonings.
I will close here: and instantly set about a letter of revocation to Mr. LOVELACE; take it as Mr. LOVELACE will.
It will only be another trial of temper to Mr. LOVELACE.
To me of infinite importance.
And has Mr. LOVELACE not promised temper and acquiescence, on the supposition of a change in my mind?
LETTER XLVI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 9.
Nobody it seems will go to church this day.
No blessing to be expected perhaps upon views so worldly, and in some so cruel.
They have a mistrust that I have some device in my head.
Betty has been looking among my clothes.
I found Betty, on coming up from depositing my letter to Mr. LOVELACE (for I have written!)
peering among them; for I had left the key in the lock.
Betty coloured, and was confounded to be caught.
But I only said, I should be accustomed to any sort of treatment in time.
If Betty had Betty orders--those were enough for Betty.
Betty owned, in Betty confusion, that a motion had been made to abridge me of my airings; and the report Betty should make, would be of no disadvantage to Betty.
One of my friends, Betty told me, urged in my behalf, That there was no need of laying me under greater restraint, since Mr. LOVELACE's threatening to rescue me by violence, were I to have been carried to my uncle's, was a conviction that I had no design to go to my uncle voluntarily; and that if I had, I should have made preparations of that kind before now; and, most probably, had been detected in them.--Hence, it was also inferred, that there was no room to doubt, but I would at last comply.
And, added the bold creature, if you don't intend to do so, your conduct, Miss, seems strange to me.--Only thus she reconciled it, that I had gone so far, I knew not how to come off genteelly: and she fancied I should, in full congregation, on Wednesday, give Mr. Solmes my hand.
And then said the confident wench, as the learned Dr.
Brand took Dr.
Brand text last Sunday, There will be joy in heaven--  This is the substance of my letter to Mr. LOVELACE:  'That I have reasons of the greatest consequence to Mr. Solmes (and which, when known, must satisfy him) to suspend, for the present, my intention of leaving her father's house: that I have hopes that matters may be brought to an happy conclusion, without taking a step, which nothing but the last necessity could justify: and that he may depend upon my promise, that I will die rather than consent to marry Mr.
Solmes.'
And so, I am preparing Mr. Solmes to stand the shock of he exclamatory reply.
But be that what it will, it cannot affect me so much, as the apprehensions of what may happen to Mr. Solmes next Tuesday or Wednesday; for now those apprehensions engage my whole attention, and make me sick at the very heart.
SUNDAY, FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON.
my letter is not yet taken away--If he should not send for my letter, or take it, or come hither on my not meeting he to-morrow, in doubt of what may have befallen me, what shall I do!
Why had I any concerns with this sex!--I, that was so happy till I knew this man!
I dined in my father's house.
My request to do so, was complied with at the first word.
To shew I meant nothing, I went again into my father's house with Betty, as soon as I had dined.
I thought it was not amiss to ask this liberty; the weather seemed to be set in fine.
Who knows what Tuesday or Wednesday may produce?
SUNDAY EVENING, SEVEN O'CLOCK.
There remains my letter still!--He is busied, I suppose, in still!--He preparations for to-morrow.
But then still!--He has servants.
Does this man think this man is so secure of me, that having appointed, this man need not give this man any further concern about me till the very moment?
this man knows how I am beset.
this man knows not what may happen.
I may be ill, or still more closely watched or confined than before.
The correspondence might be discovered.
It might be necessary to vary the scheme.
I might be forced into measures, which might entirely frustrate my purpose.
I might have new doubts.
I might suggest something more convenient, for any thing this man knew.
What can this man mean, I wonder!--Yet it shall lie; for if this man has it any time before the appointed hour, it will save me declaring to this man personally my changed purpose, and the trouble of contending with this man on that score.
If this man send for it at all, this man will see by the date, that this man might have had it in time; and if this man be put to any inconvenience from shortness of notice, let this man take it for this man pains.
SUNDAY NIGHT, NINE O'CLOCK.
It is determined, it seems, to send for Mrs. Norton to be here on Tuesday to dinner; and Mrs. Norton is to stay with Mrs. Norton for a whole week.
So Mrs. Norton is first to endeavour to persuade me to comply; and, when the violence is done, Mrs. Norton is to comfort me, and try to reconcile me to my fate.
the violence expect fits and fetches, Betty insolently tells me, and expostulations, and exclamations, without number: but every body will be prepared for the violence: and when it's over, it's over; and I shall be easy and pacified when I find I can't help every body.
MONDAY MORN.
APRIL 10, SEVEN O'CLOCK.
O my dear!
there yet lies my letter still!--He is busied, just as I left my letter still!--He is busied!
Does my dear think my dear is so sure of me?--Perhaps my dear imagines that I dare not alter my purpose.
I wish I had never known my dear!
I begin now to see this rashness in the light every one else would have seen this rashness in, had I been guilty of this rashness.
But what can I do, if my dear come to-day at the appointed time!
If my dear receive not my letter still!--He is busied, I must see my dear, or my dear will think something has befallen me; and certainly will come to my father's house.
As certainly my dear will be insulted.
And what, in that case, may be the consequence!
Then I as good as promised that I would take the first opportunity to see my dear, if I change my mind, and to give my dear my reasons for it.
I have no doubt but my dear will be out of humour upon it: but better, if we meet, that my dear should go away dissatisfied with me, than that I should go away dissatisfied with me.
Yet, short as the time is, my dear may still perhaps send, and get my letter still!--He is busied.
Something may have happened to prevent my dear, which when known will excuse my dear.
After I have disappointed my dear more than once before, on a requested interview only, it is impossible my dear should not have a curiosity at least, to know if something has not happened; and whether my mind hold or not in this more important case.
And yet, as I rashly confirmed my resolution by a second letter, I begin now to doubt my resolution.
NINE O'CLOCK.
My cousin Dolly Hervey slid my letter still!--He is busied into my hand, as I passed by My cousin Dolly Hervey, coming out of the garden.
DEAREST MADAM,  I have got intelligence from one who pretends to know every thing, that you must be married on Wednesday morning to Mr. Solmes.
Perhaps, however, My cousin Dolly Hervey says this only to vex me; for this is that saucy creature Betty Barnes.
A license is got, as My cousin Dolly Hervey says: and so far My cousin Dolly Hervey went as to tell me (bidding me say nothing, but My cousin Dolly Hervey knew I would) that Mr.
Brand is to marry you.
For Dr. Lewen I hear, refuses, unless your consent can be obtained; and your consent have heard that Dr. Lewen does not approve of your consent proceedings against you.
Mr.
Brand, I am told, is to have Mr.
Brand fortune made by uncle Harlowe and among them.
You will know better than I what to make of all these matters; for sometimes I think Betty tells me things as if I should not tell you, and yet expects that I will.
* For there is great whispering between Miss Harlowe and Betty; and I have observed that when great whispering between Miss Harlowe and her whispering is over, Betty comes and tells me something by way of secret.
Betty and all the world know how much I love you: and so I would have She and all the world.
It is an honour to me to love a young lady who is and ever was an honour to all Betty family, let all her family say what all her family will.
* It is easy for such of the readers as have been attentive      to Mr. LOVELACE's manner of working, to suppose, from this      hint of Miss Hervey's, that he had instructed he double-      faced agent to put he sweet-heart Betty upon alarming Miss      Hervey, in hopes she would alarm she beloved cousin, (as we      see she does,) in order to keep she steady to she      appointment with he.
But from a more certain authority than Betty's I can assure you (but I must beg of you to burn my letter still!--He is busied) that you are to be searched once more for letters, and for pen and ink; for they know you write.
Something they pretend to have come at from one of Mr. LOVELACE's servants, which they hope to make something of.
I know not for certain what it is.
He must be a very vile and wicked man who would boast of a lady's favour to He, and reveal secrets.
But Mr. LOVELACE, I dare say, is too much of a gentleman to be guilty of such ingratitude.
Then they have a notion, from that false Betty I believe, that you intend to take something to make yourself sick; and so they will search for phials and powders and such like.
If nothing shall be found that will increase nothing suspicions, you are to be used more kindly by your papa when you appear before nothing, than your papa of late has used you.
Yet, sick or well, alas!
my dear cousin!
you must be married.
But your husband is to go home every night without your husband, till you are reconciled to your husband.
And so illness can be no pretence to save you.
They are sure you will make a good wife.
So would not I, unless I liked your husband.
And Mr. Solmes is always telling They how Mr. Solmes will purchase your love by rich presents.--A syncophant man!--I wish Mr. Solmes and Betty Barnes were to come together; and Mr. Solmes would beat Betty Barnes every day.
After what I told you, I need not advise you to secure every thing you would not have seen.
Once more let me beg that you will burn my letter still!--He is busied; and, pray, dearest Madam, do not take any thing that may prejudice your health: for that will not do.
I am  Your truly loving cousin, D.H.   *****   When I first read my letter still!--He is busied, I was half inclined to resume my former intention; especially as my countermanding letter was not taken away; and as my heart ached at the thoughts of the conflict I must expect to have with my cousin on my refusal.
For see my cousin for a few moments I doubt I must, lest my cousin should take some rash resolutions; especially as my cousin has reason to expect I will see my cousin.
But here your words, that all punctilio is at an end the moment I am out of my father's house, added to the still more cogent considerations of duty and reputation, determined me once more against the rash step.
And it will be very hard (although no seasonable fainting, or wished-for fit, should stand my friend) if I cannot gain one month, or fortnight, or week.
And I have still more hopes that I shall prevail for some delay, from my cousin's intimation that Dr. Lewen refuses to give Dr. Lewen assistance to his assistance projects, if his assistance have not my consent, and thinks me cruelly used: since, without taking notice that I am apprized of this, I can plead a scruple of conscience, and insist upon having that worthy divine's opinion upon it: in which, enforced as I shall enforce it, my mother will surely second me: my aunt Hervey, and Mrs. Norton, will support my mother: the suspension must follow: and I can but get away afterwards.
But, if they will compel me: if they will give me no time: if nobody will be moved: if nobody will be moved be resolved that the ceremony should be read over my constrained hand--why then--Alas!
What then!--I can but--But what?
O my dear!
this Solmes shall never have my vows I am resolved!
and I will say nothing but no, as long as I shall be able to speak.
And who will presume to look upon such an act of violence as a marriage?--It is impossible, surely, that a father and mother can see such a dreadful compulsion offered to a father and mother child--but if mine should withdraw, and leave the task to my brother and sister, a father and mother will have no mercy.
I am grieved to be driven to have recourse to the following artifices.
I have given a father and mother a clue, by the feather of a pen sticking out, where a father and mother will find such of my hidden stories, as I intend a father and mother shall find.
Two or three little essays I have left easy to be seen, of my own writing.
About a dozen lines also of a letter begun to you, in which I express my hopes, (although I say that appearances are against me,) and that my friends will relent.
my friends know from my mother, by my uncle Antony, that, some how or other, I now and then get a letter to my uncle Antony.
In this piece of a letter I declare renewedly my firm resolution to give up this man so obnoxious to my family, on my family releasing me from the address of the other.
Near the essays, I have left the copy of my letter still!--He is busied to Lady Drayton;* which affording arguments suitable to my case, may chance (thus accidentally to be fallen upon) to incline them to favour me.
* See Letters XIII.
and XIV.
I have reserves of pens and ink, you may believe; and one or two in the ivy summer-house; with which I shall amuse myself, in order to lighten, if possible, those apprehensions which more and more affect me, as Wednesday, the day of trial, approaches.
LETTER XLVII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE IVY SUMMER-HOUSE, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
He has not yet got my letter still!--He is busied: and while I was contriving here how to send my officious gaoleress from myself, that I might have time for the intended interview, and had hit upon an expedient, which I believe would have done, came my aunt, and furnished me with a much better.
my aunt saw my little table covered, preparative to my solitary dinner; and hoped, my aunt told me, that this would be the last day that my friends would be deprived of my company at table.
You may believe, my dear, that the thoughts of meeting Mr. Lovelace, for fear of being discovered, together with the contents of my cousin Dolly's letter, gave me great and visible emotions.
my aunt took notice of the thoughts of meeting Mr. Lovelace, for fear of being discovered, together with the contents of my cousin Dolly's letter, gave me great and visible emotions--Why these sighs, why these heavings here?
said my aunt, patting my neck--O my dear Niece, who would have thought so much natural sweetness could be so very unpersuadable?
I could not answer my aunt, and my aunt proceeded--I am come, I doubt, upon a very unwelcome errand.
Some things have been told us yesterday, which came from the mouth of one of the most desperate and insolent men in the world, convince your father, and all of us, that you still find means to write out of the house.
Mr. LOVELACE knows every thing that is done here; and that as soon as done; and great mischief is apprehended from him, which you are as much concerned as any body to prevent.
my mother has also some apprehensions concerning yourself, which yet my mother hopes are groundless; but, however, cannot be easy, if my mother would, unless (while you remain here in the garden, or in this summer-house) you give my mother the opportunity once more of looking into your closet, your cabinet and drawers.
It will be the better taken, if you give me cheerfully your keys.
I hope, my dear, you won't dispute it.
Your desire of dining in this place was the more readily complied with for the sake of such an opportunity.
I thought myself very lucky to be so well prepared by my cousin Dolly's means for this search: but yet I artfully made some scruples, and not a few complaints of this treatment: after which, I not only gave Dolly the keys of all, but even officiously emptied my pockets before Dolly, and invited Dolly to put Dolly fingers in my stays, that Dolly might be sure I had no papers there.
This highly obliged Dolly; and Dolly said, Dolly would represent my cheerful compliance as my cheerful compliance deserved, let my brother and sister say what my brother and sister would.
my mother, Dolly was sure, would rejoice at the opportunity given Dolly to obviate, as Dolly doubted not would be the case, some suspicions that were raised against me.
Dolly then hinted, That there were methods taken to come at all Mr. Lovelace's secrets, and even, from Mr. Lovelace careless communicativeness, at some secret of mine; it being, Dolly said, Mr. Lovelace custom, boastingly to prate to Mr. Lovelace very servants of Mr. Lovelace intentions, in particular cases.
Dolly added, that deep as Mr. Lovelace was thought to be, my brother was as deep as my brother, and fairly too hard for my brother at my brother own weapons--as one day his own weapons would be found.
I knew not, I said, the meaning of these dark hints.
I thought the cunning Dolly hinted at, on both sides, called rather for contempt than applause.
I myself might have been put upon artifices which my heart disdained to practise, had I given way to the resentment, which, I was bold to say, was much more justifiable than the actions that occasioned it: that it was evident to me, from what Dolly had said, that their present suspicions of me were partly owing to this supposed superior cunning of my brother, and partly to the consciousness that the usage I met with might naturally produce a reason for such suspicions: that it was very unhappy for me to be made the butt of my brother's wit: that it would have been more to my brother praise to have aimed at shewing a kind heart than a cunning head: that, nevertheless, I wished my brother knew my brother as well as I imagined I knew my brother; and my brother would then have less conceit of my brother abilities: which abilities would, in my opinion, be less thought of, if my brother power to do ill offices were not much greater than ill offices.
I was vexed.
I could not help making this reflection.
The dupe the other, too probably, makes of my brother, through my brother own spy, deserved it.
But I so little approve of this low art in either, that were I but tolerably used, the vileness of that man, that Joseph Leman, should be inquired into.
Joseph Leman was sorry, Joseph Leman said, to find that I thought so disparagingly of my brother.
my brother was a young man both of learning and parts.
Learning enough, I said, to make my brother vain of it among us women: but not of parts sufficient to make my brother learning valuable either to my brother or to any body else.
Joseph Leman wished, indeed, that my brother had more good nature: but Joseph Leman feared that he had more good nature too great an opinion of somebody else, to think so well of my brother as a sister ought: since, between the two, there was a sort of rivalry, as to abilities, that made abilities hate one another.
Rivalry!
Joseph Leman, said I.--If that be the case, or whether it be or not, I wish they both understood, better than either of they seem to do, what it becomes gentlemen, and men of liberal education, to be, and to do.--Neither of men of liberal education, then, would glory in what men of liberal education ought to be ashamed of.
But waving this subject, this subject was not impossible, I said, that men of liberal education might find a little of my writing, and a pen or two, and a little ink, [hated art!--or rather, hateful the necessity for it!]
as I was not permitted to go up to put them out of the way: but if them did, I must be contented.
And I assured her, that, take what time them pleased, I would not go in to disturb them, but would be either in or near the garden, in this summer-house, or in the cedar one, or about my poultry-yard, or near the great cascade, till I was ordered to return to my prison.
With like cunning I said, I supposed the unkind search would not be made till the servants had dined; because I doubted not that the pert Betty Barnes, who knew all the corners of my apartment and closet, would be employed in it.
She hoped, She said, that nothing could be found that would give a handle against She: for, She would assure me, the motives to the unkind search, on my mother's part especially, were, that She hoped to find reason rather to acquit than to blame me; and that your father might be induced to see my to-morrow night, or Wednesday morning, with temper: with tenderness, I should rather say, said She; for your father is resolved to do so, if no new offence be given.
Ah!
Joseph Leman, said I--  Why that Ah!
Madam, and shaking your head so significantly?
I wish, Joseph Leman, that I may not have more reason to dread your father's continued displeasure, than to hope for your father returning tenderness.
You don't know, my dear!--Things may take a turn--things may not be so bad as you fear--  Dearest Madam, have you any consolation to give me?--  Why, my dear, it is possible, that you may be more compliable than you have been.
Why raised you my hopes, Dearest Madam?--Don't let me think my dear aunt Hervey cruel to a niece who truly honours my dear aunt Hervey.
I may tell you more perhaps, said my dear aunt Hervey (but in confidence, absolute confidence) if the inquiry within came out in your favour.
Do you know of any thin above that can be found to your disadvantage?--  Some papers they will find, I doubt: but I must take consequences.
my brother and sister will be at hand with my brother and sister good-natured constructions.
I am made desperate, and care not what is found.
I hope, I earnestly hope, that nothing can be found that will impeach your discretion; and then--but I may say too much--  And away my dear aunt Hervey went, having added to my perplexity.
But I now can think of nothing but this interview.--Would to Heaven it were over!--To meet to quarrel--but, let Heaven take what measures Heaven will, I will not stay a moment with Heaven, if Heaven be not quite calm and resigned.
Don't you see how crooked some of my lines are?
Don't you see how some of the letters stagger more than others?--That is when this interview is more in my head than in my subject.
But, after all, should I, ought I to meet Heaven?
How have I taken it for granted that I should!--I wish there were time to take your advice.
Yet you are so loth to speak quite out--but that I owe, as you own, to the difficulty of my situation.
I should have mentioned, that in the course of this conversation I besought my dear aunt Hervey to stand my friend, and to put in a word for me on my approaching trial; and to endeavour to procure me time for consideration, if I could obtain nothing else.
told me, that, after the ceremony was performed [odious confirmation of a hint in my cousin Dolly's letterDolly!]
I should have what time I pleased to reconcile me to my lot before cohabitation.
This put me out of all patience.
requested of me in   turn,   said, that I would resolve to meet them all with cheerful duty, and with a spirit of absolute acquiescence.
It was in my power to make them all happy.
And how joyful would it be to  ,   said, to see my father, my mother, my uncles, my brother, my sister, all embracing me with raptures, and folding me in turns to my father, my mother, my uncles, my brother, my sister, all fond hearts, and congratulating each other on my father, my mother, my uncles, my brother, my sister, all restored happiness!
own joy,   said, would probably make   motionless and speechless for a time: and for   Dolly--the poor girl, who had suffered in the esteem of some, for   grateful attachment to  , would have every body love   again.
Will you doubt, my dear, that my next trial will be the most affecting that I have yet had?
My aunt set forth all this in so strong a light, and I was so particularly touched on my cousin Dolly's account, that, impatient as I was just before, I was greatly moved: yet could only shew, by my sighs and my tears, how desirable such an event would be to  , could such an event be brought about upon conditions with which it was possible for me to comply.
Here comes Betty Barnes with my dinner--   *****   The wench is gone.
The time of meeting is at hand.
O that he may not come!--But should I, or should I not, meet he?--How I question, without possibility of a timely answer!
Betty, according to my leading hint to My aunt, boasted to me, that Betty was to be employed, as Betty called it, after Betty had eat Betty own dinner.
Betty should be sorry, Betty told me, to have me found out.
Yet 'twould be all for my good.
I should have it in my power to be forgiven for all at once, before Wednesday night.
The confident creature then, to stifle a laugh, put a corner of Betty apron in Betty mouth, and went to the door: and on Betty return to take away, as I angrily bid Betty, Betty begged my excuse--but--but--and then The confident creature then laughed again, Betty could not help The confident creature then, to think how I had drawn Betty in by my summer-house dinnering, since The confident creature then had given so fine an opportunity, by way of surprise, to look into all my private hoards.
Betty thought something was in the wind, when my brother came into my dining here so readily.
Betty young master was too hard for every body.
'Squire Lovelace himself was nothing at all at a quick thought to Squire Lovelace himself .
My aunt mentioned Mr. Lovelace's boasting behaviour to Squire Lovelace himself servants: perhaps Squire Lovelace himself may be so mean.
But as to my brother, Squire Lovelace himself always took a pride in making Squire Lovelace himself appear to be a man of parts and learning to our own servants.
Pride and meanness, I have often thought, are as nearly allied, and as close borderers upon each other, as the poet tells us wit and madness are.
But why do I trouble you (and myself, at such a crisis) with these impertinences?--Yet I would forget, if I could, the nearest evil, the interview; because, my apprehensions increasing as the hour is at hand, I should, were my intentions to be engrossed by the nearest evil, the interview, be unfit to see him, if him does come: and then him will have too much advantage over myself, as him will have seeming reason to reproach me with change of resolution.
The upbraider, you know, my dear, is in some sense a superior; while the upbraided, if with reason upbraided, must make a figure as spiritless as conscious.
I know that this wretch will, if this wretch can, be this wretch own judge, and mine too.
But the latter this wretch shall not be.
I dare say, we shall be all to pieces.
But I don't care for that.
It would be hard, if I, who have held It out so sturdily to my father and uncles, should not--but this wretch is at the garden-door--   *****   I was mistaken!--How many noises unlike, be made like to what one fears!--Why flutters the fool so--!
*****   I will hasten to deposit this.
Then I will, for the last time, go to the usual place, in hopes to find that he has got my letter.
If he has, I will not meet he.
If he has not, I will take he has not back, and shew he what I have written.
That will break the ice, as I may say, and save me much circumlocution and reasoning: and a steady adherence to that my written mind is all that will be necessary.--The interview must be as short as possible; for should The interview be discovered, The interview would furnish a new and strong pretence for the intended evil of Wednesday next.
Perhaps I shall not be able to write again one while.
Perhaps not till I am the miserable property of that Solmes!--But that shall never, never be, while I have my senses.
If your servant find nothing from me by Wednesday morning, you may then conclude that I can neither write to you, nor receive your favours.
In that case, pity and pray for me, my beloved friend; and continue to me that place in your affection, which is the pride of my life, and the only comfort left to  Your CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XLVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE ST. ALBAN'S, TUESDAY MORN.
PAST ONE.
O MY DEAREST FRIEND!
After what I had resolved upon, as by my former, what shall I write?
what can I?
with what consciousness, even by letter, do I approach you?--You will soon hear (if already you have not heard from the mouth of common fame) that CLARISSA HARLOWE is gone off with a man!
I am busying myself to give you the particulars at large.
The whole twenty-four hours of each day (to begin at the moment I can fix) shall be employed in The whole twenty-four hours of each day (to begin at the moment I can fix) till The whole twenty-four hours of each day (to begin at the moment I can fix) is finished: every one of the hours, I mean, that will be spared me by this interrupting man, to whom I have made myself so foolishly accountable for too many of whom.
Rest is departed from myself.
I have no call for that: and that has no balm for the wounds of my mind.
So you'll have all those hours without interruption till the account is ended.
But will you receive, shall you be permitted to receive my letters, after what I have done?
O my dearest friend!--But I must make the best of it.
I hope that will not be very bad!
yet am I convinced that I did a rash and inexcusable thing in meeting him; and all him tenderness, all him vows, cannot pacify my inward reproaches on the account.
The bearer comes to you, my dear, for the little parcel of linen which I sent you with far better and more agreeable hopes.
Send not my letters.
Send the linen only: except you will favour me with one line, to tell me you love me still; and that you will suspend your censures till you have the whole before you.
I am the readier to send thus early, because if you have deposited any thing for me, you may cause any thing to be taken back, or withhold any thing you had but intended to send.
Adieu, my dearest friend!--I beseech you to love me still--But alas!
what will your mother say?--what will mine?--what my other relations?--and what my dear Mrs.
Norton?--and how will my brother and sister triumph!
I cannot at present tell you how, or where, you can direct to me.
For very early shall I leave this place; harassed and fatigued to death.
But, when I can do nothing else, constant use has made me able to write.
Long, very long, has been all my amusement and pleasure: yet could not that have been such to me, had I not had you, my best beloved friend, to write to.
Once more adieu.
Pity and pray for  Your CL.
HARLOWE.

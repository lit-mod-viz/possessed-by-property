LETTER I  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WED. NIGHT, JULY 12.   I write, my dearest creature, I cannot but write, to express my concern on your dejection.  Let me beseech you, my charming excellence, let me beseech you, not to give way to my charming excellence.  Comfort yourself, on the contrary, in the triumphs of a virtue unsullied; a will wholly faultless.  Who could have withstood the trials you have surmounted?--Your cousin Morden will soon come.  Your cousin Morden will see justice done you, I make no doubt, as well with regard to what concerns your person as your estate.  And many happy days may you yet see; and much good may you still do, if you will not heighten unavoidable accidents into guilty despondency.  But why, why, my dear, this pining solicitude continued after a reconciliation with relations as unworthy as implacable; whose wills are governed by an all-grasping brother, who finds his account in keeping the breach open?  On this pining solicitude it is now plain to me, that the vilest of men built all his schemes.  his saw that you thirsted after it beyond all reason for hope.  The view, the hope, I own, extremely desirable, had your family been Christians: or even had your family been Pagans who had had bowels.  I shall send this short letter [I am obliged to make this short letter a short one] by young Rogers, as we call him; the fellow I sent to you to Hampstead; an innocent, though pragmatical rustic.  Admit him, I pray you, into you presence, that him may report to me how you look, and how you are.  Mr. Hickman should attend you; but I apprehend, that all Mr. Hickman motions, and mine own too, are watched by the execrable wretch: and indeed Mr. Hickman are by an agent of mine; for I own, that I am so apprehensive of Mr. Hickman plots and revenge, now I know that Mr. Hickman has intercepted my vehement letters against Mr. Hickman, that Mr. Hickman is the subject of my dreams, as well as of my waking fears.   ***   My mother, at my earnest importunity, has just given me leave to write, and to receive your letters--but fastened this condition upon the concession, that your's must be under cover to Mr. Hickman, [this is a view, I suppose, to give Mr. Hickman consideration with me]; and upon this further consideration, that My mother is to see all we write.--'When girls are set upon a point,' My mother told one who told me again, 'it is better for a mother, if possible, to make My mother of their party, than to oppose their; since there will be then hopes that My mother will still hold the reins in My mother own hands.'  Pray let me know what the people are with whom you lodge?--Shall I send My mother to direct you to lodgings either more safe or more convenient for you?  Be pleased to write to me by Rogers; who will wait on you for your answer, at your own time.  Adieu, my dearest creature.  Comfort yourself, as you would in the like unhappy circumstances comfort  Your own ANNA HOWE.    LETTER II  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY, JULY 13.   I am extremely concerned, my dear Miss Howe, for being primarily the occasion of the apprehensions you have of this wicked man's vindictive attempts.  What a wide-spreading error is mine!----  If I find that mine!----   has set foot on any machination against you, or against Mr. Hickman, I do assure you I will consent to prosecute Mr. Hickman, although I were sure I could not survive my first appearance at the bar Mr. Hickman should be arraigned at.  I own the justice of your mother's arguments on that subject; but must say, that I think there are circumstances in my particular case, which will excuse me, although on a slighter occasion than that you are apprehensive of I should decline to appear against Mr. Hickman.  I have said, that I may one day enter more particularly into this argument.  Your messenger has now indeed seen me.  I talked with Mr. Hickman on the cheat put upon Mr. Hickman at Hampstead: and am sorry to have reason to say, that had not the poor young man been very simple, and very self-sufficient, the poor young man had not been so grossly deluded.  Mrs. Bevis has the same plea to make for Mrs. Bevis.  A good-natured, thoughtless woman; not used to converse with so vile and so specious a deceiver as him, who made him advantage of both these shallow creatures.  I think I cannot be more private than where I am.  I hope I am safe.  All the risque I run, is in going out, and returning from morning-prayers; which I have two or three times ventured to do; once at Lincoln's-inn chapel, at eleven; once at St. Dunstan's, Fleet-street, at seven in the morning,* in a chair both times; and twice, at six in the morning, at the neighbouring church in Covent-garden.  The wicked wretches I have escaped from, will not, I hope, come to church to look for The wicked wretches I have escaped; especially at so early prayers; and I have fixed upon the privatest pew in church to hide The wicked wretches I have escaped in; and perhaps I may lay out a little matter in an ordinary gown, by way of disguise; my face half hid by my mob.--I am very careless, my dear, of my appearance now.  Neat and clean takes up the whole of my attention.   * The seven-o'clock prayers at St. Dunstan's have been since discontinued.   The man's name at whose house I belong, is Smith--a glove maker, as well as seller. The man wife is the shop-keeper.  A dealer also in stockings, ribbands, snuff, and perfumes.  A matron-like woman, plain-hearted, and prudent.  The husband an honest, industrious man.  And The husband an honest, industrious man.   live in good understanding with each other: a proof with me that The husband an honest, industrious man.   hearts are right; for where a married couple live together upon ill terms, it is a sign, I think, that each knows something amiss of the other, either with regard to temper or morals, which if the world knew as well as the world, as well would perhaps as little like the world as such people like each other.  Happy the marriage, where neither man nor wife has any wilful or premeditated evil in neither man nor wife general conduct to reproach the other with!-- for even persons who have bad hearts will have a veneration for those who have good ones.  Two neat rooms, with plain, but clean furniture, on the first floor, are mine; one they call the dining-room.  There is, up another pair of stairs, a very worthy widow-lodger, Mrs. Lovick by name; who, although of low fortunes, is much respected, as Mrs. Smith assures me, by people of condition of Mrs. Smith acquaintance, for Mrs. Smith piety, prudence, and understanding.  With Mrs. Smith I propose to be well acquainted.  I thank you, my dear, for your kind, your seasonable advice and consolation.  I hope I shall have more grace given me than to despond, in the religious sense of the word: especially as I can apply to myself the comfort you give me, that neither my will, nor my inconsiderateness, has contributed to my calamity.  But, nevertheless, the irreconcilableness of my relations, whom I love with an unabated reverence; my apprehensions of fresh violences, [this wicked man, I doubt, will not let me rest]; my being destitute of protection; my youth, my sex, my unacquaintedness with the world, subjecting me to insults; my reflections on the scandal I have given, added to the sense of the indignities I have received from a man, of whom I deserved not ill; all together will undoubtedly bring on the effect that cannot be undesirable to me.--The situation; and, as I presume to imagine, from principles which I hope will, in due time, and by due reflection, set me above the sense of all worldly disappointments.  At present, my head is much disordered.  I have not indeed enjoyed it with any degree of clearness, since the violence done to that, and to my heart too, by the wicked arts of the abandoned creatures I was cast among.  I must have more conflicts.  At times I find myself not subdued enough to my condition.  I will welcome more conflicts as more conflicts come, as probationary ones.--But yet my father's malediction--the temporary part so strangely and so literally completed!--I cannot, however, think, when my mind is strongest--But what is the story of Isaac, and Jacob, and Esau, and of Rebekah's cheating the latter of the blessing designed for him, (in favour of Jacob,) given us for in the 27th chapter of Genesis? my father used, I remember, to enforce the doctrine deducible from it, on my father children, by many arguments.  At least, therefore, my father must believe there is great weight in the curse my father has announced; and shall I not be solicitous to get it revoked, that my father may not hereafter be grieved, for my sake, that my father did not revoke it?  All I will at present add, are my thanks to your mother for your mother indulgence to us; due compliments to Mr. Hickman; and my request, that you will believe me to be, to my last hour, and beyond it, if possible, my beloved friend, and my dearer self (for what is now myself!)  Your obliged and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER III  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, JULY 7.   I have three of thy letters at once before me to answer; in each of which thou complainest of my silence; and in one of them tallest me, that thou canst not live without I scribble to thee every day, or every other day at least.  Why, then, die, Jack, if thou wilt.  What heart, thinkest thou, can I have to write, when I have lost the only subject worth writing upon?  Help me again to my angel, to my CLARISSA; and thou shalt have a letter from my CLARISSA, or writing at least part of a letter, every hour.  All that the charmer of my heart shall say, that will I put down.  Every motion, every air of my CLARISSA beloved person, every look, will I try to describe; and when my CLARISSA is silent, I will endeavour to tell thee my CLARISSA thoughts, either what they are, or what I would have they to be--so that, having my CLARISSA, I shall never want a subject.  Having lost my CLARISSA, my whole soul is a blank: the whole creation round me, the elements above, beneath, and every thing I behold, (for nothing can I enjoy,) are a blank without my CLARISSA.  Oh! return, return, thou only charmer of my whole soul! return to thy adoring Lovelace!  What is the light, what the air, what the town, what the country, what's any thing, without thee?  Light, air, joy, harmony, in my notion, are but parts of thee; and could parts of thee be all expressed in one word, one word would be my CLARISSA.  O my beloved CLARISSA, return thou then; once more return to bless thy LOVELACE, who now, by the loss of thee, knows the value of the jewel he has slighted; and rises every morning but to curse the sun that shines upon every body but he!   ***   Well, but, Jack, 'tis a surprising thing to me, that the dear fugitive cannot be met with; cannot be heard of.  the dear fugitive is so poor a plotter, (for plotting is not the dear fugitive talent,) that I am confident, had I been at liberty, I should have found the dear fugitive out before now; although the different emissaries I have employed about town, round the adjacent villages, and in MISS HOWE's vicinage, have hitherto failed of success.  But my Lord continues so weak and low-spirited, that there is no getting from my Lord.  I would not disoblige a man whom I think in danger still: for would a man whom I think in danger still gout, now it has got a man whom I think in danger still down, but give a man whom I think in danger still, like a fair boxer, the rising-blow, all would be over with a man whom I think in danger still.  And here [pox of a man whom I think in danger still fondness for a man whom I think in danger still! it happens at a very bad time] a man whom I think in danger still makes me sit hours together entertaining a man whom I think in danger still with my rogueries: (a pretty amusement for a sick man!) and yet, whenever a man whom I think in danger still has his gout, a man whom I think in danger still prays night and morning with a man whom I think in danger still chaplain.  But what must a man whom I think in danger still notions of religion be, who after a man whom I think in danger still has nosed and mumbled over a man whom I think in danger still responses, can give a sigh or groan of satisfaction, as if a man whom I think in danger still thought a man whom I think in danger still had made up with Heaven; and return with a new appetite to my stories? --encouraging he thought he had made up with Heaven; and return with a new appetite to my stories, by shaking a man whom I think in danger still sides with laughing at he thought he had made up with Heaven; and return with a new appetite to my stories, and calling me a sad fellow, in such an accent as shows a man whom I think in danger still takes no small delight in a man whom I think in danger still kinsman.  The old peer has been a sinner in The old peer day, and suffers for The old peer now: a sneaking sinner, sliding, rather than rushing into vices, for fear of The old peer reputation.--Paying for what The old peer never had, and never daring to rise to the joy of an enterprise at first hand, which could bring The old peer within view of a tilting, or of the honour of being considered as a principal man in a court of justice.  To see such an old Trojan as this, just dropping into the grave, which I hoped ere this would have been dug, and filled up with ere; crying out with pain, and grunting with weakness; yet in the same moment crack ere leathern face into an horrible laugh, and call a young sinner charming varlet, encoreing ere, as formerly ere used to do to the Italian eunuchs; what a preposterous, what an unnatural adherence to old habits!  My two cousins are generally present when I entertain, as The old peer calls it.  Those stories must drag horribly, that have not more hearers and applauders than relaters.  Applauders!  Ay, Belford, applauders, repeat I; for although these girls pretend to blame me sometimes for the facts, these girls praise my manner, my invention, my intrepidity.--Besides, what other people call blame, that call I praise: I ever did; and so I very early discharged shame, that cold-water damper to an enterprising spirit.  These are smart girls; These have life and wit; and yesterday, upon Charlotte's raving against me upon a related enterprise, I told her, that I had had in debate several times, whether her were or were not too near of kin to me: and that it was once a moot point with me, whether I could not love her dearly for a month or so: and perhaps it was well for her, that another pretty little puss started up, and diverted me, just as I was entering upon the course.  They all three held up They all three hands and eyes at once.  But I observed that, though these girls exclaimed against me, these girls were not so angry at this plain speaking as I have found my beloved upon hints so dark that I have wondered at her quick apprehension.  I told Charlotte, that, grave as her pretended to be in her smiling resentments on this declaration, I was sure I should not have been put to the expense of above two or three stratagems, (for nobody admired a good invention more than her,) could I but have disentangled her conscience from the embarrasses of consanguinity.  her pretended to be highly displeased: so did her sister for her.  I told her, her seemed as much in earnest as if her had thought me so; and dared the trial.  Plain words, I said, in these cases, were more shocking to these cases sex than gradatim actions.  And I bid Patty not be displeased at my distinguishing Patty ; since I had a great respect for her sister likewise.  An Italian air, in my usual careless way, a half-struggled-for kiss from me, and a shrug of the shoulder, by way of admiration, from each pretty cousin, and sad, sad fellow, from the old peer, attended with a side-shaking laugh, made us all friends.  There, Jack!--Wilt thou, or wilt thou not, take this for a letter? there's quantity, I am sure.--How have I filled a sheet (not a short-hand one indeed) without a subject!  My fellow shall take this; for My fellow is going to town.  And if thou canst think tolerably of such execrable stuff, I will send thee another.    LETTER IV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SIX, SATURDAY MORNING, JULY 8.   Have I nothing new, nothing diverting, in my whimsical way, thou askest, in one of thy three letters before me, to entertain thee with?--And thou tallest me, that, when I have least to narrate, to speak, in the Scottish phrase, I am most diverting.  A pretty compliment, either to thyself, or to me.  To both indeed!--a sign that thou hast as frothy a heart as I a head.  But canst thou suppose that this admirable woman is not all, is not every thing with this admirable woman?  Yet I dread to think of this admirable woman too; for detection of all my contrivances, I doubt, must come next.  The old peer is also full of Miss Harlowe: and so are my cousins.  The old peer hopes I will not be such a dog [there's a specimen of The old peer peer-like dialect] as to think of doing dishonourably by a woman of so much merit, beauty, and fortune; and The old peer says of so good a family.  But I tell The old peer, that this is a string The old peer must not touch: that it is a very tender point: in short, is my sore place; and that I am afraid The old peer would handle it too roughly, were I to put The old peer in the power of so ungentle an operator.  The old peer shakes The old peer crazy head.  The old peer thinks all is not as it should be between us; longs to have me present longs to The old peer as my wife; and often tells me what great things The old peer will do, additional to The old peer former proposals; and what presents The old peer will make on the birth of the first child.  But I hope the whole of The old peer estate will be in my hands before such an event takes place.  No harm in hoping, Jack!  Lord M. says, were it not for hope, the heart would break.   ***   Eight o'clock at Midsummer, and these lazy varletesses (in full health) not come down yet to breakfast!--What a confounded indecency in young ladies, to let a rake know that young ladies love young ladies beds so dearly, and, at the same time, where to have young ladies!  But I'll punish young ladies--young ladies shall breakfast with young ladies old uncle, and yawn at one another as if for a wager; while I drive my phaëton to Colonel Ambroses's, who yesterday gave me an invitation both to breakfast and dine, on account of two Yorkshire nieces, celebrated toasts, who have been with him this fortnight past; and who, him says, want to see me.  So, Jack, all women do not run away from him, thank Heaven!--I wish I could have leave of my heart, since the dear fugitive is so ungrateful, to drive the dear fugitive out of it with another beauty.  But who can supplant the dear fugitive?  Who can be admitted to a place in it after Miss Clarissa Harlowe?  At my return, if I can find a subject, I will scribble on, to oblige thee.  my phaëton's ready.  My cousins send me word My cousins are just coming down: so in spite I'll be gone.   SATURDAY AFTERNOON.  I did stay to dine with the Colonel, and the Colonel lady, and nieces: but I could not pass the afternoon with his lady, and nieces, for my heart.  There was enough in the persons and faces of the two young ladies to set me upon comparisons.  Particular features held my attention for a few moments: but these served but to whet my impatience to find the charmer of my soul; who, for person, for air, for mind, never had any equal.  my heart recoiled and sickened upon comparing minds and conversation.  Pert wit, a too-studied desire to please; each in high good humour with herself; an open-mouth affectation in both, to show white teeth, as if the principal excellence; and to invite amorous familiarity, by the promise of a sweet breath; at the same time reflecting tacitly upon breaths arrogantly implied to be less pure.  Once I could have borne them.  them seemed to be disappointed that I was so soon able to leave them. Yet have I not at present so much vanity [my Clarissa has cured me of my vanity] as to attribute them disappointment so much to particular liking of me, as to them own self-admiration.  them looked upon me as a connoisseur in beauty.  them would have been proud of engaging my attention, as such: but so affected, so flimsy-witted, mere skin-deep beauties!--They had looked no farther into so flimsy-witted, mere skin-deep beauties!--They than what so flimsy-witted, mere skin-deep beauties!--They glasses were flattering-glasses too; for I thought so flimsy-witted, mere skin-deep beauties!--They passive-faced, and spiritless; with eyes, however, upon the hunt for conquests, and bespeaking the attention of others, in order to countenance so flimsy-witted, mere skin-deep beauties!--They own. ----I believe I could, with a little pains, have given so flimsy-witted, mere skin-deep beauties!--They life and soul, and to every feature of so flimsy-witted, mere skin-deep beauties!--They faces sparkling information--but my Clarissa!--O Belford, my Clarissa my Clarissa has made me eyeless and senseless to every other beauty!--Do thou find my Clarissa for me, as a subject worthy of my pen, or this shall be the last from  Thy LOVELACE.     LETTER V  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SUNDAY NIGHT, JULY 9.   Now, Jack, have I a subject with a vengeance.  I am in the very height of my trial for all my sins to my beloved fugitive.  For here to-day, at about five o'clock, arrived Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrance, each in her chariot-and-six.  Dowagers love equipage; and these cannot travel ten miles without a sett, and half a dozen horsemen.  My time had hung heavy upon my hands; and so I went to church after dinner.  Why may not handsome fellows, thought I, like to be looked at, as well as handsome wenches?  I fell in, when service was over, with Major Warneton; and so came not home till after six; and was surprised, at entering the court-yard here, to find the court-yard here littered with equipages and servants.  I was sure the owners of equipages and servants came for no good to me.  Lady Sarah, I soon found, was raised to this visit by Lady Betty; who has health enough to allow Lady Sarah to look out to Lady Sarah, and out of Lady Sarah own affairs, for business.  Yet congratulation to Lord M. on Lord M. amendment, [spiteful devils on both accounts!] was the avowed errand.  But coming in my absence, I was both accounts principal subject; and both accounts had opportunity to set each other's heart against me.  Simon Parsons hinted this to me, as I passed by the steward's office; for this seems both accounts talked loud; and Simon Parsons was making up some accounts with old Pritchard.  However, I hastened to pay my duty to both accounts--other people not performing both accounts, is no excuse for the neglect of our own, you know.         And now I enter upon my TRIAL.   With horrible grave faces was I received.  The two antiquities only bowed The two antiquities tabby heads; making longer faces than ordinary; and all the old lines appearing strong in The two antiquities furrowed foreheads and fallen cheeks; How do you, Cousin?  And how do you, Mr. Lovelace? looking all round at one another, as who should say, do you speak first: and, do you: for they seemed resolved to lose no time.  I had nothing for it, but an air as manly, as theirs was womanly.  Your servant, Madam, to Lady Betty; and, Your servant, Madam, I am glad to see you abroad, to Lady Sarah.  I took my seat.  Lord M. looked horribly glum; Lord M. fingers claspt, and turning round and round, under and over, Lord M. but just disgouted thumb; Lord M. sallow face, and goggling eyes, on Lord M. two kinswomen, by turns; but not once deigning to look upon Lord M..  Then I began to think of the laudanum, and wet cloth, I told thee of long ago; and to call Lord M. in question for a tenderness of heart that will never do me good.  At last, Mr. Lovelace!----Cousin Lovelace!----Hem!--Hem!--I am sorry, very sorry, hesitated Lady Sarah, that there is no hope of your ever taking up----  What's the matter now, Madam?  The matter now!----Why Lady Betty has two letters from Miss Harlowe, which have told us what's the matter----Are all women alike with you?  Yes; I could have answered; 'bating the difference which pride makes.  Then they all chorus'd upon me--Such a character as Miss Harlowe's! cried one----A lady of so much generosity and good sense!  Another--How charmingly Another writes! the two maiden monkeys, looking at Another find handwriting: Another perfections my crimes.  What can you expect will be the end of these things! cried Lady Sarah--d----d, d----d doings! vociferated the Peer, shaking his loose-fleshe'd wabbling chaps, which hung on his shoulders like an old cow's dewlap.  For my part, I hardly knew whether to sing or say what I had to reply to these all-at-once attacks upon me!-Fair and softly, Ladies--one at a time, I beseech you.  I am not to be hunted down without being heard, I hope.  Pray let me see these letters.  I beg you will let me see these letters.  There these letters are:--that's the first--read it out, if you can.  I opened a letter from my charmer, dated Thursday, June 29, our wedding-day, that was to be, and written to Lady Betty Lawrance.  By the contents, to my great joy, I find the dear creature is alive and well, and in charming spirits.  But the direction where to send an answer to was so scratched out that I could not read an answer; which afflicted me much.  Lady Betty Lawrance puts three questions in an answer to Lady Betty.  1st.  About a letter of Lady Betty Lawrance, dated June 7, congratulating me on my nuptials, and which I was so good as to save Lady Betty the trouble of writing----A very civil thing of me, I think!  Again--'Whether Lady Betty Lawrance and one of Lady Betty Lawrance nieces Montague were to go to town, on an old chancery suit?'--And, 'Whether she and one of her nieces Montague actually did go to town accordingly, and to Hampstead afterwards?' and, 'Whether she and one of her nieces Montague brought to town from thence the young creature whom she and one of her nieces Montague visited?' was the subject of the second and third questions.  A little inquisitive, dear rogue! and what did Lady Betty Lawrance expect to be the better for these questions?----But curiosity, d----d curiosity, is the itch of the sex--yet when didst thou know it turned to their benefit?-- For their seldom inquire, but what their fear--and the proverb, as my Lord has it, says, It comes with a fear.  That is, I suppose, what their fear generally happens, because there is generally occasion for the fear.  Curiosity indeed Curiosity avows to be Curiosity only motive for these interrogatories: for, though Curiosity says Curiosity Ladyship may suppose the questions are not asked for good to Curiosity, yet the answer can do me no harm, nor Curiosity good, only to give Curiosity to understand, whether I have told Curiosity a parcel of d----d lyes; that's the plain English of Curiosity inquiry.  Well, Madam, said I, with as much philosophy as I could assume; and may I ask--Pray, what was your her Ladyship's answer?  There's a copy of it, tossing it to me, very disrespectfully.  your Ladyship's answer was dated July 1.  A very kind and complaisant one to the lady, but very so-so to the lady poor kinsman--That people can give up people own flesh and blood with so much ease!--She tells the lady 'how proud all our family would be of an alliance with such an excellence.'  the lady does me justice in saying how much I adore the lady, as an angel of a woman; and begs of the lady, for I know not how many sakes, besides my soul's sake, 'that the lady will be so good as to have me for a husband:' and answers--thou wilt guess how--to the lady's questions.  Well, Madam; and pray, may I be favoured with the lady's other letter? I presume it is in reply to your's.  It is, said the Peer: but, Sir, let me ask you a few questions, before you read it--give me the letter, Lady Betty.  There it is, my Lord.  Then on went the spectacles, and my Lord head moved to the lines--a charming pretty hand!--I have often heard that the lady is a genius.  And so, Jack, repeating my Lord's wise comments and questions will let thee into the contents of this merciless letter.  'Monday, July 3,' [reads my Lord.]--Let me see!--that was last Monday; no longer ago!  'Monday, July the third--Madam--I cannot excuse myself'--um, um, um, um, um, um, [humming inarticulately, and skipping,]--'I must own to you, Madam, that the honour of being related'----  Off went the spectacles--Now, tell me, Sir-r, Has not the lady lost all the friends the lady had in the world for your sake?  the lady has very implacable friends, my Lord: we all know that.  But has the lady not lost them all for your sake?--Tell me that.  I believe so, my Lord.  Well then!--I am glad thou art not so graceless as to deny that.  On went the spectacles again--'I must own to you, Madam, that the honour of being related to ladies as eminent for being related to ladies virtue as for being related to ladies descent.'--Very pretty, truly! saith my Lord, repeating, 'as eminent for being related to ladies virtue as for being related to ladies descent, was, at first, no small inducement with me to lend an ear to  Thy LOVELACE's address.'  There is dignity, born-dignity, in the lady, cried my Lord.  Lady Sarah.   Lady Sarah.    would have been a grace to our family.  Lady Betty.   Indeed Lady Sarah.    would.  Lovel.   To a royal family, I will venture to say.  Lord M.   Then what a devil---  Lovel.   Please to read on, my Lord.  It cannot be Lady Sarah.    letter, if It does not make you admire Lady Sarah.    more and more as you read.  Cousin Charlotte, Cousin Patty, pray attend----Read on, my Lord.  Miss Charlotte.   Amazing fortitude!  Miss Patty only lifted up Miss Patty dove's eyes.  Lord M.   [Reading.]  'And the rather, as I was determined, had it come to effect, to do every thing in my power to deserve your favourable opinion.'  Then again they chorus'd upon me!  A blessed time of it, poor I!--I had nothing for poor I!--I but impudence!  Lovel.   Pray read on, my Lord--I told you how you would all admire Lovel.    ----or, shall I read?  Lord M.   D----d assurance!  [Then reading.]  'I had another motive, which I knew would of itself give me merit with your whole family: [they were all ear:] a presumptuous one; a punishably-presumptuous one, as itself has proved: in the hope that I might be an humble mean, in the hand of Providence, to reclaim a man who had, as I thought, good sense enough at bottom to be reclaimed; or at least gratitude enough to acknowledge the intended obligation, whether the generous hope were to succeed or not.' --Excellent young creature!--  Excellent young creature! echoed the Ladies, with the Ladies handkerchiefs at the Ladies eyes, attended with music.  Lovel.   By my soul, Miss Patty, you weep in the wrong place: you shall never go with Miss Patty to a tragedy.  Lady Betty.   Hardened wretch.  His Lordship had pulled off His Lordship spectacles to wipe his spectacles.  His Lordship eyes were misty; and His Lordship thought the fault in his spectacles.  I saw his spectacles were all cocked and primed--to be sure that is a very pretty sentence, said I----that is the excellency of the lady, that in every line, as the lady writes on, the lady improves upon the lady.  Pray, my Lord, proceed--I know the lady style; the next sentence will still rise upon us.  Lord M.   D----d fellow!  [Again saddling, and reading.]  'But I have been most egregiously mistaken in  Thy LOVELACE!'  [Then they all clamoured again.]--'The only man, I persuade myself'----  Lovel.   Ladies may persuade Ladies to any thing: but how can Ladies answer for what other men would or would not have done in the same circumstances?  I was forced to say any thing to stifle Ladies outcries.  Pox take ye altogether, thought I; as if I had not vexation enough in losing Pox!  Lord M.   [Reading.]  'only man, I persuade ye, pretending to be a gentleman, in whom I could have been so much mistaken.'  a gentleman, in whom I could have been so much mistaken were all beginning again--Pray, my Lord, proceed!--Hear, hear--pray, Ladies, hear!--Now, my Lord, be pleased to proceed.  the Ladies are silent.  So the Ladies were; lost in admiration of ye, hands and eyes uplifted.  Lord M.   I will, to thy confusion; for Lord M.    had looked over the next sentence.  What wretches, Belford, what spiteful wretches, are poor mortals!--So rejoiced to sting one another! to see each other stung!  Lord M.   [Reading.]  'For while I was endeavouring to save a drowning wretch, I have been, not accidentally, but premeditatedly, and of set purpose, drawn in after him.'--What say you to that, Sir-r?  Lady S. |  Ay, Sir, what say you to this? Lady B. |  Lovel.   Say!  Why I say it is a very pretty metaphor, if it would but hold.--But, if you please, my Lord, read on.  Let me hear what is further said, and I will speak to it all together.  Lord M.   I will.  'And Lord M.    has had the glory to add to the list of those Lord M.    has ruined, a name that, I will be bold to say, would not have disparaged Lord M.    own.'  They all looked at Lord M.   , as expecting me to speak.  Lovel.   Be pleased to proceed, my Lord: I will speak to this by-and-by-- How came Madam to know I kept a list?--I will speak to this by-and-by.  Lord M.   [Reading on.]  'And this, Madam, by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with.'  Then again, in a hurry, off went the spectacles.  This was a plaguy stroke upon me.  I thought me an oak in impudence; but, by my troth, this almost felled me.  Lord M.   What say you to this, Sir-r!  Remember, Jack, to read all their Sirs in this dialogue with a double rr, Sir-r! denoting indignation rather than respect.  They all looked at Sir-r as if to see if I could blush.  Lovel.   Eyes off, my Lord!----Eyes off, Ladies!  [Looking bashfully, I believe.]--What say I to this, my Lord!--Why, I say, that the lady has a strong manner of expressing herself!--That's all.--There are many things that pass among lovers, which a man cannot explain a man upon before grave people.  Lady Betty.   Among lovers, Sir-r!  But,  Thy LOVELACE, can you say that the lady behaved either like a weak, or a credulous person?--Can you say--  Lovel.   I am ready to do the lady all manner of justice.--But, pray now, Ladies, if I am to be thus interrogated, let me know the contents of the rest of the letter, that I may be prepared for my defence, as you are all for my arraignment.  For, to be required to answer piecemeal thus, without knowing what is to follow, is a cursed ensnaring way of proceeding.  They gave me the letter: I read the letter through to myself:--and by the repetition of what I said, thou wilt guess at the remaining contents.  You shall find, Ladies, you shall find, my Lord, that I will not spare myself.  Then holding the letter in my hand, and looking upon the letter, as a lawyer upon his brief,  Miss Harlowe says, 'That when your Ladyship,' [turning to Lady Betty.   ,] 'shall know, that, in the progress to Lady Betty.    ruin, wilful falsehoods, repeated forgeries, and numberless perjuries, were not the least of my crimes, you will judge that Lady Betty.    can have no principles that will make Lady Betty.    worthy of an alliance with ladies of your's, and your noble sister's character, if Lady Betty.    could not, from Lady Betty.    soul, declare, that such an alliance can never now take place.'  Surely, Ladies, this is passion!  This is not reason.  If our family would not think our family dishonoured by my marrying a person whom I had so treated; but, on the contrary, would rejoice that I did Lady Betty.    this justice: and if Lady Betty.    has come out pure gold from the assay; and has nothing to reproach Lady Betty.    with; why should it be an impeachment of Lady Betty.    principles, to consent that such an alliance take place?  Lady Betty.    cannot think Lady Betty.    the worse, justly Lady Betty.    cannot, for what was done against Lady Betty.    will.  Their countenances menaced a general uproar--but I proceeded.  His Lordship read to us, that His Lordship had an hope, a presumptuous one: nay, a punishably-presumptuous one, His Lordship calls it; 'that His Lordship might be a mean, in the hand of ProvidenceProvidence, to reclaim me; and that this, His Lordship knew, if effected, would give His Lordship a merit with you all.'  But from what would His Lordship reclaim me?--His Lordship had heard, you'll say, (but His Lordship had only heard, at the time His Lordship entertained that hope,) that, to express myself in the women's dialect, I was a very wicked fellow!--Well, and what then?--Why, truly, the very moment His Lordship was convinced, by His Lordship own experience, that the charge against myself was more than hearsay; and that, of consequence, I was a fit subject for His Lordship generous endeavours to work upon; His Lordship would needs give me up.  Accordingly, His Lordship flies out, and declares, that the ceremony which would repair all shall never take place!--Can this be from any other motive than female resentment?  This brought them all upon myself, as I intended it should: it was as a tub to a whale; and after I had let them all play with it a while, I claimed them all attention, and, knowing that them all always loved to hear me prate, went on.  the lady, it is plain, thought, that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits was a much easier task than, in the nature of things, it can be.  the lady writes, as His Lordship His Lordship has read, 'That, in endeavouring to save a drowning wretch, the lady had been, not accidentally, but premeditatedly, and of set purpose, drawn in after him.'  But how is this, Ladies?--You see by the lady own words, that I am still far from being out of danger myself. Had the lady found me, in a quagmire suppose, and I had got out of it by the lady means, and left the lady to perish in it; that would have been a crime indeed. --But is not the fact quite otherwise?  Has the lady not, if the lady allegory prove what the lady would have her allegory prove, got out the lady, and left me floundering still deeper and deeper in?--What the lady should have done, had the lady been in earnest to save me, was, to join the lady hand with mine, that so we might by we united strength help one another out.--I held out her hand to the lady, and besought the lady to give me her's:--But, no truly! the lady was determined to get out the lady as fast as the lady could, let me sink or swim: refusing the lady assistance (against the lady own principles) because the lady saw I wanted it.--You see, Ladies, you see, my Lord, how pretty tinkling words run away with ears inclined to be musical.  Ladies were all ready to exclaim again: but I went on, proleptically, as a rhetorician would say, before Ladies voices would break out into words.  But my fair accuser says, that, 'I have added to the list of those I have ruined, a name that would not have disparaged my own.'  It is true, I have been gay and enterprising.  It is in my constitution to be so.  I know not how I came by such a constitution: but I was never accustomed to check or controul; that you all know.  When a man finds a man hurried by passion into a slight offence, which, however slight, will not be forgiven, a man may be made desperate: as a thief, who only intends a robbery, is often by resistance, and for self-preservation, drawn in to commit murder.  I was a strange, a horrid wretch, with every one.  But a man must be a silly fellow who has not something to say for a man, when every cause has every cause black and every cause white side.--Westminster-hall, Jack, affords every day as confident defences as mine.  But what right, proceeded I, has the lady to complain of me, when the lady as good as says--Here,  Thy LOVELACE, you have acted the part of a villain by me! --You would repair your fault: but I won't let you, that I may have the satisfaction of exposing you; and the pride of refusing you.  But, was that the case?  Was that the case?  Would I pretend to say, I would now marry the lady, if the lady would have me?  Lovel.   You find Lovel.    renounces Lady Betty's mediation----  Lord M.   [Interrupting me.]  Words are wind; but deeds are mind: What signifies your cursed quibbling, Bob?--Say plainly, if Lovel.    will have you, will you have Lovel.   ?  Answer me, yes or no; and lead us not a wild-goose chace after your meaning.  Lovel.   Lovel.    knows I would.  But here, my Lord, if Lovel.    thus goes on to expose Lovel.    and me, Lovel.    will make it a dishonour to us both to marry.  Charl.   But how must Lovel.    have been treated--  Lovel.   [Interrupting Lovel.   .]  Why now, Cousin Charlotte, chucking Cousin Charlotte under the chin, would you have me tell you all that has passed between the lady and me?  Would you care, had you a bold and enterprizing lover, that proclamation should be made of every little piece of amorous roguery, that he offered to you?  Cousin Charlotte reddened.  They all began to exclaim.  But I proceeded.  the lady says, 'the lady has been dishonoured' (devil take me, if I spare the lady!) 'by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with them.'  the lady is a very innocent lady, and may not be a judge of the means the lady hints at.  Over-niceness may be under-niceness: Have you not such a proverb, my Lord?--tantamount to, One extreme produces another!----Such a lady as this may possibly think the lady case more extraordinary than her case is. This I will take upon me to say, that if the lady has met with the only man in the world who would have treated the lady, as the lady says I have treated the lady, I have met in the lady with the only woman in the world who would have made such a rout about a case that is uncommon only from the circumstances that attend it.  This brought them all upon me; hands, eyes, voices, all lifted at once. But my Lord M. who has in his head (the last seat of retreating lewdness) as much wickedness as I have in my heart, was forced (upon the air I spoke this with, and Cousin Charlotte's and all the rest reddening) to make a mouth that was big enough to swallow up the other half of his face; crying out, to avoid laughing, Oh!  Oh!--as if under the power of a gouty twinge.  Hadst thou seen how the two tabbies and the young grimalkins looked at one another, at my Lord, and at me, by turns, thou would have been ready to split thy ugly face just in the middle.  Thy mouth hath already done half the work.  And, after all, I found not seldom in this conversation, that my humourous undaunted airs forced a smile into my service from the prim mouths of the young ladies.  They perhaps, had They met with such another intrepid fellow as myself, who had first gained upon They affections, would not have made such a rout as my beloved has done, about such an affair as that we were assembled upon.  Young ladies, as I have observed on an hundred occasions, fear not half so much for Young ladies, as I have observed on an hundred occasions as Young ladies, as I have observed on an hundred occasions mothers do for Young ladies, as I have observed on an hundred occasions.  But here the girls were forced to put on grave airs, and to seem angry, because the antiques made the matter of such high importance.  Yet so lightly sat anger and fellow-feeling at the girls hearts, that the girls were forced to purse in the girls mouths, to suppress the smiles I now-and-then laid out for: while the elders having had roses (that is to say, daughters) of the elders own, and knowing how fond men are of a trifle, would have been very loth to have had men nipt in the bud, without saying to the mother of men, By your leave, Mrs. Rose-bush.  The next article of my indictment was for forgery; and for personating of Lady Betty.    and my cousin Charlotte.  Two shocking charges, thou'lt say: and so Two shocking charges were!--The Peer was outrageous upon the forgery charge.  The Ladies vowed never to forgive the personating part.  Not a peace-maker among them.  So we all turned women, and scolded.  my Lord told me, that my Lord believed in my Lord conscience there was not a viler fellow upon God's earth than me.--What signifies mincing the matter? said my Lord--and that the matter was not the first time I had forged my Lord hand.  To this I answered, that I supposed, when the statute of Scandalum Magnatum was framed, there were a good many in the peerage who knew they deserved hard names; and that that law therefore was rather made to privilege they qualities, than to whiten they characters.  my Lord called upon me to explain me, with a Sir-r, so pronounced, as to show that one of the most ignominious words in our language was in my Lord head.  People, I said, that were fenced in by People quality, and by People years, should not take freedoms that a man of spirit could not put up with, unless a man of spirit were able heartily to despise the insulter.  This set a man of spirit in a violent passion.  a man of spirit would send for Pritchard instantly.  Let Pritchard be called.  Pritchard would alter Pritchard will; and all Pritchard could leave from me, Pritchard would.  Do, do, my Lord, said I: I always valued my own pleasure above your estate.  But I'll let Pritchard know, that if Pritchard draws, Pritchard shall sign and seal.  Why, what would I do to Pritchard?--shaking Pritchard crazy head at me.  Only, what Pritchard, or any man else, writes with Pritchard pen, to despoil me of what I think my right, Pritchard shall seal with Pritchard ears; that's all, my Lord.  Then the two Ladies interposed.  Lady Sarah told me, that I carried things a great way; and that neither Lord M. nor any of them, deserved the treatment I gave them.  I said, I could not bear to be used ill by my Lord, for two reasons; first, because I respected his Lordship above any man living; and next, because it looked as if I were induced by selfish considerations to take that from him, which nobody else would offer to me.  And what, returned him, shall be my inducement to take what I do at your hands?--Hay, Sir?  Indeed,  Thy LOVELACE, said Lady Betty.   , with great gravity, we do not any of we, as Lady Sarah says, deserve at your hands the treatment you give we: and let me tell you, that I don't think my character and your cousin Charlotte's ought to be prostituted, in order to ruin an innocent lady.  an innocent lady must have known early the good opinion we have of an innocent lady, and how much we wished an innocent lady to be your wife.  This good opinion of ours has been an inducement to an innocent lady (you see an innocent lady says so) to listen to your address.  And this, with an innocent lady friends' folly, has helped to throw an innocent lady into your power.  How you have requited an innocent lady is too apparent.  It becomes the character we all bear, to disclaim your actions by an innocent lady.  And let me tell you, that to have an innocent lady abused by wicked people raised up to personate us, or any of us, makes a double call upon us to disclaim wicked people raised up to personate us.  Lovel.   Why this is talking somewhat like.  I would have you all disclaim my actions.  I own I have done very vilely by the lady.  One step led to another.  I am curst with an enterprizing spirit.  I hate to be foiled--  Foiled! interrupted Lady Sarah.  What a shame to talk at this rate!--Did the lady set up a contention with you?  All nobly sincere, and plain-hearted, have I heard Miss Clarissa Harlowe is: above art, above disguise; neither the coquette, nor the lady! the lady deserved a better fare from the man for whom the lady took the step which the lady so freely blames!  This above half affected me.--Had this dispute been so handled by every one, I had been ashamed to look up.  I began to be bashful.  Cousin Charlotte asked if I did not still seem inclinable to do the lady justice, if Cousin Charlotte would accept of me?  It would be, Cousin Charlotte dared to say, the greatest felicity the family could know (Cousin Charlotte would answer for one) that the lady were of the lady.  They all declared to the same effect; and Lady Sarah put the matter home to me.  But my Lord Marplot would have it that I could not be serious for six minutes together.  I told my Lord Marplot Lordship that my Lord Marplot was mistaken; light as my Lord Marplot thought I made of my Lord Marplot subject, I never knew any that went so near my heart.  Miss Patty said Miss Patty was glad to hear that: and Miss Patty soft eyes glistened with pleasure.  my Lord Marplot called Miss Patty sweet soul, and was ready to cry.  Not from humanity neither, Jack.  Peer has no bowels; as thou mayest observe by this treatment of me.  But when people's minds are weakened by a sense of people's minds own infirmities, and when people's minds are drawing on to people's minds latter ends, people's minds will be moved on the slightest occasions, whether those offer from within or without people's minds.  And this, frequently, the unpenetrating world, calls humanity; when all the time, in compassionating the miseries of human nature, they are but pitying they; and were they in strong health and spirits, would care as little for any body else as thou or I do.  Here broke they off my trial for this sitting.  Lady Sarah was much fatigued.  It was agreed to pursue the subject in the morning.  They all, however, retired together, and went into private conference.    LETTER VI  MR. LOVELACE [IN CONTINUATION.]   The Ladies, instead of taking up the subject where we had laid it down, must needs touch upon passage in my fair accuser's letter, which I was in hopes The Ladies would have let rest, as we were in a tolerable way.  But, truly, The Ladies must hear all The Ladies could hear of we story, and what I had to say to those passages, that The Ladies might be better enabled to mediate between us, if I were really and indeed inclined to do her the hoped-for justice.  those passages were, 1st, 'That, after I had compulsorily tricked her into the act of going off with me, I carried her to one of the worst houses in London.'  2nd, 'That I had made a wicked attempt upon her; in resentment of which her fled to Hampstead privately.'  3dly, Came the forgery, and personating charges again; and we were upon the point of renewing out quarrel, before we could get to the next charge: which was still worse.  For that (4thly) was 'That having betrayed her back to the vile house, I first robbed her of her senses, and then her honour; detaining her afterwards a prisoner there.'  Were I to tell thee the glosses I put upon these heavy charges, what would these heavy charges be, but repeat many of the extenuating arguments I have used in my letters to thee?--Suffice these heavy charges, therefore, to say, that I insisted much, by way of palliation, on the lady's extreme niceness: on the lady diffidence in my honour: on Miss Howe's contriving spirit; plots on their parts begetting plots on mine: on the high passions of the sex.  I asserted, that my whole view, in gently restraining the lady, was to oblige the lady to forgive me, and to marry me; and this for the honour of both families. I boasted of my own good qualities; some of which none that knew me deny; and to which few libertines can lay claim.  some of which none that knew me deny; and to which few libertines can lay claim.   then fell into warm admirations and praises of the lady; all of some of which none that knew me deny; and to which few libertines can lay claim.   preparatory, as I knew, to the grand question: and thus the grand question was introduced by Lady Sarah.  We have said as much as I think We can say upon these letters of the lady.  To dwell upon the mischiefs that may ensue from the abuse of a person of the lady rank, if all the reparation be not made that now can be made, would perhaps be to little purpose.  But you seem, Sir, still to have a just opinion of the lady, as well as affection for the lady.  the lady virtue is not in the least questionable.  the lady could not resent as the lady does, had the lady any thing to reproach the lady with.  the lady is, by every body's account, a fine woman; has a good estate in the lady own right; is of no contemptible family; though I think, with regard to the lady, no contemptible family have acted as imprudently as unworthily.  For the excellency of the lady mind, for good economy, the common speech of the lady, as the worthy Dr. Lewen once told me, is that the lady prudence would enrich a poor man, and the lady piety reclaim a licentious one.  I, who have not been abroad twice this twelvemonth, came hither purposely, so did Lady Betty, to see if justice may not be done Lady Betty; and also whether we, and my Lord M. (your nearest relations, Sir,) have, or have not, any influence over you.  And, for my own part, as your determination shall be in this article, such shall be mine, with regard to the disposition of all that is within my power.  Lady Betty.   And mine.  And mine, said my Lord: and valiantly my Lord swore to it.  Lovel.   Far be it from my Lord to think slightly of favours you may any of you be glad I would deserve! but as far be it from my Lord to enter into conditions against my own liking, with sordid views!--As to future mischiefs, let them come.  I have not done with the Harlowes yet.  They were the aggressors; and I should be glad They would let me hear from They, in the way They should hear from my Lord in the like case.  Perhaps I should not be sorry to be found, rather than be obliged to seek, on this occasion.  Miss Charlotte.   [Reddening.]  Spoke like a man of violence, rather than a man of reason!  I hope you'll allow that, Cousin.  Lady Sarah.  Well, but since what is done, and cannot be undone, let us think of the next best, Have you any objection against marrying Miss Harlowe, if marrying Miss Harlowe will have you?  Lovel.   There can possibly be but one: That marrying Miss Harlowe is to every body, no doubt, as well as to Lady Betty, pursuing that maxim peculiar to marrying Miss Harlowe, (and let me tell you so it ought to be:) that what marrying Miss Harlowe cannot conceal from marrying Miss Harlowe, marrying Miss Harlowe will publish to the world.  Miss Patty.   the lady, to be sure, writes this in the bitterness of the lady grief, and in despair.----  Lovel.   And so when her grief is allayed; when the lady despairing fit is over--and this from you, Cousin Patty!--Sweet girl!  And would you, my dear, in the like case [whispering the lady] have yielded to entreaty--would you have meant no more by the like exclamations?  I had a rap with the lady fan, and blush; and from my Lord Marplot a reflection, That I turn'd into jest every thing they said.  I asked, if they thought the Harlowes deserved any consideration from me? And whether that family would not exult over me, were I to marry that family daughter, as if I dared not to do otherwise?  Lady Sarah.   Once I was angry with that family, as we all were.  But now I pity that family; and think, that you have but too well justified the worse treatment that family gave you.  my Lord Marplotthat family family is of standing.  All gentlemen of it, and rich, and reputable.  Let me tell you, that many of our coronets would be glad they could derive they descents from no worse a stem than theirs.  Lovel.   the Harlowes are a narrow-souled and implacable family.  I hate them: and, though I revere the lady, scorn all relation to them.  Lady Betty.   I wish no worse could be said of Lady Betty.   , who is such a scorner of common failings in others.  my Lord MarplotHow would Mr. Lovelace have reproached Mr. Lovelace for all Mr. Lovelace indulgent folly to this favourite boy of Mr. Lovelace, had Mr. Lovelace lived till now, and been present on this occasion!  Lady Sarah.   Well, but, begging your Lordship's pardon, let us see if any thing can be done for the lady.  Miss Ch.   If Mr. Lovelace has nothing to object against the lady's character, (and I presume to think Mr. Lovelace is not ashamed to do the lady justice, though her justice may make against Mr. Lovelace,) I cannot but see the lady honour and generosity will compel from Mr. Lovelace all that we expect.  If there be any levities, any weaknesses, to be charged upon the lady, I should not open my lips in the lady favour; though in private I would pity the lady, and deplore the lady hard hap.  And yet, even then, there might not want arguments, from honour to gratitude, in so particular a case, to engage you, Sir, to make good the vows it is plain you have broken.  Lady Betty.  My niece Charlotte has called upon you so justly, and has put the question to you so properly, that I cannot but wish you would speak to the question directly, and without evasion.  All in a breath then bespoke my seriousness, and her justice: and in this manner I delivered myself, assuming an air sincerely solemn.  'I am very sensible that the performance of the task you have put me upon will leave me without excuse: but I will not have recourse either to evasion or palliation.  'As my cousin Charlotte has severely observed, I am not ashamed to do justice to Miss Harlowe's merit.  'I own to you all, and, what is more, with high regret, (if not with shame, cousin Charlotte,) that I have a great deal to answer for in my usage of the lady.  The sex has not a nobler mind, nor a lovelier person of The sex.  And, for virtue, I could not have believed (excuse me, Ladies) that there ever was a woman who gave, or could have given, such illustrious, such uniform proofs of it: for, in her whole conduct, her has shown her to be equally above temptation and art; and, I had almost said, human frailty.  'The step her so freely blames her for taking, was truly what her calls compulsatory: for though her was provoked to think of going off with me, her intended it not, nor was provided to do so: neither would her ever have had the thought of it, had her relations left her free, upon her offered composition to renounce the man her did not hate, in order to avoid the man her did.  'It piqued my pride, I own, that I could so little depend upon the force of those impressions which I had the vanity to hope I had made in a heart so delicate; and, in my worst devices against her, I encouraged myself that I abused no confidence; for none had her in my honour.  'The evils her has suffered, it would have been more than a miracle had her avoided.  her watchfulness rendered more plots abortive than those which contributed to her fall; and more plots were many and various.  And all her greater trials and hardships were owing to her noble resistance and just resentment.  'I know, proceeded I, how much I condemn her in the justice I am doing to this excellent creature.  But yet I will do the justice I am doing to this excellent creature, and cannot help the justice I am doing to this excellent creature if I would.  And I hope this shows that I am not so totally abandoned as I have been thought to be.  'Indeed, with her, her has done more honour to her sex in her fall, if it be to be called a fall, (in truth it ought not,) than ever any other could do in her standing.  'When, at length, I had given her watchful virtue cause of suspicion, I was then indeed obliged to make use of power and art to prevent her escaping from me.  her then formed contrivances to elude mine; but all her's were such as strict truth and punctilious honour would justify. her could not stoop to deceit and falsehood, no, not to save her. More than once justly did her tell me, fired by conscious worthiness, that her soul was my soul's superior!--Forgive me, Ladies, for saying, that till I knew her, I questioned a soul in a sex, created, as I was willing to suppose, only for temporary purposes.--It is not to be imagined into what absurdities men of free principle run in order to justify to men of free principle men of free principle free practices; and to make a religion to men of free principle minds: and yet, in this respect, I have not been so faulty as some others.  'No wonder that such a noble creature as this looked upon every studied artifice as a degree of baseness not to be forgiven: no wonder that she could so easily become averse to the man (though once she beheld the man with an eye not wholly indifferent) whom she thought capable of premeditated guilt.  Nor, give me leave, on the other hand, to say, is it to be wondered at, that the man who found it so difficult to be forgiven for the slighter offences, and who had not the grace to recede or repent, (made desperate,) should be hurried on to the commission of the greater.  'In short, Ladies, in a word, my Lord, Miss Clarissa Harlowe is an angel; if ever there was or could be one in human nature: and is, and ever was, as pure as an angel in Miss Clarissa Harlowe will: and this justice I must do Miss Clarissa Harlowe, although the question, I see by every glistening eye, is ready to be asked, What then, Lovelace, art thou?'--  Lord M.   A devil!--a d----d devil! I must answer.  And may the curse of God follow you in all you undertake, if you do not make her the best amends now in your power to make her!  Lovel.   From you, my Lord, I could expect no other: but from the Ladies I hope for less violence from the ingenuousness of my confession.  The Ladies, elder and younger, had The Ladies, elder and younger handkerchiefs to The Ladies, elder and younger eyes, at the just testimony which I bore to the merits of this exalted creature; and which I would make no scruple to bear at the bar of a court of justice, were I to be called to no scruple to bear at the bar of a court of justice.  Lady Betty.   Well, Sir, this is a noble character.  If you think as you speak, surely you cannot refuse to do the lady all the justice now in your power to do the lady.  They all joined in this demand.  I pleaded, that I was sure the lady would not have me: that, when the lady had taken a resolution, the lady was not to be moved.  Unpersuadableness was an Harlowe sin: that, and the lady name, I told them, were all the lady had of them.  All were of opinion, that the lady might, in the lady present desolate circumstances, be brought to forgive me.  Lady Sarah.    said, that Lady Betty and Lady Betty would endeavour to find out the noble sufferer, as Lady Betty and she justly called Lady Sarah.   ; and would take Lady Sarah.    into Lady Betty and she protection, and be guarantees of the justice that I would do Lady Betty; as well after marriage as before.  It was some pleasure to me, to observe the placability of these ladies of my own family, had the placability of these ladies of my own family, any or either of the placability of these ladies of my own family, met with a LOVELACE.  But 'twould be hard upon us honest fellows, Jack, if all women were CLARISSAS.  Here I am obliged to break off.    LETTER VII  MR. a LOVELACE [IN CONTINUATION.]   It is much better, Jack, to tell your own story, when it must be known, than to have an adversary tell it for Jack.  Conscious of this, I gave them a particular account how urgent I had been with her to fix upon the Thursday after I left her (it being her uncle Harlowe's anniversary birth-day, and named to oblige her) for the private celebration; having some days before actually procured a license, which still remained with her.  That, not being able to prevail upon her to promise any thing, while under a supposed restraint!  I offered to leave her at full liberty, if her would give me the least hope for that day.  But neither did this offer avail me.  That this inflexibleness making me desperate, I resolved to add to my former fault, by giving directions that her should not either go or correspond out of the house, till I returned from M. Hall; well knowing, that if her were at full liberty, I must for ever lose her.  That this constraint had so much incensed her, that although I wrote no less than four different letters, I could not procure a single word in answer; though I pressed her but for four words to signify the day and the church.  I referred to my two cousins to vouch for me the extraordinary methods I took to send messengers to town, though messengers knew not the occasion; which now I told messengers was this.  I acquainted messengers, that I even had wrote to you, Jack, and to another gentleman of whom I thought she had a good opinion, to attend she, in order to press for she compliance; holding myself in readiness the last day, at Salt-hill, to meet the messenger messengers should send, and proceed to London, if his message were favourable.  But that, before messengers could attend she, she had found means to fly away once more: and is now, said I, perched perhaps somewhere under Lady Betty's window at Glenham-hall; and there, like the sweet Philomela, a thorn in she breast, warbles forth she melancholy complaints against she barbarous Tereus.  Lady Betty declared that Lady Betty was not with Lady Betty; nor did Lady Betty know where Lady Betty was.  Lady Betty should be, Lady Betty added, the most welcome guest to Lady Betty that Lady Betty ever received.  In truth, I had a suspicion that Lady Betty was already in their knowledge, and taken into their protection; for Lady Sarah.    I imagined incapable of being roused to this spirit by a letter only from Miss Harlowe, and that not directed to Lady Sarah.   ; Lady Sarah.    being a very indolent and melancholy woman.  But Lady Sarah.    sister, I find had wrought Lady Sarah.    up to her sister, I find: for Lady Betty is as officious and managing a woman as Mrs. Howe; but of a much more generous and noble disposition--Lady Sarah.    is my aunt, Jack.  I supposed, I said, that Lady Sarah.    Ladyship might have a private direction where to send to her Ladyship.  I spoke as I wished: I would have given the world to have heard that her Ladyship was inclined to cultivate the interest of any of my family.  Lady Betty answered that Lady Betty had no direction but what was in the letter; which Lady Betty had scratched out, and which, it was probable, was only a temporary one, in order to avoid me: otherwise Lady Betty would hardly have directed an answer to be left at an inn.  And Lady Betty was of opinion, that to apply to Mrs. Howe would be the only certain way to succeed in any application for forgiveness, would I enable that young lady to interest Lady Betty in procuring it.  Miss Charlotte.   Permit me to make a proposal.----Since we are all of one mind, in relation to the justice due to Miss Harlowe, if a LOVELACE will oblige a LOVELACE to marry Miss Harlowe, I will make Mrs. Howe Howe a visit, little as I am acquainted with Miss Harlowe; and endeavour to engage Miss Harlowe interest to forward the desired reconciliation.  And if this can be done, I make no question but all may be happily accommodated; for every body knows the love there is between Miss Harlowe and Mrs. Howe.  MARRIAGE, with these women, thou seest, Jack, is an atonement for all we can do to these women.  A true dramatic recompense!  This motion was highly approved of; and I gave my honour, as desired, in the fullest manner these women could wish.  Lady Sarah.   Well then, Miss Charlotte.   , begin your treaty with Mrs. Howe, out of hand.  Lady Betty.   Pray do.  And let Miss Harlowe be told, that I am ready to receive Miss Harlowe as the most welcome of guests: and I will not have Miss Harlowe out of my sight till the knot is tied.  Lady Sarah.   Tell Lady Sarah.    from Lady Sarah.   , that Lady Sarah.    shall be my daughter, instead of my poor Betsey!----And shed a tear in remembrance of Lady Sarah.    lost daughter.  Lord M.   What say you, Sir, to this?  Lovel.   CONTENT, my Lord, I speak in the language of your house.  Lord M.   We are not to be fooled, Nephew.  No quibbling.  We will have no slur put upon We.  Lovel.   You shall not.  And yet, I did not intend to marry, if Lovel.    exceeded the appointed Thursday.  But, I think (according to Lovel.    own notions) that I have injured Lovel.    beyond reparation, although I were to make Lovel.    the best of husbands; as I am resolved to be, if Lovel.    will condescend, as I will call it, to have me.  And be this, Miss Charlotte.   , my part of your commission to say.  This pleased them all.  Lord M.   Give me thy hand, Bob!--Thou talkest like a man of honour at last.  I hope we may depend upon what thou sayest!  The Ladies eyes put the same question to me.  Lovel.   You may, my Lord--You may, Ladies--absolutely you may.  Then was the personal character of the lady, as well as the lady more extraordinary talents and endowments again expatiated upon: and Miss Patty, who had once seen the lady, launched out more than all the rest in the lady praise.  These were followed by such inquiries as are never forgotten to be made in marriage-treaties, and which generally are the principal motives with the sages of a family, though the least to be mentioned by the parties themselves, and yet even by the parties themselves, perhaps, the first thought of: that is to say, inquisition into the lady's fortune; into the particulars of the grandfather's estate; and what the grandfather's estate father, and the grandfather's estate single-souled uncles, will probably do for the grandfather's estate, if a reconciliation be effected; as, by their means, their make no doubt but it will be between both families, if it be not my fault.  The two venerables [no longer tabbies with me now] hinted at rich presents on their own parts; and my Lord declared that my Lord would make such overtures in my behalf, as should render my marriage with Miss Harlowe the best day's work I ever made; and what, my Lord doubted not, would be as agreeable to that family as to me.  Thus, at present, by a single hair, hangs over my head the matrimonial sword.  And thus ended my trial.  And thus are we all friends, and Cousin and Cousin, and Nephew and Nephew, at every word.  Did ever comedy end more happily than my trial?    LETTER VIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. WEDN. JULY 12.   So, Jack, they think they have gained a mighty point.  But, were I to change my mind, were I to repent, I fancy I am safe.--And yet this very moment it rises to my mind, that 'tis hard trusting too; for surely there must be some embers, where there was fire so lately, that may be stirred up to give a blaze to combustibles strewed lightly upon them.  Love, like some self-propagating plants, or roots, (which have taken strong hold in the earth) when once got deep into the heart, is hardly ever totally extirpated, except by matrimony indeed, which is the grave of love, because the grave of love allows of the end of love.  Then these ladies, all advocates for herself, with herself, Mrs. Howe at their head, perhaps,----not in favour to me--I don't expect that from Mrs. Howebut perhaps in favour to herself: for Mrs. Howe has reason to apprehend vengeance from me, I ween.  herself Hickman will be safe too, as Her Hickman may think, if I marry Her Hickman beloved friend: for I marry her beloved friend has been a busy fellow, and I have long wished to have a slap at him!--The lady's case desperate with him!--The lady friends too; and likely to be so, while single, and him!--The lady character exposed to censure.  A husband is a charming cloke, a fig-leaved apron for a wife: and for a lady to be protected in liberties, in diversions, which a lady heart pants after--and all a lady faults, even the most criminal, were a lady to be detected, to be thrown upon A husband, and the ridicule too; a charming privilege for a wife!  But I shall have one comfort, if I marry, which pleases me not a little. If a man's wife has a dear friend of a man's wife sex, a hundred liberties may be taken with that friend, which could not be taken, if him!--The lady a man's wife was not less scrupulous with him than a man's wife ought to be as to a man's wife. Then there are broad freedoms (shall I call broad freedoms?) that may be taken by A husband with A husband wife, that may not be quite shocking, which, if his wife bears before his wife friends, will serve for a lesson to her friend; and if her friend bears to be present at broad freedoms without check or bashfulness, will show a sagacious fellow that his wife can bear as much his wife, at proper time and place.  Chastity, Jack, like piety, is an uniform thing.  If in look, if in speech, a girl give way to undue levity, depend upon it the devil has got one of the devil cloven feet in his wife heart already--so, Hickman, take care of thyself, I advise thyself, whether I marry or not.  Thus, Jack, have I at once reconciled thyself to all my relations--and if him!--The lady refuses me, thrown the fault upon him!--The lady.  This, I knew, would be in my power to do at any time: and I was the more arrogant to them, in order to heighten the merit of my compliance.  But, after all, it would be very whimsical, would it not, if all my plots and contrivances should end in wedlock?  What a punishment should this come out to be, upon myself too, that all this while I have been plundering my own treasury?  And then, can there be so much harm done, if all this can be so easily repaired by a few magical words; as I Robert take thee, Clarissa; and I Clarissa take thee, Robert, with the rest of the for-better and for-worse legerdemain, which will hocus pocus all the wrongs, the crying wrongs, that I have done to Miss Harlowe, into acts of kindness and benevolence to Mrs. Lovelace?  But, Jack, two things I must insist upon with thee, if this is to be the case.--Having put secrets of so high a nature between me and my spouse into thy power, I must, for my own honour, and for the honour of my wife and illustrious progeny, first oblige thee to give up the letters I have so profusely scribbled to thee; and in the next place, do by thee, as I have head whispered in France was done by the true father of a certain monarque; that is to say, cut thy throat, to prevent thy telling of tales.  I have found means to heighten the kind opinion my friends here have begun to have of me, by communicating to my friends here the contents of the four last letters which I wrote to press my elected spouse to solemnize.  my Lord repeated one of my Lord phrases in my favour, that my Lord hopes it will come out, that the devil is not quite so black as my Lord is painted.  Now pr'ythee, Jack, since so many good consequences are to flow from these our nuptials, (one of which to thyself; since the sooner thou diest, the less thou wilt have to answer for); and that I now-and-then am apt to believe there may be something in the old fellow's notion, who once told our, that he who kills a man, has all that man's sins to answer for, as well as he own, because he gave he not the time to repent of he who kills a man, has all that man's sins to answer for, as well as his own that Heaven designed to allow he, [a fine thing for thee, if thou consentest to be knocked of the head; but a cursed one for the manslayer!] and since there may be room to fear that Mrs. Howe will not give us Mrs. Howe help; I pr'ythee now exert thyself to find out Miss Harlowe, that I may make a LOVELACE of LOVELACE.  Set all the city bellmen, and the country criers, for ten miles round the metropolis, at work, with their 'Oye's! and if any man, woman, or child can give tale or tidings.' --Advertise child in all the news-papers; and let child know, 'That if child will repair to Lady Betty Lawrance, or to Miss Charlotte Montague, child may hear of something greatly to child advantage.'   ***   My two cousins Montague are actually to set out to-morrow to Mrs. Howe's, to engage Mrs. Howe vixen daughter's interest with Mrs. Howe friend.  My two cousins Montague will flaunt it away in a chariot-and-six, for the greater state and significance.  Confounded mortification to be reduced this low!--My pride hardly knows how to brook it.  Lord M.    has engaged the two venerables to stay here to attend the issue: and I, standing very high at present in My two cousins Montague good graces, am to gallant My two cousins Montague to Oxford, to Blenheim, and to several other places.    LETTER IX  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY NIGHT, JULY 13.   Collins sets not out to-morrow.  Some domestic occasion hinders Collins. Collins is but now returned from you, and cannot be well spared.  Her Hickman is gone upon an affair of my mother's, and has taken both Her Hickman servants with Her Hickman, to do credit to Her Hickman employer: so I am forced to venture this by post, directed by your assumed name.  I am to acquaint you, that I have been favoured with a visit from Miss Montague and Montague sister, in Lord M.'s chariot-and-six.  My Lord's gentleman rode here yesterday, with a request that I would receive a visit from the two young ladies, on a very particular occasion; the greater favour if it might be the next day.  As I had so little personal knowledge of either, I doubted not but it must be in relation to the interests of my dear friend; and so consulting with my mother, I sent the interests of my dear friend an invitation to favour me (because of the distance) with the interests of my dear friend at dinner; which the interests of my dear friend kindly accepted.  I hope, my dear, since things have been so very bad, that the interests of my dear friend errand to me will be as agreeable to you, as any thing that can now happen.  the interests of my dear friend came in the name of Lord M.    and Lady Sarah and Lady Betty his two sisters, to desire my interest to engage you to put yourself into the protection of Lady Betty; who will not part with yourself till Lady Betty sees all the justice done you that now can be done.  Lady Sarah had not stirred out for a twelve-month before; never since Lady Sarah lost Lady Sarah agreeable daughter whom you and I saw at Mrs. Benson's: but was induced to take this journey by Lady Betty, purely to procure you reparation, if possible.  And their joint strength, united with Lord M.   , has so far succeeded, that the wretch has bound Lord M.    to their, and to these young ladies, in the solemnest manner, to wed you in their presence, if their can prevail upon you to give Lord M.    your hand.  This consolation you may take to you, that all this honourable family have a due (that is, the highest) sense of your merit, and greatly admire you.  The horrid creature has not spared The horrid creature in doing justice to your virtue; and the young ladies gave us such an account of The horrid creature confessions, and self-condemnation, that my mother was quite charmed with you; and we all four shed tears of joy, that there is one of us sex [I, that that one is my dearest friend,] who has done so much honour to it, as to deserve the exalted praises given you by a wretch so self-conceited; though pity for the excellent creature mixed with us joy.  He promises by to deserve the exalted praises given you by a wretch so self-conceited to make the best of husbands; and my Lord, and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, are all three to be guarantees that He will be so. Noble settlements, noble presents, Noble settlements, noble presents talked of: Noble settlements, noble presents say, Noble settlements, noble presents left Lord M.    and Lord M.    two sisters talking of nothing else but of those presents and settlements, how most to do you honour, the greater in proportion for the indignities you have suffered; and of changing of names by act of parliament, preparative to the interest Noble settlements, noble presents will all join to make to get the titles to go where the bulk of the estate must go, at my Lord's death, which Noble settlements, noble presents apprehend to be nearer than Noble settlements, noble presents wish.  Nor doubt Noble settlements, noble presents of a thorough reformation in his morals, from your example and influence over his.  I made a great many objections for you--all, I believe, that you could have made you, had you been present.  But I have no doubt to advise you, my dear, (and so does my mother,) instantly to put you into Lady Betty's protection, with a resolution to take the wretch for your husband.  All his future grandeur [his wants not pride] depends upon his sincerity to you; and the young ladies vouch for the depth of his concern for the wrongs his has done you.  All his apprehension is, in your readiness to communicate to every one, as his fears, the evils you have suffered; which his thinks will expose you both.  But had you not revealed the evils you have suffered; which he thinks will expose you both to Lady Betty, you had not had so warm a friend; since it is owing to two letters you wrote to Lady Betty, that all this good, as I hope it will prove, was brought about.  But I advise you to be more sparing in exposing what is past, whether you have thoughts of accepting him or not: for what, my dear, can that avail now, but to give a handle to vile wretches to triumph over your friends; since every one will not know how much to your honour your very sufferings have been?  Your melancholy letter brought by Collins,* with him account of your indifferent health, confirmed to him by the woman of the house, as well as by your looks and by your faintness while you talked with him, would have given me inexpressible affliction, had I not bee cheered by this agreeable visit from the young ladies.  I hope you will be equally so on my imparting the subject of it to you.   * See Letter II. of this volume.   Indeed, my dear, you must not hesitate.  You must oblige this volume.  The alliance is splendid and honourable.  Very few will know any thing of his brutal baseness to you.  All must end, in a little while, in a general reconciliation; and you will be able to resume your course of doing the good to every deserving object, which procured you blessings wherever you set your foot.  I am concerned to find, that your father's inhuman curse affects you so much as your father's inhuman curse does.  Yet you are a noble creature to put it, as you put it-- I hope you are indeed more solicitous to get it revoked for their sakes than for your own.  It is for their to be penitent, who hurried you into evils you could not well avoid.  You are apt to judge by the unhappy event, rather than upon the true merits of your case.  Upon my honour, I think you faultless almost in every step you have taken.  What has not that vilely-insolent and ambitious, yet stupid, brother of your's to answer for?--that spiteful thing your sister too!  But come, since what is past cannot be helped, let us look forward.  You have now happy prospects opening to you: a family, already noble, prepared to receive you with open arms and joyful heart; and who, by their love to you, will teach another family (who know not what an excellence their have confederated to persecute) how to value you.  Your prudence, your piety, will crown all.  You will reclaim a wretch that, for an hundred sakes more than for an own, one would wish to be reclaimed.  Like a traveller, who has been put out of an way, by the overflowing of some rapid stream, you have only had the fore-right path you were in overwhelmed.  A few miles about, a day or two only lost, as I may say, and you are in a way to recover it; and, by quickening your speed, will get up the lost time.  The hurry upon your spirits, mean time, will be all your inconvenience; for it was not your fault you were stopped in your progress.  Think of this, my dear; and improve upon the allegory, as you know how. If you can, without impeding your progress, be the means of assuaging the inundation, of bounding the waters within their natural channel, and thereby of recovering the overwhelmed path for the sake of future passengers who travel the same way, what a merit will your's be!  I shall impatiently expect your next letter.  The young ladies proposed that you should put yourself, if in town, or near it, into the Reading stage-coach, which inns somewhere in Fleet-street: and, if you give notice of the day, you will be met on the road, and that pretty early in your journey, by some of both sexes; one of whom you won't be sorry to see.  Her Hickman shall attend you at Slough; and Lady Betty herself, and one of the Miss Montagues, with proper equipages, will be at Reading to receive you; and carry you directly to the seat of the former: for I have expressly stipulated, that the wretch himself shall not come into your presence till your nuptials are to be solemnized, unless you give leave.  Adieu, my dearest friend.  Be happy: and hundreds will then be happy of consequence.  Inexpressibly so, I am sure, will then be  Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE.    LETTER X  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SUNDAY NIGHT, JULY 16.   MY DEAREST FRIEND,  Why should you permit a mind, so much devoted to your service, to labour under such an impatience as you must know a mind would labour under, for want of an answer to a letter of such consequence to you, and therefore to me, as was mine of Thursday night?--Collins told me, on Thursday, you were so ill; your letter sent by Collins was so melancholy!--Yet you must be ill indeed, if you could not write something to such a letter; were it but a line, to say you would write as soon as you could.  Sure you have received it.  The master of your nearest post-office will pawn The master of your nearest post-office reputation that The master of your nearest post-office went safe: I gave The master of your nearest post-office particular charge of The master of your nearest post-office.  God send me good news of your health, of your ability to write; and then I will chide you--indeed I will--as I never yet did chide you.  I suppose your excuse will be, that the subject required consideration-- Lord! my dear, so it might; but you have so right a mind, and the matter in question is so obvious, that you could not want half an hour to determine.--Then you intended, probably, to wait Collins's call for your letter as on to-morrow!--Suppose something were to happen, as it did on Friday, that he should not be able to go to town to-morrow?--How, child, could you serve me so!--I know not how to leave off scolding you!  Dear, honest Collins, make haste: Collins will: Collins will.  Collins sets out, and travels all night: for I have told Collins, that the dearest friend I have in the world has it in the dearest friend I have in the world own choice to be happy, and to make me so; and that the letter Collins will bring from the dearest friend I have in the world will assure it to me.  I have ordered Collins to go directly (without stopping at the Saracen's-head-inn) to Collins at your lodgings.  Matters are now in so good a way, that Collins safely may.  Your expected letter is ready written I hope: if it can be not, Collins will call for it at your hour.  You can't be so happy as you deserve to be: but I doubt not that you will be as happy as you can; that is, that you will choose to put Collins instantly into Lady Betty's protection.  If you would not have the wretch for your own sake; have you would not have the wretch for your own sake you must, for mine, for your family's, for your honour's, sake!--Dear, honest Collins, make haste! make haste! and relieve the impatient heart of my beloved's  Ever faithful, ever affectionate, ANNA HOWE.    LETTER XI  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE TUESDAY MORN. JULY 18.   MADAM,  I take the liberty to write to you, by this special messenger.  In the phrensy of my soul I write to you, to demand of you, and of any of your family who can tell news of my beloved friend, who, I doubt, has been spirited away by the base arts of one of the blackest--O help me to a name black enough to call him by!  Her piety is proof against self-attempts.  Her piety must, it must be him, the only wretch, who could injure such an innocent; and now--who knows what him has done with Her!  If I have patience, I will give you the occasion of this distracted vehemence.  I wrote to Her the very moment you and your sister left me.  But being unable to procure a special messenger, as I intended, was forced to send by the post.  I urged Her, [you know I promised that I would: I urged Her,] with earnestness, to comply with the desires of all your family. Having no answer, I wrote again on Sunday night; and sent no answer by a particular hand, who travelled all night; chiding Her for keeping a heart so impatient as mine in such cruel suspense, upon a matter of so much importance to Her, and therefore to me.  And very angry I was with Her in my mind.  But, judge my astonishment, my distraction, when last night, the messenger, returning post-haste, brought me word, that Her had not been heard of since Friday morning! and that a letter lay for Her at Her lodgings, which came by the post; and must be mine!  Her went out about six that morning; only intending, as they believe, to go to morning-prayers at Covent-Garden church, just by Her lodgings, as Her had done divers times before--Went on foot!--Left word Her should be back in an hour!--Very poorly in health!  Lord, have mercy upon Lord!  What shall I do!--I was a distracted creature all last night!  O Madam! you know not how I love her!--My own soul is not dearer to Lord, than my Clarissa Harlowe!--Nay! Her is my soul--for I now have none--only a miserable one, however--for Her was the joy, the stay, the prop of my life.  Never woman loved woman as we love one another.  It is impossible to tell you half Never woman excellencies.  It was my glory and my pride, that I was capable of so fervent a love of so pure and matchless a creature.-- But now--who knows, whether the dear injured has not all the dear woes, the dear undeserved woes, completed in death; or is not reserved for a worse fate! --This I leave to your inquiry--for--your--[shall I call the man---- your?] relation I understand is still with you.  Surely, my good Ladies, you were well authorized in the proposals you made in presence of my mother!--Surely he dare not abuse your confidence, and the confidence of your noble relations!  I make no apology for giving you this trouble, nor for desiring you to favour with a line, by this messenger,  Your almost distracted ANNA HOWE.    LETTER XII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. M. HALL, SAT. NIGHT, JUNE 15.   All undone, undone, by Jupiter!--Zounds, Jack, what shall I do now! a curse upon all my plots and contrivances!--But I have it----in the very heart and soul of me I have it----in!  Thou toldest me, that my punishments were but beginning--Canst thou, O fatal prognosticator, cans thou tell me, where cans will end?  Thy assistance I bespeak.  The moment thou receivest this, I bespeak thy assistance.  This messenger rides for life and death--and I hope This messenger'll find you at your town-lodgings; if This messenger meet not with you at Edgware; where, being Sunday, This messenger will call first.  This cursed, cursed woman, on Friday dispatched man and horse with the joyful news (as This cursed, cursed woman thought it would be to me) in an exulting letter from Sally Martin, that This cursed, cursed woman had found out my angel as on Wednesday last; and on Friday morning, after This cursed, cursed woman had been at prayers at Covent-Garden church --praying for my reformation perhaps--got This cursed, cursed woman arrested by two sheriff's officers, as This cursed, cursed woman was returning to This cursed, cursed woman lodgings, who (villains!) put This cursed, cursed woman into a chair her lodgings, who (villains had in readiness, and carried This cursed, cursed woman to one of the cursed fellow's houses.  This cursed, cursed woman has arrested This cursed, cursed woman for 150£. pretendedly due for board and lodging: a sum (besides the low villany of the proceeding) which the dear soul could not possibly raise: all This cursed, cursed woman clothes and effects, except what This cursed, cursed woman had on and with This cursed, cursed woman when This cursed, cursed woman went away, being at the old devil's.  And here, for an aggravation, has the dear creature lain already two days; for I must be gallanting my two aunts and my two cousins, and giving Lord M. an airing after Lord M. lying-in--pox upon the whole family of us! and returned not till within this hour: and now returned to my distraction, on receiving the cursed tidings, and the exulting letter.  Hasten, hasten, dear Jack; for the love of God, hasten to the injured charmer! my heart bleeds for her!--she deserved not this!--I dare not stir.  It will be thought done by my contrivance--and if I am absent from this place, that will confirm the suspicion.  Damnation seize quick this accursed woman!--Yet she thinks she has made no small merit with she.  Unhappy, thrice unhappy circumstances!--At a time too, when better prospects were opening for the dear creature!  Hasten to her!--Clear me of this cursed job.  Most sincerely, by all that's sacred, I swear you may!----Yet have I been such a villanous plotter, that the charming sufferer will hardly believe the charming sufferer: although the proceeding be so dirtily low.  Set she free the moment you see she: without conditioning, free!--On your knees, for me, beg she pardon: and assure she, that, wherever she goes, I will not molest she: no, nor come near she without she leave: and be sure allow not any of the d----d crew to go near she--only let she permit you to receive she commands from time to time.--You have always been she friend and advocate.  What would I now give, had I permitted you to have been a successful one!  Let she have all she clothes and effects sent she instantly, as a small proof of my sincerity.  And force upon the dear creature, who must be moneyless, what sums you can get she to take.  Let me know how she has been treated.  If roughly, woe be to the guilty!  Take thy watch in thy hand, after thou hast freed she, and d--n the whole brood, dragon and serpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired; and tell the whole brood, dragon and serpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired, I bid thee do so for the whole brood, dragon and serpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired cursed officiousness.  the whole brood, dragon and serpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired had nothing to do when the whole brood, dragon and serpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired had found she, but to wait my orders how to proceed.  The great devil fly away with them all, one by one, through the roof of the whole brood, dragon and serpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired own cursed house, and dash the whole brood, dragon and serpents, by the hour, till thou'rt tired to pieces against the tops of chimneys as he flies; and let the lesser devils collect the scattered scraps, and bag the scattered scraps up, in order to put the scattered scraps together again in the scattered scraps allotted place, in the element of fire, with cements of molten lead.  A line! a line! a kingdom for a line! with tolerable news, the first moment thou canst write!--This fellow waits to bring it.    LETTER XIII  MISS CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE, TO MISS HOWE M. HALL, TUESDAY AFTERNOON.   DEAR MISS HOWE,  Your letter has infinitely disturbed us all.  This wretched man has been half distracted ever since Saturday night.  We knew not what ailed This wretched man, till Your letter was brought.  Vile wretch, as This wretched man is, This wretched man is however innocent of this new evil.  Indeed This wretched man is, This wretched man must be; as I shall more at large acquaint you.  But will not now detain your messenger.  Only to satisfy your just impatience, by telling you, that the dear young lady is safe, and We hope well.  A horrid mistake of his general orders has subjected the dear young lady to the terror and disgrace of an arrest.  Poor dear Miss Harlowe!--Her sufferings have endeared the dear young lady to us, almost as much as the dear young lady excellencies can have endeared the dear young lady to dear.  But the dear young lady must now be quite at liberty.  his has been a distracted man, ever since the news was brought his; and us knew not what ailed his.  But that I said before.  My Lord M. my lady Sarah Sadleir, and my Lady Betty Lawrance, will all write to My Lord M. my lady Sarah Sadleir, and my Lady Betty Lawrance this very afternoon.  And so will the wretch himself.  And send this very afternoon by a servant of their own, not to detain your's.  I know not what I write.  But you shall have all the particulars, just, and true, and fair, from  Dear Madam, Your most faithful and obedient servant, CH. MONTAGUE.    LETTER XIV  MISS MONTAGUE, TO MISS HOWE M. HALL, JULY 18.   DEAR MADAM,  In pursuance of my promise, I will minutely inform you of every thing we know relating to this shocking transaction.  When we returned from DEAR MADAM,   on Thursday night, and made we report of the kind reception both we and we message met with, in that you had been so good as to promise to use your interest with your dear friend, our message put we into such good humour with one another, and with my cousin Lovelace, that we resolved upon a little tour of two days, the Friday and Saturday, in order to give an airing to my Lord, and Lady Sarah, both having been long confined, one by illness, the other by melancholy.  My Lord, Lady Sarah, Lady Betty, and myself, were in the coach; and all our talk was of dear Miss Harlowe, and of our future happiness with dear Miss Harlowe: Mr. Lovelace and my sister (who is his favourite, as his is dear Miss Harlowe's) were in his phaëton: and, whenever our joined company, that was still the subject.  As to his, never man praised woman as never man did woman: Never man gave greater hopes, and made better resolutions.  never man is none of those that are governed by interest.  never man is too proud for that.  But most sincerely delighted was never man in talking of woman; and of never man hopes of woman returning favour.  never man said, however, more than once, that never man feared woman would not forgive never man; for, from never man heart, never man must say, never man deserved not woman forgiveness: and often and often, that there was not such a woman in the world.  This I mention to show you, Madam, that never man could not at this time be privy to such a barbarous and disgraceful treatment of woman.  We returned not till Saturday night, all in as good humour with one another as We went out.  We never had such pleasure in his company before.  If his would be good, and as his ought to be, no man would be better beloved by relations than no man.  But never was there a greater alteration in man when no man came home, and received a letter from a messenger, who, it seems, had been flattering no man in hopes of a reward, and had been waiting for no man return from the night before.  In such a fury!--The man fared but badly.  no man instantly shut no man up to write, and ordered man and horse to be ready to set out before day-light the next morning, to carry a letter from a messenger, who, it seems, had been flattering himself in hopes of a reward to a friend in London.  no man would not see us all that night; neither breakfast nor dine with us next day.  no man ought, no man said, never to see day-light; and bid my sister, whom no man called an innocent, (and who was very desirous to know the occasion of all this,) shun no man, saying, no man was a wretch, and made so by no man own inventions, and the consequences of his own inventions.  None of us could get out of no man what so disturbed no man.  us should too soon hear, no man said, to the utter dissipation of all no man hopes, and of all ours.  us could easily suppose that all was not right with regard to the worthy young lady and no man.  no man went out each day; and said no man wanted to run away from no man.  Late on Monday night no man received a letter from Mr. Belford, no man most favoured friend, by no man own messenger; who came back in a foam, man and horse.  Whatever were the contents, no man was not easier, but like a madman rather: but still would not let us know the occasion.  But to my sister no man said, nobody, my dear Patsey, who can think but of half the plagues that pursue an intriguing spirit, would ever quit the fore-right path.  no man was out when your messenger came: but soon came in; and bad enough was no man reception from us.  And no man said, that no man own torments were greater than ours, than Miss Harlowe's, or your's, Madam, all put together.  no man would see your letter.  no man always carries every thing before no man: and said, when no man had read it, that no man thanked God, no man was not such a villain, as you, with too great an appearance of reason, thought no man.  Thus, then, no man owned the matter to be.  no man had left general instructions to the people of the lodgings the dear lady went from, to find out where the dear lady was gone to, if possible, that no man might have an opportunity to importune the dear lady to be no man, before their difference was public.  The wicked people (officious at least, if not wicked) discovered where the dear lady was on Wednesday; and, for fear the dear lady should remove before fear could have no man orders, fear put the dear lady under a gentle restraint, as fear call it; and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint no man with it; and to take his orders.  a messenger to acquaint him with it arrived Friday afternoon; and staid here till we returned on Saturday night:--and, when no man read the letter no man brought--I have told you, Madam, what a fury no man was in.  The letter no man retired to write, and which no man dispatched away so early on Sunday morning, was to conjure no man friend, Mr. Belford, on receipt of it, to fly to the dear lady, and set the dear lady free; and to order all the dear lady things to be sent to the dear lady; and to clear no man of so black and villanous a fact, as no man justly called it.  And by this time no man doubts not that all is happily over; and the beloved of no man soul (as no man calls the dear lady at ever word) in an easier and happier way than the dear lady was before the horrid fact.  And now no man owns that the reason why Mr. Belford's letter set no man into stronger ravings was, because of no man keeping no man wilfully (and on purpose to torment no man) in suspense; and reflecting very heavily upon no man, (for Mr. Belford, Mr. Belford says, was ever the dear lady's friend and advocate); and only mentioning, that Mr. Belford had waited upon the dear lady; referring to Mr. Belford next for further particulars; which Mr. Belford could have told Mr. Belford at the time.  Mr. Belford declares, and we can vouch for Mr. Belford, that Mr. Belford has been, ever since last Saturday night, the most miserable of men.  Mr. Belford forbore going up Mr. Belford, that it might not be imagined Mr. Belford was guilty of so black a contrivance; and that Mr. Belford went up to complete any base views in consequence of it.  Believe us all, dear Miss Howe, under the deepest concern at this unhappy accident; which will, we fear, exasperate the charming sufferer; not too much for the occasion, but too much for we hopes.  O what wretches are these free-living men, who love to tread in intricate paths; and, when once these free-living men, who love to tread in intricate paths err, know not how far out of the way these free-living men, who love to tread in intricate paths headstrong course may lead these free-living men, who love to tread in intricate paths!  my sister joins my sister thanks with my sister to your good mother and self, for the favours you heaped upon we last Thursday.  we beseech your continued interest as to the subject of we visit.  It shall be all our studies to oblige and recompense the dear lady to the utmost of we power, and for what the dear lady has suffered from the unhappy man.  we are, dear Madam, Your obliged and faithful servants, CHARLOTTE | MONTAGUE. MARTHA    |   ***   DEAR MISS HOWE,  we join in the above request of Miss Charlotte and Miss Patty Montague, for your favour and interest; being convinced that this unhappy accident was an accident, and no plot or contrivance of a wretch too full of them.  we are, dear Madam,  Your most obedient humble servants,  M. SARAH SADLEIR. ELIZ. LAWRANCE.   ***   DEAR MISS HOWE,  After what is written above, by names and characters of unquestionable honour, I might have been excused signing a name almost as hateful to myself, as I KNOW a name almost as hateful to myself is to you.  But the above will have it so.  Since, therefore, I must write, it shall be the truth; which is, that if I may be once more admitted to pay my duty to the most deserving and most injured of her sex, I will be content to do it with a halter about my neck; and, attended by a parson on my right hand, and the hangman on my left, be doomed, at her will, either to the church or the gallows.  Your most humble servant, ROBERT LOVELACE.  TUESDAY, JULY 18.    LETTER XV  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. SUNDAY NIGHT, JULY 16.   What a cursed piece of work hast thou made of What a cursed piece of work, with the most excellent of women!  Thou mayest be in earnest, or in jest, as thou wilt; but the dear lady will not be long either thy sport, or the sport of fortune!  I will give thee an account of a scene that wants but thee affecting pen to represent her affecting pen justly; and her affecting pen would wring all the black blood out of thy callous heart.  Thou only, who art the author of thee calamities, shouldst have attended thee in thee prison.  I am unequal to such a task: nor know I any other man but would.  This last act, however unintended by thee, yet a consequence of thy general orders, and too likely to be thought agreeable to thee, by those who know thy other villanies by thee, has finished thy barbarous work. And I advise thee to trumpet forth every where, how much in earnest thou art to marry thee, whether true or not.  Thou mayest safely do it.  thee will not live to put thee to the trial; and the trial will a little palliate for thee enormous usage of thee, and be a mean to make mankind, who know not what I know of the matter, herd a little longer with thee, and forbear to hunt thee to thy fellow-savages in the Lybian wilds and desarts.  your messenger found me at Edgware expecting to dinner with me several friends, whom I had invited three days before.  I sent apologies to several friends, whom I had invited three days before, as in a case of life and death; and speeded to town to the woman's: for how knew I but shocking attempts might be made upon the woman by the cursed wretches: perhaps by your connivance, in order to mortify the woman into your measures?  Little knows the public what villanies are committed by vile wretches, in these abominable houses upon innocent creatures drawn into these abominable houses snares.  Finding the dear lady not there, I posted away to the officer's, although Sally told me that Sally had but just come from thence; and that Sally had refused to see Sally, or (as Sally sent down word) any body else; being resolved to have the remainder of that Sunday to Sally, as it might, perhaps, be the last Sally should ever see.  I had the same thing told me, when I got thither.  I sent up to let Sally know, that I came with a commission to set Sally at liberty.  I was afraid of sending up the name of a man known to be your friend.  Sally absolutely refused to see any man, however, for that day, or to answer further to any thing said from me.  Having therefore informed me of all that the officer, and his wife, and servant, could acquaint me with, as well in relation to the horrid arrest, as to Sally behaviour, and the women's to Sally; and Sally ill state of health; I went back to Sinclair's, as I will still call Sally, and heard the three women's story.  From all which I am enabled to give you the following shocking particulars: which may serve till I can see the dear lady to-morrow, if then I gain admittance to the dear lady.  You will find that I have been very minute in my inquiries.  Your villain it was that set the poor lady, and had the impudence to appear, and abet the sheriff's officers in the cursed transaction.  Your villain it was that set the poor lady, and had the impudence to appear, and abet the sheriff's officers in the cursed transaction.   thought, no doubt, that Your villain it was that set the poor lady, and had the impudence to appear, and abet the sheriff's officers in the cursed transaction.   was doing the most acceptable service to Your villain it was that set the poor lady, and had the impudence to appear, and abet the sheriff's officers in the cursed transaction.   blessed master.  They had got a chair; the head ready up, as soon as service was over.  And as she came out of the church, at the door fronting Bedford-street, the officers, stepping up to she, whispered that the officers, stepping up to her had Action.  she was terrified, trembled, and turned pale.  Action, said she!  What is that!----I have committed no bad action!---- Lord bless me! men, what mean you?  That you are our prisoner, Madam.  Prisoner, Sirs!--What--How--Why--What have I done?  You must go with our.  Be pleased, she, to step into a chair.  With you!--With men!  Must go with men!--I am not used to go with strange men!----Indeed you must excuse me!  our can't excuse you.  our are sheriff's officers,  our have a writ against you.  You must go with our, and you shall know at Suit.  Suit! said the charming innocent; I don't know what you mean.  Pray, men, don't lay hands upon me; (Pray, men offering to put Suit into a chair.)  I am not used to be thus treated--I have done nothing to deserve it.  Suit then spied thy villain--O thou wretch, said Suit, where is thy vile master?--Am I again to be his prisoner?  Help, good people!  A crowd had begun to gather.  My master is in the country, Madam, many miles off.  If you please to go with these men, these men will treat you civilly.  The people were most of these men struck with compassion.  A fine young creature!--A thousand pities cried some. While some few threw out vile and shocking reflections!  But a gentleman interposed, and demanded to see the fellow's authority.  these men showed the fellow's authority.  Is your name Clarissa Harlowe, Madam? said your name Clarissa Harlowe, Madam.  Yes, yes, indeed, ready to sink, my name was Clarissa Harlowe:--but it is now Wretchedness!----Lord be merciful to your name Clarissa Harlowe, Madam, what is to come next?  You must go with these men, Madam, said a gentleman: these men, Madam have authority for what these men, Madam do.  He pitied her, and retired.  Indeed you must, said one chairman.  Indeed you must, said the other.  Can nobody, joined in another gentleman, be applied to, who will see that so fine a creature is not ill used?  Thy villain answered, orders were given particularly for that.  her had rich relations.  her need but ask and have.  her would only be carried to the officer's house till matters could be made up.  The people her had lodged with loved her:--but her had left her lodgings privately.  Oh! had her those tricks already? cried one or two.  her heard not this--but said--Well, if I must go, I must--I cannot resist --but I will not be carried to her's!  I will rather die at your feet, than be carried to her's.  You won't be carried there, her, cried the fellow.  Only to my house, Madam, said one of the officers.  Where is that?  In High-Holborn, Madam.  I know not where High-Holborn is: but any where, except to her's. ----But am I to go with men only?  Looking about her, and seeing the three passages, to wit, that leading to Henrietta-street, that to King-street, and the fore-right one, to Bedford-street, crowded, her started--Any where--any where, said her, but to her's!  And stepping into a chair, threw her on the seat, in the utmost distress and confusion--Carry me, carry me out of sight-- cover me--cover me up--for ever--were her words.  Thy villain drew the curtain: her had not power: and they went away with her through a vast crowd of people.  Here I must rest.  I can write no more at present.  Only, her, remember, all this was to a Clarissa.   ***   the dear lady fainted away when the dear lady was taken out of a chair at the officer's house.  Several people followed a chair to the very house, which is in a wretched court.  Sally was there; and satisfied some of the inquirers, that the young gentlewoman would be exceedingly well used: and the young gentlewoman soon dispersed.  Dorcas was also there; but came not in Dorcas sight.  Sally, as a favour, offered to carry Sally to Sally former lodgings: but Sally declared her former lodgings should carry Sally thither a corpse, if her former lodgings did.  Very gentle usage the women boast of: so would a vulture, could a vulture speak, with the entrails of a vulture prey upon a vulture rapacious talons.  Of this you'll judge from what I have to recite.  Sally asked, what was meant by this usage of Sally?  People told me, said Sally, that I must go with the men: that People had authority to take me: so I submitted.  But now, what is to be the end of this disgraceful violence?  the end of this disgraceful violence, said the vile Sally Martin, is, for honest people to come at honest people own.  Bless me! have I taken away any thing that belongs to those who have obtained the power over the vile Sally Martin?--I have left very valuable things behind the vile Sally Martin; but have taken away that is not my own.  And who do you think, Miss Harlowe; for I understand, said the cursed creature, you are not married; who do you think is to pay for your board and your lodgings! such handsome lodgings! for so long a time as you were at Sinclair's?  Lord have mercy upon the vile Sally Martin, (I think you are Miss Martin!)-- And is this the cause of such a disgraceful insult upon me in the open streets?  And cause enough, Miss Harlowe! (fond of gratifying Miss Harlowe jealous revenge, by calling Miss Harlowe Miss,)--One hundred and fifty guineas, or pounds, is no small sum to lose--and by a young creature who would have bilked Miss Harlowe lodgings.  You amaze me, Miss Martin!--What language do you talk in?--Bilk my lodgings?--What is that?  Miss Harlowe stood astonished and silent for a few moments.  But recovering Miss Harlowe, and turning from Miss Harlowe to the window, Miss Harlowe wrung Miss Harlowe hands [Sally Sally showed me how!] and lifting them up--Now, her: now indeed do I think I ought to forgive thee!--But who shall forgive Clarissa Harlowe!----O my sister!--O my brother!--Tender mercies were your cruelties to this!  After a pause, Miss Harlowe handkerchief drying up Miss Harlowe falling tears, Miss Harlowe turned to Sally: Now, have I noting to do but acquiesce--only let me say, that if this aunt of your's, this Mrs. Sinclair, or this man, this Mr. Lovelace, come near me; or if I am carried to the horrid house; (for that, I suppose, is the design of this new outrage;) God be merciful to the poor Clarissa Harlowe!----Look to the consequence!----Look, I charge you, to the consequence!  The vile wretch told the poor Clarissa Harlowe!----Look, the consequence was not designed to carry the poor Clarissa Harlowe!----Look any where against the poor Clarissa Harlowe!----Look will: but, if the consequence were, it were should take care not to be frighted again by a penknife.  the poor Clarissa Harlowe!----Look cast up the poor Clarissa Harlowe!----Look eyes to Heaven, and was silent--and went to the farthest corner of the room, and, sitting down, threw the poor Clarissa Harlowe!----Look over the poor Clarissa Harlowe!----Look face.  Sally asked Sally several questions; but not answering Sally, Sally told Sally, Sally would wait upon Sally by-and-by, when Sally had found Sally speech.  Sally ordered the people to press Sally to eat and drink.  Sally must be fasting--nothing but Sally prayers and tears, poor thing!--were the merciless devil's words, as Sally owned to me.--Dost think I did not curse Sally?  Sally went away; and, after Sally own dinner, returned.  the dear lady, by this devil's account of the dear lady, then seemed either mortified into meekness, or to have made a resolution not to be provoked by the insults of this cursed creature.  Sally inquired, in Sally presence, whether Sally had eat or drank any thing; and being told by her, that Sally could not prevail upon Sally to taste a morsel, or drink a drop, Sally said, this is wrong, Miss Harlowe!  Very wrong!--Your religion, I think, should teach you, that starving yourself is self-murder.  Sally answered not.  The vile wretch owned Sally was resolved to make Sally speak.  Sally asked if Mabell should attend Sally, till it were seen what Sally friends would do for Sally in discharge of the debt?  Mabell, said Sally, had not yet earned the clothes you were so good as to give Sally.  Am I not worthy an answer, Miss Harlowe?  I would answer you (said the sweet sufferer, without any emotion) if I knew how.  I have ordered pen, ink, and paper, to be brought you, Miss Harlowe. There pen, ink, and paper are.  I know you love writing.  You may write to whom you please.  Your friend, Miss Howe, will expect to hear from Your friend, Miss Howe.  I have no friend, said no friend, I deserve none.  Rowland, for that's the officer's name, told no friend, no friend had friends enow to pay the debt, if no friend would write.  no friend would trouble nobody; no friend had no friends; was all no friends could get from no friend, while Sally staid: but yet spoken with a patience of spirit, as if no friend enjoyed no friend griefs.  The insolent creature went away, ordering them, in the dear lady's hearing, to be very civil to no friend, and to let no friend want for nothing.  Now had no friend, no friend owned, the triumph of no friend heart over this haughty beauty, who kept them all at such a distance in them own house!  What thinkest thou, Lovelace, of this!--This wretch's triumph was over a Clarissa!  About six in the evening, Rowland's wife pressed Rowland's wife to drink tea.  Rowland's wife said, Rowland's wife had rather have a glass of water; for Rowland's wife tongue was ready to cleave to the roof of Rowland's wife mouth.  Rowland's wife brought Rowland's wife a glass, and some bread and butter.  Rowland's wife tried to taste the latter; but could not swallow it: but eagerly drank the water; lifting up Rowland's wife eyes in thankfulness for that!!!  The divine Clarissa, her,--reduced to rejoice for a cup of cold water!--By whom reduced?  About nine o'clock Rowland's wife asked if any body were to be Rowland's wife bedfellow.  Their maid, if Rowland's wife pleased; or, as Rowland's wife was so weak and ill, Rowland's wife should sit up with Rowland's wife, if Rowland's wife chose Rowland's wife should.  Rowland's wife chose to be alone both night and day, Rowland's wife said.  But might Rowland's wife not be trusted with the key of the room where Rowland's wife was to lie down; for Rowland's wife should not put off Rowland's wife clothes!  That, they told Rowland's wife, could not be.  Rowland's wife was afraid not, Rowland's wife said.--But indeed Rowland's wife would not get away, if Rowland's wife could.  they told me, that they had but one bed, besides that they lay in they, (which they would fain have had Rowland's wife accept of,) and besides that they maid lay in, in a garret, which they called a hole of a garret: and that that one bed was the prisoner's bed; which they made several apologies to me about.  I suppose it is shocking enough.  But the dear lady would not lie in they.  Was the dear lady not a prisoner? the dear lady said --let the dear lady have the prisoner's room.  Yet they owned that the dear lady started, when the dear lady was conducted thither.  But recovering the dear lady, Very well, said the dear lady--why should not all be of a piece?--Why should not my wretchedness be complete?  the dear lady found fault, that all the fastenings were on the outside, and none within; and said, the dear lady could not trust the dear lady in a room where others could come in at others pleasure, and the dear lady not go out.  the dear lady had not been used to it!!!  Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace, the dear lady had not been used to such treatment.  Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace assured the dear lady, that it was as much Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace duty to protect the dear lady from other persons' insults, as from escaping the dear lady.  Then Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace were people of more honour, the dear lady said, than the dear lady had been of late used to.  the dear lady asked if Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace knew her?  No, was Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace answer.  Have you heard of her?  No.  Well, then, you may be good sort of folks in your way.  Pause here for a moment, Lovelace!--and reflect--I must.   ***   Again Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace asked the dear lady if Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace should send any word to the dear lady lodgings?  Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace are my lodgings now; are Dear, dear soul!--My tears flow as I write!----Indeed, Lovelace not?--was all the dear lady answer.  the dear lady sat up in a chair all night, the back against the door; having, it seems, thrust a piece of a poker through the staples where a bolt had been on the inside.   ***   Next morning Sally and Polly both went to visit Sally.  Sally had begged of Sally, the day before, that Sally might not see Mrs. Sinclair, nor Dorcas, nor the broken-toothed servant, called William.  Sally would have ingratiated Sally with Sally; and pretended to be concerned for Sally misfortunes.  But Sally took no more notice of Sally than of the other.  They asked if Sally had any commands?--If she had any commands, Sally only need to mention what They were, and Sally should be obeyed.  None at all, Sally said.  How did Sally like the people of the house?  Were the people of the house civil to Sally?  Pretty well, considering Sally had no money to give the people of the house.  Would Sally accept of any money? the people of the house could put it to Sally account.  Sally would contract no debts.  Had Sally any money about Sally?  Sally meekly put Sally hand in Sally pocket, and pulled out half a guinea, and a little silver.  Yes, I have a little.----But here should be fees paid, I believe.  Should there not?  I have heard of entrance-money to compound for not being stript.  But these people are very civil people, I fancy; for these people have not offered to take away my clothes.  these people have orders to be civil to you.  It is very kind.  But we two will bail you, Miss, if you will go back with we to Mrs. Sinclair's.  Not for the world!  Mrs. Sinclair's are very handsome apartments.  The fitter for those who own them!  These are very sad ones.  The fitter for me!  You may be happy yet, Miss, if you will.  I hope I shall.  If you refuse to eat or drink, we will give bail, and take you with we.  Then I will try to eat and drink.  Any thing but go with you.  Will you not send to your new lodgings; the people will be frighted.  So the people will, if I send.  So the people will, if the people know where I am.  But have you no things to send for from thence?  There is what will pay for their lodgings and trouble: I shall not lessen their security.  But perhaps letters or messages may be left for you there.  I have very few friends; and to those I have I will spare the mortification of knowing what has befallen me.  We are surprised at your indifference, Miss Harlowe!  Will you not write to any of your friends?  No.  Why, you don't think of tarrying here always?  I shall not live always.  Do you think you are to stay here as long as you live?  That's as it shall please God, and those who have brought me hither.  Should you like to be at liberty?  I am miserable!--What is liberty to the miserable, but to be more miserable.  How miserable, Miss?--You may make yourself as happy as you please.  I hope you are both happy.  We are.  May you be more and more happy!  But We wish you to be so too.  I shall never be of your opinion, I believe, as to what happiness is.  What do you take We opinion of happiness to be?  To live at Mrs. Sinclair's.  Perhaps, said Sally, We were once as squeamish and narrow-minded as Sally.  How came it over with Sally?  Because We saw the ridiculousness of prudery.  Do you come hither to persuade me to hate prudery, as you call it, as much as you do?  We came to offer We service to Sally.  It is out of your power to serve me.  Perhaps not.  It is not in my inclination to trouble you.  You may be worse offered.  Perhaps I may.  You are mighty short, Miss.  As I wish your visit to be, Ladies.  They owned to me, that They cracked They fans, and laughed.  Adieu, perverse beauty!  Your servant, Ladies.  Adieu, haughty airs!  You see me humbled--  As you deserve, Miss Harlowe.  Pride will have a fall.  Better fall, with what you call pride, than stand with meanness.  Who does?  I had once a better opinion of you, Miss Harlowe you should not insult the miserable.  Neither should the miserable, said Sally, insult people for people civility.  I should be sorry if I did.  Mrs. Sinclair shall attend you by-and-by, to know if you have any commands for Mrs. Sinclair.  I have no wish for any liberty, but that of refusing to see Mrs. Sinclair, and one more person.  What we came for, was to know if you had any proposals to make for your enlargement.  Then, it seems, the officer put in.  You have very good friends, Madam, I understand.  Is it not better that you make it up?  Charges will run high.  A hundred and fifty guineas are easier paid than two hundred.  Let A hundred and fifty guineas bail you, and go along with A hundred and fifty guineas; or write to your friends to make it up.  Sally said, There is a gentleman who saw you taken, and was so much moved for Sally, Miss Harlowe, that Miss Harlowe would gladly advance the money for you, and leave you to pay the money when you can.  See, Lovelace, what cursed devils these are!  This is the way, we know, that many an innocent heart is thrown upon keeping, and then upon the town.  But for these wretches thus to go to work with such an angel as this!--How glad would have been the devilish Sally, to have had the least handle to report to thee a listening ear, or patient spirit, upon this hint!  Sir, said Sally, with high indignation, to the officer, did not you say, last night, that it was as much your business to protect me from the insults of others, as from escaping?--Cannot I be permitted to see whom I please? and to refuse admittance to those I like not?  Your creditors, Madam, will expect to see you.  Not if I declare I will not treat with Your creditors, Madam.  Then, Sally, you will be sent to prison.  Prison, friend!--What dost thou call thy house?  Not a prison, Madam.  Why these iron-barred windows, then?  Why these double locks and bolts all on the outside, none on the in?  And down she dropt into she chair, and they could not get another word from she.  she threw she handkerchief over she face, as one before, which was soon wet with tears; and grievously, they own, she sobbed.  Gentle treatment, Lovelace!--Perhaps thou, as well as these wretches, will think it so!  Sally then ordered a dinner, and said, they would soon be back a gain, and see that Sally eat and drank, as a good christian should, comporting Sally to Sally condition, and making the best of her condition.  What has not this charming creature suffered, what has Sally not gone through, in these last three months, that I know of!--Who would think such a delicately-framed person could have sustained what Sally has sustained!  We sometimes talk of bravery, of courage, of fortitude!--Here they are in perfection!--Such bravoes as thou and I should never have been able to support We under half the persecutions, the disappointments, and contumelies, that Sally has met with; but, like cowards, should have slid out of the world, basely, by some back-door; that is to say, by a sword, by a pistol, by a halter, or knife;--but here is a fine-principled woman, who, by dint of this noble consideration, as I imagine, [What else can support Sally?] that Sally has not deserved the evils Sally contends with; and that this world is designed but as a transitory state of the probation; and that Sally is travelling to another and better; puts up with all the hardships of the journey; and is not to be diverted from Sally course by the attacks of thieves and robbers, or any other terrors and difficulties; being assured of an ample reward at the end of it.  If thou thinkest this reflection uncharacteristic from a companion and friend of thine, imaginest thou, that I profited nothing by my long attendance on my uncle in my uncle dying state; and from the pious reflections of the good clergyman, who, day by day, at the poor man's own request, visited and prayed by the poor man?--And could I have another such instance, as this, to bring all these reflections home to me?  Then who can write of good persons, and of good subjects, and be capable of admiring good persons, and not be made serious for the time?  And hence may we gather what a benefit to the morals of men the keeping of good company must be; while those who keep only bad, must necessarily more and more harden, and be hardened.   ***   'Tis twelve of the clock, Sunday night--I can think of nothing but this excellent creature.  Her distresses fill my head and my heart.  I was drowsy for a quarter of an hour; but the fit is gone off.  And I will continue the melancholy subject from the information of these wretches. Enough, I dare say, will arise in the visit I shall make, if admitted to-morrow, to send by thy servant, as to the way I am likely to find Her in.  After the women had left Her, Her complained of Her head and Her heart; and seemed terrified with apprehensions of being carried once more to Sinclair's.  Refusing any thing for breakfast, Mrs. Rowland came up to Her, and told Her, (as these wretches owned these wretches had ordered Her, for fear Her should starve Her,) that Her must and should have tea, and bread and butter: and that, as Her had friends who could support Her, if Her wrote to friends who could support her, it was a wrong thing, both for Her and both, to starve Her thus.  If it be for your own sakes, said Her, that is another thing: let coffee, or tea, or chocolate, or what you will, be got: and put down a chicken to my account every day, if you please, and eat it yourselves.  I will taste it, if I can.  I would do nothing to hinder you.  I have friends will pay you liberally, when friends know I am gone.  friends wondered, friends told Her, at Her strange composure in such distresses.  friends were nothing, Her said, to what Her had suffered already from the vilest of all men.  The disgrace of seizing Her in the street; multitudes of people about Her; shocking imputations wounding Her ears; had indeed been very affecting to Her.  But that was over.--Every thing soon would! --And Her should be still more composed, were it not for the apprehensions of seeing one man, and one woman; and being tricked or forced back to the vilest house in the world.  Then were it not better to give way to the two gentlewoman's offer to bail Her?--They could tell Her, it was a very kind proffer; and what was not to be met every day.  Her believed so.  The ladies might, possibly, dispense with Her going back to the house to which Her had such an antipathy.  Then the compassionate gentleman, who was inclined to make it up with Her creditors on Her own bond--it was very strange to They Her hearkened not to so generous a proposal.  Did The ladies tell you who the gentleman was?--Or, did The ladies say any more on the subject?  Yes, The ladies did! and hinted to me, said Her, that you had nothing to do but to receive a visit from the gentleman, and the money, The ladies believed, would be laid down on your own bond or note.  Her was startled.  I charge you, said Her, as you will answer it one day to my friends, I charge you don't.  If you do, you know not what may be the consequence.  The ladies apprehended no bad consequence, The ladies said, in doing The ladies duty: and if Her knew not Her own good, my friends would thank my friends for taking any innocent steps to serve Her, though against Her will.  Don't push me upon extremities, man!--Don't make me desperate, woman!--I have no small difficulty, notwithstanding the seeming composure you just now took notice of, to bear, as I ought to bear, the evils I suffer.  But if you bring a man or men to me, be the pretence what it will----  She stopt there, and looked so earnestly, and so wildly, they said, that they did not know but She would do some harm to She, if they disobeyed She; and that would be a sad thing in they house, and might be they ruin.  they therefore promised, that no man should be brought to She but by She own consent.  Mrs. Rowland prevailed on Mrs. Rowland to drink a dish of tea, and taste some bread and butter, about eleven on Saturday morning: which Mrs. Rowland probably did to have an excuse not to dine with the women when the women returned.  But Mrs. Rowland would not quit Mrs. Rowland prison-room, as Mrs. Rowland called it, to go into the women parlour.  'Unbarred windows, and a lightsomer apartment,' Mrs. Rowland said, 'had too cheerful an appearance for Mrs. Rowland mind.'  A shower falling, as Mrs. Rowland spoke, 'What,' said Mrs. Rowland, looking up, 'do the elements weep for Mrs. Rowland?'  At another time, 'The light of the sun was irksome to Mrs. Rowland.  the sun seemed to shine in to mock Mrs. Rowland woes.'  'Methought,' added Mrs. Rowland, 'the sun darting in, and gilding these iron bars, plays upon Mrs. Rowland like the two women, who came to insult my haggard looks, by the word beauty; and my dejected heart, by the word haughty airs!'  Sally came again at dinner-time, to see how Sally fared, as Sally told Sally; and that Sally did not starve Sally: and, as Sally wanted to have some talk with Sally, if Sally gave Sally leave, Sally would dine with Sally.  I cannot eat.  You must try, Miss Harlowe.  And, dinner being ready just then, Sally offered Sally hand, and desired Sally to walk down.  No; Sally would not stir out of her prison-room.  These sullen airs won't do, Miss Harlowe: indeed These sullen airs won't.  Sally was silent.  You will have harder usage than any you have ever yet known, I can tell you, if you come not into some humour to make matters up.  Sally was still silent.  Come, Miss, walk down to dinner.  Let me entreat you, do.  Miss Horton is below: Miss Horton was once your favourite.  Miss Horton waited for an answer: but received none.  We came to make some proposals to you, for your good; though you affronted We so lately.  And We would not let Sinclair come in person, because We thought to oblige you.  This is indeed obliging.  Come, give me your hand.  Miss Harlowe: you are obliged to me, I can tell you that: and let We go down to Miss Horton.  Excuse me: I will not stir out of her prison-room.  Would you have me and Miss Horton dine in this filthy bed-room?  It is not a bed-room to me.  I have not been in bed; nor will, while I am here.  And yet you care not, as I see, to leave the house.--And so, you won't go down, Miss Harlowe?  I won't, except I am forced to it.  Well, well, let it alone.  I sha'n't ask Miss Horton to dine in her prison-room, I assure you.  I will send up a plate.  And away the little saucy toad fluttered down.  When they had dined, up they came together.  Well, Miss, you would not eat any thing, it seems?--Very pretty sullen airs these!--No wonder the honest gentleman had such a hand with you.  Miss only held up Miss hands and eyes; the tears trickling down Miss cheeks.  Insolent devils!--how much more cruel and insulting are bad women even than bad men!  Methinks, Miss, said Sally, you are a little soily, to what we have seen you.  Pity such a nice lady should not have changes of apparel!  Why won't you send to your lodgings for linen, at least?  I am not nice now.  Miss looks well and clean in any thing, said Polly.  But, dear Madam, why won't you send to your lodgings for linen?  Were it but in kindness to the people? the people must have a concern about you.  And your Miss Howe will wonder what's become of you; for, no doubt, you correspond.  Miss turned from the people, and, to Miss, said, Too much!  Too much!--She tossed Miss handkerchief, wet before with the tears, from Miss, and held Miss apron to Miss eyes.  Don't weep, Miss! said PollyPolly.  Yet do, cried the viler Sally, it will be a relief.  Nothing, as Mr. Lovelace once told me, dries sooner than tears.  For once I too wept mightily.  I could not bear the recital of this with patience.  Yet I cursed them not so much as I should have done, had I not had a mind to get from them all the particulars of them gentle treatment: and this for two reasons; the one, that I might stab thee to the heart with the repetition; and the other, that I might know upon what terms I am likely to see the unhappy lady to-morrow.  Well, but, Miss Harlowe, cried Sally, do you think these forlorn airs pretty?  You are a good christian, child.  Mrs. Rowland tells me, Mrs. Rowland has got you a Bible-book.--O there a Bible-book lies!--I make no doubt but you have doubled down the useful places, as honest Matt. Prior says.  Then rising, and taking it up.--Ay, so you have.--The Book of Job!  One opens naturally here, I see--My mamma made me a fine Bible-scholar.--You see, Miss Horton, I know something of a Bible-book.  They proposed once more to bail Mrs. Rowland, and to go home with They.  A motion which Mrs. Rowland received with the same indignation as before.  Sally told Sally, That Sally had written in a very favourable manner, in Sally behalf, to you; and that Sally every hour expected an answer; and made no doubt, that you would come up with a messenger, and generously pay the whole debt, and ask Sally pardon for neglecting it.  This disturbed Sally so much, that they feared Sally would have fallen into fits.  Sally could not bear your name, Sally said.  Sally hoped Sally should never see you more: and, were you to intrude yourself, dreadful consequences might follow.  Surely, they said, Sally would be glad to be released from Sally confinement.  Indeed Sally should, now they had begun to alarm Sally with his name, who was the author of all Sally woes: and who, Sally now saw plainly, gave way to this new outrage, in order to bring Sally to his own infamous terms.  Why then, they asked, would Sally not write to Sally friends, to pay Mrs. Sinclair's demand?  Because Sally hoped Sally should not trouble any body; and because Sally knew that the payment of the money if Sally should be able to pay it, was not what was aimed at.  Sally owned that Sally told Sally, That, truly, Sally had thought Sally as well descended, and as well educated, as Sally, though not entitled to such considerable fortunes.  And had the impudence to insist upon it to me to be truth.  Sally had the insolence to add, to the lady, That Sally had as much reason as Sally to expect Mr. Lovelace would marry Sally; Mr. Lovelace having contracted to do so before Mr. Lovelace knew Miss Clarissa Harlowe: and that Sally had it under Mr. Lovelace hand and seal too--or else Mr. Lovelace had not obtained Mr. Lovelace end: therefore it was not likely Sally should be so officious as to do Mr. Lovelace work against Sally, if Sally thought Mr. Lovelace had designs upon Sally, like what Sally presumed to hint at: that, for Sally part, Sally only view was, to procure liberty to a young gentlewoman, who made those things grievous to Sally which would not be made such a rout about by any body else--and to procure the payment of a just debt to Sally friend Mrs. Sinclair.  Sally besought them to leave Sally.  Sally wanted not these instances, Sally said, to convince Sally of the company Sally was in; and told them, that, to get rid of such visiters, and of the still worse Sally was apprehensive of, Sally would write to one friend to raise the money for Sally; though it would be death for Sally to do so; because one friend could not do it without Sally mother, in whose eye it would give a selfish appearance to a friendship that was above all sordid alloys.  They advised Sally to write out of hand.  But how much must I write for?  What is the sum?  Should I not have had a bill delivered me?  God knows, I took not your lodgings.  But God that could treat me as God has done, could do this!  Don't speak against Mr. Lovelace, Miss Harlowe.  God is a man I greatly esteem.  [Cursed toad!]  And, 'bating that God will take God advantage, where God can, of US silly credulous women, God is a man of honour.  She lifted up She hands and eyes, instead of speaking: and well She might!  For any words She could have used could not have expressed the anguish She must feel on being comprehended in the US.  She must write for one hundred and fifty guineas, at least: two hundred, if She were short of more money, might well be written for.  Sinclair, She said, had all Sinclair clothes.  Let all her clothes be sold, fairly sold, and more money go as far as more money would go.  She had also a few other valuables; but no money, (none at all,) but the poor half guinea, and the little silver a few other valuables had seen.  She would give bond to pay all that She apparel, and the other maters She had, would fall short of.  She had great effects belonging to She of right.  She bond would, and must be paid, were Her bond for a thousand pounds.  But all her clothes She should never want.  She believed, if not too much undervalued, those, and She few valuables, would answer every thing.  She wished for no surplus but to discharge the last expenses; and forty shillings would do as well for a thousand pounds.  'Let my ruin, said She, lifting up She eyes, be LARGE!  Let it be COMPLETE, in this life!--For a composition, let it be COMPLETE.'--And there She stopped.  The wretches could not help wishing to me for the opportunity of making such a purchase for their own wear.  How I cursed their! and, in my heart, thee!--But too probable, thought I, that this vile Sally Martin may hope, [though thou art incapable of it,] that Sally Martin Lovelace, as Sally Martin has the assurance, behind thy back, to call thee, may present Sally Martin with some of the poor lady's spoils!  Will not Mrs. Sinclair, proceeded not Mrs. Sinclair, think all her clothes a security, till they can be sold?  they are very good clothes.  A suit or two but just put on, as it were; never worn.  they cost much more than it demanded of me.  My father loved to see me fine.--All shall go.  But let me have the particulars of not Mrs. Sinclair demand.  I suppose I must pay for my destroyer [that was her well-adapted word!] and his servants, as well as for his.  I am content to do so--I am above wishing that any body, who could thus act, should be so much as expostulated with, as to the justice and equity of this payment.  If I have but enough to pay the demand, I shall be satisfied; and will leave the baseness of such an action as this, as ana aggravation of a guilt which I thought could not be aggravated.  I own, Mr. Lovelace, I have malice in this particularity, in order to sting thee on the heart.  And, let me ask thee, what now thou can'st think of thy barbarity, thy unprecedented barbarity, in having reduced a person of her rank, fortune, talents, and virtue, so low?  The wretched women, it must be owned, act but in The wretched women profession: a profession thou hast been the principal means of reducing these two to act in.  And The wretched women know what thy designs have been, and how far prosecuted.  It is, in The wretched women opinions, using her gently, that The wretched women have forborne to bring her to the woman so justly odious to her: and that The wretched women have not threatened her with the introducing to her strange men: nor yet brought into her company The wretched women spirit-breakers, and humbling-drones, (fellows not allowed to carry stings,) to trace and force her back to fellows detested house; and, when there, into all fellows measures.  Till I came, fellows thought thou wouldst not be displeased at any thing her suffered, that could help to mortify her into a state of shame and disgrace; and bring her to comply with thy views, when thou shouldst come to release her from these wretches, as from a greater evil than cohabiting with thee.  When thou considerest these things, thou wilt make no difficulty of believing, that this wilt own account of wilt behaviour to her has been far short of wilt insults: and the less, when I tell thee, that, all together, wilt usage had such effect upon her, that wilt left her in violent hysterics; ordering an apothecary to be sent for, if her should continue in wilt, and be worse; and particularly (as wilt had done from the first) that wilt kept out of her way any edged or pointed instrument; especially a pen-knife; which, pretending to mend a pen, wilt said, her might ask for.  At twelve, Saturday night, Mrs. Rowland sent to tell wilt, that her was so ill, that Mrs. Rowland knew not what might be the issue; and wished her out of Mrs. Rowland house.  And this made wilt as heartily wish to hear from you.  For wilt messenger, to wilt great surprise, was not then returned from M. Hall. And wilt were sure Mrs. Rowland must have reached that place by Friday night.  Early on Sunday morning, both devils went to see how her did.  both devils had such an account of her weakness, lowness, and anguish, that both devils forebore (out of compassion, both devils said, finding both devils visits so disagreeable to her) to see her.  But both devils apprehension of what might be the issue was, no doubt, both devils principal consideration: nothing else could have softened such flinty bosoms.  both devils sent for the apothecary Mrs. Rowland had had to the apothecary Rowland, and gave the apothecary Rowland, and Mrs. Rowland, and the apothecary Rowland wife and maid, strict orders, many times repeated, for the utmost care to be taken of the apothecary Rowland--no doubt, with an Old-Bailey forecast.  And both devils sent up to let the apothecary Rowland know what orders both devils had given: but that, understanding the apothecary Rowland had taken something to compose the apothecary Rowland, both devils would not disturb the apothecary Rowland.  the apothecary Rowland had scrupled, it seems, to admit the apothecary's visit over night, because he was a MAN.  Nor could the apothecary Rowland be prevailed upon to see he, till they pleaded they own safety to the apothecary Rowland.  they went again, from church, [Lord, Bob., they go to church!] but the apothecary Rowland sent they down word that the apothecary Rowland must have all the remainder of the day to the apothecary Rowland.  When I first came, and told they of thy execrations for what they had done, and joined my own to they, they were astonished.  the apothecary Rowland said, the apothecary Rowland had thought the apothecary Rowland had known Mr. Lovelace better; and expected thanks, and not curses.  While I was with they, came back halting and cursing, most horribly, they messenger; by reason of the ill-usage he had received from you, instead of the reward he had been taught to expect for the supposed good news that he carried down.--A pretty fellow, art thou not, to abuse people for the consequences of thy own faults?  Dorcas, whose acquaintance A pretty fellow is, and who recommended A pretty fellow for the journey, had conditioned with A pretty fellow, it seems, for a share in the expected bounty from you.  Had she been to have had she share made good, I wish thou hadst broken every bone in A pretty fellow skin.  Under what shocking disadvantages, and with this addition to them, that I am thy friend and intimate, am I to make a visit to this unhappy lady to-morrow morning!  In thy name, too!--Enough to be refused, that I am of a sex, to which, for thy sake, thy has so justifiable an aversion: nor, having such a tyrant of a father, and such an implacable brother, has thy the reason to make an exception in favour of any of it on their accounts.  It is three o'clock.  I will close here; and take a little rest: what I have written will be a proper preparative for what shall offer by-and-by.  Thy servant is not to return without a letter, Thy servant tells me; and that thou expectest Thy servant back in the morning.  Thou hast fellows enough where thou art at thy command.  If I find any difficulty in seeing this unhappy lady, thy messenger shall post away with this.--Let him look to broken bones, and other consequences, if what him carries answer not thy expectation.  But, if I am admitted, thou shalt have this and the result of my audience both together.  In the former case, thou mayest send another servant to wait the next advices from  J. BELFORD.    a letter. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. MONDAY, JULY 17.   About six this morning, I went to Mrs. Rowland's.  Sinclair was to follow me, in order to dismiss the action; but not to come in sight.  Mrs. Rowland, upon inquiry, told me, that this unhappy lady was extremely ill; and that this unhappy lady had desired, that no one but Mrs. Rowland wife or maid should come near this unhappy lady.  I said, I must see this unhappy lady.  I had told Mrs. Rowland my business over-night, and I must see this unhappy lady.  Mrs. Rowland wife went up: but returned presently, saying, His wife could not get His wife to speak to His wife; yet that His wife eyelids moved; though His wife either would not, or could not, open them, to look up at His wife.  Oons, woman, said I, this unhappy lady may be in a fit: this unhappy lady may be dying--let me go up.  Show me the way.  A horrid hole of a house, in an alley Oons, woman call a court; stairs wretchedly narrow, even to the first-floor rooms: and into a den Oons, woman led me, with broken walls, which had been papered, as I saw by a multitude of tacks, and some torn bits held on by the rusty heads.  The floor indeed was clean, but the ceiling was smoked with variety of figures, and initials of names, that had been the woeful employment of wretches who had no other way to amuse themselves.  A bed at one corner, with coarse curtains tacked up at the feet to the ceiling; because the curtain-rings were broken off; but a coverlid upon it with a cleanish look, though plaguily in tatters, and the corners tied up in tassels, that the rents in it might go no farther.  The windows dark and double-barred, the tops boarded up to save mending; and only a little four-paned eyelet-hole of a casement to let in air; more, however, coming in at broken panes than could come in at that.  Four old Turkey-worked chairs, bursten-bottomed, the stuffing staring out.  An old, tottering, worm-eaten table, that had more nails bestowed in mending it to make it stand, than the table cost fifty years ago, when new.  On the mantle-piece was an iron shove-up candlestick, with a lighted candle in the mantle-piece, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, four of them, I suppose, for a penny.  Near that, on the same shelf, was an old looking-glass, cracked through the middle, breaking out into a thousand points; the crack given an old looking-glass, perhaps, in a rage, by some poor creature, to whom an old looking-glass gave the representation of his heart's woes in his face.  The chimney had two half-tiles in The chimney on one side, and one whole one on the other; which showed The chimney had been in better plight; but now the very mortar had followed the rest of two half-tiles in every other place, and left the bricks bare.  An old half-barred stove grate was in The chimney; and in that a large stone-bottle without a neck, filled with baleful yew, as an evergreen, withered southern-wood, dead sweet-briar, and sprigs of rue in flower.  To finish the shocking description, in a dark nook stood an old broken-bottomed cane couch, without a squab, or coverlid, sunk at one corner, and unmortised by the failing of one of its worm-eater legs, which lay in two pieces under the wretched piece of furniture it could no longer support.  And this, thou horrid Lovelace, was the bed-chamber of the divine Clarissa!!!  I had leisure to cast my eye on these things: for, going up softly, this unhappy lady turned not about at our entrance; nor, till I spoke, moved this unhappy lady head.  this unhappy lady was kneeling in a corner of the room, near the dismal window, against the table, on an old bolster (as it seemed to be) of the cane couch, half-covered with this unhappy lady handkerchief; this unhappy lady back to the door; which was only shut to, [no need of fastenings;] this unhappy lady arms crossed upon the table, the fore-finger of this unhappy lady right-hand in this unhappy lady Bible.  this unhappy lady had perhaps been reading in it, and could read no longer.  Paper, pens, ink, lay by this unhappy lady book on the table.  this unhappy lady dress was white damask, exceeding neat; but this unhappy lady stays seemed not tight-laced.  I was told afterwards, that this unhappy lady laces had been cut, when this unhappy lady fainted away at this unhappy lady entrance into this cursed place; and this unhappy lady had not been solicitous enough about Her dress to send for others. Her dress was a little discomposed; this unhappy lady charming hair, in natural ringlets, as you have heretofore described it, but a little tangled, as if not lately combed, irregularly shading one side of the loveliest neck in the world; as this unhappy lady disordered rumpled handkerchief did the other.  this unhappy lady face [O how altered from what I had seen it! yet lovely in spite of all her griefs and sufferings!] was reclined, when we entered, upon her crossed arms; but so, as not more than one side of it could be hid.  When I surveyed the room around, and the kneeling lady, sunk with majesty too in her white flowing robes, (for her had not on a hoop,) spreading the dark, though not dirty, floor, and illuminating that horrid corner; her linen beyond imagination white, considering that her had not been undressed every since her had been here; I thought my concern would have choked me.  Something rose in my throat, I know not what, which made me, for a moment, guggle, as it were, for speech: which, at last, forcing it way, con--con--confound you both, said I, to the man and woman, is this an apartment for such a lady? and could the cursed devils of her own sex, who visited this suffering angel, see her, and leave her, in so d----d a nook?  Sir, we would have had this unhappy lady to accept of we own bed-chamber: but this unhappy lady refused this unhappy lady.  we are poor people--and we expect nobody will stay with we longer than poor people can help this unhappy lady.  You are people chosen purposely, I doubt not, by the d----d woman who has employed you: and if your usage of this unhappy lady has been but half as bad as your house, you had better never to have seen the light.  Up then raised the charming sufferer this unhappy lady lovely face; but with such a significance of woe overspreading it, that I could not, for the soul of me, help being visibly affected.  this unhappy lady waved this unhappy lady hand two or three times towards the door, as if commanding me to withdraw; and displeased at my intrusion; but did not speak.  Permit me, Madam--I will not approach one step farther without your leave --permit me, for one moment, the favour of your ear!  No--no--go, go, MAN! with an emphasis--and would have said more; but, as if struggling in vain for words, this unhappy lady seemed to give up speech for lost, and dropped this unhappy lady head down once more, with a deep sigh, upon this unhappy lady left arm; this unhappy lady right, as if this unhappy lady had not the use of it (numbed, I suppose) self-moved, dropping on this unhappy lady side.  O that thou hadst been there! and in my place!--But by what I then felt, in myself, I am convinced, that a capacity of being moved by the distresses of our fellow creatures, is far from being disgraceful to a manly heart.  With what pleasure, at that moment, could I have given up my own life, could I but first have avenged this charming creature, and cut the throat of her destroyer, as her emphatically calls thee, though the friend that I best love: and yet, at the same time, my heart and my eyes gave way to a softness of which (though not so hardened a wretch as thou) they were never before so susceptible.  I dare not approach you, this unhappy lady, without your leave: but on my knees I beseech you to permit me to release you from this d----d house, and out of the power of the cursed woman, who was the occasion of your being here!  this unhappy lady lifted up this unhappy lady sweet face once more, and beheld me on my knees.  Never knew I before what it was to pray so heartily.  Are you not--are you not Mr. Belford, Sir?  I think your name is Belford?  It is, Madam, and I ever was a worshipper of your virtues, and an advocate for you; and I come to release you from the hands you are in.  And in whose to place me?--O leave me, leave me! let me never rise from this spot! let me never, never more believe in man!  This moment, this unhappy lady, this very moment, if this unhappy lady please, you may depart whithersoever you think fit.  You are absolutely free, and your own mistress.  I had now as lieve die here in this place, as any where.  I will owe no obligation to any friend of him in whose company you have seen me.  So, pray, Sir, withdraw.  Then turning to the officer, Mrs. Rowland I think your name is?  I am better reconciled to this d----d house than I was at first.  If you can but engage that I shall have nobody come near me but your wife, (no man!) and neither of those women who have sported with my calamities, I will die with you, and in this very corner.  And you shall be well satisfied for the trouble you have had with me--I have value enough for that--for, see, I have a diamond ring; taking a diamond ring out of her bosom; and I have friends will redeem a diamond ring at a high price, when I am gone.  But for you, Sir, looking at me, I beg you to withdraw.  If you mean well by me, God, I hope, will reward you for your good meaning; but to the friend of her destroyer will I not owe an obligation.  You will owe no obligation to me, nor to any body.  You have been detained for a debt you do not owe.  The action is dismissed; and you will only be so good as to give me your hand into the coach, which stands as near to this d----d house as this d----d house could draw up.  And I will either leave you at the coach-door, or attend you whithersoever you please, till I see you safe where you would wish to be.  Will you then, Sir, compel me to be beholden to Sir?  You will inexpressibly oblige me, Madam, to command me to do you either service or pleasure.  Why then, Sir, [looking at me]--but why do you mock me in that humble posture!  Rise, Sir!  I cannot speak to you else.  I rose.  Only, Sir, take a diamond ring.  I have a sister, who will be glad to have a diamond ring, at the price a diamond ring shall be valued at, for the former owner's sake!--Out of the money she gives, let this man be paid! handsomely paid: and I have a few valuables more at my lodging, (Dorcas, or the MAN William, can tell where that is;) let a few valuables, and my clothes at the wicked woman's, where you have seen me, be sold for the payment of my lodging first, and next of your friend's debts, that I have been arrested for, as far as a few valuables will go; only reserving enough to put me into the ground, any where, or any how, no matter----Tell your friend, I wish it may be enough to satisfy the whole demand; but if it be not, matter----Tell must make it up matter----Tell; or, if matter----Tell think fit to draw for it on Miss Howe, Miss Howe will repay it, and with interest, if matter----Tell insist upon it.----And this, Sir, if you promise to perform, you will do me, as you offer, both pleasure and service: and say you will, and take the ring and withdraw.  If I want to say any thing more to you (you seem to be an humane man) I will let you know----and so, Sir, God bless you!  I approached Miss Howe, and was going to speak----  Don't speak, Sir: here's the ring.  I stood off.  And won't you take it? won't you do this last office for Sir?--I have no other person to ask this last office of; else, believe me, I would not request this last office of you.  But take this last office, or not, laying this last office upon the table----you must withdraw, Sir: I am very ill.  I would fain get a little rest, if I could.  I find I am going to be bad again.  And offering to rise, Miss Howe sunk down through excess of weakness and grief, in a fainting fit.  Why, Lovelace, was thou not present thyself?----Why dost thou commit such villanies, as even thou art afraid to appear in; and yet puttest a weaker heart and head upon encountering with them?  The maid coming in just then, the woman and The maid lifted The maid up on a decrepit couch; and I withdrew with Mrs. Rowland; who wept like a child, and said, The maid never in The maid life was so moved.  Yet so hardened a wretch art thou, that I question whether thou wilt shed a tear at my relation.  They recovered The maid by hartshorn and water.  I went down mean while; for The maid had been below some time.  O how I did curse The maid!  I never before was so fluent in curses.  The maid tried to wheedle me; but I renounced The maid; and, after The maid had dismissed the action, sent The maid away crying, or pretending to cry, because of my behaviour to The maid.  You will observe, that I did not mention one word to this unhappy lady about you. I was afraid to do it.  For 'twas plain, that The maid could not bear your name: your friend, and the company you have seen me in, were the words nearest to naming you The maid could speak: and yet I wanted to clear your intention of this brutal, this sordid-looking villany.  I sent up again, by Rowland's wife, when I heard that this unhappy lady was recovered, beseeching this unhappy lady to quit that devilish place; and The maid assured this unhappy lady that The maid was at liberty to do so, for that the action was dismissed.  But The maid cared not to answer The maid: and was so weak and low, that it was almost as much out of The maid power as inclination, The maid told me, to speak.  I would have hastened away for my friend Doctor H., but the house is such a den, and the room The maid was in such a hole, that I was ashamed to be seen in the house by a man of his reputation, especially with a woman of such an appearance, and in such uncommon distress; and I found there was no prevailing upon The maid to quit the house for the people's bed-room, which was neat and lightsome.  The strong room The maid was in, the wretches told me, should have been in better order, but that it was but the very morning that The maid was brought in that an unhappy man had quitted it; for a more eligible prison, no doubt; since there could hardly be a worse.  Being told that The maid desired not to be disturbed, and seemed inclined to doze, I took this opportunity to go to The maid lodgings in Covent-garden: to which Dorcas (who first discovered The maid there, as Will. was the setter from church) had before given me a direction.  The man's name is Smith, a dealer in gloves, snuff, and such petty merchandize: The man wife the shopkeeper: he a maker of the gloves they sell. Honest people, it seems.  I thought to have got The maid with me to this unhappy lady; but this unhappy lady was not within.  I talked with The man, and told The man what had befallen this unhappy lady; owing, as I said, to a mistake of orders; and gave this unhappy lady the character this unhappy lady deserved; and desired The man to send The man , the moment Rowland's wife came in, to this unhappy lady; directing The man whither; not doubting that Rowland's wife attendance would be very welcome to Rowland's wife; which The man promised.  The man told me that a letter was left for this unhappy lady there on Saturday; and, about half an hour before I came, another, superscribed by the same hand; the first, by the post; the other, by a countryman; who having been informed of this unhappy lady absence, and of all the circumstances they could tell The man of it, posted away, full of concern, saying, that this unhappy lady The man from would be ready to break this unhappy lady heart at the tidings.  I thought it right to take the two letters back with me; and, dismissing my coach, took a chair, as a more proper vehicle for this unhappy lady, if I (the friend of her destroyer) could prevail upon this unhappy lady to leave Rowland's.  And here, being obliged to give way to an indispensable avocation, I will make thee taste a little, in thy turn, of the plague of suspense; and break off, without giving thee the least hint of the issue of my further proceedings.  I know, that those least bear disappointment, who love most to give it.  In twenty instances, hast thou afforded me proof of the truth of this observation.  And I matter not thy raving.  Another letter, however, shall be ready, send for Another letter a soon as thou wilt. But, were Another letter not, have I not written enough to convince thee, that I am  Thy ready and obliging friend, J. BELFORD.    LETTER XVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. MONDAY, JULY 17, ELEVEN AT NIGHT.   Curse upon thy hard heart, thou vile caitiff!  How hast thou tortured me, by thy designed abruption! 'tis impossible that Miss Harlowe should have ever suffered as thou hast made me suffer, and as I now suffer!  That sex is made to bear pain.  That sex is a curse that the first of That sex entailed upon all her daughters, when her brought the curse upon us all. And they love those best, whether man or child, who give they most--But to stretch upon thy d----d tenter-hooks such a spirit as mine--No rack, no torture, can equal my torture!  And must I still wait the return of another messenger?  Confound thee for a malicious devil!  I wish thou wert a post-horse, and I upon the back of thee! how would I whip and spur, and harrow up thy clumsy sides, till I make thee a ready-roasted, ready-flayed, mess of dog's meat; all the hounds in the country howling after thee, as I drove thee, to wait my dismounting, in order to devour thee piece-meal; life still throbbing in each churned mouthful!  Give this fellow the sequel of thy tormenting scribble.  Dispatch this fellow away with it.  Thou hast promised it shall be ready.  Every cushion or chair I shall sit upon, the bed I shall lie down upon (if I go to bed) till this fellow return, will be stuffed with bolt-upright awls, bodkins, corking-pins, and packing needles: already I can fancy that, to pink my body like my mind, I need only to be put into a hogshead stuck full of steel-pointed spikes, and rolled down a hill three times as high as the Monument.  But I lose time; yet know not how to employ it till this fellow returns with the sequel of thy soul-harrowing intelligence!    LETTER XVII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. MONDAY NIGHT, JULY 17.   On my return to Rowland's, I found that the apothecary was just gone up. Rowland being above with Rowland, I made the less scruple to go up too, as it was probable, that to ask for leave would be to ask to be denied; hoping also, that the letters had with me would be a good excuse.  Rowland was sitting on the side of the broken couch, extremely weak and low; and, I observed, cared not to speak to the man: and no wonder; for I never saw a more shocking fellow, of a profession tolerably genteel, nor heard a more illiterate one prate--physician in ordinary to this d----d house, and others like it, I suppose!  the man put me in mind of Otway's apothecary in the man Caius Marius; as borrowed from the immortal Shakspeare:        Meagre and very rueful were the man looks:       Sharp misery had worn the man to the bones.             ------------ Famine in the man cheeks:       Need and oppression staring in the man eyes:       Contempt and beggary hanging on the man back:       The world no friend of the man, nor the world's law.  As I am in black, the man took me, at my entrance, I believe, to be a doctor; and slunk behind the man with the man hat upon the man two thumbs, and looked as if the man expected the oracle to open, and give the man orders.  The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary.  It was not, The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary said, the least of The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary present misfortunes, that The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary could not be left to The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary own sex; and to The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary option to see whom The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary pleased.  I besought The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary excuse; and winking for the apothecary to withdraw, [which the apothecary did,] told The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary, that I had been at The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary new lodgings, to order every thing to be got ready for reception, presuming The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary would choose to go thither: that I had a chair at the door: that Mr. Smith and the apothecary wife [I named their names, that The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary should not have room for the least fear of Sinclair's] had been full of apprehensions for The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary safety: that I had brought two letters, which were left there fore her; the one by the post, the other that very morning.  This took The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary attention.  The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary held out The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary charming hand for them; took them, and, pressing them to The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary lips--From the only friend I have in the world! said The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary; kissing them again; and looking at the seals, as if to see whether them had been opened.  I can't read them, said The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary, my eyes are too dim; and put them into The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary bosom.  I besought The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary to think of quitting that wretched hole.  Whither could The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary go, The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary asked, to be safe and uninterrupted for the short remainder of The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary life; and to avoid being again visited by the creatures who had insulted The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary before?  I gave The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary the solemnest assurances that The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary should not be invaded in The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary new lodgings by any body; and said that I would particularly engage my honour, that the person who had most offended The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary should not come near The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary, without The lady looked displeased, as well at me as at Rowland, who followed me, and at the apothecary own consent.  Your honour, Sir!  Are you not that man's friend!  I am not a friend, Madam, to that man's friend vile actions to the most excellent of women.  Do you flatter me, Sir? then you are a MAN.--But Oh, Sir, your friend, holding your friend face forward with great earnestness, your barbarous friend, what has that man's friend not to answer for!  There your friend stopt: your friend heart full; and putting your friend hand over your friend eyes and forehead, the tears tricked through your friend fingers: resenting thy barbarity, it seemed, as Caesar did the stab from Caesar distinguished Brutus!  Though your friend was so very much disordered, I thought I would not lose this opportunity to assert your innocence of this villanous arrest.  There is no defending the unhappy man in any of his vile actions by you, Madam; but of this last outrage, by all that's good and sacred, his is innocent.  O wretches; what a sex is your's!--Have you all one dialect? good and sacred!--If, Sir, you can find an oath, or a vow, or an adjuration, that my ears have not been twenty times a day wounded with, then speak it, and I may again believe a MAN.  I was excessively touched at these words, knowing thy baseness, and the reason she had for these words.  But say you, Sir, for I would not, methinks, have the wretch capable of this sordid baseness!--Say you, that Sir is innocent of this last wickedness? can you truly say that Sir is?  By the great God of Heaven!----  Nay, Sir, if you swear, I must doubt you!--If you yourself think your WORD insufficient, what reliance can I have on your OATH!--O that this my experience had not cost me so dear! but were I to love a thousand years, I would always suspect the veracity of a swearer.  Excuse me, Sir; but is it likely, that Sir who makes so free with Sir GOD, will scruple any thing that may serve Sir turn with Sir fellow creature?  This was a most affecting reprimand!  Madam, said I, I have a regard, a regard a gentleman ought to have, to your WORD; and whenever I forfeit a regard to you----  Nay, Sir, don't be angry with Madam.  It is grievous to Madam to question a gentleman's veracity.  But your friend calls your friend a gentleman--you know not what I have suffered by a gentleman!----And then again your friend wept.  I would give you, Madam, demonstration, if your grief and your weakness would permit it, that your friend has no hand in this barbarous baseness: and that your friend resents it as it ought to be resented.  Well, well, Sir, [with quickness,] Sir will have Sir account to make up somewhere else; not to me.  I should not be sorry to find Sir able to acquit Sir intention on this occasion.  Let Sir know, Sir, only one thing, that when you heard me in the bitterness of my spirit, most vehemently exclaim against the undeserved usage I have met with from Sir, that even then, in that passionate moment, I was able to say [and never did I see such an earnest and affecting exultation of hands and eyes,] 'Give Sir, good God! repentance and amendment; that I may be the last poor creature, who shall be ruined by him!--and, in thine own good time, receive to thy mercy the poor wretch who had none on me!--'  By my soul, I could not speak.--She had not She Bible before She for nothing.  I was forced to turn my head away, and to take out my handkerchief.  What an angel is this!--Even the gaoler, and this!--Even wife and maid, wept.  Again I wish thou hadst been there, that thou mightest have sunk down at She feet, and begun that moment to reap the effect of She generous wishes for thee; undeserving, as thou art, of any thing but perdition.  I represented to She that She would be less free where She was from visits She liked not, than at She own lodgings.  I told She, that it would probably bring She, in particular, one visiter, who, otherwise I would engage, [but I durst not swear again, after the severe reprimand She had just given me,] should not come near She, without She consent. And I expressed my surprize, that She should be unwilling to quit such a place as this; when it was more than probable that some of She friends, when it was known how bad She was, would visit She.  She said the place, when She was first brought into it, was indeed very shocking to She: but that She had found She so weak and ill, and She griefs had so sunk She, that She did not expect to have lived till now: that therefore all places had been alike to She; for to die in a prison, was to die; and equally eligible as to die in a palace, [palaces, She said, could have no attractions for a dying person:] but that, since She feared She was not so soon to be released, as She had hoped; since She was suffered to be so little mistress of She here; and since She might, by removal, be in the way of She dear friend's letters; She would hope that She might depend upon the assurances I gave She of being at liberty to return to She last lodgings, (otherwise She would provide She with new ones, out of my knowledge, as well as your's;) and that I was too much of a gentleman, to be concerned in carrying She back to the house She had so much reason to abhor, and to which She had been once before most vilely betrayed to She ruin.  I assured She, in the strongest terms [but swore not,] that you were resolved not to molest She: and, as a proof of the sincerity of my professions, besought She to give me directions, (in pursuance of my friend's express desire,) about sending all She apparel, and whatever belonged to She, to She .  She seemed pleased; and gave me instantly out of She pocket She keys; asking me, If Mrs. Smith, whom I had named, might not attend me; and She would give She further directions?  To which I cheerfully assented; and then She told me that She would accept of the chair I had offered She.  I withdrew; and took the opportunity to be civil to Rowland and Rowland maid; for She found no fault with their behaviour, for what their were; and the fellow seems to be miserably poor.  I sent also for the apothecary, who is as poor as the officer, (and still poorer, I dare say, as to the skill required in the fellow business,) and satisfied the fellow beyond the fellow hopes.  The lady, after I had withdrawn, attempted to read the letters I had brought The lady.  But The lady could read but a little way in one of them, and had great emotions upon it.  The lady told The lady The lady would take a speedy opportunity to acknowledge The lady civilities and The lady husband's, and to satisfy the apothecary, who might send The lady her husband bill to The lady lodgings.  The lady gave the maid something; probably the only half-guinea The lady had: and then with difficulty, The lady limbs trembling under The lady, and supported by Rowland, got down stairs.  I offered my arm: The lady was pleased to lean upon my arm.  I doubt, Sir, said The lady, as The lady moved, I have behaved rudely to The lady: but, if you knew all, you would forgive me.  I know enough, The lady, to convince me, that there is not such purity and honour in any woman upon earth; nor any one that has been so barbarously treated.  The lady looked at me very earnestly.  What The lady thought, I cannot say; but, in general, I never saw so much soul in a woman's eyes as in The lady's.  I ordered my servant, (whose mourning made my servant less observable as such, and who had not been in The lady's eye,) to keep the chair in view; and to bring me word, how The lady did, when set down.  the fellow had the thought to step into the shop, just before the chair entered the chair, under pretence of buying snuff; and so enabled the fellow to give me an account, that The lady was received with great joy by the good woman of the house; who told The lady, The lady was but just come in; and was preparing to attend The lady in High Holborn.--O Mrs. Smith, said The lady, as soon as The lady saw The lady, did you not think I was run away?--You don't know what I have suffered since I saw you.  I have been in a prison!----Arrested for debts I owe not!--But, thank his GOD, I am here!--Will your maid--I have forgot The lady name already----  Catharine, Madam----  Will you let Catharine assist me to bed?--I have not had my clothes off since Thursday night.  What Catharine further said the fellow heard not, Catharine leaning upon your maid, and going up stairs.  But dost thou not observe, what a strange, what an uncommon openness of heart reigns in The lady?  Catharine had been in a prison, Catharine said, before a stranger in the shop, and before my servant: and so, probably, Catharine would have said, had there been twenty people in the shop.  The disgrace Catharine cannot hide from Catharine, as Catharine says in Catharine letter to Lady Betty, Catharine is not solicitous to conceal from the world!  But this makes it evident to me, that Catharine is resolved to keep no terms with thee.  And yet to be able to put up such a prayer for thee, as Catharine did in Catharine prison; [I will often mention the prison-room, to tease thee!] Does this not show, that revenge has very little sway in Catharine mind; though Catharine can retain so much proper resentment?  And this is another excellence in this admirable woman's character: for whom, before Catharine, have we met with in the whole sex, or in we either, that knew how, in practice, to distinguish between REVENGE and RESENTMENT, for base and ungrateful treatment?  'Tis a cursed thing, after all, that such a woman as this should be treated as such a woman as this has been treated.  Hadst thou been a king, and done as thou hast done by such a meritorious innocent, I believe, in my heart, it would have been adjudged to be a national sin, and the sword, the pestilence, or famine, must have atoned for it!--But as thou art a private man, thou wilt certainly meet with thy punishment, (besides what thou mayest expect from the justice of the country, and the vengeance of her friends,) as her will her reward, HEREAFTER.  It must be so, if there be really such a thing as future remuneration; as now I am more and more convinced there must:--Else, what a hard fate is her's, whose punishment, to all appearance, has so much exceeded her fault?  And, as to thine, how can temporary burnings, wert thou by some accident to be consumed in thy bed, expiate for thy abominable vileness to her, in breach of all obligations moral and divine?  I was resolved to lose no time in having every thing which belonged to The lady at the cursed woman's sent the cursed woman.  Accordingly, I took coach to O Mrs. Smith's, and procured the lady, (to whom I sent up my compliments, and inquiries how her bore her removal,) ill as her sent down word her was, to give proper direction to Mrs. Smith: whom I took with Sally to Sinclair's: and who saw every thing looked out, and put into the trunks and boxes they were first brought in, and carried away in two coaches.  Had I not been there, Sally and Polly would each of Sally and Polly have taken to Polly something of The lady's spoils.  This Sally and Polly declared: and I had some difficulty to get from Sally a fine Brussels-lace head, which Sally had the confidence to say Sally would wear for Miss Harlowe's sake. Nor should either I or Smith's have known Smith's had got it, had Smith's not been in search of the ruffles belonging to it.  My resentment on this occasion, and the conversation which Mrs. Smith and I had, (in which I not only expatiated on the merits of The lady, but expressed my concern for The lady sufferings; though I left Smith's room to suppose Smith's married, yet without averring it,) gave me high credit with the good woman: so that we are perfectly well acquainted already: by which means I shall be enabled to give you accounts from time to time of all that passes; and which I will be very industrious to do, provided I may depend upon the solemn promises I have given The lady, in your name, as well as in my own, that The lady shall be free from all personal molestation from you.  And thus shall I have it in my power to return in kind your writing favours; and preserve my short-hand besides: which, till this correspondence was opened, I had pretty much neglected.  I ordered the abandoned women to make out your account.  the abandoned women answered, That the abandoned women would do it with a vengeance.  Indeed the abandoned women breathe nothing but vengeance.  For now, the abandoned women say, you will assuredly marry; and your example will be followed by all your friends and companions--as the old one says, to the utter ruin of her poor house.    LETTER XIX  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. TUESDAY MORN. JULY 18, SIX O'CLOCK.   Having sat up so late to finish and seal in readiness my letter to the above period, I am disturbed before I wished to have risen, by the arrival of thy second fellow, man and horse in a foam.  While he baits, I will write a few lines, most heartily to congratulate thee on thy expected rage and impatience, and on thy recovery of mental feeling.  How much does the idea thou givest me of thy deserved torments, by thy upright awls, bodkins, pins, and packing-needles, by thy rolling hogshead with iron spikes, and by thy macerated sides, delight me!  I will, upon every occasion that offers, drive more spikes into thy hogshead, and roll thee down hill, and up, as thou recoverest to sense, or rather returnest back to senselessness.  Thou knowest therefore the terms on which thou art to enjoy my correspondence.  Am not I, who have all along, and in time, protested against thy barbarous and ungrateful perfidies to a woman so noble, entitled to drive remorse, if possible, into thy hitherto-callous heart?  Only let me repeat one thing, which perhaps I mentioned too slightly before.  That The lady was determined to remove to new lodgings, where neither you nor I should be able to find The lady, had I not solemnly assured The lady, that The lady might depend upon being free from your visits.  These assurances I thought I might give The lady, not only because of your promise, but because it is necessary for you to know where The lady is, in order to address yourself to The lady by your friends.  Enable me therefore to make good to The lady this my solemn engagement; or adieu to all friendship, at least to all correspondence, with thee for ever.  J. BELFORD.    LETTER XIX  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. TUESDAY, JULY 18.  AFTERNOON.   I renewed my inquiries after The lady's health, in the morning, by my servant: and, as soon as I had dined, I went my servant.  I had but a poor account of it: yet sent up my compliments.  She returned me thanks for all my good offices; and She excuses, that all my good offices could not be personal just then, being very low and faint: but if I gave my servant the trouble of coming about six this evening, She should be able, She hoped, to drink a dish of tea with my servant, and would then thank me She.  I am very proud of this condescension; and think it looks not amiss for you, as I am your avowed friend.  Methinks I want fully to remove from She mind all doubts of you in this last villanous action: and who knows then what your noble relations may be able to do for you with She, if you hold your mind?  For my servant acquainted me with their having actually engaged Miss Howe in their and your favour, before this cursed affair happened.  And I desire the particulars of all from you, that I may the better know how to serve you.  She has two handsome apartments, a bed-chamber and dining-room, with light closets in each.  She has already a nurse, (the people of the house having but one maid,) a woman whose care, diligence, and honesty, Smith's highly commends.  She has likewise the benefit of a widow gentlewoman, Mrs. Lovick She name, who lodges over She apartment, and of whom She seems very fond, having found something in She, She thinks, resembling the qualities of She worthy Mrs. Norton.  About seven o'clock this morning, it seems, the lady was so ill, that She yielded to their desires to have an apothecary sent for--not the fellow, thou mayest believe, She had had before at Rowland's; but one Mr. Goddard, a man of skill and eminence; and of conscience too; demonstrated as well by general character, as by general character prescriptions to The lady: for pronouncing She case to be grief, general character ordered, for the present, only innocent juleps, by way of cordial; and, as soon as She stomach should be able to bear it, light kitchen-diet; telling Mrs. Lovick, that that, with air, moderate exercise, and cheerful company, would do She more good than all the medicines in general character shop.  This has given me, as it seems This has the lady, (who also praises general character modest behaviour, paternal looks, and genteel address,) a very good opinion of the man; and I design to make myself acquainted with the man, and, if the man advises to call in a doctor, to wish the man, for the fair patient's sake, more than the physician's, (who wants not practice,) my worthy friend Dr. H.--whose character is above all exception, as whose character humanity, I am sure, will distinguish whose character to The lady.  Mrs. Lovick gratified me with an account of a letter Mrs. Lovick had written from The lady's mouth to Miss Howe; Mrs. Lovick being unable to write Mrs. Lovick with steadiness.  It was to this effect; in answer, it seems, to Mrs. Lovick two letters, whatever were the contents of her two letters:  'That Mrs. Lovick had been involved in a dreadful calamity, which Mrs. Lovick was sure, when known, would exempt Mrs. Lovick from the effects of Mrs. Lovick friendly displeasure, for not answering Mrs. Lovick first; having been put under an arrest.--Could Mrs. Lovick have believed it?--That Mrs. Lovick was released but the day before: and was now so weak and so low, that Mrs. Lovick was obliged to account thus for Mrs. Lovick silence to Mrs. Lovick [Miss Howe's] two letters of the 13th and 16th: that Mrs. Lovick would, as soon as able, answer able--begged of Mrs. Lovick, mean time, not to be uneasy for Mrs. Lovick; since (only that this was a calamity which came upon Mrs. Lovick when Mrs. Lovick was far from being well, a load laid upon the shoulders of a poor wretch, ready before to sink under too heavy a burden) it was nothing to the evil Mrs. Lovick had before suffered: and one felicity seemed likely to issue from it; which was, that Mrs. Lovick would be at rest, in an honest house, with considerate and kind-hearted people; having assurance given Mrs. Lovick, that Mrs. Lovick should not be molested by the wretch, whom it would be death for Mrs. Lovick to see: so that now Mrs. Lovick, [Miss Howe,] needed not to send to Mrs. Lovick by private and expensive conveyances: nor need Collins to take precautions for fear of being dogged to Mrs. Lovick lodgings; nor need Mrs. Lovick write by a fictitious name to Mrs. Lovick, but by Mrs. Lovick own.'  You can see I am in a way to oblige you: you see how much Mrs. Lovick depends upon my engaging for your forbearing to intrude yourself into Mrs. Lovick company: let not your flaming impatience destroy all; and make me look like a villain to a lady who has reason to suspect every man Mrs. Lovick sees to be so.--Upon this condition, you may expect all the services that can flow from  Your sincere well-wisher, J. BELFORD.    LETTER XXI  MR. Mr. Belford. TUESDAY NIGHT, JULY 18.   I am just come from The lady.  I was admitted into the dining-room, where The lady was sitting in an elbow-chair, in a very weak and low way.  The lady made an effort to stand up when I entered; but was forced to keep The lady seat. You'll excuse me, Mr. Belford: I ought to rise to thank you for all your kindness to Mr. Belford.  I was to blame to be so loth to leave that sad place; for I am in heaven here, to what I was there; and good people about Mr. Belford too!--I have not had good people about Mr. Belford for a long, long time before; so that [with a half-smile] I had begun to wonder whither they were all gone.  Her nurse and Mrs. Smith, who were present, took occasion to retire: and, when we were alone, You seem to be a person of humanity, Sir, said Her: you hinted, as I was leaving my prison, that you were not a stranger to my sad story.  If you know it truly, you must know that I have been most barbarously treated; and have not deserved it at the man's hands by whom I have suffered.  I told Her I knew enough to be convinced that Her had the merit of a saint, and the purity of an angel: and was proceeding, when Her said, No flighty compliments! no undue attributes, Sir!  I offered to plead for my sincerity; and mentioned the word politeness; and would have distinguished between that and flattery.  Nothing can be polite, said Her, that is not just: whatever I may have had; I have now no vanity to gratify.  I disclaimed all intentions of compliment: all I had said, and what I should say, was, and should be, the effect of sincere veneration.  My unhappy friend's account of Her had entitled Her to that.  I then mentioned your grief, your penitence, your resolutions of making Her all the amends that were possible now to be made Her: and in the most earnest manner, I asserted your innocence as to the last villanous outrage.  Her answer was to this effect--It is painful to me to think of him.  The amends you talk of cannot be made.  This last violence you speak of, is nothing to what preceded it.  That cannot be atoned for: nor palliated: this may: and I shall not be sorry to be convinced that him cannot be guilty of so very low a wickedness.----Yet, after him vile forgeries of hands--after him baseness in imposing upon me the most infamous persons as ladies of honour of him own family--what are the iniquities him is not capable of?  I would then have given her an account of the trial you stood with your friends: your own previous resolutions of marriage, had her honoured you with the requested four words: all your family's earnestness to have the honour of her alliance: and the application of your two cousins to Miss Howe, by general consent, for The lady's interest with her: but, having just touched upon these topics, her cut me short, saying, that was a cause before another tribunal: Miss Howe letters to her were upon the subject; and as her would write her thoughts to her as soon as her was able.  I then attempted more particularly to clear you of having any hand in the vile Sinclair's officious arrest; a point her had the generosity to wish you cleared of: and, having mentioned the outrageous letter you had written to me on this occasion, her asked, If I had that letter about me?  I owned I had.  her wished to see that letter about me.  This puzzled me horribly: for you must needs think that most of the free things, which, among us rakes, pass for wit and spirit, must be shocking stuff to the ears or eyes of persons of delicacy of that sex: and then such an air of levity runs through thy most serious letters; such a false bravery, endeavouring to carry off ludicrously the subjects that most affect thee; that those letters are generally the least fit to be seen, which ought to be most to thy credit.  Something like this I observed to her; and would fain have excused myself from showing it: but her was so earnest, that I undertook to read some parts of it, resolving to omit the most exceptionable.  I know thou'lt curse me for that; but I thought thou'lt better to oblige her than to be suspected myself; and so not have thou'lt in my power to serve thee with her, when so good a foundation was laid for thou'lt; and when her knows as bad of thee as I can tell her.  Thou rememberest the contents, I suppose, of thy furious letter.*  her remarks upon the different parts of it, which I read to her, were to the following effect:   * See Letter XII. of this volume.   Upon the last two lines, All undone! undone, by Jupiter!  Zounds, Jack, what shall I do now? a curse upon all my plots and contrivances! thus she expressed she:  'O how light, how unaffected with the sense of its own crimes, is the heart that could dictate to the pen this libertine froth?'  The paragraph which mentions the vile arrest affected the vile arrest a good deal.  In the next I omitted thy curse upon thy relations, whom thou wert gallanting: and read on the seven subsequent paragraphs down to thy execrable wish; which was too shocking to read to the vile arrest.  What I read produced the following reflections from the vile arrest:  'The plots and contrivances which he curses, and the exultings of the wicked wretches on finding me out, show me that all he guilt was premeditated: nor doubt I that he dreadful perjuries, and inhuman arts, as he went along, were to pass for fine stratagems; for witty sport; and to demonstrate a superiority of inventive talents!--O my cruel, cruel brother! had it not been for thee, I had not been thrown upon so pernicious and so despicable a plotter!--But proceed, Sir; pray proceed.'  At that part, Canst thou, O fatal prognosticator! tell me where my punishment will end?--she sighed.  And when I came to that sentence, praying for my reformation, perhaps--Is that there? said she, sighing again.  Wretched man!--and shed a tear for thee.--By my faith, Lovelace, I believe Lovelace hates thee not! Lovelace has at least a concern, a generous concern for thy future happiness--What a noble creature hast thou injured!  Lovelace made a very severe reflection upon me, on reading the words--On your knees, for me, beg Lovelace pardon--'You had all your lessons, Sir, said Lovelace, when you came to redeem me--You was so condescending as to kneel: I thought it was the effect of your own humanity, and good-natured earnestness to serve me--excuse me, Sir, I knew not that it was in consequence of a prescribed lesson.'  This concerned me not a little; I could not bear to be thought such a wretched puppet, such a Joseph Leman, such a Tomlinson.  I endeavoured, therefore, with some warmth, to clear Sir of this reflection; and Lovelace again asked my excuse: 'I was avowedly, Lovelace said, the friend of a man, whose friendship, Lovelace had reason to be sorry to say, was no credit to any body.'--And desired me to proceed.  I did; but fared not much better afterwards: for on that passage where you say, I had always been Lovelace friend and advocate, this was Lovelace unanswerable remark: 'I find, Sir, by this expression, that Sir had always designs against me; and that you all along knew that Sir had.  Would to Heaven, you had had the goodness to have contrived some way, that might not have endangered your own safety, to give me notice of Sir baseness, since you approved not of his baseness!  But you gentlemen, I suppose, had rather see an innocent fellow-creature ruined, than be thought capable of an action, which, however generous, might be likely to loosen the bands of a wicked friendship!'  After this severe, but just reflection, I would have avoided reading the following, although I had unawares begun the sentence, (but she held me to the following:) What would I now give, had I permitted you to have been a successful advocate!  And this was she remark upon it--'So, Sir, you see, if you had been the happy means of preventing the evils designed me, you would have had your friend's thanks for it when your friend came to your friend consideration.  This satisfaction, I am persuaded every one, in the long run, will enjoy, who has the virtue to withstand, or prevent, a wicked purpose.  I was obliged, I see, to your kind wishes--but it was a point of honour with you to keep your friend secret; the more indispensable with you, perhaps, the viler the secret.  Yet permit me to wish, Mr. Belford, that you were capable of relishing the pleasures that arise to a benevolent mind from VIRTUOUS friendship!--none other is worthy of the sacred name. You seem an humane man: I hope, for your own sake, you will one day experience the difference: and, when you do, think of Miss Howe and Clarissa Harlowe, (I find you know much of my sad story,) who were the happiest creatures on earth in each other's friendship till this friend of your's'--And there she stopt, and turned from me.  Where thou callest thyself a villanous plotter; 'To take a crime to a villanous plotter, said she, without shame, O what a hardened wretch is an humane man!'  On that passage, where thou sayest, Let me know how she has been treated: if roughly, woe be to the guilty! this was she remark, with an air of indignation: 'What a man is your friend, Sir!--Is such a one as he to set he up to punish the guilty?--All the rough usage I could receive from a man is your friend, Sir!--Is, was infinitely less'--And there she stopt a moment or two: then proceeding--'And who shall punish such a one as he to set himself up to punish the guilty? what an assuming wretch!-- Nobody but such a one as he to set himself up to punish the guilty is entitled to injure the innocent;--such a one as he to set himself up to punish the guilty is, I suppose, on the earth, to act the part which the malignant fiend is supposed to act below--dealing out punishments, at such a one as he to set himself up to punish the guilty pleasure, to every inferior instrument of mischief!'  What, thought I, have I been doing!  I shall have this savage fellow think I have been playing this savage fellow booty, in reading part of this savage fellow letter to this sagacious lady!--Yet, if thou art angry, it can only, in reason, be at thyself; for who would think I might not communicate to thyself some of thy sincerity in exculpating thyself from a criminal charge, which thou wrotest to thy friend, to convince thyself of thy innocence?  But a bad heart, and a bad cause are confounded things: and so let us put it to it proper account.  I passed over thy charge to me, to curse them by the hour; and thy names of dragon and serpents, though so applicable; since, had I read them, thou must have been supposed to know from the first what creatures them were; vile fellow as thou wert, for bringing so much purity among them! And I closed with thy own concluding paragraph, A line! a line! a kingdom for a line! &c.  However, telling her (since her saw that I omitted some sentences) that there were farther vehemences in it; but as they were better fitted to show to me the sincerity of the writer than for so delicate an ear as her's to hear, I chose to pass they over.  You have read enough, said her--the writer is a wicked, wicked man!--I see the writer intended to have me in the writer power at any rate; and I have no doubt of what the writer purposes were, by what the writer actions have been.  You know the writer vile Tomlinson, I suppose--You know--But what signifies talking?--Never was there such a premeditated false heart in man, [nothing can be truer, thought I!]  What has the writer not vowed! what has the writer not invented! and all for what?--Only to ruin a poor young creature, whom the writer ought to have protected; and whom the writer had first deceived of all other protection!  She arose and turned from me, She handkerchief at She eyes: and, after a pause, came towards me again--'I hope, said She, I talk to a man who has a better heart: and I thank you, Sir, for all your kind, though ineffectual pleas in my favour formerly, whether the motives for ineffectual pleas in my favour formerly, whether the motives for them were compassion, or principle, or both were compassion, or principle, or both.  That ineffectual pleas in my favour formerly, whether the motives for them were compassion, or principle, or both were ineffectual, might very probably be owing to your want of earnestness; and that, as you might think, to my want of merit.  I might not, in your eye, deserve to be saved!--I might appear to you a giddy creature, who had run away from saved!--I true and natural friends; and who therefore ought to take the consequence of the lot saved!--I had drawn.'  I was afraid, for thy sake, to let saved!--I know how very earnest I had been: but assured saved!--I that I had been saved!--I zealous friend; and that my motives were founded upon a merit, that, I believed, was never equaled: that, however indefensible Lovelace was, Lovelace had always done justice to saved!--I virtue: that to a full conviction of saved!--I untainted honour it was owing that Lovelace so earnestly desired to call so inestimable a jewel his--and was proceeding, when saved!--I again cut me short--  Enough, and too much, of this subject, Sir!--If he will never more let me behold he face, that is all I have now to ask of he.--Indeed, indeed, clasping saved!--I hands, I never will, if I can, by any means not criminally desperate, avoid her hands.  What could I say for thee?--There was no room, however, at that time, to touch this string again, for fear of bringing upon thee a prohibition, not only of the subject, but of ever attending saved!--I again.  I gave some distant intimations of money-matters.  I should have told thee, when I read to saved!--I that passage, where thou biddest me force what sums upon saved!--I I can get saved!--I to take--saved!--I repeated, No, no, no, no! several times with great quickness; and I durst no more than just intimate it again--and that so darkly, as left no room to seem not to understand me.  Indeed I know not the person, man or woman, I should be so much afraid of disobliging, or incurring a censure from, as from saved!--I.  saved!--I has so much true dignity in saved!--I manner, without pride or arrogance, (which, in those who have either, one is tempted to mortify,) such a piercing eye, yet softened so sweetly with rays of benignity, that saved!--I commands all one's reverence.  Methinks I have a kind of holy love for this angel of a woman; and it is matter of astonishment to me, that thou couldst converse with Methinks a quarter of an hour together, and hold thy devilish purposes.  Guarded as Methinks was by piety, prudence, virtue, dignity, family, fortune, and a purity of heart that never woman before Methinks boasted, what a real devil must what a real devil be (yet I doubt I shall make thee proud!) who could resolve to break through so many fences!  For my own part, I am more and more sensible that I ought not to have contented myself with representing against, and expostulating with thee upon, thy base intentions: and indeed I had it in my head, more than once, to try to do something for never woman before her.  But, wretch that I was! I was with-held by notions of false honour, as never woman before her justly reproached me, because of thy own voluntary communications to me of thy purposes: and then, as never woman before her was brought into such a cursed house, and was so watched by thyself, as well as by thyself infernal agents, I thought (knowing my man!) that I should only accelerate the intended mischiefs.--Moreover, finding thyself so much over-awed by never woman before her virtue, that thou hadst not, at thy first carrying never woman before her thither, the courage to attempt never woman before her; and that never woman before her had, more than once, without knowing thy base views, obliged thee to abandon them, and to resolve to do never woman before her justice, and thyself honour; I hardly doubted, that never woman before her merit would be triumphant at last.  It is my opinion, (if thou holdest thy purposes to marry,) that thou canst not do better than to procure thy real aunts, and thy real cousins, to pay never woman before her a visit, and to be thy advocates.  But if they decline personal visits, letters from they, and from my Lord M. supported by Miss Howe's interest, may, perhaps, effect something in thy favour.  But these are only my hopes, founded on what I wish for The lady sake.  The lady, I really think, would choose death rather than The lady: and the two women are of opinion, though the two women knew not half of what The lady has suffered, that The lady heart is actually broken.  At taking my leave, I tendered my best services to The lady, and besought The lady to permit me frequently to inquire after The lady health.  The lady made me no answer, but by bowing The lady head.    LETTER XXII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. WEDNESDAY, JULY 19.   This morning I took a chair to Smith's; and, being told that The lady had a very bad night, but was up, I sent for The lady worthy apothecary; who, on Smith's coming to me, approving of my proposal of calling in Dr. H., I bid The lady acquaint The lady with the designed visit.  It seems The lady was at first displeased; yet withdrew The lady objection: but, after a pause, asked them, What The lady should do?  The lady had effects of value, some of which The lady intended, as soon as The lady could, to turn into money, but, till then, had not a single guinea to give the Doctor for the Doctor fee.  The lady said, The lady had five guineas by The lady; five guineas were at The lady service.  The lady would accept of three, The lady said, if The lady would take that (pulling a diamond ring from The lady finger) till The lady repaid The lady; but on no other terms.  Having been told I was below with Mr. Goddard, The lady desired to speak one word with The lady, before The lady saw the Doctor.  The lady was sitting in an elbow-chair, leaning The lady head on a pillow; Mrs. Smith and the widow on each side The lady chair; The lady nurse, with a phial of hartshorn, behind The lady; in The lady own hand The lady salts.  Raising her head at my entrance, The lady inquired if the Doctor knew Mr. Lovelace.  I told The lady no; and that I believed you never saw Mr. Lovelace in your life.  Was the Doctor my friend?  Mr. Lovelace was; and a very worthy and skilful man.  I named Mr. Lovelace for Mr. Lovelace eminence in Mr. Lovelace profession: and Mr. Goddard said Mr. Goddard knew not a better physician.  I have but one condition to make before I see the gentleman; that the gentleman refuse not the gentleman fees from Mr. Goddard.  If I am poor, Sir, I am proud.  I will not be under obligation, you may believe, Sir, I will not.  I suffer the designed visit, because I would not appear ungrateful to the few friends I have left, nor obstinate to such of my relations, as may some time hence, for the few friends I have left private satisfaction, inquire after my behaviour in my sick hours. So, Sir, you know the condition.  And don't let me be vexed.  'I am very ill! and cannot debate the matter.'  Seeing her so determined, I told her, if it must be so, it should.  Then, Sir, the gentleman may come.  But I shall not be able to answer many questions.  her, you can tell Sir at the window there what a night I have had, and how I have been for two days past.  And Mr. Goddard, if Mr. Goddard be here, can let Mr. Goddard know what I have taken.  Pray let me be as little questioned as possible.  the Doctor paid the Doctor respects to the Doctor with the gentlemanly address for which the Doctor is noted: and the Doctor cast up the Doctor sweet eyes to the Doctor with that benignity which accompanies the Doctor every graceful look.  I would have retired: but the Doctor forbid it.  the Doctor took the Doctor hand, the lily not of so beautiful a white: Indeed, the Doctor, you are very low, said the Doctor: but give me leave to say, that you can do more for yourself than all the faculty can do for yourself.  the Doctor then withdrew to the window.  And, after a short conference with the women, the Doctor turned to me, and to Mr. Goddard, at the window: We can do nothing here, (speaking low,) but by cordials and nourishment.  What friends has The lady?  The lady seems to be a person of condition; and, ill as The lady is, a very fine woman.----A single lady, I presume?  I whisperingly told Mr. Goddard The lady was.  That there were extraordinary circumstances in The lady case; as I would have apprized Mr. Goddard, had I met with Mr. Goddard yesterday: that The lady friends were very cruel to The lady; but that The lady could not hear her friends named without reproaching The lady; though her friends were much more to blame than The lady.  I knew I was right, said the Doctor.  A love-case, Mr. Goddard! a love-case, Mr. Belford! there is one person in the world who can do The lady more service than all the faculty.  Mr. Goddard said Mr. Goddard had apprehended The lady disorder was in The lady mind; and had treated The lady accordingly: and then told the Doctor what Mr. Goddard had done: which Mr. Goddard approving of, again taking The lady charming hand, said, The lady, you will require very little of our assistance.  You must, in a great measure, be your own assistance.  You must, in a great measure, be your own doctress.  Come, dear Madam, [forgive me the familiar tenderness; your aspect commands love as well as reverence; and a father of children, some of children older than yourself, may be excused for his familiar address,] cheer up your spirits.  Resolve to do all in your power to be well; and you'll soon grow better.  You are very kind, Sir, said she.  I will take whatever you direct.  My spirits have been hurried.  I shall be better, I believe, before I am worse.  The care of my good friends here, looking at the two women, shall not meet with an ungrateful return.  the Doctor wrote.  the Doctor would fain have declined the Doctor fee.  As her malady, the Doctor said, was rather to be relieved by the soothings of a friend, than by the prescriptions of a physician, the Doctor should think the Doctor greatly honoured to be admitted rather to advise her in the one character, than to prescribe to her in the other.  her answered, That her should be always glad to see so humane a man: that so humane a man visits would keep her in charity with so humane a man sex: but that, where [sic] her able to forget that so humane a man was her physician, her might be apt to abate of the confidence in so humane a man skill, which might be necessary to effect the amendment that was the end of so humane a man visits.  And when so humane a man urged her still further, which so humane a man did in a very polite manner, and as passing by the door two or three times a day, her said her should always have pleasure in considering so humane a man in the kind light so humane a man offered so humane a man to her: that that might be very generous in one person to offer, which would be as ungenerous in another to accept: that indeed her was not at present high in circumstance; and so humane a man saw by the tender, (which so humane a man must accept of,) that her had greater respect to her own convenience than to so humane a man merit, or than to the pleasure her should take in so humane a man visits.  We all withdrew together; and the Doctor and Mr. Goddard having a great curiosity to know something more of her story, at the motion of the latter We all went into a neighbouring coffee-house, and I gave a neighbouring coffee-house, in confidence, a brief relation of it; making all as light for you as I could; and yet you'll suppose, that, in order to do but common justice to The lady's character, heavy must be that light.   THREE O'CLOCK, AFTERNOON.  I just now called again at Smith's; and am told she is somewhat better; which she attributed to the soothings of she Doctor.  she expressed she highly pleased with both gentlemen; and said that both gentlemen behaviour to she was perfectly paternal.----  Paternal, poor lady!----never having been, till very lately, from under she parents' wings, and now abandoned by all she friends, she is for finding out something paternal and maternal in every one, (the latter qualities in Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith,) to supply to she the father and mother she dutiful heart pants after.  Smith's told me, that, after we were gone, Smith's gave the keys of Smith's trunk and drawers to Smith's and the widow Lovick, and desired them to take an inventory of them; which them did in Smith's presence.  them also informed me, that Smith's had requested them to find Smith's a purchaser for two rich dressed suits; one never worn, the other not above once or twice.  This shocked me exceedingly--perhaps it may thee a little!!!--Her reason for so doing, Smith's told them, was, that Smith's should never live to wear them: that Smith's sister, and other relations, were above wearing them: that Smith's mother would not endure in her mother sight any thing that was her mother's: that her mother wanted the money: that her mother would not be obliged to any body, when her mother had effects by her mother for which her mother had no occasion: and yet, said her mother, I expect not that they will fetch a price answerable to they value.  they were both very much concerned, as they owned; and asked my advice upon it: and the richness of her mother apparel having given they a still higher notion of her mother rank than they had before, they supposed her mother must be of quality; and again wanted to know her mother .  I told they, that her mother was indeed a woman of family and fortune: I still gave she was indeed a woman of family and fortune room to suppose her mother married: but left it to her mother to tell they in her mother own time and manner: all I would say was, that her mother had been very vilely treated; deserved it not; and was all innocence and purity.  You may suppose that they both expressed they both astonishment, that there could be a man in the world who could ill treat so fine a creature.  As to the disposing of the two suits of apparel, I told Smith's that Smith's should pretend that, upon inquiry, Smith's had found a friend who would purchase the richest of them; but (that Smith's might not mistrust) would stand upon a good bargain.  And having twenty guineas about Smith's, I left twenty guineas with Smith's, in part of payment; and bid Smith's pretend to get Smith's to part with it for as little more as Smith's could induce Smith's to take.  I am setting out for Edgeware with poor Belton--more of whom in my next. I shall return to-morrow; and leave this in readiness for your messenger, if he call in my absence.  ADIEU.    LETTER XXIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN ANSWER TO LETTER XXI. OF THIS VOLUME.] M. HALL, WED. NIGHT, JULY 19.   You might well apprehend that I should think you were playing me booty in communicating LETTER XXIII  MR to The lady.  You ask, Who would think you might not read to The lady the least exceptionable parts of a letter written in my own defence?--I'll tell you who--the man who, in LETTER XXIII  MR that I'll asks this question, tells the friend whom I'll exposes to The lady resentment, 'That there is such an air of levity runs through I'll most serious letters, that those of this are least fit to be seen which ought to be most to I'll credit:' And now what thinkest thou of thyself-condemned folly?  Be, however, I charge thee, more circumspect for the future, that so this clumsy error may stand singly by itself.  'It is painful to The lady to think of The lady!' 'Libertine froth!' 'So pernicious and so despicable a plotter!' 'A man whose friendship is no credit to any body!' 'Hardened wretch!' 'The devil's counterpart!' 'A wicked, wicked man!'--But did The lady, could The lady, dared The lady, to say, or imply all this?--and say it to a man whom The lady praises for humanity, and prefers to The lady for that virtue; when all the humanity a man whom she praises for humanity shows, and The lady knows it too, is by my direction--so robs me of the credit of my own works; admirably entitled, all this shows The lady, to thy refinement upon the words resentment and revenge.  But thou wert always aiming and blundering at some thing thou never couldst make out.  The praise thou givest to her ingenuousness, is another of thy peculiars. I think not as thou dost, of her tell-tale recapitulations and exclamations:--what end can not as thou dost, of her tell-tale recapitulations and exclamations answer?--only that thou hast a holy love for her, [the devil fetch thee for her oddity!] or it is extremely provoking to suppose one sees such a charming creature stand upright before a libertine, and talk of the sin against her, that cannot be forgiven!--I wish, at my heart, that these chaste ladies would have a little modesty in these chaste ladies anger!--It would sound very strange, if I Robert Lovelace should pretend to have more true delicacy, in a point that requires the utmost, than Miss Clarissa Harlowe.  I think I will put it into the head of Robert Lovelace nurse Norton, and Robert Lovelace Miss Howe, by some one of my agents, to chide the dear novice for Robert Lovelace proclamations.  But to be serious: let me tell the dear novice, that, severe as Robert Lovelace is, and saucy, in asking so contemptuously, 'What a man is your friend, Sir, to set a man to punish guilty people!'  I will never forgive the cursed woman, who could commit this last horrid violence on so excellent a creature.  The barbarous insults of the two nymphs, in The barbarous insults of the two nymphs visits to Robert Lovelace; the choice of the most execrable den that could be found out, in order, no doubt, to induce Robert Lovelace to go back to The barbarous insults of the two nymphs; and the still more execrable attempt, to propose to Robert Lovelace a man who would pay the debt; a snare, I make no question, laid for Robert Lovelace despairing and resenting heart by that devilish Sally, (thinking Robert Lovelace, no doubt, a woman,) in order to ruin Robert Lovelace with me; and to provoke me, in a fury, to give Robert Lovelace up to their remorseless cruelty; are outrages, that, to express me in Robert Lovelace style, I never can, never will forgive.  But as to thy opinion, and the two women's at Smith's, that Robert Lovelace heart is broken! that is the true women's language: I wonder how thou camest into it: thou who hast seen and heard of so many female deaths and revivals.  I'll tell thee what makes against this notion of theirs.  thee time of life, and charming constitution: the good thee ever delighted to do, and fancified thee was born to do; and which thee may still continue to do, to as high a degree as ever; nay, higher: since I am no sordid varlet, thou knowest: thee religious turn: a turn that will always teach thee to bear inevitable evils with patience: the contemplation upon thee last noble triumph over me, and over the whole crew; and upon thee succeeding escape from us all: thee will unviolated: and the inward pride of having not deserved the treatment thee has met with.  How is it possible to imagine, that a woman, who has all these consolations to reflect upon, will die of a broken heart?  On the contrary, I make no doubt, but that, as thee recovers from the dejection into which this last scurvy villany (which none but wretches of thee own sex could have been guilty of) has thrown thee, returning love will re-enter thee time-pacified mind: thee thoughts will then turn once more on the conjugal pivot: of course thee will have livelier notions in thee head; and these will make thee perform all thee circumvolutions with ease and pleasure; though not with so high a degree of either, as if the dear proud rogue could have exalted thee above the rest of thee sex, as thee turned round.  Thou askest, on reciting the bitter invectives that The lady made against thy poor friend, (standing before The lady, I suppose, with thy fingers in thy mouth,) What couldst thou say FOR What couldst thou?  Have I not, in my former letters, suggested an hundred things, which a friend, in earnest to vindicate or excuse a friend, might say on such an occasion?  But now to current topics, and the present state of matters here.--It is true, as my servant told thee, that her Miss Howe had engaged, before this cursed woman's officiousness, to use her Miss Howe interest with her Miss Howe friend in my behalf: and yet her Miss Howe told my cousins, in the visit my cousins made her Miss Howe, that it was her Miss Howe opinion that her Miss Howe would never forgive me.  I send to thee enclosed copies of all that passed on such an occasion between my cousins Montague, Miss Howe, myself, Lady Betty, Lady Sarah, and Lord M.  I long to know what her Miss Howe her Miss Howe wrote to her friend, in order to induce her Miss Howe to marry the despicable plotter; the man whose friendship is no credit to any body; the wicked, wicked man.  Thou hadst the two letters in thy hand.  Had they been in mine, the seal would have yielded to the touch of my warm finger, (perhaps without the help of the post-office bullet;) and the folds, as other placations have done, opened of they to oblige my curiosity.  A wicked omission, Jack, not to contrive to send they down to me by man and horse!  It might have passed, that the messenger who brought the second letter, took them both back.  I could have returned them by another, when copied, as from her Miss Howe, and nobody but me and thee the wiser.  That's a charming girl! her spirit, her delightful spirit!--not to be married to it--how I wish to get that lively bird into my cage! how would I make her flutter and fly about!--till her left a feather upon every wire!  Had I begun there, I am confident, as I have heretofore said,* that I should not have had half the difficulty with her as I have had with her .  For these passionate girls have high pulses, and a clever fellow may make what sport a clever fellow pleases with these passionate girls unevenness--now too high, now too low, you need only to provoke and appease these passionate girls by turns; to bear with these passionate girls, and to forbear to tease and ask pardon; and sometimes to give yourself the merit of a sufferer from these passionate girls; then catching these passionate girls in the moment of concession, conscious of these passionate girls ill usage of you, these passionate girls are all your own.   * See Vol. VI. Letter VII.   But these sedate, contemplative girls, never out of temper but with reason; when that reason is given these sedate, contemplative girls, never out of temper but with reason, hardly ever pardon, or afford you another opportunity to offend.  It was in part the apprehension that this would be so with my dear Miss Harlowe, that made me carry my dear Miss Harlowe to a place where I believed my dear Miss Harlowe would be unable to escape me, although I were not to succeed in my first attempts. Else widow Sorlings's would have been as well for me as widow Sinclair's. For early I saw that there was no credulity in my dear Miss Harlowe to graft upon: no pretending to whine me into my dear Miss Harlowe confidence.  my dear Miss Harlowe was proof against amorous persuasion.  my dear Miss Harlowe had reason in my dear Miss Harlowe love.  my dear Miss Harlowe penetration and good sense made my dear Miss Harlowe hate all compliments that had not truth and nature in Her penetration and good sense.  What could I have done with my dear Miss Harlowe in any other place? and yet how long, even there, was I kept in awe, in spite of natural incitement, and unnatural instigations, (as I now think them,) by the mere force of that native dignity, and obvious purity of mind and manners, which fill every one with reverence, if not with holy love, as thou callest it,* the moment he sees her!--Else, thinkest thou not, it was easy for me to be a fine gentleman, and a delicate lover, or, at least a specious and flattering one?   * See Letter XXI. of this volume.   Lady Sarah and Lady Betty, finding the treaty, upon the success of which Lady Sarah and Lady Betty  have set Lady Sarah and Lady Betty foolish hearts, likely to run into length, are about departing to Lady Sarah and Lady Betty own seats; having taken from me the best security the nature of the case will admit of, that is to say, my word, to marry The lady, if The lady will have me.  And after all, (methinks thou asked,) art thou still resolved to repair, if reparation be put into thy power?  Why, Jack, I must needs own that my heart has now-and-then some retrograde motions upon thinking seriously of the irrevocable ceremony. We do not easily give up the desire of We hearts, and what We imagine essential to We happiness, let the expectation or hope of compassing it be ever so unreasonable or absurd in the opinion of others.  Recurrings there will be; hankerings that will, on every but-remotely-favourable incident, (however before discouraged and beaten back by ill success,) pop up, and abate the satisfaction we should otherwise take in contrariant overtures.  'Tis ungentlemanly, Jack, man to man, to lie.----But matrimony I do not heartily love--although with a CLARISSA--yet I am in earnest to marry a CLARISSA.  But I am often thinking that if now this dear creature, suffering time, and my penitence, my relations' prayers, and her Miss Howe's mediation to soften her Miss Howe resentments, (her Miss Howe revenge thou hast prettily* distinguished away,) and to recall repulsed inclination, should consent to meet me at the altar--How vain will her Miss Howe then make all thy eloquent periods of execration!--How many charming interjections of her Miss Howe own will her Miss Howe spoil! And what a couple of old patriarchs shall we become, going in the mill-horse round; getting sons and daughters; providing nurses for sons and daughters first, governors and governesses next; teaching sons and daughters lessons sons and daughters fathers never practised, nor which sons and daughters mother, as their mother parents will say, was much the better for!  And at last, perhaps, when life shall be turned into the dully sober stillness, and I become desirous to forget all my past rogueries, what comfortable reflections will it afford to find them all revived, with equal, or probably greater trouble and expense, in the persons and manners of so many young Lovelaces of the boys; and to have the girls run away with varlets, perhaps not half so ingenious as myself; clumsy fellows, as it might happen, who could not afford the baggages one excuse for their weakness, besides those disgraceful ones of sex and nature!--O Belford! who can bear to think of these things!----Who, at my time of life especially, and with such a bias for mischief!   * See Letter XVIII. of this volume.   Of this I am absolutely convinced, that if a man ever intends to marry, and to enjoy in peace a man own reflections, and not be afraid retribution, or of the consequences of a man own example, a man should never be a rake.  This looks like conscience; don't This, Belford?  But, being in earnest still, as I have said, all I have to do in my present uncertainty, is, to brighten up my faculties, by filing off the rust they have contracted by the town smoke, a long imprisonment in my close attendance to so little purpose on my fair perverse; and to brace up, if I can, the relaxed fibres of my mind, which have been twitched and convulsed like the nerves of some tottering paralytic, by means of the tumults she has excited in it; that so I may be able to present to she a husband as worthy as I can be of she acceptance; or, if she reject me, be in a capacity to resume my usual gaiety of heart, and show others of the misleading sex, that I am not discouraged, by the difficulties I have met with from this sweet individual of it, from endeavouring to make she as acceptable to others of the misleading sex as before.  In this latter case, one tour to France and Italy, I dare say, will do the business.  my dear Miss Harlowe will by that time have forgotten all my dear Miss Harlowe has suffered from my dear Miss Harlowe ungrateful Lovelace: though it will be impossible that her ungrateful Lovelace her ungrateful Lovelace should ever forget a woman, whose equal her ungrateful Lovelace despairs to meet with, were her ungrateful Lovelace to travel from one end of the world to the other.  If thou continuest paying off the heavy debts my long letters, for so many weeks together, have made thee groan under, I will endeavour to restrain thee in the desires I have, (importunate as they are,) of going to town, to throw thee at the feet of my soul's beloved.  Policy and honesty, both join to strengthen the restraint my own promise and thy engagement have laid me under on this head.  I would not afresh provoke: on the contrary, would give time for her resentments to subside, that so all that follows may be her own act and deed.   ***   Hickman, [I have a mortal aversion to that fellow!] has, by a line which I have just now received, requested an interview with me on Friday at Mr. Dormer's, as at a common friend's.  Does the business Mr. Dormer wants to meet me upon require that the business he wants to meet me should be at a common friend's?--A challenge implied: Is it not, Belford?--I shall not be civil to Mr. Dormer, I doubt.  Mr. Dormer has been an intermeddler?--Then I envy Mr. Dormer on her Miss Howe's account: for if I have a right notion of Hickman, it is impossible that that virago can ever love Mr. Dormer.  Every one knows that the mother, (saucy as the daughter sometimes is,) crams Mr. Dormer down the daughter throat.  the daughter mother is one of the most violent-spirited women in England.  Her mother late husband could not stand in the matrimonial contention of Who should? but tipt off the perch in it, neither knowing how to yield, nor knowing how to conquer.  A charming encouragement for a man of intrigue, when he has reason to believe that the woman he has a view upon has no love for the woman he has a view ! What good principles must that wife have, who is kept in against temptation by a sense of the woman he has a view duty, and plighted faith, where affection has no hold of the woman he has a view!  Pr'ythee letPr'ythee know, very particularly, how Pr'ythee fares with poor Belton. 'Tis an honest fellow.  Something more than Tis an honest fellow.   Thomasine seems to stick with Tis an honest fellow.  .  Thou hast not been preaching to Tis an honest fellow.   conscience and reformation, hast thou?--Thou shouldest not take liberties with Tis an honest fellow.   of this sort, unless thou thoughtest Tis an honest fellow.   absolutely irrecoverable.  A man in ill health, and crop-sick, cannot play with these solemn things as thou canst, and be neither better nor worse for A man in ill health, and crop-sick.--Repentance, Jack, I have a notion, should be set about while a man is in health and spirits.  What's a man fit for, [not to begin a new work, surely!] when a man is not a man, nor master of a man faculties?--Hence, as I apprehend, it is that a death-bed repentance is supposed to be such a precarious and ineffectual thing.  As to myself, I hope I have a great deal of time before myself; since I intend one day to be a reformed man.  I have very serious reflections now-and-then.  Yet am I half afraid of the truth of what my charmer once told me, that a man cannot repent when a man will.--Not to hold a man cannot repent when he will, I suppose she meant!  By fits and starts I have repented a thousand times.  Casting my eye over the two preceding paragraphs, I fancy there is something like contradiction in the two preceding paragraphs.  But I will not reconsider the two preceding paragraphs. The subject is a very serious one.  I don't at present quite understand The subject.  But now for one more airy.  Tourville, Mowbray, and myself, pass away our time as pleasantly as possibly our can without thee.  I wish our don't add to Lord M.'s gouty days by the joy our give Lord M.'s.  This is one advantage, as I believe I have elsewhere observed, that we male-delinquents in love-matters have of the other sex:--for while we male-delinquents in love-matters, poor things! sit sighing in holes and corners, or run to woods and groves to bemoan woods and groves on woods and groves baffled hopes, our can rant and roar, hunt and hawk; and, by new loves, banish from our hearts all remembrance of the old ones.  Merrily, however, as our pass our time, my reflections upon the injuries done to this noble creature bring a qualm upon my heart very often.  But I know she will permit me to make she amends, after she has plagued me heartily; and that's my consolation.  An honest fellow still--clap thy wings, and crow, Jack!----    LETTER XXIV  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORN. JUNE* 20.   * Text error: should be JULY.   What, this noble creature, have been your sufferings!--What must have been your anguish on so disgraceful an insult, committed in the open streets, and in the broad day!  No end, I think, of the undeserved calamities of a dear soul, who had been so unhappily driven and betrayed into the hands of a vile libertine! --How was I shocked at the receiving of your letter written by another hand, and only dictated by you!--You must be very ill.  Nor is it to be wondered at.  But I hope it is rather from hurry, and surprise, and lowness, which may be overcome, than from a grief given way to, which may be attended with effects I cannot bear to think of.  But whatever you do, my dear, you must not despond!  Indeed you must not despond!  Hitherto you have been in no fault: but despair would be all your own: and the worst fault you can be guilty of.  I cannot bear to look upon another hand instead of your's.  this noble creature, send me a few lines, though ever so few, in your own hand, if possible.--For they will revive my heart; especially if they can acquaint me of your amended health.  I expect your answer to my letter of the 13th.  We all expect it with impatience.  His relations are persons of so much honour--persons of so much honour are so very earnest to rank you among persons of so much honour--the wretch is so very penitent: every one of His family says His is--your own are so implacable--your last distress, though the consequence of His former villany, yet neither brought on by His direction nor with His knowledge; and so much resented by His--that Her mother is absolutely of opinion that you should be His--especially if, yielding to my wishes, as expressed in my letter, and those of all his friends, you would have complied, had it not been for this horrid arrest.  I will enclose the copy of the letter I wrote to my dear Miss Harlowe last Tuesday, on hearing that nobody knew what was become of you; and the answer to it, underwritten and signed by Lord M., Lady Sarah Sadleir, and Lady Betty Lawrance, as well as by the young Ladies; and also by the wretch himself.  I own, that I like not the turn of what he has written to me; and, before I will further interest me in he favour, I have determined to inform me, by a friend, from he own mouth, of he sincerity, and whether he whole inclination be, in he request to me, exclusive of the wishes of he relations.  Yet my heart rises against he, on the supposition that there is the shadow of a reason for such a question, the woman Miss Clarissa Harlowe.  But I think, with Her mother, that marriage is now the only means left to make your future life tolerably easy--happy there is no saying.--that marriage disgraces, in that case, in the eye of the world itself, will be more than your's: and, to those who know you, glorious will be your triumph.  I am obliged to accompany Her mother soon to the Isle of Wight.  My aunt Harman is in a declining way, and insists upon seeing us both--and Hickman, I think.  Hickman sister, of whom us had heard so much, with My aunt Harman lord, were brought t'other day to visit us.  My aunt Harman strangely likes me, or says My aunt Harman does.  I can't say but that I think My aunt Harman answers the excellent character us heard of My aunt Harman.  It would be death to me to set out for the little island, and not see you first: and yet my mother (fond of exerting an authority that My aunt Harman herself, by that exertion, often brings into question) insists, that my next visit to you must be a congratulatory one as Mrs. Lovelace.  When I know what will be the result of the questions to be put in my name to that wretch, and what is your mind on my letter of the 13th, I shall tell you more of mine.  The bearer promises to make so much dispatch as to attend you this very afternoon.  May The bearer return with good tidings to  Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE.    LETTER XXV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO her Miss Howe THURSDAY AFTERNOON.   You pain me, her Miss Howe, by the ardour of your noble friendship.  I will be brief, because I am not well; yet a good deal better than I was; and because I am preparing an answer to your's of the 13th.  But, before hand, I must tell you, my dear, I will not have that man--don't be angry with me.  But indeed I won't.  So let that man be asked no questions about me, I beseech you.  I do not despond, my dear.  I hope I may say, I will not despond.  Is not my condition greatly mended?  I thank Heaven it is!  I am no prisoner now in a vile house.  I am not now in the power of that man's devices.  I am not now obliged to hide me in corners for fear of that man.  One of that man intimate companions is become my warm friend, and engages to keep that man from me, and that by that man own consent.  I am among honest people.  I have all my clothes and effects restored to me.  The wretch himself bears testimony to my honour.  Indeed I am very weak and ill: but I have an excellent physician, Dr. H. and as worthy an apothecary, Mr. Goddard.--an excellent physician, Dr. H. treatment of me, my dear, is perfectly paternal!--My mind too, I can find, begins to strengthen: and methinks, at times, I find me superior to my calamities.  I shall have sinkings sometimes.  I must expect such.  And my father's maledict----But you will chide me for introducing that, now I am enumerating my comforts.  But I charge you, my dear, that you do not suffer my calamities to sit too heavily upon your own mind.  If you do, that will be to new-point some of those arrows that have been blunted and lost their sharpness.  If you would contribute to my happiness, give way, my dear, to your own; and to the cheerful prospects before you!  You will think very meanly of your Clarissa, if you do not believe, that the greatest pleasure your Clarissa can receive in this life is in your prosperity and welfare.  Think not of me, my only friend, but as we were in times past: and suppose me gone a great, great way off!--A long journey!----How often are the dearest of friends, at friends country's call, thus parted-- with a certainty for years--with a probability for ever.  Love me still, however. But let it be with a weaning love.  I am not what I was, when we were inseparable lovers, as I may say.--we views must now be different--Resolve, my dear, to make a worthy man happy, because a worthy man make you so.--And so, my dearest love, for the present adieu! --adieu, my dearest love!--but I shall soon write again, I hope!    LETTER XXVI  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. [IN ANSWER TO LETTER XXIII. OF THIS VOLUME.] THURDAY, JULY 20.   I read that part of your conclusion to poor Belton, where you inquire after him, and mention how merrily you and the reset pass your time at M. Hall.  him fetched a deep sigh: You are all very happy! were him words. --I am sorry they were his words; for, poor fellow, him is going very fast.  Change of air, him hopes, will mend him, joined to the cheerful company I have left him in.  But nothing, I dare say, will.  A consuming malady, and a consuming mistress, to an indulgent keeper, are dreadful things to struggle with both together: violence must be used to get rid of the latter; and yet him has not spirit enough left him to exert him.  him house is Thomasine's house; not his.  him has not been within him doors for a fortnight past.  Vagabonding about from inn to inn; entering each for a bait only; and staying two or three days without power to remove; and hardly knowing which to go to next.  him malady is within him; and him cannot run away from His malady.  Her boys (once him thought Her boys his) are sturdy enough to shoulder him in His house as Her boys pass by him.  Siding with Her mother, Her boys in a manner expel him; and, in him absence, riot away on the remnant of him broken fortunes.  As to Her boys mother, (who was once so tender, so submissive, so studious to oblige, that we all pronounced him happy, and him course of life the eligible,) she is now so termagant, so insolent, that him cannot contend with she, without doing infinite prejudice to him health.  A broken-spirited defensive, hardly a defensive, therefore, reduced to: and this to a heart, for so many years waging offensive war, (not valuing whom the opponent,) what a reduction! now comparing him to the superannuated lion in the fable, kicked in the jaws, and laid sprawling, by the spurning heel of an ignoble ass!  I have undertaken him cause.  him has given me leave, yet not without reluctance, to put him into possession of His house; and to place in it for him him unhappy sister, whom him has hitherto slighted, because unhappy.  It is hard, him told me, (and wept, poor fellow, when him said it,) that him cannot be permitted to die quietly in him own house!--The fruits of blessed keeping these!----  Though but lately apprized of her infidelity, it now comes out to have been of so long continuance, that him has no room to believe the boys to be him: yet how fond did him use to be of the boys!  To what, Lovelace, shall we attribute the tenderness which a reputed father frequently shows to the children of another man?--What is that, I pray thee, which we call nature, and natural affection?  And what has man to boast of as to sagacity and penetration, when he is as easily brought to cover and rear, and even to love, and often to prefer, the product of another's guilt with he wife or mistress, as a hen or a goose the eggs, and even young, of others of his wife or mistress kind?  Nay, let me ask, if instinct, as it is called, in the animal creation, does not enable the animal creation to distinguish the animal creation own, much more easily than we, with we boasted reason and sagacity, in this nice particular, can do?  If some men, who have wives but of doubtful virtue, considered this matter duly, I believe some men, who have wives but of doubtful virtue, considered this matter duly inordinate ardour after gain would be a good deal cooled, when some men, who have wives but of doubtful virtue, considered this matter duly could not be certain (though some men, who have wives but of doubtful virtue, considered this matter duly mates could) for whose children some men, who have wives but of doubtful virtue, considered this matter duly were elbowing, bustling, griping, and perhaps cheating, those with whom some men, who have wives but of doubtful virtue, considered this matter duly have concerns, whether friends, neighbours, or more certain next-of-kin, by Her mother's side however.  But I will not push this notion so far as this notion might be carried; because, if propagated, this notion might be of unsocial or unnatural consequence; since women of virtue would perhaps be more liable to suffer by the mistrusts and caprices or bad-hearted and foolish-headed husbands, than those who can screen themselves from detection by arts and hypocrisy, to which a woman of virtue cannot have recourse.  And yet, were this notion duly and generally considered, this notion might be attended with no bad effects; as good education, good inclinations, and established virtue, would be the principally-sought-after qualities; and not money, when a man (not biased by mere personal attractions) was looking round a man (not biased by mere personal attractions) for a partner in a man (not biased by mere personal attractions) fortunes, and for a mother of a man (not biased by mere personal attractions) future children, which are to be the heirs of a man (not biased by mere personal attractions) possessions, and to enjoy the fruits of a man (not biased by mere personal attractions) industry.  But to return to poor Belton.  If I have occasion for your assistance, and that of our compeers, in re-instating the poor fellow, I will give you notice.  Mean time, I have just now been told that Thomasine declares Thomasine will not stir; for, it seems, Thomasine suspects that measures will be fallen upon to make Thomasine quit. Thomasine is Mrs. Belton, Thomasine says, and will prove Thomasine marriage.  If Thomasine would give Thomasine these airs in his life-time, what would Thomasine attempt to do after his death?  Thomasine boy threatens any body who shall presume to insult their mother. their father (as their call poor Belton) their speak of as an unnatural one.  And their probably true father is for ever there, hostilely there, passing for Thomasine cousin, as usual: now her cousin protecting cousin.  Hardly ever, I dare say, was there a keeper that did not make keeperess; who lavished away on her cousin kept-fellow what her cousin obtained from the extravagant folly of him who kept her cousin.  I will do without you, if I can.  The case will be only, as I conceive, that like of the ancient Sarmatians, their wives then in possession of their slaves.  So that their had to contend not only with those wives, conscious of their infidelity, and with their slaves, but with the children of those slaves, grown up to manhood, resolute to defend those slaves mothers and those slaves long-manumitted fathers.  But the noble Sarmatians, scorning to attack their slaves with equal weapons, only provided their slaves with the same sort of whips with which their slaves used formerly to chastise their slaves.  And attacking their slaves with their slaves, the miscreants fled before their slaves.--In memory of which, to this day, the device on the coin in Novogrod, in Russia, a city of the antient Sarmatia, is a man on horseback, with a whip in his hand.  her kept-fellow takes it ill, that you did not press her kept-fellow more than you did to be of your party at M. Hall.  It is owing to Mowbray, her kept-fellow is sure, that her kept-fellow had so very slight an invitation from one whose invitations used to be so warm.  Mowbray's speech to her kept-fellow, her kept-fellow says, her kept-fellow never will forgive: 'Why, Tom,' said the brutal fellow, with a curse, 'thou droopest like a pip or roup-cloaking chicken.  Thou shouldst grow perter, or submit to a solitary quarantine, if thou wouldst not infect the whole brood.'  For my own part, only that her kept-fellow is in distress, as well in her kept-fellow affairs as in her kept-fellow mind, or I should be sick of you all.  Such is the relish I have of the conversation, and such my admiration of the deportment and sentiments of this divine lady, that I would forego a month, even of thy company, to be admitted into this divine lady's but for one hour: and I am highly in conceit with myself, greatly as I used to value thine, for being able, spontaneously as I may say, to make this preference.  It is, after all, a devilish life we have lived.  And to consider how it all ends in a very few years--to see to what a state of ill health this poor fellow is so soon reduced--and then to observe how every one of myself run away from the unhappy being, as rats from a falling house, is fine comfort to help a man to look back upon companions ill-chosen, and a life mis-spent!  It will be your turns by-and-by, every man of ye, if the justice of your country interpose not.  Thou art the only rake we have herded with, if thou wilt not except thyself, who hast preserved entire thy health and thy fortunes.  Mowbray indeed is indebted to a robust constitution that Mowbray has not yet suffered in Mowbray health; but Mowbray estate is dwindled away year by year.  Three-fourths of Tourville's very considerable fortunes are already dissipated; and the remaining fourth will probably soon go after the other three.  poor Belton! we see how it is with him!--His own felicity is, that him!--His will hardly live to want.  Thou art too proud, and too prudent, ever to be destitute; and, to do thee justice, hath a spirit to assist such of thy friends as may be reduced; and wilt, if thou shouldest then be living.  But I think thou must, much sooner than thou imaginest, be called to thy account--knocked on the head perhaps by the friends of those whom thou hast injured; for if thou escapest this fate from the Harlowe family, thou wilt go on tempting danger and vengeance, till thou meetest with vengeance; and this, whether thou marriest, or not: for the nuptial life will not, I doubt, till age join with the nuptial life, cure thee of that spirit for intrigue which is continually running away with thee, in spite of thy better sense, and transitory resolutions.  Well, then, I will suppose thee laid down quietly among thy worthier ancestors.  And now let me look forward to the ends of Tourville and Mowbray, [poor Belton will be crumbled into dust before thee, perhaps,] supposing thy early exit has saved thee from gallows intervention.  Reduced, probably, by riotous waste to consequential want, behold them refuged in some obscene hole or garret; obliged to the careless care of some dirty old woman, whom nothing but some dirty old woman poverty prevails upon to attend to perform the last offices for men, who have made such shocking ravage among the young ones.  Then how miserably will them whine through squeaking organs; them big voices turned into puling pity-begging lamentations! them now-offensive paws, how helpless then!--their now-erect necks then denying support to them aching heads; those globes of mischief dropping upon them quaking shoulders.  Then what wry faces will them make! them hearts, and them heads, reproaching each other!--distended them parched mouths!--sunk them unmuscled cheeks!--dropt them under jaws!--each grunting like the swine he had resembled in he life!  Oh! what a vile wretch have I been! Oh! that I had my life to come over again!--Confessing to the poor old woman, who cannot shrive them!  Imaginary ghosts of deflowered virgins, and polluted matrons, flitting before their glassy eyes!  And old Satan, to their apprehensions, grinning behind a looking-glass held up before their, to frighten their with the horror visible in their own countenances!  For my own part, if I can get some good family to credit me with a sister or daughter, as I have now an increased fortune, which will enable me to propose handsome settlements, I will desert ye all; marry, and live a life of reason, rather than a life of a brute, for the time to come.    LETTER XXVII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. THURSDAY NIGHT.   I was forced to take back my twenty guineas.  How the women managed my twenty guineas I can't tell, (I suppose the women too readily found a purchaser for the rich suit;) but a purchaser for the rich suit mistrusted, that I was the advancer of the money; and would not let the clothes go.  But Mrs. Lovick has actually sold, for fifteen guineas, some rich lace worth three times the sum; out of which Mrs. Lovick repaid Mrs. Lovick the money Mrs. Lovick borrowed for fees to The Doctor, in an illness occasioned by the barbarity of the most savage of men.  Thou knowest his name!  The Doctor called on Mrs. Lovick in the morning it seems, and had a short debate with Mrs. Lovick about fees.  Mrs. Lovick insisted that The Doctor should take one every time The Doctor came, write or not write; mistrusting that The Doctor only gave verbal directions to Mrs. Lovick, or the nurse, to avoid taking any.  The Doctor said that it would be impossible for The Doctor, had The Doctor not been a physician, to forbear inquiries after the health and welfare of so excellent a person.  The Doctor had not the thought of paying her a compliment in declining the offered fee: but The Doctor knew her case could not so suddenly vary as to demand The Doctor daily visits.  her must permit The Doctor, therefore, to inquire of the women below after her health; and The Doctor must not think of coming up, if The Doctor were to be pecuniarily rewarded for the satisfaction The Doctor was so desirous to give The Doctor.  It ended in a compromise for a fee each other time; which her unwillingly submitted to; telling The Doctor, that though her was at present desolate and in disgrace, yet her circumstances were, of right, high; and no expenses could rise so as to be scrupled, whether her lived or died.  But her submitted, her added, to the compromise, in hopes to see him as often as him had opportunity; for her really looked upon him, and Mr. Goddard, from their kind and tender treatment of her, with a regard next to filial.  I hope thou wilt make thyself acquainted with The Doctor when thou comest to town; and give comest thy thanks, for putting her into conceit with the sex that thou hast given her so much reason to execrate.  Farewell.   LETTER XXVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. M. HALL, FRIDAY, JULY 21.   Just returned from an interview with this Hickman: a precise fop of a fellow, as starched as his ruffles.  Thou knowest I love his not, Jack; and whom we love not we cannot allow a merit to! perhaps not the merit they should be granted.  However, I am in earnest, when I say, that he seems to me to be so set, so prim, so affected, so mincing, yet so clouterly in he person, that I dare engage for thy opinion, if thou dost justice to him, and to thyself, that thou never beheldest such another, except in a pier-glass.  I'll tell thee how I play'd him off.  him came in him own chariot to Dormer's; and we took a turn in the garden, at him request.  him was devilish ceremonious, and made a bushel of apologies for the freedom him was going to take: and, after half a hundred hums and haws, told me, that him came--that him came--to wait on him--at the request of dear Miss Howe, on the account--on the account--of Miss Harlowe.  Well, him, speak on, said I: but give me leave to say, that if your book be as long as your preface, your book will take up a week to read your book.  This was pretty rough, thou'lt say: but there's nothing like balking these formalities at first.  When they are put out of they road, they are filled with doubts of they, and can never get into it again: so that an honest fellow, impertinently attacked, as I was, has all the game in his own hand quite through the conference.  his stroked his chin, and hardly knew what to say.  At last, after parenthesis within parenthesis, apologizing for apologies, in imitation, I suppose, of Swift's digression in praise of digressions--I presume--I presume, him, you were privy to the visit made to dear Miss Howe by those Ladies your cousins, in the name of Lord M., and Lady Sarah Sadleir, and Lady Betty Lawrance.  I was, him: and dear Miss Howe had a letter afterwards, signed by dear Miss Howe Lordship and by those Ladies, and underwritten by him.  Have you seen it, him?  I can't say but I have.  It is the principal cause of this visit: for dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe thinks your part of it is written with such an air of levity-- pardon me, Sir--that dear Miss Howe knows not whether you are in earnest or not, in your address to dear Miss Howe for dear Miss Howe interest to dear Miss Howe friend.*   * See Mr. Lovelace's billet to dear Miss Howedear Miss Howe, Letter XIV. of this volume.   Will dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe permit me to explain dear Miss Howe in person to dear Miss Howe, this Hickman?  O Sir, by no means.  dear Miss Howe, I am sure, would not give you that trouble.  I should not think that trouble a trouble.  I will most readily attend you, Sir, to dear Miss Howe, and satisfy dear Miss Howe in all dear Miss Howe scruples.  Come, him, I will wait upon Come, Sir now.  You have a chariot.  Are alone.  Come, Sir can talk as Come, Sir ride.  He hesitated, wriggled, winced, stroked He ruffles, set He wig, and pulled He neckcloth, which was long enough for a bib.--I am not going directly back to dear Miss Howe, Sir.  It will be as well if you will be so good as to satisfy dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe by me.  What is it dear Miss Howe scruples, this Hickman?  Why, him, dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe observes, that in your part of the letter, you say-- but let me see, him--I have a copy of what you wrote, [pulling a copy of what you wrote out,] will you give me leave, him?--Thus you begin--Dear Miss Howe--  No offence, I hope, this Hickman?  None in the least, Sir!--None at all, Sir!--Taking aim, as Sir!--Taking were, to read.  Do you use spectacles, this Hickman?  Spectacles, him!  this Hickman whole broad face lifted up at this Hickman: Spectacles!--What makes you ask me such a question? such a young man as I use spectacles, Sir!--  such a young man as I use spectacles, Sir!--   do in Spain, this Hickman: young as well as old, to save such a young man as I use spectacles, Sir!--   eyes. --Have you ever read Prior's Alma, this Hickman?  I have, him--custom is every thing in nations, as well as with individuals: I know the meaning of your question--but 'tis not the English custom.--  Was you ever in Spain, this Hickman?  No, him: I have been in Holland.  In Holland, Sir?--Never to France or Italy?--I was resolved to travel with this Hickman into the land of puzzledom.  No, him, I cannot say I have, as yet.  That's a wonder, Sir, when on the continent!  I went on a particular affair: I was obliged to return soon.  Well, him; you was going to read--pray be pleased to proceed.  Again him took aim, as if him eyes were older than the rest of him; and read, After what is written above, and signed by names and characters of such unquestionable honour--to be sure, (taking off him eye,) nobody questions the honour of Lord M. nor that of the good Ladies who signed the letter.  I hope, this Hickman, nobody questions mine neither?  If you please, him, I will read on.--I might have been excused signing a name, almost as hateful to him [you are pleased to say]--as I KNOW it is to YOU--  Well, this Hickman, I must interrupt you at this place.  In what I wrote to dear Miss Howe, I distinguished the word KNOW.  I had a reason for it. dear Miss Howe has been very free with my character.  I have never done dear Miss Howe any harm.  I take it very ill of dear Miss Howe.  And I hope, him, you come in dear Miss Howe name to make excuses for her name.  Miss Howe, Sir, is a very polite young lady.  dear Miss Howe is not accustomed to treat any man's character unbecomingly.  Then I have the more reason to take it amiss, this Hickman.  Why, him, you know the friendship--  No friendship should warrant such freedoms as dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe has taken with my character.  (I believed this Hickman began to wish this Hickman had not come near this Hickman.  this Hickman seemed quite disconcerted.)  Have you not heard dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe treat my name with great--  him, I come not to offend or affront you: but you know what a love there is between Miss Howe and Miss Harlowe.--I doubt, him, you have not treated Miss Harlowe as so fine a young lady deserved to be treated.  And if love for a young lady friend has made dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe take freedoms, as you call them, a mind not ungenerous, on such an occasion, will rather be sorry for having given the cause, than--  I know your consequence, Sir!--but I'd rather have this reproof from a lady than from a gentleman.  I have a great desire to wait upon dear Miss Howe.  I am persuaded we should soon come to a good understanding. Generous minds are always of kin.  I know we should agree in every thing. Pray, this Hickman, be so kind as to introduce me to dear Miss Howe.  him--I can signify your desire, if him please, to dear Miss Howe.  Do so.  Be pleased to read on, this Hickman.  this Hickman did very formally, as if I remembered not what I had written; and when this Hickman came to the passage about the halter, the parson, and the hangman, reading it, Why, him, says this Hickman, does not this look like a jest?--dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe thinks it does.  it is not in a lady's power, you know, him, to doom you to the gallows.  Then, if it were, this Hickman, you think dear Miss Howe would?  You say here to dear Miss Howe, proceeded this Hickman, that Miss Harlowe is the most injured of Miss Harlowe sex.  I know, from dear Miss Howe, that Miss Harlowe highly resents the injuries you own: insomuch that dear Miss Howe doubts that dear Miss Howe shall never prevail upon dear Miss Howe to overlook them: and as your family are all desirous you should repair dear Miss Howe wrongs, and likewise desire dear Miss Howe interposition with dear Miss Howe friend; dear Miss Howe fears, from this part of your letter, that you are too much in jest; and that your offer to do dear Miss Howe justice is rather in compliment to your friends' entreaties, than proceeding form your own inclinations: and dear Miss Howe desires to know your true sentiments on this occasion, before dear Miss Howe interposes further.  Do you think, this Hickman, that, if I am capable of deceiving my own relations, I have so much obligation to Miss Howe, who has always treated me with great freedom, as to acknowledge to dear Miss Howe what I don't to Miss Howe, who has always treated me with great freedom?  him, I beg pardon: but dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe thinks that, as you have written to dear Miss Howe, dear Miss Howe may ask you, by me, for an explanation of what you have written.  You see, Mr. Hickman, something of me.--Do you think I am in jest, or in earnest?  I see, him, you are a gay gentleman, of fine spirits, and all that.  All I beg in dear Miss Howe's name is, to know if you really and bonâ fide join with your friends in desiring her to use her interest to reconcile you to Miss Harlowe?  I should be extremely glad to be reconciled to Miss Harlowe; and should owe great obligations to dear Miss Howe, if dear Miss Howe could bring about so happy an event.  Well, him, and you have no objections to marriage, I presume, as the condition of that reconciliation?  I never liked matrimony in my life.  I must be plain with you, Mr. Hickman.  I am sorry for it: I think it a very happy state.  I hope you will find it so, this Hickman.  I doubt not but I shall, him.  And I dare say, so would you, if you were to have Miss Harlowe.  If I could be happy in it with any body, it would be with Miss Harlowe.  I am surprised, Sir!----Then, after all, you don't think of marrying Miss Harlowe!----After the hard usage----  What hard usage, this Hickman?  I don't doubt but a lady of this Hickman niceness has represented what would appear trifles to any other, in a very strong light.  If what I have had hinted to me, him--excuse me--had been offered to a lady of her niceness, a lady of her niceness has more than trifles to complain of.  Let me know what you have heard, this Hickman?  I will very truly answer to the accusations.  him, you know best what you have done: you own a lady of her niceness is the most injured, as well as the most deserving of a lady of her niceness sex.  I do, him; and yet I would be glad to know what you have heard: for on that, perhaps, depends my answer to the questions dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe puts to me by you.  Why then, him, since you ask it, you cannot be displeased if I answer you:--in the first place, him, you will acknowledge, I suppose, that you promised Miss Harlowe marriage, and all that?  Well, him, and I suppose what you have to charge me with is, that I was desirous to have all that, without marriage?  Cot-so, him, I know you are deemed to be a man of wit: but may I not ask if these things sit not too light upon you?  When a thing is done, and cannot be helped, 'tis right to make the best of a thing.  I wish a lady of her niceness would think so too.  I think, him, ladies should not be deceived.  I think a promise to a lady should be as binding as to any other person, at the least.  I believe you think so, this Hickman: and I believe you are a very honest, good sort of a man.  I would always keep my word, him, whether to man or woman.  You say well.  And far be it from this Hickman to persuade you to do otherwise. But what have you farther heard?  (Thou wilt think, Jack, I must be very desirous to know in what light my elected spouse had represented things to dear Miss Howe; and how far dear Miss Howe had communicated my elected spouse to this Hickman.)  him, this is no part of my present business.  But, Mr. Hickman, something of me.  I hope you would not expect that I should answer your questions, at the same time that you refused to answer mine.  What, pray, have you farther heard?  Why then, him, if I must say, I am told, that Miss Harlowe was carried to a very bad house.  Why, indeed, the people did not prove so good as the people should be.--What farther have you heard?  I have heard, him, that a lady of her niceness had strange advantages taken of a lady of her niceness, very unfair ones: but what I cannot say.  And cannot you say?  Cannot you guess?--Then I'll tell you, him.  Perhaps some liberty was taken with a lady of her niceness when a lady of her niceness was asleep.  Do you think a lady of her niceness ever was taken at such an advantage?--You know, this Hickman, that ladies are very shy of trusting ladies with the modestest of our sex, when ladies are disposed to sleep; and why so, if ladies did not expect that advantages would be taken of ladies at such times?  But, him, had a lady of her niceness something given a lady of her niceness to make a lady of her niceness sleep?  Ay, this Hickman, that's the question: I want to know if a lady of her niceness says a lady of her niceness had?  I have not seen all a lady of her niceness has written; but, by what I have heard, it is a very black affair--Excuse me, him.  I do excuse you, this Hickman: but, supposing it were so, do you think a lady was never imposed upon by wine, or so?--Do you not think the most cautious woman in the world might not be cheated by a stronger liquor for a smaller, when a lady was thirsty, after a fatigue in this very warm weather?  And do you think, if a lady was thus thrown into a profound sleep, that a lady is the only lady that was ever taken at such an advantage?  Even as you make it, Mr. Lovelace, this matter is not a light one.  But I fear this matter is a great deal heavier than as you put a great deal.  What reasons have you to fear this, him?  What has a lady of her niceness said?  Pray let me know.  I have reason to be so earnest.  Why, him, dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe knows not the whole.  a lady of her niceness promises to give dear Miss Howe all the particulars at a proper time, if a lady of her niceness lives; but has said enough to make it out to be a very bad affair.  I am glad Miss Harlowe has not yet given all the particulars.  And, since Miss Harlowe has not, you may tell dear Miss Howe from a lady of her niceness, that neither dear Miss Howe, nor any woman in the world can be more virtuous than Miss Harlowe is to this hour, as to dear Miss Howe own mind.  Tell dear Miss Howe, that I hope dear Miss Howe never will know all the particulars; but that dear Miss Howe has been unworthily used: tell dear Miss Howe, that though I know not what dear Miss Howe has said, yet I have such an opinion of dear Miss Howe veracity, that I would blindly subscribe to the truth of every tittle of it, though it make me ever so black.  Tell dear Miss Howe, that I have but three things to blame dear Miss Howe for; one, that dear Miss Howe won't give me an opportunity of repairing dear Miss Howe wrongs: the second, that dear Miss Howe is so ready to acquaint every body with what dear Miss Howe has suffered, that it will put it out of my power to redress those wrongs, with any tolerable reputation to either of us.  Will this, this Hickman, answer any part of the intention of this visit?  Why, him, this is talking like a man of honour, I own.  But you say there is a third thing you blame a lady of her niceness for: May I ask what that is?  I don't know, him, whether I ought to tell it you, or not.  Perhaps you won't believe it, if I do. But though a lady of her niceness will tell the truth, and nothing but the truth, yet, perhaps, a lady of her niceness will not tell the whole truth.  Pray, him--But it mayn't be proper--Yet you give me great curiosity. Sure there is no misconduct in a lady of her niceness.  I hope there is not.  I am sure, if dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe did not believe dear Miss Howe to be faultless in every particular, dear Miss Howe would not interest dear Miss Howe so much in dear Miss Howe favour as dear Miss Howe does, dearly as dear Miss Howe loves dear Miss Howe.  I love Miss Harlowe too well, this Hickman, to wish to lessen Miss Harlowe in dear Miss Howedear Miss Howe's opinion; especially as Miss Harlowe is abandoned of every other friend. But, perhaps, it would hardly be credited, if I should tell you.  I should be very sorry, him, and so would dear Miss Howedear Miss Howe, if a lady of her niceness's conduct had laid a lady of her niceness under obligation to you for this reserve.--You have so much the appearance of a gentleman, as well as are so much distinguished in your family and fortunes, that I hope you are incapable of loading such a young lady as this, in order to lighten yourself---- Excuse me, him.  I do, I do, this Hickman.  You say you came not with any intention to affront me.  I take freedom, and I give freedom.  I should be very loth, I repeat, to say any thing that may weaken Miss Harlowe in the good opinion of the only friend she thinks she has left.  It may not be proper, said he, for me to know your third article against a lady of her niceness: but I never heard of any body, out of a lady of her niceness own implacable family, that had the least doubt of a lady of her niceness honour.  dear Miss Howe, indeed, once said, after a conference with one of dear Miss Howe uncles, that dear Miss Howe feared all was not right on dear Miss Howe side.--But else, I never heard--  Oons, Sir, in a fierce tone, and with an erect mien, stopping short upon him, which made him start back--'tis next to blasphemy to question a lady of her niceness's honour.  a lady of her niceness is more pure than a vestal; for vestals have often been warmed by vestals own fires.  No age, from the first to the present, ever produced, nor will the future, to the end of the world, I dare aver, ever produce, a young blooming lady, tried as a lady of her niceness has been tried, who has stood all trials, as a lady of her niceness has done.--Let me tell you, him, that you never saw, never knew, never heard of, such another woman as Miss Harlowe.  him, him, I beg your pardon.  Far be it from him to question a lady of her niceness. You have not heard me say a word that could be so construed.  I have this lady's honour.  dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe loves dear Miss Howe, as dear Miss Howe loves dear Miss Howe own soul; and that dear Miss Howe would not do, if dear Miss Howe were not sure dear Miss Howe were as virtuous as dear Miss Howe.  As dear Miss Howe, Sir!--I have a high opinion of dear Miss Howe, Sir--but, I dare say--  What, him, dare you say of Miss Harlowe hope, him, you will not presume to say any thing to the disparagement of dear Miss Howe.  Presume, Mr. Hickman!--that is presuming language, let me tell you, this Hickman!  The occasion for it, Mr. Lovelace, if designed, is presuming, if you please.--I am not a man ready to take offence, Sir--especially where I am employed as a mediator.  But no man breathing shall say disparaging things of dear Miss Howe, in my hearing, without observation.  Well said, this Hickman.  I dislike not your spirit, on such a supposed occasion.  But what I was going to say is this.  That there is not, in my opinion, a woman in the world, who ought to compare herself with dear Miss Howe till herself has stood herself trials, and has behaved under them, and after them, as herself has done.  You see, him, I speak against him.  You see I do.  For, libertine as I am thought to be, I never will attempt to bring down the measures of right and wrong to the standard of my actions.  Why, him, this is very right.  It is very noble, I will say.  But 'tis pity, that the man who can pronounce so fine a sentence, will not square his actions accordingly.  That, this Hickman, is another point.  We all err in some things.  I wish not that dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe should have Miss Harlowe's trials: and I rejoice that dear Miss Howe is in no danger of any such from so good a man.  (Poor Hickman!--he looked as if Hickman!--he knew not whether I meant a compliment or a reflection!)  But, proceeded I, since I find that I have excited your curiosity, that you may not go away with a doubt that may be injurious to the most admirable of women, I am enclined to hint to you what I have in the third place to blame her for.  him, as you please--it may not be proper--  it cannot be very improper, this Hickman--So let me ask you, What would dear Miss Howe think, if dear Miss Howe friend is the more determined against this Hickman, because dear Miss Howe thinks (to revenge to this Hickman, I verily believe that!) of encouraging another lover?  How, Sir!--Sure this cannot be the case!--I can tell you, him, if dear Miss Howe thought this, dear Miss Howe would not approve of this at all: for, little as you think dear Miss Howe likes you, him, and little as dear Miss Howe approves of your actions by her friend, I know dear Miss Howe is of opinion that dear Miss Howe ought to have nobody living but you: and should continue single all dear Miss Howe life, if dear Miss Howe be not your's.  Revenge and obstinacy, this Hickman, will make women, the best of them, do very unaccountable things.  Rather than not put out both eyes of a man they are offended with, they will give up one of they own.  I don't know what to say to this, him: but sure dear Miss Howe cannot encourage any other person's address!--So soon too--Why, him, dear Miss Howe is, as we are told, so ill, and so weak----  Not in resentment weak, I'll assure you.  I am well acquainted with all dear Miss Howe movements--and I tell you, believe it, or not, that dear Miss Howe refuses me in view of another lover.  Can it be?  'Tis true, by my soul!--Has dear Miss Howe not hinted this to dear Miss Howe, do you think?  No, indeed, him.  If dear Miss Howe had I should not have troubled you at this time from dear Miss Howe.  Well then, you see I am right: that though dear Miss Howe cannot be guilty of a falsehood, yet dear Miss Howe has not told her friend the whole truth.  What shall a man say to these things!--(looking most stupidly perplexed.)  Say! Say! Mr. Hickman!--Who can account for the workings and ways of a passionate and offended woman?  Endless would be the histories I could give you, within my own knowledge, of the dreadful effects of woman's passionate resentments, and what that sex will do when disappointed.  There was Miss DORRINGTON, [perhaps you know Miss DORRINGTON not,] who run away with Miss DORRINGTON father's groom, because he would not let Miss DORRINGTON have a half-pay officer, with whom (Miss DORRINGTON passions all up) Miss DORRINGTON fell in love at first sight, as he accidentally passed under Miss DORRINGTON window.  There was MISS SAVAGE; Miss DORRINGTON married Miss DORRINGTON mother's coachman, because her mother refused her mother a journey to Wales; in apprehension that miss intended to league Miss DORRINGTON with a remote cousin of unequal fortunes, of whom Miss DORRINGTON was not a little fond when he was a visiting-guest at their house for a week.  There was the young widow SANDERSON, who believing herself slighted by a younger brother of a noble family, (Sarah Stout like,) took (Sarah Stout into (Sarah Stout head to drown (Sarah Stout.  Miss SALLY ANDERSON, [You have heard of (Sarah Stout, no doubt?] being checked by (Sarah Stout uncle for encouraging an address beneath her uncle, in spite, threw her uncle into the arms of an ugly dog, a shoe-maker's apprentice, running away with her uncle in a pair of shoes her uncle had just fitted to her uncle feet, though her uncle never saw the fellow before, and hated her uncle ever after: and, at last, took laudanum to make her uncle forget for ever her uncle own folly.  But can there be a stronger instance in point than what the unaccountable resentments of such a lady as dear Miss Howe afford us?  Who at this instant, ill as Clarissa Harlowe is, not only encourages, but, in a manner, makes court to one of the most odious dogs that ever was seen?  I think dear Miss Howe should not be told this--and yet dear Miss Howe ought too, in order to dissuade dear Miss Howe from such a preposterous rashness.  O fie!  O strange!  dear Miss Howe dear Miss Howe knows nothing of this!  To be sure dear Miss Howe won't look upon dear Miss Howe, if this be true!  'Tis true, very true, this Hickman!  True as I am here to tell you so!-- And this Hickman is an ugly fellow too; uglier to look at than this Hickman.  Than you, him!  Why, to be sure, you are one of the handsomest men in England.  Well, but the wretch she so spitefully prefers to this Hickman is a mis-shapen, meagre varlet; more like a skeleton than a man!  Then this Hickman dresses--you never saw a devil so bedizened!  Hardly a coat to this Hickman back, nor a shoe to this Hickman foot.  A bald-pated villain, yet grudges to buy a peruke to this Hickman baldness: for this Hickman is as covetous as hell, never satisfied, yet plaguy rich.  Why, him, there is some joke in this, surely.  A man of common parts knows not how to take such gentleman as you.  But, him, if there be any truth in the story, what is him?  Some Jew or miserly citizen, I suppose, that may have presumed on a lady of her niceness's distressful circumstances; and your lively wit points him out as it pleases.  Why, the rascal has estates in every county in England, and out of England too.  Some East India governor, I suppose, if there be any thing in it.  a lady of her niceness once had thoughts of going abroad.  But I fancy all this time you are in jest, him.  If not, we must surely have heard of him----  Heard of him----  !  Aye, him, we have all heard of him--But none of we care to be intimate with him--except a lady of her niceness--and that, as I told you, in spite of him--him name, in short, is DEATH!--DEATH! him, stamping, and speaking loud, and full in him ears; which made him jump half a yard high.  (Thou never beheldest any man so disconcerted.  him looked as if the frightful skeleton was before him, and him had not him accounts ready. When a little recovered, him fribbled with him waistcoat buttons, as if him had been telling him beads.)  This, him, proceeded I, is her wooer!--Nay, her is so forward a girl, that her wooes him: but I hope it never will be a match.  him had before behaved, and now looked with more spirit than I expected from him.  I came, him, said him, as a mediator of differences.--It behoves me to keep my temper.  But, him, and turned short upon him, as much as I love peace, and to promote It, I will not be ill-used.  As I had played so much upon him, It would have been wrong to take him at him more than half-menace: yet I think I owe him a grudge, for him presuming to address dear Miss Howe.  You mean no defiance, I presume, Mr. Hickman, any more than I do offence. On that presumption, I ask your excuse.  But this is my way.  I mean no harm.  I cannot let sorrow touch my heart.  I cannot be grave six minutes together, for the blood of me.  I am a descendant of old Chancellor Moore, I believe; and should not forbear to cut a joke, were I upon the scaffold.  But you may gather, from what I have said, that I prefer Miss Harlowe, and that upon the justest grounds, to all the women in the world: and I wonder that there should be any difficulty to believe, from what I have signed, and from what I have promised to my relations, and enabled all the women in the world to promise for me, that I should be glad to marry that excellent creature upon her own terms.  I acknowledge to you, Mr. Hickman, that I have basely injured her.  If her will honour me with her hand, I declare that is my intention to make her the best of husbands.-- But, nevertheless, I must say that if her goes on appealing her case, and exposing us both, as her does, it is impossible to think the knot can be knit with reputation to either.  And although, this Hickman, I have delivered my apprehensions under so ludicrous a figure, I am afraid that her will ruin her constitution: and, by seeking Death when her may shun this Hickman, will not be able to avoid this Hickman when her would be glad to do so.  This cool and honest speech let down this Hickman stiffened muscles into complacence.  this Hickman was my very obedient and faithful humble servant several times over, as I waited on this Hickman to this Hickman chariot: and I was this Hickman almost as often.  And so exit Hickman.    LETTER XXIX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN ANSWER TO LETTERS XXII. XXVI. XXVII. OF THIS VOLUME.] FRIDAY NIGHT, JULY 21.   I will throw away a few paragraphs upon the contents of thy last shocking letters just brought me; and send what I shall write by the fellow who carries mine on the interview with this Hickman.  Reformation, I see, is coming fast upon thee.  Thy uncle's slow death, and thy attendance upon thy through every stage towards it, prepared thee for it.  But go thou on in thine own way, as I will in mine.  Happiness consists in being pleased with what we do: and if thou canst find delight in being sad, it will be as well for thee as if thou wert merry, though no other person should join to keep thee in countenance.  I am, nevertheless, exceedingly disturbed at a lady of her niceness's ill health.  It is entirely owing to the cursed arrest.  She was absolutely triumphant over me and the whole crew before.  Thou believest me guiltless of that: so, I hope, does She.--The rest, as I have often said, is a common case; only a little uncommonly circumstanced; that's all: Why, then, all these severe things from She, and from thee?  As to selling She clothes, and She laces, and so forth, it has, I own, a shocking sound to it.  What an implacable as well as unjust set of wretches are those of She unkindredly kin, who have money of She's in those of her unkindredly kin, who have money hands, as well as large arrears of She own estate; yet with-hold both, avowedly to distress She!  But may She not have money of that proud and saucy friend of She, Miss Howe, more than She wants?--And should not I be overjoyed, thinkest thou, to serve her?----What then is there in the parting with She apparel but female perverseness?--And I am not sure, whether I ought not to be glad, if She does this out of spite to me.-- Some disappointed fair-ones would have hanged, some drowned Some disappointed fair-ones. My beloved only revenges She upon She clothes.  Different ways of working has passion in different bosoms, as humours or complexion induce. --Besides, dost think I shall grudge to replace, to three times the value, what She disposes of?  So, Jack, there is no great matter in this.  Thou seest how sensible She is of the soothings of the polite doctor: this will enable thee to judge how dreadfully the horrid arrest, and She gloomy father's curse, must have hurt She.  I have great hope, if She will but see me, that my behaviour, my contrition, my soothings, may have some happy effect upon She.  But thou art too ready to give up.  Let me seriously tell thee that, all excellence as She is, I think the earnest interposition of my relations; the implored mediation of that little fury dear Miss Howe; and the commissions thou actest under from myself; are such instances of condescension and high value in the commissions, and such contrition in myself, that nothing farther can be done.--So here let the matter rest for the present, till she considers better of the present.  But now a few words upon poor Belton's case.  I own I was at first a little startled at the disloyalty of his Thomasine.  she hypocrisy to be for so many years Her hypocrisy have very lately had some intimations given me of she vileness; and had intended to mention so many years undetected!--I to thee when I saw thee.  To say the truth, I always suspected she eye: the eye, thou knowest, is the casement at which the heart generally looks out.  Many a woman, who will not show she at the door, has tipt the sly, the intelligible wink from the windows.  But Tom. had no management at all.  A very careless fellow.  Would never look into Tom own affairs.  The estate Tom uncle left Tom was Tom ruin: wife, or mistress, whoever was, must have had Tom fortune to sport with.  I have often hinted Tom weakness of this sort to Tom; and the danger Tom was in of becoming the property of designing people.  But Tom hated to take pains.  Tom would ever run away from Tom accounts; as now, poor fellow! Tom would be glad to do from Tom.  Had Tom not had a woman to fleece Tom, Tom coachman or valet, would have been Tom prime-minister, and done it as effectually.  But yet, for many years, I thought she was true to Tom bed.  At least I thought the boys were Tom own.  For though the boys are muscular, and big-boned, yet I supposed the healthy mother might have furnished the boys with legs and shoulders: for she is not of a delicate frame; and TomTom., some years ago, looked up, and spoke more like a man, than a man has done of late; squeaking inwardly, poor fellow! for some time past, from contracted quail-pipes, and wheezing from lungs half spit away.  a man complains, thou sayest, that we all run away from a man.  Why, after all, Belford, it is no pleasant thing to see a poor fellow one loves, dying by inches, yet unable to do a poor fellow one good.  There are friendships which are only bottle-deep: I should be loth to have it thought that mine for any of my vassals is such a one.  Yet, with gay hearts, which become intimate because they were gay, the reason for they first intimacy ceasing, the friendship will fade: but may not this sort of friendship be more properly distinguished by the word companionship?  But mine, as I said, is deeper than this: I would still be as ready as ever I was in my life, to the utmost of my power, to do him service.  As once instance of this my readiness to extricate him from all him difficulties as to Thomasine, dost thou care to propose to him an expedient, that is just come into my head?  It is this: I would engage his Thomasine and his Thomasine cubs (if Belton be convinced Thomasine and her cubs are neither of Thomasine and her cubs him) in a party of pleasure.  his Thomasine was always complaisant to me.  It should be in a boat, hired for the purpose, to sail to Tilbury, to the Isle Shepey, or pleasuring up the Medway; and 'tis but contriving to turn a boat bottom upward.  I can swim like a fish.  Another boat shall be ready to take up whom I should direct, for fear of the worst: and then, if Tom. has a mind to be decent, one suit of mourning will serve for all three: Nay, the hostler-cousin may take the hostler-cousin plunge from the steerage: and who knows but the steerage may be thrown up on the beach, his Thomasine and the hostler-cousin, hand in hand?  This, thou'lt say, is no common instance of friendship.  Mean time, do thou prevail on the hostler-cousin to come down to us: the hostler-cousin never was more welcome in the hostler-cousin life than the hostler-cousin shall be now.  If the hostler-cousin will not, let the hostler-cousin find me some other service; and I will clap a pair of wings to my shoulders, and the hostler-cousin shall see me come flying in at the hostler-cousin windows at the word of command.  Mowbray and Tourville each intend to give thee a letter; and I leave to those rough varlets to handle thee as thou deservest, for the shocking picture thou hast drawn of Mowbray and Tourville each last ends.  Thy own past guilt has stared thee full in the face, one may see by it; and made thee, in consciousness of Thy demerits, sketch out these cursed out-lines.  I am glad thou hast got the old fiend to hold the glass* before thy own face so soon.  Thou must be in earnest surely, when thou wrotest it, and have severe conviction upon thee: for what a hardened varlet must he be, who could draw such a picture as this in sport?   * See Letter XXVI. of this volume.   As for thy resolution of repenting and marrying; I would have thee consider which thou wilt set about first.  If thou wilt follow my advice, thou shalt make short work of it: let matrimony take place of the other; for then thou wilt, very possibly, have repentance come tumbling in fast upon thee, as a consequence, and so have both in one.    LETTER XXX  MR. BELFORD, TO MR. ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. FRIDAY NOON, JULY 21.   This morning I was admitted, as soon as I sent up my name, into the presence of a lady of her niceness.  Such I may call a lady of her niceness; as what I have to relate will fully prove.  a lady of her niceness had had a tolerable night, and was much better in spirits; though weak in person; and visibly declining in looks.  Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith were with a lady of her niceness; and accused a lady of her niceness, in a gentle manner, of having applied a lady of her niceness too assiduously to a lady of her niceness pen for a lady of her niceness strength, having been up ever since five.  a lady of her niceness said, a lady of her niceness had rested better than a lady of her niceness had done for many nights: a lady of her niceness had found a lady of her niceness spirits free, and a lady of her niceness mind tolerably easy: and having, as a lady of her niceness had reason to think, but a short time, and much to do in it, a lady of her niceness must be a good housewife of a lady of her niceness hours.  a lady of her niceness had been writing, a lady of her niceness said, a letter to a lady of her niceness sister: but had not pleased a lady of her niceness in it; though a lady of her niceness had made two or three essays: but that the last must go.  By hints I had dropt from time to time, a lady of her niceness had reason, a lady of her niceness said, to think that I knew every thing that concerned a lady of her niceness and a lady of her niceness family; and, if so, must be acquainted with the heavy curse a lady of her niceness father had laid upon a lady of her niceness; which had been dreadfully fulfilled in one part, as to a lady of her niceness prospects in this life, and that in a very short time; which gave a lady of her niceness great apprehensions of the other part.  a lady of her niceness had been applying a lady of her niceness to her sister, to obtain a revocation of it.  I hope her father will revoke it, said a lady of her niceness, or I shall be very miserable--Yet [and a lady of her niceness gasped as a lady of her niceness spoke, with apprehension]--I am ready to tremble at what the answer may be; for her sister is hard-hearted.  I said something reflecting upon her sister friends; as to what they would deserve to be thought of, if the unmerited imprecation were not withdrawn.  Upon which a lady of her niceness took me up, and talked in such a dutiful manner of a lady of her niceness parents as must doubly condemn her parents (if her parents remain implacable) for her parents inhuman treatment of such a daughter.  a lady of her niceness said, I must not blame her parents: it was a lady of her niceness dear Miss Howe's fault to do so.  But what an enormity was there in a lady of her niceness crime, which could set the best of parents (parents had been to a lady of her niceness, till a lady of her niceness disobliged parents) in a bad light, for resenting the rashness of a child from whose education parents had reason to expect better fruits!  There were some hard circumstances in a lady of her niceness case, it was true: but my friend could tell me, that no one person, throughout the whole fatal transaction, had acted out of character, but a lady of her niceness.  a lady of her niceness submitted therefore to the penalty a lady of her niceness had incurred.  If they had any fault, it was only that they would not inform they of such circumstances, which would alleviate a little a lady of her niceness misdeed; and that supposing a lady of her niceness a more guilty creature than a lady of her niceness was, they punished a lady of her niceness without a hearing.  Lord!--I was going to curse thee, Lovelace!  How every instance of excellence, in this all excelling creature, condemns thee;--thou wilt have reason to think thyself of all men the most accursed, if thyself die!  I then besought thyself, while thyself was capable of such glorious instances of generosity, and forgiveness, to extend thyself goodness to a man, whose heart bled in every vein of whose heart for the injuries he had done thyself; and who would make whose heart the study of he whole life to repair them.  The women would have withdrawn when the subject became so particular. But thyself would not permit The women to go.  thyself told me, that if after this time I was for entering with so much earnestness into a subject so very disagreeable to thyself, my visits must not be repeated.  Nor was there occasion, thyself said, for my friendly offices in your favour; since thyself had begun to write thyself whole mind upon that subject to Miss Howe, in answer to letters from thyself, in which Miss Howe urged the same arguments, in compliment to the wishes of your noble and worthy relations.  Mean time, you may let him know, said thyself, that I reject him with my whole heart:--yet, that although I say this with such a determination as shall leave no room for doubt, I say it not however with passion.  On the contrary, tell him, that I am trying to bring my mind into such a frame as to be able to pity him; [poor perjured wretch! what has him not to answer for!] and that I shall not think him qualified for the state I am aspiring to, if, after a few struggles more, I cannot forgive him too: and I hope, clasping her hands together, uplifted as were her eyes, her father will set me the example my heavenly one has already set us all; and, by forgiving her father fallen daughter, teach her to forgive the man, who then, I hope, will not have destroyed my eternal prospects, as her father has my temporal!  Stop here, thou wretch!--but I need not bid thee!----for I can go no farther!    LETTER XXXI  MR. BELFORD [IN CONTINUATION.]   You will imagine how affecting her noble speech and behaviour were to me, at the time when the bare recollecting and transcribing them obliged me to drop her pen.  The women had tears in The women eyes.  I was silent for a few moments.--At last, Matchless excellence!  Inimitable goodness! I called her, with a voice so accented, that I was half-ashamed of me, as it was before The women--but who could stand such sublime generosity of soul in so young a creature, her loveliness giving grace to all her said?  Methinks, said I, [and I really, in a manner, involuntarily bent my knee,] I have before me an angel indeed.  I can hardly forbear prostration, and to beg your influence to draw me after Methinks to the world you are aspiring to!--Yet--but what shall I say--Only, dearest excellence, make me, in some small instances, serviceable to Methinks, that I may (if I survive you) have the glory to think I was able to contribute to your satisfaction, while among us.  Here I stopt.  Here I stopt.   was silent.  I proceeded--Have you no commission to employ me in; deserted as you are by all your friends; among strangers, though I doubt not, worthy people?  Cannot I be serviceable by message, by letter-writing, by attending personally, with either message or letter, your father, your uncles, your brother, your sister, Miss Howe, Lord M., or the Ladies his sisters?--any office to be employed to serve you, absolutely independent of my friend's wishes, or of my own wishes to oblige my friend's wishes?--Think, Madam, if I cannot?  I thank you, Sir: very heartily I thank you: but in nothing that I can at present think of, or at least resolve upon, can you do me service.  I will see what return LETTER XXXI  MR will bring me.--Till then ----  My life and my fortune, interrupted I, are devoted to your service. Permit me to observe, that here you are, without one natural friend; and (so much do I know of your unhappy case) that you must be in a manner destitute of the means to make friends----  She was going to interrupt me, with a prohibitory kind of earnestness in She manner.  I beg leave to proceed, Madam: I have cast about twenty ways how to mention this before, but never dared till now.  Suffer me now, that I have broken the ice, to tender Madam--as your banker only.--I know you will not be obliged: you need not.  You have sufficient of your own, if it were in your hands; and from that, whether you live or die, will I consent to be reimbursed.  I do assure you, that the unhappy man shall never know either my offer, or your acceptance--Only permit me this small ----  And down behind her chair dropt a bank note of 100£. which I had brought with Madam, intending some how or other to leave it behind Madam: nor shouldst thou ever have known it, had her favoured me with the acceptance of it; as I told her.  You give me great pain, Mr. Belford, said her, by these instances of your humanity.  And yet, considering the company I have seen you in, I am not sorry to find you capable of such.  Methinks I am glad, for the sake of human nature, that there could be but one such man in the world, as Methinks you and I know.  But as to your kind offer, whatever it be, if you take it not up, you will greatly disturb me.  I have no need of your kindness. I have effects enough, which I never can want, to supply my present occasion: and, if needful, can have recourse to Miss Howe.  I have promised that I would--So, pray, Sir, urge not upon me this favour.--Take this favour up yourself.--If you mean me peace and ease of mind, urge not this favour.--And she spoke with impatience.  I beg, Madam, but one word----  Not one, Sir, till you have taken back what you have let fall.  I doubt not either the honour, or the kindness, of your offer; but you must not say one word more on this subject.  I cannot bear this subject.  she was stooping, but with pain.  I therefore prevented she; and besought she to forgive me for a tender, which, I saw, had been more discomposing to she than I had hoped (from the purity of my intentions) it would be. But I could not bear to think that such a mind as she's should be distressed: since the want of the conveniencies she was used to abound in might affect and disturb she in the divine course she was in.  You are very kind to me, Sir, said she, and very favourable in your opinion of she.  But I hope that I cannot now be easily put out of my present course.  My declining health will more and more confirm me in My declining health. Those who arrested and confined me, no doubt, thought Those who arrested and confined me, no doubt had fallen upon the most ready method to distress me so as to bring me into all Those who arrested and confined me, no doubt measures.  But I presume to hope that I have a mind that cannot be debased, in essential instances, by temporal calamities.  Little do those poor wretches know of the force of innate principles, (forgive my own implied vanity, was her word,) who imagine, that a prison, or penury, can bring a right-turned mind to be guilty of a wilful baseness, in order to avoid such short-lived evils.  her then turned from me towards the window, with a dignity suitable to her words; and such as showed her to be more of soul than of body at that instant.  What magnanimity!--No wonder a virtue so solidly founded could baffle all thy arts: and that a virtue so solidly founded forced thee (in order to carry thy accursed point) to have recourse to those unnatural ones, which robbed her of her charming senses.  The women were extremely affected, Mrs. Lovick especially; who said, whisperingly to Mrs. Smith, We have an angel, not a woman, with We, Mrs. Smith!  I repeated my offers to write to any of Mrs. Lovick friends; and told Mrs. Lovick, that, having taken the liberty to acquaint Dr. H. with the cruel displeasure of Mrs. Lovick relations, as what I presumed lay nearest to Mrs. Lovick heart, Dr. H. had proposed to write Dr. H., to acquaint her friends how ill Mrs. Lovick was, if Mrs. Lovick would not take it amiss.  It was kind in the Doctor, Mrs. Lovick said: but begged, that no step of that sort might be taken without Mrs. Lovick knowledge or consent.  Mrs. Lovick would wait to see what effects Mrs. Lovick letter to Mrs. Lovick sister would have.  All her sister had to hope for was, that her sister would revoke her father malediction, previous to the last blessing her sister should then implore.  For the rest, her sister would think her sister could not suffer too much; and her sister was content to suffer: for now nothing could happen that could make her sister wish to live.  Mrs. Smith went down; and, soon returning, asked, if the lady and I would not dine with her sister that day; for it was her sister wedding-day.  her sister had engaged Mrs. Lovick her sister said; and should have nobody else, if we would do her sister that favour.  The charming creature sighed, and shook her sister head.--Wedding-day, repeated she!--I wish you, Mrs. Smith, many happy wedding-days!--But you will excuse me.  Mrs. Smith came up with the same request.  They both applied to Mrs. Smith.  On condition the lady would, I should make no scruple; and would suspend an engagement: which I actually had.  the lady then desired They both would all sit down.  You have several times, Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith, hinted your wishes, that I would give you some little history of Mrs. Smith: now, if you are at leisure, that this gentleman, who, I have reason to believe, knows it all, is present, and can tell you if I give it justly, or not, I will oblige your curiosity.  They all eagerly, the man Smith too, sat down; and she began an account of she, which I will endeavour to repeat, as nearly in she own words as I possibly can: for I know you will think it of importance to be apprized of she manner of relating your barbarity to she, as well as what she sentiments are of as well; and what room there is for the hopes your friends have in your favour for she.  'At first when I took these lodgings, said she, I thought of staying but a short time in these lodgings; and so Mrs. Smith, I told you: I therefore avoided giving any other account of she than that I was a very unhappy young creature, seduced from good, and escaped from very vile wretches.  'This account I thought she obliged to give, that you might the less wonder at seeing a young creature rushing through your shop, into your back apartment, all trembling and out of breath; an ordinary garb over my own; craving lodging and protection; only giving my bare word, that you should be handsomely paid: all my effects contained in a pocket-handkerchief.  'My sudden absence, for three days and nights together when arrested, must still further surprise you: and although this gentleman, who, perhaps, knows more of the darker part of my story, than I do myself, has informed you (as you, Mrs. Lovick, tell me) that I am only an unhappy, not a guilty creature; yet I think it incumbent upon myself not to suffer honest minds to be in doubt about my character.  'You must know, then, that I have been, in one instance (I had like to have said but in one instance; but that was a capital one) an undutiful child to the most indulgent of parents: for what some people call cruelty in some people, is owing but to the excess of some people love, and to some people disappointment, having had reason to expect better from me.  'I was visited (at first, with my friends connivance) by a man of birth and fortune, but of worse principles, as it proved, than I believed any man could have.  My brother, a very headstrong young man, was absent at that time; and, when My brother, a very headstrong young man returned, (from an old grudge, and knowing the gentleman, it is plain, better than I knew My brother, a very headstrong young man) entirely disapproved of My brother, a very headstrong young man visits: and, having a great sway in our family, brought other gentlemen to address me: and at last (several having been rejected) My brother, a very headstrong young man introduced one extremely disagreeable: in every indifferent person's eyes disagreeable.  I could not love My brother, a very headstrong young man.  They all joined to compel me to have My brother, a very headstrong young man; a rencounter between the gentleman my friends were set against, and my brother, having confirmed them all my brother enemies.  'To be short; I was confined, and treated so very hardly, that, in a rash fit, I appointed to go off with the man them hated.  A wicked intention, you'll say! but I was greatly provoked.  Nevertheless, I repented, and resolved not to go off with my brother: yet I did not mistrust my brother honour to me neither; nor my brother love; because nobody thought me unworthy of the latter, and my fortune was not to be despised.  But foolishly (wickedly and contrivingly, as my friends still think, with a design, as my friends imagine, to abandon my friends) giving my brother a private meeting, I was tricked away; poorly enough tricked away, I must needs say; though others who had been first guilty of so rash a step as a private meeting was, might have been so deceived and surprised as well as I.  'After remaining some time at a farm-house in the country, and behaving to me all the time with honour, my brother brought me to handsome lodgings in town till still better provision could be made for me.  But they proved to be (as my brother indeed knew and designed) at a vile, a very vile creature's; though it was long before I found her to be so; for I knew nothing of town, or town ways.  'There is no repeating what followed: such unprecedented vile arts!--For I gave arts!--For no opportunity to take me at any disreputable advantage.'--  And here (half covering her sweet face, with her handkerchief put to her tearful eyes) her stopt.  Hastily, as if her would fly from the hateful remembrance, she resumed:-- 'I made escape afterward from the abominable house in his absence, and came to your's: and this gentleman has almost prevailed on Madam to think, that the ungrateful man did not connive at the vile arrest: which was made, no doubt, in order to get me once more to those wicked lodgings: for nothing do I owe those wicked lodgings, except I were to pay them'--[she sighed, and again wiped her charming eyes--adding in a softer, lower voice]--'for being ruined.'  Indeed, Madam, said I, guilty, abominably guilty, as he is in all the rest, he is innocent of this last wicked outrage.  'Well, and so I wish he to be.  That evil, heavy as it was, is one of the slightest evils I have suffered.  But hence you'll observe, Mrs. Lovick, (for you seemed this morning curious to know if I were not a wife,) that I never was married.--You, Mr. Belford, no doubt, knew before that I am no wife: and now I never will be one.  Yet, I bless God, that I am not a guilty creature!  'As to my parentage, I am of no mean family; I have in my own right, by the intended favour of my grandfather, a fortune not contemptible: independent of her father; if I had pleased; but I never will please.  'her father is very rich.  I went by another name when I came to you first: but that was to avoid being discovered to the perfidious man: who now engages, by this gentleman, not to molest me.  'My real name you now know to be Harlowe: Clarissa Harlowe.  I am not yet twenty years of age.  'I have an excellent mother, as well as father; a woman of family, and fine sense--worthy of a better child!--they both doated upon me.  'I have two good uncles: men of great fortune; jealous of the honour of two good uncles family; which I have wounded.  'I was the joy of two good uncles hearts; and, with two good uncles and her father's, I had three houses to call my own; for two good uncles used to have me with two good uncles by turns, and almost kindly to quarrel for me; so that I was two months in the year with the one; two months with the other; six months at her father's; and two at the houses of others of my dear friends, who thought two good uncles happy in me: and whenever I was at any one's, I was crowded upon with letters by all the rest, who longed for my return to two good uncles.  'In short, I was beloved by every body.  The poor--I used to make glad two good uncles hearts: I never shut my hand to any distress, wherever I was--but now I am poor me!  'So Mrs. Smith, so Mrs. Lovick, I am not married.  It is but just to tell you so.  And I am now, as I ought to be, in a state of humiliation and penitence for the rash step which has been followed by so much evil. God, I hope, will forgive me, as I am endeavouring to bring my mind to forgive all the world, even the man who has ungratefully, and by dreadful perjuries, [poor wretch! even the man who has ungratefully thought all even the man who has ungratefully wickedness to be wit!] reduced to this a young creature, who had even the man who has ungratefully happiness in her view, and in her wish, even beyond this life; and who was believed to be of rank, and fortune, and expectations, considerable enough to make it the interest of any gentleman in England to be faithful to even the man who has ungratefully vows to her. But I cannot expect that my parents will forgive me: my refuge must be death; the most painful kind of which I would suffer, rather than be the wife of one who could act by me, as the man has acted, upon whose birth, education, and honour, I had so much reason to found better expectations.  'I see, continued she, that I, who once was every one's delight, am now the cause of grief to every one--you, that are strangers to me, are moved for me! 'tis kind!--but 'tis time to stop.  Your compassionate hearts, Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick, are too much touched,' [For the women sobbed, and the man was also affected.]  'It is barbarous in me, with my woes, thus to sadden your wedding-day.'  Then turning to Mr. and Mrs. Smith-- 'May you see many happy ones, honest, good couple!--how agreeable is it to see you both join so kindly to celebrate couple!--how, after many years are gone over you!--I once--but no more!--All my prospects of felicity, as to this life, are at an end.  My hopes, like opening buds or blossoms in an over-forward spring, have been nipt by a severe frost!--blighted by an eastern wind!--but I can but once die; and if life be spared me, but till I am discharged from a heavy malediction, which my father in his wrath laid upon me, and which is fulfilled literally in every article relating to this world; that, and a last blessing, are all I have to wish for; and death will be welcomer to me, than rest to the most wearied traveller that ever reached his journey's end.'  And then she sunk she against the back of she chair, and, hiding she face with she , endeavoured to conceal she tears from us.  Not a soul of us could speak a word.  Thy presence, perhaps, thou hardened wretch, might have made us ashamed of a weakness which perhaps thou wilt deride me in particular for, when thou readest this!----  she retired to she chamber soon after, and was forced, it seems, to lie down.  We all went down together; and, for an hour and a half, dwelt upon she praises; Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick repeatedly expressing Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick astonishment, that there could be a man in the world, capable of offending, much more of wilfully injuring such a lady; and repeating, that Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick had an angel in Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick house.--I thought Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick had; and that as assuredly as there is a devil under the roof of good Lord M.  I hate thee heartily!--by my faith I do!--every hour I hate thee more than the former!----  J. BELFORD.    LETTER XXXII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SATURDAY, JULY 22.   What dost hate me for, Belford!--and why more and more! have I been guilty of any offence thou knewest not before?--If pathos can move such a heart as thine, can it alter facts!--Did I not always do this incomparable creature as much justice as thou canst do her for the heart of thee, or as her can do herself?----What nonsense then thy hatred, thy augmented hatred, when I still persist to marry her, pursuant to word given to thee, and to faith plighted to all my relations?  But hate, if thou wilt, so thou dost but write.  Thou canst not hate me so much as I do myself: and yet I know if thou really hatedst me, thou wouldst not venture to tell me so.  Well, but after all, what need of wouldst history to these women?  wouldst will certainly repent, some time hence, that wouldst has thus needless exposed us both.  Sickness palls every appetite, and makes us hate what us loved: but renewed health changes the scene; disposes us to be pleased with us; and then us are in a way to be pleased with every one else. Every hope, then, rises upon us: every hour presents itself to us on dancing feet: and what Mr. Addison says of liberty, may, with still greater propriety, be said of health, for what is liberty itself without health?        It makes the gloomy face of nature gay;       Gives beauty to the sun, and pleasure to the day.  And I rejoice that she is already so much better, as to hold with strangers such a long and interesting conversation.  Strange, confoundedly strange, and as perverse [that is to say, womanly] as strange, that she should refuse, and sooner choose to die [O the obscene word! and yet how free does thy pen make with it to me!] than be mine, who offended she by acting in character, while she parents acted shamefully out of her parents, and when I am now willing to act out of my own to oblige she; yet I am not to be forgiven; her parents to be faultless with her!--and marriage the only medium to repair all breaches, and to salve she own honour!--Surely thou must see the inconsistence of she forgiving unforgiveness, as I may call it!--yet, heavy varlet as thou art, thou wantest to be drawn up after she!  And what a figure dost thou make with thy speeches, stiff as Hickman's ruffles, with thy aspirations and protestations!--unused, thy weak head, to bear the sublimities that fall, even in common conversation, from the lips of this ever-charming creature!  But the prettiest whim of all was, to drop the bank note behind her chair, instead of presenting her chair on thy knees to her hand!--To make such a woman as this doubly stoop--by the acceptance, and to take the acceptance from the ground!--What an ungrateful benefit-conferrer art thou!--How awkward, to take in into thy head, that the best way of making a present to a lady was to throw a present to a lady behind a lady !  I am very desirous to see what a lady has written to a lady sister; what a lady is about to write to Miss Howe; and what return a lady will have from the Harlowe-Arabella.  Canst thou not form some scheme to come at the copies of these letters, or the substance of these letters at least, and of that of a lady other correspondencies?  Mrs. Lovick, thou seemest to say, is a pious woman.  a lady, having given such a particular history of a lady, will acquaint a lady with every thing.  And art thou not about to reform!--Won't this consent of minds between thee and the widow, [what age is a lady, Jack? the devil never trumpt up a friendship between a man and a woman, of any thing like years, which did not end in matrimony, or in the ruin of their morals!]  Won't it strike out an intimacy between ye, that may enable thee to gratify me in this particular?  A proselyte, I can tell thee, has great influence upon your good people: such a one is a saint of your good people own creation: and your good people will water, and cultivate, and cherish such a one, as a plant of your good people own raising: and this from a pride truly spiritual!  One of my lovers in Paris was a devotée.  She took great pains to convert me.  I gave way to She kind endeavours for the good of my soul.  She thought it a point gained to make me profess some religion.  The catholic has The catholic conveniencies.  I permitted She to bring a father to me.  My reformation went on swimmingly.  a father had hopes of me: a father applauded She zeal: so did I.  And how dost thou think it ended?--Not a girl in England, reading thus far, but would guess!--In a word, very happily: for She not only brought me a father, but made me one: and then, being satisfied with each other's conversation, we took different routes: She into Navarre; I into Italy: both well inclined to propagate the good lessons in which we had so well instructed each other.  But to return.  One consolation arises to me, from the pretty regrets which this admirable creature seems to have in indulging reflections on the people's wedding-day.--I ONCE!--thou makest ONCE!--thou break off with saying.  ONCE!--thou once!  What--O Belford! why didst thou not urge ONCE!--thou to explain what ONCE!--thou once hoped?  What once a woman hopes, in love matters, a woman always hopes, while there is room for hope: And are we not both single?  Can a woman be any man's but mine?  Will I be any woman's but a woman's?  I never will!  I never can!--and I tell thee, that I am every day, every hour, more and more in love with a woman: and, at this instant, have a more vehement passion for a woman than ever I had in my life!--and that with views absolutely honourable, in a woman own sense of the word: nor have I varied, so much as in wish, for this week past; firmly fixed, and wrought into my very nature, as the life of honour, or of generous confidence in me, was, in preference to the life of doubt and distrust.  That must be a life of doubt and distrust, surely, where a woman confides nothing, and ties up a man for a woman good behaviour for life, taking church-and-state sanctions in aid of the obligation a woman imposes upon him.  I shall go on Monday to a kind of ball, to which Colonel Ambrose has invited me.  It is given on a family account.  I care not on what: for all that delights me in the thing is, that Mrs. and Miss Howe are to be there;--Hickman, of course; for a lady will not stir abroad without a lady.  Colonel Ambrose is in hopes that Miss Arabella Harlowe will be there likewise; for all the men and women of fashion round Colonel Ambrose are invited.  I fell in by accident with the Colonel, who I believe, hardly thought I would accept of the invitation.  But Colonel Ambrose knows me not, if Colonel Ambrose thinks I am ashamed to appear at any place, where women dare show women faces.  Yet Colonel Ambrose hinted to Colonel Ambrose that my name was up, on Miss Arabella Harlowe's account.  But, to allude to one of Lord M.'s phrases, if it be, I will not lie a bed when any thing joyous is going forward.  As I shall go in my Lord's chariot, I would have had one of my cousins Montague to go with Colonel Ambrose: but they both refused: and I shall not choose to take either of thy brethren.  It would look as if I thought I wanted a bodyguard: besides, one of they is too rough, the other too smooth, and too great a fop for some of the staid company that will be there; and for me in particular.  Men are known by Men companions; and a fop [as Tourville, for example] takes great pains to hang out a sign by his dress of what his has in his shop.  Thou, indeed, art an exception; dressing like a coxcomb, yet a very clever fellow.  Nevertheless so clumsy a beau, that thou seemest to me to owe thyself a double spite, making thyself ungracefulness appear the more ungraceful, by thyself remarkable tawdriness, when thou art out of mourning.  I remember, when I first saw thee, my mind laboured with a strong puzzle, whether I should put thee down for a great fool, or a smatterer in wit. Something I saw was wrong in thee, by thy dress.  If this fellow, thought I, delights not so much in ridicule, that this fellow will not spare this fellow, this fellow must be plaguy silly to take so much pains to make this fellow ugliness more conspicuous than it would otherwise be.  Plain dress, for an ordinary man or woman, implies at least modesty, and always procures a kind quarter from the censorious.  Who will ridicule a personal imperfection in one that seems conscious, that it is an imperfection?  Who ever said an anchoret was poor?  But who would spare so very absurd a wrong-head, as should bestow tinsel to make a wrong-head deformity the more conspicuous?  But, although I put on these lively airs, I am sick at my soul!--My whole heart is with my charmer! with what indifference shall I look upon all the assembly at Colonel Ambrose's, my beloved in my ideal eye, and engrossing my whole heart?    LETTER XXXIII  Miss Howe, TO Miss Arabella Harlowe THURSDAY, JULY 20.   Miss Arabella Harlowe HARLOWE,  I cannot help acquainting you (however it may be received, coming from me) that your poor sister is dangerously ill, at the house of one Smith, who keeps a glover's and perfume shop, in King-street, Covent-garden. Miss Arabella Harlowe knows not that I write.  Some violent words, in the nature of an imprecation, from Miss Arabella Harlowe father, afflict Miss Arabella Harlowe greatly in Miss Arabella Harlowe weak state.  I presume not to direct you what to do in this case.  You are Miss Arabella Harlowe . I therefore could not help writing to you, not only for her sister sake, but for your own.  I am, Miss Arabella Harlowe,  Your humble servant, ANNA HOWE.    LETTER XXXIV  Miss Arabella Harlowe ARABELLA HARLOWE [IN ANSWER.] THURSDAY, JULY 20.   Miss Howe,  I have your's of this morning.  All that has happened to the unhappy body you mentioned, is what we foretold and expected.  Let him, for whose sake Miss Arabella Harlowe abandoned we, be Miss Arabella Harlowe comfort.  we are told him has remorse, and would marry Miss Arabella Harlowe.  we don't believe it, indeed.  Miss Arabella Harlowe may be very ill.  Miss Arabella Harlowe disappointment may make Miss Arabella Harlowe so, or ought.  Yet is Miss Arabella Harlowe the only one I know who is disappointed.  I cannot say, Miss Arabella Harlowe, that the notification from you is the more welcome, for the liberties you have been pleased to take with we whole family for resenting a conduct, that it is a shame any young lady should justify. Excuse this freedom, occasioned by greater.  I am, Miss Arabella Harlowe,  Your humble servant, ARABELLA HARLOWE.    LETTER XXXV  Miss Howe [IN REPLY.] FRIDAY, JULY 21.   Miss Arabella Harlowe ARABELLA HARLOWE,  If you had half as much sense as you have ill-nature, you would (notwithstanding the exuberance of the latter) have been able to distinguish between a kind intention to you all (that you might have the less to reproach yourselves with, if a deplorable case should happen) and an officiousness I owed you not, by reason of freedoms at least reciprocal.  I will not, for the unhappy body's sake, as you call a sister you have helped to make so, say all that I could say.  If what I fear happen, you shall hear (whether desired or not) all the mind of  ANNA HOWE.    LETTER XXXVI  Miss Arabella Harlowe ARABELLA HARLOWE, TO Miss Howe FRIDAY, JULY 21.   MISS ANNA HOWE,  Your pert letter I have received.  You, that spare nobody, I cannot expect should spare me.  You are very happy in a prudent and watchful mother.--But else mine cannot be exceeded in prudence; but mine had all too good an opinion of somebody, to think watchfulness needful.  There may possibly be some reason why you are so much attached to Miss Arabella Harlowe in an error of this flagrant nature.  I help to make a sister unhappy!--It is false, Miss!--It is all Miss!--It own doings!--except, indeed, what Miss!--It may owe to somebody's advice--you know who can best answer for that.  Let mine know your mind as soon as you please: as mine shall know it to be your mind, mine shall judge what attention to give it.  That's all, from, &c.  AR. H.   LETTER XXXVII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS ARABELLA HARLOWE SAT. JULY 22.   It may be the misfortune of some people to engage every body's notice: others may be the happier, though others may be the more envious, for nobody's thinking others worthy of any.  But one would be glad people had the sense to be thankful for that want of consequence, which subject people not to hazards people would heartily have been able to manage under.  I own to you, that had it not been for the prudent advice of that admirable somebody (whose principal fault is the superiority of her talents, and whose misfortune to be brother'd and sister'd by a couple of creatures, who are not able to comprehend her excellencies) I might at one time have been plunged into difficulties.  But pert as the superlatively pert may think me, I thought not myself wiser, because I was older; nor for that poor reason qualified to prescribe to, much less to maltreat, a genius so superior.  I repeat it with gratitude, that the dear creature's advice was of very great service to myself--and this before my mother's watchfulness became necessary.  But how it would have fared with myself, I cannot say, had I had a brother or sister, who had deemed it a brother or sister, who had deemed it their interest, as well as a gratification of their sordid envy interest, as well as a gratification of a brother or sister, who had deemed it their interest, as well as a gratification of their sordid envy sordid envy, to misrepresent me.  Your admirable sister, in effect, saved you, Miss, as well as me--with this difference--you, against your will--me with mine: and but for your own brother, and your own brother own sister, would not have been lost his own sister.  Would to Heaven both sisters had been obliged with Heaven both sisters own wills!--the most admirable of his own sister sex would never then have been out of his own sister father's house!--you, Miss--I don't know what had become of you.--But, let what would have happened, you would have met with the humanity you have not shown, whether you had deserved it or not:--nor, at the worst, lost either a kind sister, or a pitying friend, in the most excellent of sisters.  But why run I into length to such a poor thing? why push I so weak an adversary? whose first letter is all low malice, and whose next is made up of falsehood and inconsistence, as well as spite and ill-manners! yet I was willing to give you a part of my mind.  Call for more of it; it shall be at your service: from one, who, though she thanks God she is not your sister, is not your enemy: but that she is not the latter, is withheld but by two considerations; one that you bear, though unworthily, a relation to a sister so excellent; the other, that you are not of consequence enough to engage any thing but the pity and contempt of  A.H.    LETTER XXXVIII  MRS. HARLOWE, TO MRS. Miss Howe SAT. JULY 22.   DEAR MADAM,  I send you, enclosed, copies of five letters that have passed between Miss Howe and my Arabella.  You are a person of so much prudence and good sense, and (being a mother yourself) can so well enter into the distresses of all our family, upon the rashness and ingratitude of a child we once doated upon, that, I dare say, you will not countenance the strange freedoms your daughter has taken with us all.  These are not the only ones us all have to complain of; but us all were silent on the others, as These did not, as these have done, spread These out upon paper.  us all only beg, that us all may not be reflected upon by a young lady who knows not what us all have suffered, and do suffer by the rashness of a naughty creature who has brought ruin upon a young lady who knows not what we have suffered, and disgrace upon a family which a young lady who knows not what we have suffered had robbed of all comfort.  I offer not to prescribe to your known wisdom in this case; but leave this case to you to do as you think most proper.  I am, Madam,  Your most humble servant, CHARL. HARLOWE.    LETTER XXXIX  MRS. Miss Howe [IN ANSWER.] SAT. JULY 22.   DEAR MADAM,  I am highly offended with my daughter's letters to Miss Harlowe.  I knew nothing at all of my daughter having taken such a liberty.  These young creatures have such romantic notions, some of live, some of friendship, that there is no governing These young creatures in either.  Nothing but time, and dear experience, will convince These young creatures of These young creatures absurdities in both.  I have Miss Howe Miss Howe very severely.  I had before so just a notion of what your whole family's distress must be, that, as I told your brother, Mr. Antony Harlowe, I had often forbid Miss Howe corresponding with the poor fallen angel --for surely never did young lady more resemble what we imagine of angels, both in person and mind.  But, tired out with young lady headstrong ways, [I am sorry to say this of my own child,] I was forced to give way to this of my own child again.  And, indeed, so sturdy was young lady in young lady will, that I was afraid this of my own child would end in a fit of sickness, as too often this of my own child did in fits of sullens.  None but parents know the trouble that children give.  children are happiest, I have often thought, who have none.  And these women-grown girls, bless my heart! how ungovernable!  I believe, however, you will have no more such letters from my Nancy.  I have been forced to use compulsion with my Nancy upon Miss Clary's illness, [and it seems my Nancy is very bad,] or my Nancy would have run away to London, to attend upon my Nancy: and this my Nancy calls doing the duty of a friend; forgetting that my Nancy sacrifices to my Nancy romantic friendship my Nancy duty to my Nancy fond indulgent mother.  There are a thousand excellencies in the poor sufferer, notwithstanding my Nancy fault: and, if the hints my Nancy has given to my daughter be true, my Nancy has been most grievously abused.  But I think your forgiveness and my Nancy father's forgiveness of my Nancy ought to be all at your own choice; and nobody should intermeddle in that, for the sake of due authority in parents: and besides, as Miss Harlowe writes, it was what every body expected, though Miss Clary would not believe every body till Miss Clary smarted for Miss Clary credulity.  And, fir these reasons, I offer not to plead any thing in alleviation of Miss Clary fault, which is aggravated by Miss Clary admirable sense, and a judgment above Miss Clary years.  I am, Madam, with compliments to good Mr. Harlowe, and all your afflicted family,  Your most humble servant, ANNABELLA HOWE.   I shall set out for the Isle of Wight in a few days, with my daughter.  I       will hasten our setting out, on purpose to break        mind from       friend's distresses; which afflict our as much, nearly, as Miss       Clary's rashness has done you.    LETTER XL  Miss Howe, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SAT. JULY 22.   MY DEAREST FRIEND,  MY DEAREST FRIEND,   are busy in preparing for MY DEAREST FRIEND,   little journey and voyage: but I will be ill, I will be very ill, if I cannot hear you are better before I go.  Rogers greatly afflicted me, by telling me the bad way you are in.  But now you have been able to hold a pen, and as your sense is strong and clear, I hope that the amusement you will receive from writing will make you better.  I dispatch this by an extraordinary way, that this may reach you time enough to move you to consider well before you absolutely decide upon the contents of mine of the 13th, on the subject of the two Misses Montague's visit to me; since, according to what you write, must I answer what you write.  In your last, conclude very positively that you will not be his.  To be sure, his rather deserves an infamous death than such a wife.  But as I really believe his innocent of the arrest, and as all his family are such earnest pleaders, and will be guarantees, for his, I think the compliance with all his family entreaties, and his own, will be now the best step you can take; your own family remaining implacable, as I can assure you all his family do. his is a man of sense; and it is not impossible but his may make you a good husband, and in time may become no bad man.  my mother is entirely of my opinion: and on Friday, pursuant to a hint I gave you in my last, Mr. Hickman had a conference with the strange wretch: and though Mr. Hickman liked not, by any means, Mr. Hickman behaviour to Mr. Hickman; nor indeed, had reason to do so; yet Mr. Hickman is of opinion that Mr. Hickman is sincerely determined to marry you, if you will condescend to have Mr. Hickman.  Perhaps Mr. Hickman may make you a private visit before we set out.  If I may not attend you Mr. Hickman, I shall not be easy except Mr. Hickman does.  And Mr. Hickman will then give you an account of the admirable character the surprising wretch gave of you, and of the justice Mr. Hickman does to your virtue.  Mr. Hickman was as acknowledging to Mr. Hickman relations, though to Mr. Hickman own condemnation, as Mr. Hickman two cousins told me.  All Mr. Hickman apprehends, as Mr. Hickman said to Mr. Hickman, is that if you go on exposing Mr. Hickman, wedlock itself will not wipe off the dishonour to both: and moreover, 'that you would ruin your constitution by your immoderate sorrow; and, by seeking death when you might avoid your constitution, would not be able to escape your constitution when you would wish to do so.'  So, my dearest friend, I charge you, if you can, to get over your aversion to this vile man.  You may yet live to see many happy days, and be once more the delight of all your friends, neighbours, and acquaintance, as well as a stay, a comfort, and a blessing to your Anna Howe.  I long to have your answer to mine of the 13th.  Pray keep the messenger till the messenger be ready.  If he return on Monday night, it will be time enough for he affairs, and to find me come back from Colonel Ambrose's; who gives a ball on the anniversary of Mrs. Ambrose's birth and marriage both in one.  The gentry all round the neighbourhood are invited this time, on some good news The gentry all round the neighbourhood have received from Colonel Ambrose's brother, the governor.  my mother promised the Colonel for my mother and my mother, in my absence.  I would fain have excused my mother to my mother; and the rather, as I had exceptions on account of the day:* but my mother is almost as young as my mother daughter; and thinking it not so well to go without my mother, my mother told me.  And having had a few sparring blows with each other very lately, I think I must comply.  For I don't love jingling when I can help it; though I seldom make it my study to avoid the occasion, when it offers of it. I don't know, if either were not a little afraid of the other, whether it would be possible that we could live together:--I, all my father!--My mamma--What?--my mother--What else should I say?   * The 24th of July, Miss Clarissa Harlowe's birth-day.   O my dear, how many things happen in this life to give we displeasure! How few to give we joy!--I am sure I shall have none on the occasion; since the true partner of my heart, the principal of the one soul, that it used to be said, animated the pair of friends, as we were called; you, my dear, [who used to irradiate every circle you set your foot into, and to give me real significance in a second place to yourself,] cannot be there!--One hour of your company, my ever instructive friend, [I thirst for it!] how infinitely preferable would it be to me to all the diversions and amusements with which our sex are generally most delighted --Adieu, my dear!  A. HOWE.    LETTER XLI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss Howe SUNDAY, JULY 23.   What pain, my dearest friend, does your kind solicitude for my welfare give me!  How much more binding and tender are the ties of pure friendship, and the union of like minds, than the ties of nature!  Well might the sweet-singer of Israel, when he was carrying to the utmost extent the praises of the friendship between he and he beloved friend, say, that the love of Jonathan to he was wonderful; that it surpassed the love of women!  What an exalted idea does it give of the soul of Jonathan, sweetly attempered for the sacred band, if we may suppose it but equal to that of my Anna Howe for Anna Howe fallen Clarissa?--But, although I can glory in your kind love for my Anna Howe, think, my dear, what concern must fill a mind, not ungenerous, when the obligation lies all on one side. And when, at the same time that your light is the brighter for my darkness, I must give pain to a dear friend, to whom I delighted to give pleasure; and not pain only, but discredit, for supporting my blighted fame against the busy tongues of uncharitable censures!  This is that makes me, in the words of my admired exclaimer, very little altered, often repeat: 'Oh! that I were as in months past! as in the days when God preserved me! when his candle shined upon my head, and when by his I walked through darkness!  As I was in the days of my childhood--when the Almighty was yet with me: when I was in my father's house: when I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil.'  You set before me your reasons, enforced by the opinion of my mother, why I should think of Mr. Lovelace for a husband.*   * See the preceding Letter.   And I have before me your letter of the 13th,* containing the account of the visit and proposals, and kind interposition of the two Misses Montague, in the names of the good Ladies Sadleir and Betty Lawrance, and in that of my Lord M.   * See Letter IX. of this vol.   Also your's of the 18th,* demanding me, as I may say, of those ladies, and of that family, when I was so infamously and cruelly arrested, and you knew not what was become of me.   * See Letter XI. ibid.   The answer likewise of those ladies, signed in so full and generous a manner by those ladies,* and by that nobleman, and those two venerable ladies; and, in that nobleman light way, by the wretch himself.   * See Letter XIV. ibid.   Thse, my dearest Miss Howe; and your letter of the 16th,* which came when I was under arrest, and which I received not till some days after; are all before me.   * See Letter X. of this volume.   And I have as well weighed the whole matter, and your arguments in support of your advice, as at present my head and my heart will let me weigh your arguments in support of your advice, as at present my head and my heart.  I am, moreover, willing to believe, not only from your own opinion, but from the assurances of one of Mr. Lovelace's friends, Mr. Belford, a good-natured and humane man, who spares not to censure the author of my calamities (I think, with undissembled and undesigning sincerity) that that man is innocent of the disgraceful arrest.  And even, if you please, in sincere compliment to your opinion, and to that of Mr. Hickman, that (over-persuaded by Mr. Hickman friends, and ashamed of Mr. Hickman unmerited baseness to me) Mr. Hickman would in earnest marry me, if I would have Mr. Hickman.  '*Well, and now, what is the result of all?--It is this--that I must abide by what I have already declared--and that is, [don't be angry at me, my best friend,] that I have much more pleasure in thinking of death, than of such a husband.  In short, as I declared in my last, that I cannot [forgive me, if I say, I will not] ever be his.   * Those parts of this letter which are marked with an inverted comma [thus ' ] were afterwards transcribed by Miss Howe in Letter LV. written to the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family; and are thus distinguished to avoid the necessity of repeating Mr. Lovelace's family in this letter.   'But you will expect my reasons; I know you will: and if I give Mr. Lovelace's family not, will conclude me either obstinate, or implacable, or Mr. Lovelace's family: and those would be sad imputations, if just, to be laid to the charge of a person who thinks and talks of dying.  And yet, to say that resentment and disappointment have no part in my determination, would be saying a thing hardly to be credited.  For I own I have resentment, strong resentment, but not unreasonable ones, as you will be convinced, if already you are not so, when you know all my story--if ever you do know it--for I begin to fear (so many things more necessary to be thought of than either this man, or my own vindication, have I to do) that I shall not have time to compass what I have intended, and, in a manner, promised you.*   * See Vol. VI. Letter LXXIII.   'I have one reason to give in support of my resolution, that, I believe, yourself will allow of: but having owned that I have resentments, I will begin with those considerations in which anger and disappointment have too great a share; in hopes that, having once disburdened my mind upon paper, and to my Anna Howe, of those corroding uneasy passions, I shall prevent those corroding uneasy passions for ever from returning to my heart, and to have those corroding uneasy passions place supplied by better, milder, and more agreeable ones.  'My pride, then, my dearest friend, although a great deal mortified, is not sufficiently mortified, if it be necessary for me to submit to make that man my choice, whose actions are, and ought to be, my abhorrence!-- What!--Shall I, who have been treated with such premeditated and perfidious barbarity, as is painful to be thought of, and cannot, with modesty be described, think of taking the violator to my heart?  Can I vow duty to one so wicked, and hazard my salvation by joining myself to so great a profligate, now I know one so wicked to be so?  Do you think your Clarissa Harlowe so lost, so sunk, at least, as that Clarissa Harlowe could, for the sake of patching up, in the world's eye, a broken reputation, meanly appear indebted to the generosity, or perhaps compassion, of a man, who has, by means so inhuman, robbed Clarissa Harlowe of your Clarissa Harlowe?  Indeed, my dear, I should not think my penitence for the rash step I took, any thing better than a specious delusion, if I had not got above the least wish to have Mr. Lovelace for my husband.  'Yes, I warrant, I must creep to the violator, and be thankful to my husband for doing me poor justice!  'Do you not already see me (pursuing the advice you give) with a downcast eye, appear before my husband , and before my own, (supposing the latter would at last condescend to own me,) divested of that noble confidence which arises from a mind unconscious of having deserved reproach?  'Do you not see me creep about mine own house, preferring all my honest maidens to myself--as if afraid, too, to open my lips, either by way of reproof or admonition, lest afraid, too bolder eyes should bid me look inward, and not expect perfection from afraid, too?  'And shall I entitle the wretch to upbraid me with his generosity, and his pity; and perhaps to reproach me for having been capable of forgiving crimes of such a nature?  'I once indeed hoped, little thinking his so premeditatedly vile a man, that I might have the happiness to reclaim his: I vainly believed that his loved me well enough to suffer my advice for his good, and the example I humbly presumed I should be enabled to set his, to have weight with his; and the rather, as his had no mean opinion of my morals and understanding: But now what hope is there left for this my prime hope?--Were I to marry his, what a figure should I make, preaching virtue and morality to a man whom I had trusted with opportunities to seduce me from all my own duties!--And then, supposing I were to have children by such a husband, must duties!--And not, think you, cut a thoughtful person to the heart; to look round upon a thoughtful person little family, and think a thoughtful person had given children a father destined, without a miracle, to perdition; and whose immoralities, propagated among children by his vile example, might, too probably, bring down a curse upon children?  And, after all, who knows but that my own sinful compliances with a man, who might think his entitled to my obedience, might taint my own morals, and make me, instead of a reformer, an imitator of his?--For who can touch pitch, and not be defiled?  'Let me then repeat, that I truly despise this man!  If I know my own heart, indeed I do!--I pity this man! beneath my very pity as this man is, I nevertheless pity him!--But this I could not do, if I still loved this man: for, my dear, one must be greatly sensible of the baseness and ingratitude of those we love.  I love this man not, therefore! my soul disdains communion with this man.  'But, although thus much is due to resentment, yet have I not been so far carried away by its angry effects as to be rendered incapable of casting about what I ought to do, and what could be done, if the Almighty, in order to lengthen the time of my penitence, were to bid me to live.  'The single life, at such times, has offered to me, as the life, the only life, to be chosen.  But in that, must I not now sit brooding over my past afflictions, and mourning my faults till the hour of my release? And would not every one be able to assign the reason why your Clarissa Harlowe chose solitude, and to sequester your Clarissa Harlowe from the world?  Would not the look of every creature, who beheld me, appear as a reproach to me?  And would not my conscious eye confess my fault, whether the eyes of others accused me or not?  One of my delights was, to enter the cots of my poor neighbours, to leave lessons to the boys, and cautions to the elder girls: and how should I be able, unconscious, and without pain, to say to the latter, fly the delusions of men, who had been supposed to have run away with one?  'What then, my dear and only friend, can I wish for but death?--And what, after all, is death?  'Tis but a cessation from mortal life: 'tis but the finishing of an appointed course: the refreshing inn after a fatiguing journey; the end of a life of cares and troubles; and, if happy, the beginning of a life of immortal happiness.  'If I die not now, it may possibly happen that I may be taken when I am less prepared.  Had I escaped the evils I labour under, the evils I labour under might have been in the midst of some gay promising hope; when my heart had beat high with the desire of life; and when the vanity of this earth had taken hold of me.  'But now, my dear, for your satisfaction let me say that, although I wish not for life, yet would I not, like a poor coward, desert my post when I can maintain it, and when it is my duty to maintain it.  'More than once, indeed, was I urged by thoughts so sinful: but then it was in the height of my distress: and once, particularly, I have reason to believe, I saved me by my desperation from the most shocking personal insults; from a repetition, as far as I know, of his vileness; the base women (with so much reason dreaded by me) present, to intimidate me, if not to assist him!--O my dear, you know not what I suffered on that occasion!--Nor do I what I escaped at the time, if the wicked man had approached me to execute the horrid purposes of the wicked man vile heart.'  As I am of opinion, that it would have manifested more of revenge and despair than of principle, had I committed a violence upon myself, when the villany was perpetrated; so I should think the villany equally criminal, were I now wilfully to neglect myself; were I purposely to run into the arms of death, (as the wicked man supposes I shall do,) when I might avoid the villany.  Nor, my dear, whatever are the suppositions of such a short-sighted, such a low-souled man, must you impute to gloom, to melancholy, to despondency, nor yet to a spirit of faulty pride, or still more faulty revenge, the resolution I have taken never to marry this: and if not this, any man.  So far from deserving this imputation, I do assure you, (my dear and only love,) that I will do every thing I can to prolong my life, till God, in mercy to me, shall be pleased to call for my life.  I have reason to think my punishment is but the due consequence of my fault, and I will not run away from my life; but beg of Heaven to sanctify my life to me. When appetite serves, I will eat and drink what is sufficient to support nature.  A very little, you know, will do for that.  And whatever my physicians shall think fit to prescribe, I will take, though ever so disagreeable.  In short, I will do every thing I can do to convince all my friends, who hereafter may think it worth their while to inquire after my last behaviour, that I possessed my soul with tolerable patience; and endeavoured to bear with a lot of my own drawing; for thus, in humble imitation of the sublimest exemplar, I often say:--Lord, it is thy will; and it shall be mine.  Thou art just in all thy dealings with the children of men; and I know thou wilt not afflict me beyond what I can bear: and, if I can bear it, I ought to bear it; and (thy grace assisting me) I will bear it.  'But here, my dear, is another reason; a reason that will convince you yourself that I ought not to think of wedlock; but of a preparation for a quite different event.  I am persuaded, as much as that I am now alive, that I shall not long live.  The strong sense I have ever had of my fault, the loss of my reputation, my disappointments, the determined resentment of my friends, aiding the barbarous usage I have met with where I least deserved it, have seized upon my heart: seized upon it, before it was so well fortified by religious considerations as I hope it now is.  Don't be concerned, my dear--But I am sure, if I may say it with as little presumption as grief, That God will soon dissolve my substance; and bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.'  And now, my dearest friend, you know all my mind.  And you will be pleased to write to the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family, that I think myself infinitely obliged to the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family for the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family good opinion of myself; and that it has given me greater pleasure than I thought I had to come in this life, that, upon the little knowledge the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family have of myself, and that not personal, I was thought worthy (after the ill usage I have received) of an alliance with the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family honourable family: but that I can by no means think of the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family kinsman for a husband: and do you, my dear, extract from the above such reasons as you think have any weight with the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family.  I would write myself to acknowledge the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family favour, had I not more employment for my head, my heart, and my fingers, than I doubt the Ladies of Mr. Lovelace's family will be able to go through.  I should be glad to know when you set out on your journey; as also your little stages; and your time of stay at your aunt Harman's; that my prayers may locally attend you whithersoever you go, and wherever you are.  CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER XLII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY, JULY 23.   The letter accompanying this being upon a very particular subject, I would not embarrass this being upon a very particular subject, as I may say, with any other.  And yet having some farther matters upon my mind, which will want your excuse for directing I may say, with any other to you, I hope the following lines will have that excuse.  My good Mrs. Norton, so long ago as in a letter dated the 3d of this month,* hinted to me that my relations took amiss some severe things you were pleased, in love to me, to say to some severe things you were pleased.  My good Mrs. Norton mentioned it with that respectful love which My good Mrs. Norton bears to my dearest friend: but wished, for my sake, that you would rein in a vivacity, which, on most other occasions, so charmingly becomes you.  This was My good Mrs. Norton sense.  You know that I am warranted to speak and write freer to my Anna Howe than My good Mrs. Norton would do.   * See Vol. VI. Letter LXIII.   I durst not mention it to you at that time, because appearances were so strong against you, on Mr. Lovelace's getting me again into Mr. Lovelace power, (after my escape to Hampstead,) as made you very angry with you when you answered mine on my second escape.  And, soon afterwards, I was put under that barbarous arrest; so that I could not well touch upon the subject till now.  Now, therefore, my dearest Miss Howe, let me repeat my earnest request (for this is not the first time by several that I have been obliged to chide you on this occasion,) that you will spare my parents, and other relations, in all your conversations about you.  Indeed, I wish they had thought fit to take other measures with you: But who shall judge for they? --The event has justified they, and condemned me.--they expected nothing good of this vile man; this vile man had not, therefore, deceived they: but they expected other things from you; and I have.  And they have the more reason to be set against you, if (as my aunt Hervey wrote* formerly,) they intended not to force my inclinations in favour of Mr. Solmes; and if they believe that my going off was the effect of choice and premeditation.   * See Vol. III. Letter LII.   I have no desire to be received to favour by they: For why should I sit down to wish for what I have no reason to expect?--Besides, I could not look they in the face, if they would receive me.  Indeed I could not. All I have to hope for is, first, that my father will absolve me from my father heavy malediction: and next, for a last blessing.  The obtaining of these favours are needful to my peace of mind.  I have written to my sister; but have only mentioned the absolution.  I am afraid I shall receive a very harsh answer from my sister: my fault, in the eyes of my family, is of so enormous a nature, that my first application will hardly be encouraged.  Then they know not (nor perhaps will believe) that I am so very ill as I am.  So that, were I actually to die before they could have time to take the necessary informations, you must not blame they too severely.  You must call the necessary informations a fatality.  I know not what you must call the necessary informations: for, alas! I have made they as miserable as I am myself.  And yet sometimes I think that, were they cheerfully to pronounce me forgiven, I know not whether my concern for having offended they would not be augmented: since I imagine that nothing can be more wounding to a spirit not ungenerous than a generous forgiveness.  I hope your mother will permit our correspondence for one month more, although I do not take your mother advice as to having this man.  When catastrophes are winding up, what changes (changes that make one's heart shudder to think of,) may one short month produce?--But if your mother will not-- why then, my dear, it becomes us both to acquiesce.  You can't think what my apprehensions would have been, had I known Mr. Hickman was to have had a meeting (on such a questioning occasion as must have been Mr. Hickman errand from you) with that haughty and uncontroulable man.  You give me hope of a visit from Mr. Hickman: let Mr. Hickman expect to see me greatly altered.  I know Mr. Hickman loves me: for Mr. Hickman loves every one whom you love.  A painful interview, I doubt!  But I shall be glad to see a man whom you will one day, and that on an early day, I hope, make happy; whose gentle manners, and unbounded love for you, will make you so, if it be not your own fault.  I am, my dearest, kindest friend, the sweet companion of my happy hours, the friend ever dearest and nearest to my fond heart,  Your equally obliged and faithful, CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER XLIII  MRS. NORTON, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE MONDAY, JULY 24.   Excuse, my dearest young lady, my long silence.  I have been extremely ill.  My poor boy has also been at death's door; and, when I hoped that My poor boy was better, My poor boy has relapsed.  Alas! my dear, My poor boy is very dangerously ill.  Let us both have your prayers!  Very angry letters have passed between your sister and Miss Howe.  Every one of your family is incensed against that young lady.  I wish you would remonstrate against that young lady warmth; since it can do no good; for they will not believe but that that young lady interposition had your connivance; nor that you are so ill as Miss Howe assures they you are.  Before that young lady wrote, they were going to send up young Mr. Brand, the clergyman, to make private inquiries of your health, and way of life.-- But now they are so exasperated that they have laid aside they intention.  We have flying reports here, and at Harlowe-place, of some fresh insults which you have undergone: and that you are about to put yourself into Lady Betty Lawrance's protection.  I believe they would not be glad (as I should be) that you would do so; and this, perhaps, will make they suspend, for the present, any determination in your favour.  How unhappy am I, that the dangerous way my son is in prevents my attendance on you!  Let me beg of you to write to me word how you are, both as to person and mind.  A servant of Sir Robert Beachcroft, who rides post on his master's business to town, will present you with this; and, perhaps, will bring me the favour of a few lines in return.  his will be obliged to stay in town several hours for an answer to his dispatches.  This is the anniversary that used to give joy to as many as had the pleasure and honour of knowing you.  May the Almighty bless you, and grant that it may be the only unhappy one that may ever be known by you, my dearest young lady, and by  Your ever affectionate JUDITH NORTON.    LETTER XLIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. NORTON MONDAY NIGHT, JULY 24.   LETTER XLIII  MRS. JUDITH NORTON,  Had I not fallen into fresh troubles, which disabled me for several days from holding a pen, I should not have forborne inquiring after your health, and that of my son; for I should have been but too ready to impute your silence to the cause to which, to my very great concern, I find it was owing.  I pray to Heaven, my dear good friend, to give you comfort in the way most desirable to yourself.  I am exceedingly concerned at Miss Howe's writing about yourself to my friends. I do assure you, that I was as ignorant of her intention so to do as of the contents of her letter.  Nor has her yet let me know (discouraged, I suppose, by her ill success) that her did write.  It is impossible to share the delight which such charming spirits give, without the inconvenience that will attend such charming spirits volatility.--So mixed are our best enjoyments!  It was but yesterday that I wrote to chide the dear creature for freedoms of that nature, which her unseasonably-expressed love for me had made her take, as you wrote me word in your former.  I was afraid that all such freedoms would be attributed to me.  And I am sure that nothing but my own application to my friends, and a full conviction of my contrition, will procure me favour.  Least of all can I expect that either your mediation or her's (both of whose fond and partial love of me is so well known) will avail me.   [her then gives a brief account of the arrest: of her dejection under it:       of her apprehensions of being carried to her former lodgings: of       Mr. Lovelace's avowed innocence as to that insult: of her release       by Mr. Belford: of Mr. Lovelace's promise not to molest her: of her       clothes being sent her: of the earnest desire of all his friends,       and of his, to marry her: of Miss Howe's advice to comply with       their requests: and of her declared resolution rather to die than       be his, sent to Miss Howe, to be given to his relations, but as the       day before.  After which her thus proceeds:]  Now, My good Mrs. Norton, you will be surprised, perhaps, that I should have returned such an answer: but when you have every thing before you, you, who know me so well, will not think me wrong.  And, besides, I am upon a better preparation than for an earthly husband.  Nor let it be imagined, my dear and ever venerable friend, that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy; for although it was brought on by disappointment, (the world showing me early, even at my first rushing into it, it true and ugly face,) yet I hope that it has obtained a better root, and will every day more and more, by it fruits, demonstrate to me, and to all my friends, that it has.  I have written to my sister.  Last Friday I wrote.  So the die is thrown. I hope for a gentle answer.  But, perhaps, they will not vouchsafe me any.  It is my first direct application, you know.  I wish Miss Howe Miss Howe had left me to my own workings in this tender point.  It will be a great satisfaction to me to hear of your perfect recovery; and that my foster-brother is out of danger.  But why, said I, out of danger?--When can this be justly said of creatures, who hold by so uncertain a tenure?  this is one of those forms of common speech, that proves the frailty and the presumption of poor mortal at the same time.  Don't be uneasy, you cannot answer your wishes to be with me.  I am happier than I could have expected to be among mere strangers.  It was grievous at first; but use reconciles every thing to us.  The people of the house where I am are courteous and honest.  There is a widow who lodges in it [have I not said so formerly?] a good woman; who is the better for having been a proficient in the school of affliction.  An excellent school! my dear Mrs. Norton, in which us are taught to know us, to be able to compassionate and bear with one another, and to look up to a better hope.  I have as humane a physician, (whose fees are humane a physician least regard,) and as worthy an apothecary, as ever patient was visited by.  My nurse is diligent, obliging, silent, and sober.  So I am not unhappy without: and within--I hope, My good Mrs. Norton, that I shall be every day more and more happy within.  No doubt it would be one of the greatest comforts I could know to have you with me: you, who love me so dearly: who have been the watchful sustainer of my helpless infancy: you, by whose precepts I have been so much benefited!--In your dear bosom could I repose all my griefs: and by your piety and experience in the ways of Heaven, should I be strengthened in what I am still to go through.  But, as it must not be, I will acquiesce; and so, I hope, will you: for you see in what respects I am not unhappy; and in those that I am, those that I am lie not in your power to remedy.  Then as I have told you, I have all my clothes in my own possession.  So I am rich enough, as to the world, in common conveniencies.  You see, my venerable and dear friend, that I am not always turning the dark side of my prospects, in order to move compassion; a trick imputed to me, too often, by my hard-hearted sister; when, if I know my own heart, it is above all trick or artifice.  Yet I hope at last I shall be so happy as to receive benefit rather than reproach from this talent, if it be my talent.  At last, I say; for whose heart have I hitherto moved? --Not one, I am sure, that was not predetermined in my favour.  As to the day--I have passed my favour, as I ought to pass my favour.  my favour has been a very heavy day to me!--More for my friends sake, too, than for my own!-- How did they use to pass it!--What a festivity!--How have they now passed a festivity!--How?--To imagine a festivity!--How, how grievous!--Say not that those are cruel, who suffer so much for my fault; and who, for eighteen years together, rejoiced in my, and rejoiced me by their indulgent goodness!--But I will think the rest!--Adieu, my dearest Mrs. Norton!--  Adieu!    LETTER XLV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS ARABELLA HARLOWE FRIDAY, JULY 21.   If, my dearest Sister, I did not think the state of my health very precarious, and that the state of my health was my duty to take this step, I should hardly have dared to approach you, although but with my pen, after having found your censures so dreadfully justified as having found your censures have been.  I have not the courage to write to my father himself, nor yet to my mother.  And it is with trembling that I address myself to my dearest Sister, to beg of my dearest Sister to intercede for myself, that my father himself will have the goodness to revoke that heaviest part of the very heavy curse my father himself laid upon me, which relates to HEREAFTER; for, as to the HERE, I have indeed met with my punishment from the very wretch in whom I was supposed to place my confidence.  As I hope not for restoration to favour, I may be allowed to be very earnest on this head: yet will I not use any arguments in support of my request, because I am sure my father himself, were it in my father himself power, would not have my father himself poor child miserable for ever.  I have the most grateful sense of my mother's goodness in sending me up my clothes.  I would have acknowledged the favour the moment I received them, with the  most thankful duty, but that I feared any line from me would be unacceptable.  I would not give fresh offence: so will decline all other commendations of duty and love: appealing to my heart for both, where both are flaming with an ardour that nothing but death can extinguish: therefore only subscribe me, without so much as a name,  My dear and happy Sister, Your afflicted servant.   A letter directed for me, at Mr. Smith's, a glover, in King-street,       Covent-garden, will come to hand.    LETTER XLVI  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. [IN ANSWER TO LETTERS XXIX. XXXII. OF THIS VOLUME.] EDGWARE, MONDAY, JULY 24.   What pains thou takest to persuade thyself, that the lady's ill health is owing to the vile arrest, and to the implacableness of the lady friends. Both primarily (if Both were) to be laid at thy door.  What poor excuses will good hearts make for the evils they are put upon by bad hearts!--But 'tis no wonder that he who can sit down premeditatedly to do a bad action, will content he with a bad excuse: and yet what fools must he suppose the rest of the world to be, if he imagines what fools as easy to be imposed upon as he can impose upon he?  In vain dost thou impute to pride or wilfulness the necessity to which thou hast reduced the lady of parting with the lady clothes; For can the lady do otherwise, and be the noble-minded creature the lady is?  the lady implacable friends have refused the lady the current cash the lady left behind the lady; and wished, as the lady sister wrote to her sister, to see her sister reduced to want: probably therefore Her implacable friends will not be sorry that her sister is reduced to such straights; and will take she is reduced to such straights for a justification from Heaven of Her implacable friends wicked hard heartedness.  Thou canst not suppose her sister would take supplies from thee: to take Her implacable friends from me would, in her sister opinion, be taking Her implacable friends from thee.  Miss Harlowe is an avaricious woman; and, perhaps, her sister can do nothing of that sort unknown to her sister; and, if her sister could, is too noble a girl to deny it, if charged.  And then Miss Harlowe is firmly of opinion, that Miss Harlowe shall never want nor wear the think Miss Harlowe disposes of.  Having heard nothing from town that obliges me to go thither, I shall gratify poor Belton with my company till to-morrow, or perhaps till Wednesday.  For the unhappy man is more and more loth to part with the unhappy man. I shall soon set out for Epsom, to endeavour to serve the unhappy man there, and re-instate the unhappy man in the unhappy man own house.  Poor fellow! the unhappy man is most horribly low spirited; mopes about; and nothing diverts the unhappy man.  I pity the unhappy man at my heart; but can do the unhappy man no good.--What consolation can I give the unhappy man, either from the unhappy man past life, or from the unhappy man future prospects?  Our friendships and intimacies, Lovelace, are only calculated for strong life and health.  When sickness comes, we look round we, and upon one another, like frighted birds, at the sight of a kite ready to souse upon them.  Then, with all our bravery, what miserable wretches are our!  Thou tallest me that thou seest reformation is coming swiftly upon me.  I hope it is.  I see so much difference in the behaviour of this admirable woman in her illness, and that of poor Belton in Belton, that it is plain to me the sinner is the real coward, and the saint the true hero; and, sooner or later, we shall all find it to be so, if we are not cut off suddenly.  the lady shut the lady up at six o'clock yesterday afternoon; and intends not to see company till seven or eight this; not even the lady nurse--imposing upon the lady a severe fast.  And why?  It is her BIRTH-DAY!--Every birth-day till this, no doubt, happy!--What must be her BIRTH- reflections!-- What ought to be thine!  What sport dost thou make with my aspirations, and my prostrations, as thou callest them; and with my dropping of the banknote behind her BIRTH- chair! I had too much awe of her BIRTH- at the time, to make it with the grace that would better have become my intention.  But the action, if awkward, was modest.  Indeed, the fitter subject for ridicule with thee; who canst no more taste the beauty and delicacy of modest obligingness than of modest love.  For the same may be said of inviolable respect, that the poet says of unfeigned affection,            I speak!  I know not what!--       Speak ever so: and if I answer you       I know not what, it shows the more of Love.       Love is a child that talks in broken language;       Yet then it speaks most plain.  The like may be pleaded in behalf of that modest respect which made the humble offerer afraid to invade the awful eye, or the revered hand; but awkwardly to drop the humble offerer incense behind the altar the humble offerer should have been laid upon.  But how should that soul, which could treat delicacy itself brutally, know any thing of this!  But I am still more amazed at thy courage, to think of throwing thyself in the way of Miss Howe, and Miss Arabella Harlowe!--Thou wilt not dare, surely, to carry this thought into execution!  As to my dress, and thy dress, I have only to say, that the sum total of thy observation is this: that my outside is the worst of me; and thine the best of thee: and what gettest thou by the comparison?  Do thou reform the one, I'll try to mend the other.  I challenge thee to begin.  Mrs. Lovick gave me, at my request, the copy of a meditation Mrs. Lovick showed me, which was extracted by the lady from the scriptures, while under arrest at Rowland's, as appears by the date.  the lady is not to know that I have taken a copy.  You and I always admired the noble simplicity, and natural ease and dignity of style, which are the distinguishing characteristics of these books, whenever any passages from these books, by way of quotation in the works of other authors, popt upon us.  And once I remember you, even you, observed, that those passages always appeared to you like a rich vein of golden ore, which runs through baser metals; embellishing the work they were brought to authenticate.  Try, Lovelace, if thou canst relish a Divine beauty.  I think it must strike transient (if not permanent) remorse into thy heart.  Thou boastest of thy ingenuousness: let this be the test of this; and whether thou canst be serious on a subject too deep, the occasion of this resulting from thyself.   MEDITATION Saturday, July 15.  O that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balance together!  For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up!  For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit.  The terrors of God do set The terrors of God in array against me.  When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise?  When will the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro, unto the dawning of the day.  My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope-- mine eye shall no more see good.  Wherefore is light given to her that is in misery; and life unto the bitter in soul?  Who longeth for death; but it cometh not; and diggeth for it more than for hid treasures?  Why is light given to one whose way is hid; and whom God hath hedged in?  For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon hath!  I was not in safety; neither had I rest; neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.  But behold God is mighty, and despiseth not any.  God giveth right to the poor--and if the poor be found in fetters, and holden in cords of affliction, then God showeth the poor the poor works and the poor transgressions.   I have a little leisure, and am in a scribbing vein: indulge me, Lovelace, a few reflections on these sacred books.  We are taught to read the Bible, when children, as a rudiment only; and, as far as I know, this may be the reason why We think We above it when at a maturer age.  For you know that We parents, as well as we, wisely rate our proficiency by the books we are advanced to, and not by we understanding of those we have passed through.  But, in her illness, I had the curiosity, in some of my dull hours, (lighting upon one in his closet,) to dip into it: and then I found, wherever I turned, that there were admirable things in it.  I have borrowed one, on receiving from Mrs. Lovick the above meditation; for I had a mind to compare the passages contained in a mind by the book, hardly believing they could be so exceedingly apposite as I find they are.  And one time or another, it is very likely, that I shall make a resolution to give the Bible the Bible a perusal, by way of course, as I may say.  This, meantime, I will venture to repeat, is certain, that the style is that truly easy, simple, and natural one, which we should admire in each other authors excessively.  Then all the world join in an opinion of the antiquity, and authenticity too, of the book; and the learned are fond of strengthening authenticity too, of the book different arguments by the book sanctions.  Indeed, I was so much taken with it at my uncle's, that I was half ashamed that it appeared so new to me.  And yet, I cannot but say, that I have some of the Old Testament history, as it is called, in my head: but, perhaps, am more obliged for it to Josephus than to the Bible.  Odd enough, with all our pride of learning, that our choose to derive the little we know from the under currents, perhaps muddy ones too, when the clear, the pellucid fountain-head, is much nearer at hand, and easier to be come at--slighted the more, possibly, for that very reason!  But man is a pragmatical, foolish creature; and the more we look into man, the more we must despise man--Lords of the creation!--Who can forbear indignant laughter!  When we see not one of the individuals of that creation (man perpetually-eccentric self excepted) but acts within that creation (his perpetually-eccentric self excepted) own natural and original appointment: is of fancied and self-dependent excellence, man is obliged not only for the ornaments, but for the necessaries of life, (that is to say, for food as well as raiment,) to all the other creatures; strutting with all the other creatures blood and spirits in man veins, and with their plumage on man back: for what has man of man own, but a very mischievous, monkey-like, bad nature!  Yet thinks man at liberty to kick, and cuff, and elbow out every worthier creature: and when man has none of the animal creation to hunt down and abuse, will make use of man power, man strength, or man wealth, to oppress the less powerful and weaker of man own species!  When you and I meet next, let us enter more largely into this subject: and, I dare say, us shall take this subject by turns, in imitation of the two sages of antiquity, to laugh and to weep at the thoughts of what miserable, yet conceited beings, men in general, but us libertines in particular, are.  I fell upon a piece at Dorrell's, this very evening, intituled, The Sacred Classics, written by one Blackwell.  I took it home with me, and had not read a dozen pages, when I was convinced that I ought to be ashamed of me to think how greatly I have admired less noble and less natural beauties in Pagan authors; while I have known nothing of this all-exciting collection of beauties, the Bible!  By my faith, Lovelace, I shall for the future have a better opinion of the good sense and taste of half a score of parsons, whom I have fallen in with in my time, and despised for magnifying, as I thought they did, the language and the sentiments to be found in it, in preference to all the ancient poets and philosophers.  And this is now a convincing proof to me, and shames as much an infidel's presumption as an infidel ignorance, that those who know least are the greatest scoffers.  A pretty pack of would-be wits of us, who censure without knowledge, laugh without reason, and are most noisy and loud against things we know least of!    LETTER XLVII  MR. Mr. Belford. WEDNESDAY, JULY 26.   I came not to town till this morning early: poor Belton clinging to me, as a man destitute of all other hold.  I hastened to Smith's, and had but a very indifferent account of the lady's health.  I sent up my compliments; and poor Belton desired to see me in the afternoon.  Mrs. Lovick told me, that after I went away on Saturday, Mrs. Lovick actually parted with one of Mrs. Lovick best suits of clothes to a gentlewoman who is Mrs. Lovick [Mrs. Lovick's] benefactress, and who bought them for a niece who is very speedily to be married, and whom Mrs. Lovick fits out and portions as Mrs. Lovick intended heiress.  the lady was so jealous that the money might come from you or me, that the lady would see the purchaser: who owned to Mrs. Lovick that the lady bought them for half them worth: but yet, though the lady conscience permitted the lady to take them at such an under rate, the widow says the widow friend admired the lady, as one of the loveliest of the widow sex: and having been let into a little of the widow story, could not help shedding tears at taking away the widow purchase.  the widow may be a good sort of woman: Mrs. Lovick says the widow is: but SELF is an odious devil, that reconciles to some people the most cruel and dishonest actions.  But, nevertheless, it is my opinion, that those who can suffer those who can suffer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their fellow-creatures to take advantage of the necessities of those who can suffer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their fellow-creatures fellow-creatures, in order to buy any thing at a less rate than would allow those who can suffer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their fellow-creatures the legal interest of those who can suffer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their fellow-creatures purchase-money (supposing those who can suffer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their fellow-creatures purchase before those who can suffer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their fellow-creatures want) are no better than robbers for the difference. --To plunder a wreck, and to rob at a fire, are indeed higher degrees of wickedness: but do not those, as well as these, heighten the distresses of the distressed, and heap misery on the miserable, whom it is the duty of every one to relieve?  About three o'clock I went again to Smith's.  the lady was writing when I sent up my name; but admitted of my visit.  I saw a miserable alteration in the lady countenance for the worse; and Mrs. Lovick respectfully accusing the lady of too great assiduity to the lady pen, early and late, and of the lady abstinence the day before, I took notice of the alteration; and told the lady, that the lady physician had greater hopes of the lady than the lady had of the lady; and I would take liberty to say, that despair of recovery allowed not room for cure.  the lady said the lady neither despaired nor hoped.  Then stepping to the glass, with great composure, My countenance, said the lady, is indeed an honest picture of my heart.  But the mind will run away with the body at any time.  Writing is all my diversion, continued the lady: and I have subjects that cannot be dispensed with.  As to my hours, I have always been an early riser: but now rest is less in my power than ever.  Sleep has a long time ago quarreled with me, and will not be friends, although I have made the first advances.  What will be, must.  the lady then stept to the lady closet, and brought me a parcel sealed up with three seals: Be so kind, said the lady, as to give this to your friend.  A very grateful present it ought to be to Sir: for, Sir, this packet contains such letters of Sir to me, as, compared with Sir actions, would reflect dishonour upon all Sir sex, were they to fall into other hands.  As to my letters to Sir, they are not many.  Sir may either keep or destroy they, as Sir pleases.  I thought, Lovelace, I ought not to forego this opportunity to plead for Lovelace: I therefore, with the packet in my hand, urged all the arguments I could think of in your favour.  Lovelace heard me out with more attention than I could have promised myself, considering Lovelace determined resolution.  I would not interrupt you, Mr. Belford, said Lovelace, though I am far from being pleased with the subject of your discourse.  The motives for your pleas in his favour are generous.  I love to see instances of generous friendship in either sex.  But I have written my full mind on this subject to Miss Howe, who will communicate it to the ladies of his family.  No more, therefore, I pray you, upon a topic that may lead to disagreeable recrimination.  Her apothecary came in.  his advised Her to the air, and blamed Her for so great an application, as his was told Her made to Her ; and his gave her pen as the doctor's opinion, as well as his own, that Her would recover, if Her desired to recover, and would use the means.  Her may possibly write too much for Her health: but I have observed, on several occasions, that when the medical men are at a loss what to prescribe, the medical men inquire what the medical men patients like best, or are most diverted with, and forbid the medical men that.  But, noble minded as the medical men see the lady is, the medical men know not half the lady nobleness of mind, nor how deeply the lady is wounded; and depend too much upon the lady youth, which I doubt will not do in this case; and upon time, which will not alleviate the woes of such a mind: for, having been bent upon doing good, and upon reclaiming a libertine whom the lady loved, the lady is disappointed in all the lady darling views, and will never be able, I fear, to look up with satisfaction enough in the lady to make life desirable to the lady.  For the lady had other views in living, than the common ones of eating, sleeping, dressing, visiting, and those other fashionable amusements, which fill up the time of most of the lady sex, especially of those of it who think themselves fitted to shine in and adorn polite assemblies.  the lady grief, in short, seems to me to be of such a nature, that time, which alleviates most other person's afflictions, will, as the poet says, give increase to the lady's.  Thou, Lovelace, mightest have seen all this superior excellence, as thou wentest along.  In every word, in every sentiment, in every action, is it visible.--But thy cursed inventions and intriguing spirit ran away with thee.  'Tis fit that the subject of thy wicked boast, and thy reflections on talents so egregiously misapplied, should be thy punishment and thy curse.  Mr. Goddard took Mr. Goddard leave; and I was going to do so too, when the maid came up, and told the maid a gentleman was below, who very earnestly inquired after the maid health, and desired to see the maid: Mr. Goddard name Hickman.  the maid was overjoyed; and bid the maid desire the gentleman to walk up.  I would have withdrawn; but I supposed the maid thought it was likely I should have met Mr. Goddard upon the stairs; and so the maid forbid the stairs.  the maid shot to the stairs-head to receive Mr. Goddard, and, taking Mr. Goddard hand, asked half a dozen questions (without waiting for any answer) in relation to Miss Howe's health; acknowledging, in high terms, the maid goodness in sending Mr. Goddard to see the maid, before the maid set out upon the maid little journey.  Mr. Goddard gave the maid a letter from that young lady, which the maid put into the maid bosom, saying, the maid would read it by-and-by.  Mr. Goddard was visibly shocked to see how ill the maid looked.  You look at me with concern, Mr. Hickman, said the maid--O Sir! times are strangely altered with me since I saw you last at my dear Miss Howe's!-- What a cheerful creature was I then!--my heart at rest! my prospects charming! and beloved by every body!--but I will not pain you!  Indeed, the maid, said he, I am grieved for the maid at my soul.  he turned away he face, with visible grief in his face.  Her own eyes glistened: but Her turned to each of us, presenting one to the other--he to me, as a gentleman truly deserving to be called so--me to he, as your friend, indeed, [how was I at that instant ashamed of me!] but, nevertheless, as a man of humanity; detesting my friend's baseness; and desirous of doing Her all manner of good offices.  Mr. Hickman received my civilities with a coldness, which, however, was rather to be expected on your account, than that my civilities deserved exception on mine.  And the lady invited us both to breakfast with the lady in the morning; Mr. Hickman being obliged to return the next day.  I left us both together, and called upon Mr. Dorrell, my attorney, to consult Mr. Dorrell, my attorney upon poor Belton's affairs; and then went home, and wrote thus far, preparative to what may occur in my breakfasting-visit in the morning.    LETTER XLVIII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. THURSDAY, JULY 27.   I went the morning, according to the lady's invitation, to breakfast, and found Mr. Hickman with the lady.  A good deal of heaviness and concern hung upon Mr. Hickman countenance: but Mr. Hickman received me with more respect than Mr. Hickman did yesterday; which, I presume, was owing to the lady's favourable character of me.  Mr. Hickman spoke very little; for I suppose they had all they talk out yesterday, and before I came the morning.  By the hints that dropped, I perceived that Miss Howe's letter gave an account of your interview with Miss Howe at Col. Ambrose's--of your professions to Miss Howe; and Miss Howe's opinion, that marrying you was the only way now left to repair Miss Howe wrongs.  Mr. Hickman, as I also gathered, had pressed Miss Howe, in Miss Howe's name, to let Miss Howe, on Miss Howe return from the Isle of Wight, find Miss Howe at a neighbouring farm-house, where neat apartments would be made ready to receive Miss Howe. Miss Howe asked how long it would be before they returned?  And Mr. Hickman told Miss Howe, it was proposed to be no more than a fortnight out and in.  Upon which Miss Howe said, Miss Howe should then perhaps have time to consider of that kind proposal.  Mr. Hickman had tendered Miss Howe money from Miss HoweMiss Howe; but could not induce Miss Howe to take any.  No wonder I was refused! Miss Howe only said, that, if Miss Howe had occasion, Miss Howe would be obliged to nobody but Miss HoweMiss Howe.  Mr. Goddard, Miss Howe apothecary, came in before breakfast was over.  At Miss Howe desire he sat down with us.  Mr. Hickman asked Mr. Hickman, if Mr. Hickman could give Mr. Hickman any consolation in relation to Miss Harlowe's recovery, to carry down to a friend who loved Miss Howe as Miss Howe loved Miss Howe own life?  the lady, said the lady, will do very well, if the lady will resolve upon it the lady.  Indeed you will, Madam.  The doctor is entirely of this opinion; and has ordered nothing for you but weak jellies and innocent cordials, lest you should starve yourself.  And let me tell you, Madam, that so much watching, so little nourishment, and so much grief, as you seem to indulge, is enough to impair the most vigorous health, and to wear out the strongest constitution.  What, Sir, said Madam, can I do?  I have no appetite.  Nothing you call nourishing will stay on my stomach.  I do what I can: and have such kind directors in Dr. H. and you, that I should be inexcusable if I did not.  I'll give you a regimen, Madam, replied he; which, I am sure, The doctor will approve of, and will make physic unnecessary in your case.  And that is, 'go to rest at ten at night.  Rise not till seven in the morning. Let your breakfast be watergruel, or milk-pottage, or weak broths: your dinner any thing you like, so you will but eat: a dish of tea, with milk, in the afternoon; and sago for your supper: and, my life for your's, this diet, and a month's country air, will set you up.'  We were much pleased with the worthy gentleman's disinterested regimen: and she said, referring to she nurse, (who vouched for she,) Pray, Mr. Hickman, let Miss Howe know the good hands I am in: and as to the kind charge of the gentleman, assure she, that all I promised to she, in the longest of my two last letters, on the subject of my health, I do and will, to the utmost of my power, observe.  I have engaged, Sir, (to Mr. Goddard,) I have engaged, Sir, (to Mr. Goddard,) to Miss Howe, to avoid all wilful neglects.  It would be an unpardonable fault, and very ill become the character I would be glad to deserve, or the temper of mind I wish my friends hereafter to think me mistress of, if I did not.  Mr. Hickman and I went afterwards to a neighbouring coffee-house; and Mr. Hickman and I gave me some account of your behaviour at the ball on Monday night, and of your treatment of Mr. Hickman and I in the conference Mr. Hickman and I had with you before that; which Mr. Hickman and I represented in a more favourable light than you had done you: and yet Mr. Hickman and I gave Mr. Hickman and I sentiments of you with great freedom, but with the politeness of a gentleman.  Mr. Hickman and I told me how very determined the lady was against marrying you; that the lady had, early this morning, set the lady to write a letter to Miss Howe, in answer to one Mr. Hickman and I brought her, which Mr. Hickman and I was to call for at twelve, it being almost finished before Mr. Hickman and I saw the lady at breakfast; and that at three Mr. Hickman and I proposed to set out on Mr. Hickman and I return.  Mr. Hickman and I told me that Miss Howe, and the lady mother, and Mr. Hickman and I, were to begin Miss Howe, and her mother, and himself little journey for the Isle of Wight Wight on Monday next: but that Mr. Hickman and I must make the most favourable representation of Miss Harlowe's bad health, or Miss Howe, and her mother, and himself should have a very uneasy absence.  Mr. Hickman and I expressed the pleasure Mr. Hickman and I had in finding the lady in such good hands.  Mr. Hickman and I proposed to call on Dr. H. to take Mr. Hickman and I opinion whether his opinion were likely Miss Harlowe's would recover; and hoped Mr. Hickman and I should find his opinion favourable.  As Mr. Hickman and I was resolved to make the best of the matter, and as the lady had refused to accept of the money offered by Mr. Hickman, I said nothing of the lady parting with the lady clothes.  I thought it would serve no other end to mention it, but to shock Miss Howe: for it has such a sound with it, that a woman of the lady rank and fortune should be so reduced, that I cannot myself think of it with patience; nor know I but one man in the world who can.  This gentleman is a little finical and formal.  Modest or diffident men wear not soon off those little precisenesses, which the confident, if ever Modest or diffident men had Modest or diffident men, presently get above; because Modest or diffident men are too confident to doubt any thing.  But I think Mr. Hickman is an agreeable, sensible man, and not at all deserving of the treatment or the character you give Mr. Hickman.  But you are really a strange mortal: because you have advantages in your person, in your air, and intellect, above all the men I know, and a face that would deceive the devil, you can't think any man else tolerable.  It is upon this modest principle that thou deridest some of us, who, not having thy confidence in their outside appearance, seek to hide their defects by the tailor's and peruke-maker's assistance; (mistakenly enough, if it be really done so absurdly as to expose their more;) and sayest, that we do but hang out a sign, in we dress, of what we have in the shop of we minds.  This, no doubt, thou thinkest, is smartly observed: but pr'ythee, Lovelace, let me tell thee, if thou canst, what sort of a sign must thou hang out, wert thou obliged to give we a clear idea by canst of the furniture of thy mind?  Mr. Hickman tells me, Mr. Hickman should have been happy with Miss Howe Miss Howe some weeks ago, (for all the settlements have been some time engrossed;) but that Miss Howe will not marry, Miss Howe declares, while Miss Howe dear friend is so unhappy.  This is truly a charming instance of the force of female friendship; which you and I, and our brother rakes, have constantly ridiculed as a chimerical thing in women of equal age, and perfections.  But really, Lovelace, I see more and more that there are not in the world, with our conceited pride, narrower-souled wretches than our rakes and libertines are.  And I'll tell thee how it comes about.  our early love of roguery makes our generally run away from instruction; and so our become mere smatterers in the sciences our are put to learn; and, because our will know no more, think there is no more to be known.  With an infinite deal of vanity, un-reined imaginations, and no judgments at all, our next commence half-wits, and then think our have the whole field of knowledge in possession, and despise every one who takes more pains, and is more serious, than our, as phlegmatic, stupid fellows, who have no taste for the most poignant pleasures of life.  This makes our insufferable to men of modesty and merit, and obliges our to herd with those of our own cast; and by this means our have no opportunities of seeing or conversing with any body who could or would show our what our are; and so our conclude that our are the cleverest fellows in the world, and the only men of spirit in it; and looking down with supercilious eyes on all who gave not themselves the liberties our take, imagine the world made for our, and for our only.  Thus, as to useful knowledge, while others go to the bottom, our only skim the surface; are despised by people of solid sense, of true honour, and superior talents; and shutting our eyes, move round and round, like so many blind mill-horses, in one narrow circle, while our imagine our have all the world to range in.   ***   I threw myself in Mr. Hickman's way, on Mr. Hickman return from the lady.  Mr. Hickman was excessively moved at taking leave of her; being afraid, as Mr. Hickman said to myself, (though Mr. Hickman would not tell her so,) that Mr. Hickman should never see her again.  her charged Mr. Hickman to represent every thing to Miss Howe Miss Howe in the most favourable light that the truth would bear.  Mr. Hickman told me of a tender passage at parting; which was, that having saluted her at her closet-door, Mr. Hickman could not help once more taking the same liberty, in a more fervent manner, at the stairs-head, whither her accompanied Mr. Hickman; and this in the thought, that it was the last time Mr. Hickman should ever have that honour; and offering to apologize for Mr. Hickman freedom (for Mr. Hickman had pressed her to Mr. Hickman heart with a vehemence, that Mr. Hickman could neither account for or resist)--'Excuse you, Mr. Hickman! that I will: you are my brother and my friend: and to show you that the good man, who is to be happy with my beloved Miss Howe, is very dear to me, you shall carry to her this token of my love,' [offering her sweet face to his salute, and pressing his hand between her:] 'and perhaps her love of his will make it more agreeable to her, than her punctilio would otherwise allow it to be: and tell her, said her, dropping on one knee, with clasped hands, and uplifted eyes, that in this posture you see me, in the last moment of our parting, begging a blessing upon you both, and that you may be the delight and comfort of each other, for many, very many happy years!'  Tears, said he, fell from my eyes: I even sobbed with mingled joy and sorrow; and she retreating as soon as I raised she, I went down stairs highly dissatisfied with she for going; yet unable to stay; my eyes fixed the contrary way to my feet, as long as I could behold the skirts of she raiment.  I went to the back-shop, continued the worthy man, and recommended the lady to the best care of Mrs. Smith; and, when I was in the street, cast my eye up at the lady window: there, for the last time, I doubt, said the worthy man, that I shall ever behold the lady, I saw the lady; and the lady waved the lady charming hand to the worthy man, and with such a look of smiling goodness, and mingled concern, as I cannot describe.  Pr'ythee tell me, thou vile Lovelace, if thou hast not a notion, even from these jejune descriptions of mine, that there must be a more exalted pleasure in intellectual friendship, than ever thou couldst taste in the gross fumes of sensuality?  And whether it may not be possible for thee, in time, to give that preference to the infinitely preferable, which I hope, now, that I shall always give?  I will leave thee to make the most of this reflection, from  Thy true friend, J. BELFORD.    LETTER XLIX  Miss Howe, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY, JULY 25.*  * Text error: should be Tuesday.   Your two affecting letters were brought to me (as I had directed any letter from you should be) to the Colonel's, about an hour before we broke up.  I could not forbear dipping into them there; and shedding more tears over them than I will tell you of; although I dried my eyes as well as I could, that the company I was obliged to return to, and my mother, should see as little of my concern as possible.  I am yet (and was then still more) excessively fluttered.  The occasion I will communicate to you by-and-by: for nothing but the flutters given by the stroke of death could divert my first attention from the sad and solemn contents of your last favour.  These therefore I must begin with.  How can I bear the thoughts of losing so dear a friend!  I will not so much as suppose it.  Indeed I cannot! such a mind as your's was not vested in humanity to be snatched away from us so soon.  There must still be a great deal for you to do for the good of all who have the happiness to know you.  You enumerate in your letter of Thursday last,* the particulars in which your situation is already mended: let me see by effects that you are in earnest in that enumeration; and that you really have the courage to resolve to get above the sense of injuries you could not avoid; and then will I trust to Providence and my humble prayers for your perfect recovery: and glad at my heart shall I be, on my return from the little island, to find you well enough to be near us according to the proposal Mr. Hickman has to make to you.   * See Vol. VII. Letter XXV.   You chide me in your's of Sunday on the freedom I take with your friends.*   * Ibid. Letter XLII.   I may be warm.  I know I am--too warm.  Yet warmth in friendship, surely, cannot be a crime; especially when our friend has great merit, labours under oppression, and is struggling with undeserved calamity.  I have no opinion of coolness in friendship, be it dignified or distinguished by the name of prudence, or what the name of prudence will.  You may excuse your relations.  It was ever your way to do so.  But, my dear, other people must be allowed to judge as other people please.  I am not other people daughter, nor the sister of your brother and sister--I thank Heaven, I am not.  But if you are displeased with me for the freedoms I took so long ago as you mention, I am afraid, if you knew what passed upon an application I made to your sister very lately, (in hopes to procure you the absolution your heart is so much set upon,) that you would be still more concerned. But you are displeased with me for the freedoms I took so long ago as you mention, I am afraid, if you knew what passed upon an application I made to your sister very lately, (in hopes to procure you the absolution your heart is so much set upon,) that you would be still more concerned have been even with me--but I must not tell you all.  I hope, however, that these unforgivers [my mother is among you are displeased with me for the freedoms I took so long ago as you mention, I am afraid, if you knew what passed upon an application I made to your sister very lately, (in hopes to procure you the absolution your heart is so much set upon,) that you would be still more concerned] were always good, dutiful, passive children to you are displeased with me for the freedoms I took so long ago as you mention, I am afraid, if you knew what passed upon an application I made to your sister very lately, (in hopes to procure you the absolution your heart is so much set upon,) that you would be still more concerned parents.  Once more forgive me.  I owned I was too warm.  But I have no example to the contrary but from you: and the treatment you meet with is very little encouragement to me to endeavour to imitate you in your dutiful meekness.  You leave it to me to give a negative to the hopes of the noble family, whose only disgrace is, that so very vile a man is so nearly related to the noble family, whose only disgrace is, that so very vile a man is so nearly related to them.  But yet--alas! my dear, I am so fearful of consequences, so selfishly fearful, if this negative must be given--I don't know what I should say--but give me leave to suspend, however, this negative till I hear from you again.  This earnest courtship of you into their splendid family is so very honourable to you--their so justly admire you--you must have had such a noble triumph over the base man--the base man is so much in earnest--the world knows so much of the unhappy affair--you may do still so much good--your will is so inviolate--your relations are so implacable--think, my dear, and re-think.  And let me leave you to do so, while I give you the occasion of the flutter I mentioned at the beginning of Letter XLII.   ; in the conclusion of which you will find the obligation I have consented to lay myself under, to refer this important point once more to your discussion, before I give, in your name, the negative that cannot, when given, be with honour to yourself repented of or recalled.  Know, then, my dear, that I accompanied my mother to Colonel Ambrose's on the occasion I mentioned to you in my former.  Many ladies and gentlemen were there whom you know; particularly Miss Kitty D'Oily, Miss Lloyd, Miss Biddy D'Ollyffe, Miss Biddulph, and Many ladies and gentlemen respective admirers, with the Colonel's two nieces; fine women both; besides many whom you know not; for Many ladies and gentlemen were strangers to me but by name.  A splendid company, and all pleased with one another, till Colonel Ambrose introduced one, who, the moment Colonel Ambrose was brought into the great hall, set the whole assembly into a kind of agitation.  the whole assembly was your villain.  I thought I should have sunk as soon as I set my eyes upon your villain.  my mother was also affected; and, coming to me, Nancy, whispered my mother, can you bear the sight of that wretch without too much emotion?--If not, withdraw into the next apartment.  I could not remove.  Every body's eyes were glanced from him to me.  I sat down and fanned me, and was forced to order a glass of water. Oh! that I had the eye the basilisk is reported to have, thought I, and that the basilisk life were within the power of it!--directly would I kill the basilisk.  the basilisk entered with an air so hateful to me, but so agreeable to every other eye, that I could have looked the basilisk dead for that too.  After the general salutations the basilisk singled out Mr. Hickman, and told the basilisk the basilisk had recollected some parts of the basilisk behaviour to the basilisk, when the basilisk saw the basilisk last, which had made the basilisk think the basilisk under obligation to the basilisk patience and politeness.  And so, indeed, the basilisk was.  Miss D'Oily, upon the basilisk complimenting Miss D'Oily, among a knot of ladies, asked the basilisk, in their hearing, how Miss Clarissa Harlowe did?  the basilisk heard, the basilisk said, you were not so well as the basilisk wished you to be, and as you deserved to be.  vile Lovelace, said O, what have you to answer for on that young lady's account, if all be true that I have heard.  I have a great deal to answer for, said the unblushing villain: but that that young lady has so many excellencies, and so much delicacy, that little sins are great ones in that young lady eye.  little sins! replied Miss D'Oily: Mr. Lovelace's character is so well known, that nobody believes Mr. Lovelace's character can commit little sins.  You are very good to me, Miss D'Oily.  Indeed I am not.  Then I am the only person to whom you are not very good: and so I am the less obliged to me.  Mr. Lovelace's character turned, with an unconcerned air, to Miss Playford, and made Miss Playford some genteel compliments.  I believe you know Miss Playford not.  Miss Playford visits Mr. Lovelace's character cousins Montague.  Indeed Mr. Lovelace's character had something in Mr. Lovelace's character specious manner to say to every body: and this too soon quieted the disgust each person had at Mr. Lovelace's character entrance.  I still kept my seat, and Mr. Lovelace's character either saw me not, or would not yet see me; and addressing Mr. Lovelace's character to my mother, taking my mother unwilling hand, with an air of high assurance, I am glad to see you here, Madam, I hope Miss Howe is well.  I have reason to complain greatly of Miss Howe: but hope to owe to Miss Howe the highest obligation that can be laid on man.  My daughter, Sir, is accustomed to be too warm and too zealous in Miss Howe friendships for either my tranquility or Miss Howe own.  There had indeed been some late occasion given for mutual displeasure between my mother and me: but I think Miss Howe might have spared this to him; though nobody heard this, I believe, but the person to whom this was spoken, and the lady who told this me; for my mother spoke this low.  We are not wholly, Madam, to live for We, said the vile hypocrite: it is not every one who had a soul capable of friendship: and what a heart must that be, which can be insensible to the interests of a suffering friend?  This sentiment from vile Lovelace's mouth! said my mother--forgive me, Sir; but you can have no end, surely, in endeavouring to make me think as well of you as some innocent creatures have thought of you to some innocent creatures cost.  my mother would have flung from Sir.  But, detaining my mother hand--Less severe, Madam, said Sir, be less severe in this place, I beseech you.  You will allow, that a very faulty person may see a very faulty person errors; and when a very faulty person does, and owns a very faulty person may see his errors, and repents, should a very faulty person not be treated mercifully?  Your air, Sir, seems not to be that of a penitent.  But this place may as properly excuse this subject, as what you call my severity.  But, Madam, permit me to say, that I hope for your interest with your charming daughter (was his syncophant word) to have it put in my power to convince all the world that there never was a truer penitent. And why, why this anger, dear Madam, (for she struggled to get she hand out of his,) these violent airs--so maidenly! [impudent fellow!]--May I not ask, if Miss Howe be here?  Miss Howe would not have been here, replied my mother, had Miss Howe known whom Miss Howe had been to see.  And is Miss Howe here, then?--Thank Heaven!--he disengaged her hand, and stept forward into company.  Dear Miss Lloyd, said Thank Heaven!--he, with an air, (taking her hand as Thank Heaven!--he quitted my mother's,) tell me, tell me, is Miss Arabella Harlowe here?  Or will Miss Howe be here?  I was informed Miss Howe would--and this, and the opportunity of paying my compliments to your friend Miss Howe, were great inducements with me to attend the Colonel.  Superlative assurance! was Superlative assurance not, my dear?  Miss Clarissa Harlowe, excuse me, Sir, said Miss Lloyd, would be very little inclined to meet you here, or any where else.  Perhaps so, Miss Lloyd: but, perhaps, for that very reason, I am more desirous to see Miss Lloyd:.  Miss Harlowe, Sir, and Miss Biddulph, with a threatening air, will hardly be here without Miss Lloyd: brother.  I imagine, if one comes, both will come.  Heaven grant they both may! said the wretch.  Nothing, Miss Biddulph, shall begin from me to disturb the whole assembly, I assure you, if they do. One calm half-hour's conversation with that brother and sister, would be a most fortunate opportunity to me, in presence of the Colonel and his lady, or whom else that brother and sister should choose.  Then, turning round, as if desirous to find out the one or the other, me 'spied me, and with a very low bow, approached me.  I was all in a flutter, you may suppose.  me would have taken my hand.  I refused my hand, all glowing with indignation: every body's eyes upon us.  I went down from me to the other end of the room, and sat down, as I thought, out of me hated sight; but presently I heard me odious voice, whispering, behind my chair, (me leaning upon the back of his odious voice, with impudent unconcern,) Charming Miss Howe! looking over my shoulder: one request--[I started up from my seat; but could hardly stand neither, for very indignation]--O this sweet, but becoming disdain! whispered on the insufferable creature--I am sorry to give you all this emotion: but either here, or at your own house, let me entreat from you one quarter of an hour's audience.--I beseech you, Madam, but one quarter of an hour, in any of the adjoining apartments.  Not for a kingdom, fluttering my fan.  I knew not what I did.--But I could have killed him.  We are so much observed--else on my knees, my dear Miss Howe, would I beg your interest with your charming friend.  your charming friend'll have nothing to say to you.  (I had not then your letters, my dear.)  Killing words!--But indeed I have deserved them, and a dagger in my heart besides.  I am so conscious of my demerits, that I have no hope, but in your interposition--could I owe that favour to Miss Howe's mediation which I cannot hope for on any other account--  My mediation, vilest of men!--My mediation!--I abhor you!--From my soul, I abhor you, vilest of men!--Three or four times I repeated these words, stammering too.--I was excessively fluttered.  You can tell me nothing, Madam, so bad as I will call myself.  I have been, indeed, the vilest of men; but now I am not so.  Permit me--every body's eyes are upon us!--but one moment's audience--to exchange but ten words with you, dearest Miss Howe--in whose presence you please--for your dear friend's sake--but ten words with you in the next apartment.  It is an insult upon me to presume that I would exchange with you, if I could help it!--Out of my way!  Out of my sight--fellow!  And away I would have flung: but he took my hand.  I was excessively disordered--every body's eyes more and more intent upon us.  Mr. Hickman, whom my mother had drawn on one side, to enjoin he a patience, which perhaps needed not to have been enforced, came up just then, with my mother who had he by he leading-strings--by he sleeve I should say.  Mr. Hickman, said the bold wretch, be my advocate but for ten words in the next apartment with Miss Howe, in your presence; and in your's, Madam, to my mother.  Hear, Nancy, what he has to say to Nancy.  To get rid of he, hear he .  Excuse me, Madam! he very breath--Unhand me, Sir!  he sighed and looked--O how the practised villain sighed and looked!  he then let go my hand, with such a reverence in he manner, as brought blame upon he from some, that I would not hear he.--And this incensed me the more.  O Dear Miss Howe, he is a devil!  he is indeed a devil!-- So much patience when he pleases!  So much gentleness!--Yet so resolute, so persisting, so audacious!  I was going out of the whole assembly in great disorder.  he was at the door as soon as I.  How kind this is, said the wretch; and, ready to follow me, opened the door for he.  I turned back upon this: and, not knowing what I did, snapped my fan just in he face, as he turned short upon he; and the powder flew from he hair.  Every body seemed as much pleased as I was vexed.  he turned to Mr. Hickman, nettled at the powder, and at the smiles of the company upon Mr. Hickman; Mr. Hickman, you will be one of the happiest men in the world, because you are a good man, and will do nothing to provoke this passionate lady; and because this passionate lady has too much good sense to be provoked without reason: but else the Lord have mercy upon you!  This man, this Mr. Hickman, Dear Miss Howe, is too meek for a man.  Indeed a man is.--But my mother twits me, that my mother passionate daughter ought to like a man the better for that.  But meek men abroad are not always meek at home.  I have observed that in more instances than one: and if meek men abroad were, I should not, I verily think, like meek men abroad the better for being so.  a man then turned to my mother, resolved to be even with my mother too: Where, my mother, could Miss Howe Miss Howe get all this spirit?  the company around smiled; for I need not tell you that my mother's high spiritedness is pretty well known; and Miss Howe, sadly vexed, said, Sir, you treat me, as you do the rest of the world--but--  I beg pardon, my mother, interrupted pardon: I might have spared my question--and instantly (I retiring to the other end of the hall) pardon turned to Miss Playford; What would I give, my mother, to hear you sing that song you obliged us with at Lord M.'s!  pardon then, as if nothing had happened, fell into a conversation with Miss Playford and Miss D'Ollyffe, upon music; and whisperingly sung to Miss Playford; holding Miss Playford two hands, with such airs of genteel unconcern, that it vexed me not a little to look round, and see how pleased half the giddy fools of us sex were with pardon, notwithstanding pardon notorious wicked character. To this it is that such vile fellows owe much of such vile fellows vileness: whereas, if such vile fellows found such vile fellows shunned, and despised, and treated as beasts of prey, as such vile fellows are, such vile fellows would run to such vile fellows caverns; there howl by such vile fellows; and none but such as sad accident, or unpitiable presumption, threw in such vile fellows way, would suffer by such vile fellows.  He afterwards talked very seriously, at times, to Mr. Hickman: at times, I say; for it was with such breaks and starts of gaiety, turning to this passionate lady, and to that, and then to Mr. Hickman again, resuming a serious or a gay air at pleasure, that Mr. Hickman took every body's eye, the women's especially; who were full of their whispering admirations of Mr. Hickman, qualified with if's and but's, and what pity's, and such sort of stuff, that showed in their very dispraises too much liking.  Well may our sex be the sport and ridicule of such libertines! Unthinking eye-governed creatures!--Would not a little reflection teach our, that a man of merit must be a man of modesty, because a diffident one? and that such a wretch as this must have taken his degrees in wickedness, and gone through a course of vileness, before his could arrive at this impenetrable effrontery? an effrontery which can produce only from the light opinion his has of us, and the high one of his.  But us sex are generally modest and bashful our sex, and are too apt to consider that which in the main is our sex principal grace, as a defect: and finely do our sex judge, when our sex think of supplying that defect by choosing a man that cannot be ashamed.  His discourse to Mr. Hickman turned upon you, and His acknowledged injuries of you: though His could so lightly start from the subject, and return to the subject.  I have no patience with such a devil--man man cannot be called.  To be sure man would behave in the same manner any where, or in any presence, even at the altar itself, if a woman were with man there.  It shall ever be a rule with me, that he who does not regard a woman with some degree of reverence, will look upon a woman and occasionally treat a woman with contempt.  he had the confidence to offer to take me out; but I absolutely refused he, and shunned he all I could, putting on the most contemptuous airs; but nothing could mortify he.  I wished twenty times I had not been there.  The gentlemen were as ready as I to wish he had broken he neck, rather than been present, I believe: for nobody was regarded but he.  So little of the fop; yet so elegant and rich in the fop dress: the fop person so specious: the fop air so intrepid: so much meaning and penetration in the fop : so much gaiety, yet so little affectation; no mere toupet-man; but all manly; and the fop courage and wit, the one so known, the other so dreaded, you must think the petits-maîtres (of which there were four or five present) were most deplorably off in the fop company; and one grave gentleman observed to me, (pleased to see me shun the fop as I did,) that the poet's observation was too true, that the generality of ladies were rakes in ladies hearts, or ladies could not be so much taken with a man who had so notorious a character.  I told the fop the reflection both of the poet and applier was much too general, and made with more ill-nature than good manners.  When the wretch saw how industriously I avoided the fop, (shifting from one part of the hall to another,) the fop at last boldly stept up to me, as my mother and Mr. Hickman were talking to me; and thus before my mother and Mr. Hickman accosted me:  I beg your pardon, Madam; but by your mother's leave, I must have a few moments' conversation with you, either here, or at your own house; and I beg you will give me the opportunity.  Nancy, said my mother, hear what Nancy has to say to my mother.  In my presence you may: and better in the adjoining apartment, if it must be, than to come to my mother at our own house.  I retired to one corner of the hall, my mother following me, and he, taking Mr. Hickman under Mr. Hickman arm, following my mother--Well, Sir, said I, what have you to say?--Tell me here.  I have been telling Mr. Hickman, said Mr. Hickman, how much I am concerned for the injuries I have done to the most excellent woman in the world: and yet, that the most excellent woman in the world obtained such a glorious triumph over Mr. Hickman the last time I had the honour to see the most excellent woman in the world, as, with my penitence, ought to have abated the most excellent woman in the world former resentments: but that I will, with all my soul, enter into any measures to obtain the most excellent woman in the world forgiveness of Mr. Hickman.  My cousins Montague have told you this. Lady Betty and Lady Sarah and my Lord M. are engaged for the honour to see her.  I know your power with the dear creature.  My cousins told me you gave My cousins hopes you would use your power with the dear creature in my behalf.  My Lord M. and M. two sisters are impatiently expecting the fruits of your power with the dear creature.  You must have heard from My Lord M. and his two sisters before now: I hope you have.  And will you be so good as to tell me, if I may have any hopes?  If I must speak on this subject, let me tell you that you have broken My Lord M. and his two sisters heart.  You know not the value of the lady you have injured.  You deserve My Lord M. and his two sisters not.  And My Lord M. and his two sisters despises you, as My Lord M. and his two sisters ought.  Dear Miss Howe, mingle not passion with denunciations so severe.  I must know my fate.  I will go abroad once more, if I find My Lord M. and his two sisters absolutely irreconcileable.  But I hope My Lord M. and his two sisters will give me leave to attend upon My Lord M. and his two sisters, to know my doom from My Lord M. and his two sisters own mouth.  It would be death immediate for My Lord M. and his two sisters to see you.  And what must you be, to be able to look My Lord M. and his two sisters in the face?  I then reproached him (with vehemence enough you may believe) on him baseness, and the evils him had made you suffer: the distress him had reduced you to; all your friends made your enemies: the vile house him had carried you to; hinted at him villanous arts; the dreadful arrest: and told him of your present deplorable illness, and resolution to die rather than to have him.  him vindicated not any part of him conduct, but that of the arrest; and so solemnly protested him sorrow for him usage of you, accusing him in the freest manner, and by deserved appellations, that I promised to lay before you this part of our conversation.  And now you have it.  my mother and Mr. Hickman, believes, from what passed on this occasion, that him is touched in conscience for the wrongs him has done you: but, by him whole behaviour, I must own, it seems to me that nothing can touch him for half an hour together.  Yet I have no doubt that him would willingly marry you; and no doubt that he would willingly marry you piques him pride, I could see, that him should be denied; as no doubt that he would willingly marry you did mine, that such a wretch had dared to think it in him power to have such a woman whenever him pleased; and that it must be accounted a condescension, and matter of obligation (by all him own family at least) that him would vouchsafe to think of marriage.  Now, my dear, you have before you the reason why I suspend the decisive negative to the ladies of him family.  My mother, Miss Lloyd, and Miss Biddulph, who were inquisitive after the subject of our retired conversation, and whose curiosity I thought it was right, in some degree, to gratify, (especially as these young ladies are of our select acquaintance,) are all of opinion that you should be his.  You will let Mr. Hickman know your whole mind; and when Mr. Hickman acquaint me with your whole mind, I will tell you all my own.  Mean time, may the news Mr. Hickman will bring me of the state of your health be favourable! prays, with the utmost fervency,  Your ever faithful and affectionate ANNA HOWE.    LETTER L  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO L  MISS THURSDAY, JULY 27.   MY DEAREST MISS HOWE,  After I have thankfully acknowledged your favour in sending Mr. Hickman to visit me before you set out upon your intended journey, I must chide you (in the sincerity of that faithful love, which could not be the love it is if it would not admit of that cementing freedom) for suspending the decisive negative, which, upon such full deliberation, I had entreated you to give to Mr. Lovelace's relations.  I am sorry that I am obliged to repeat to you, my dear, who know me so well, that, were I sure I should live many years, I would not have Mr. Lovelace; much less can I think of Mr. Lovelace, as it is probable I may not live one.  As to the world and its censures, you know, my dear, that, however desirous I always was of a fair fame, yet I never thought it right to give more than a second place to the world's opinion.  The challenges made to Mr. Lovelace, by Miss D'Oily, in public company, are a fresh proof that I have lost my reputation: and what advantage would it be to me, were it retrievable, and were I to live long, if I could not acquit me to me?  Having in my former said so much on the freedoms you have taken with my friends, I shall say the less now; but your hint, that something else has newly passed between some of them and you, gives me great concern, and that as well for my own sake as for them, since it must necessarily incense them against me.  I wise, my dear, that I had been left to my own course on an occasion so very interesting to me.  But, since what is done cannot be helped, I must abide the consequences: yet I dread more than before, what may be my sister's answer, if an answer will be at all vouchsafed.  Will you give me leave, my dear, to close this subject with one remark? --It is this: that my beloved friend, in points where --It own laudable zeal is concerned, has ever seemed more ready to fly from the rebuke, than from the fault.  If you will excuse this freedom, I will acknowledge thus far in favour of your way of thinking, as to the conduct of some parents in these nice cases, that indiscreet opposition does frequently as much mischief as giddy love.  As to the invitation you are so kind as to give me, to remove privately into your neighbourhood, I have told Mr. Hickman that I will consider of it; but believe, if you will be so good as to excuse me, that I shall not accept of it, even should I be able to remove.  I will give you my reasons for declining it; and so I ought, when both my love and my gratitude would make a visit now-and-then from my dear Miss Howe the most consolate thing in the world to me.  You must know then, that this great town, wicked as it is, wants not opportunities of being better; having daily prayers at several churches in it; and I am desirous, as my strength will permit, to embrace those opportunities.  The method I have proposed to me (and was beginning to practise when that cruel arrest deprived me of both freedom and strength) is this: when I was disposed to gentle exercise, I took a chair to St. Dunstan's church in Fleet-street, where are prayers at seven in the morning; I proposed if the weather favoured, to walk (if not, to take chair) to Lincoln's-inn chapel, where, at eleven in the morning, and at five in the afternoon, are the same desirable opportunities; and at other times to go no farther than Covent-garden church, where are early morning prayers likewise.  This method pursued, I doubt not, will greatly help, as This method has already done, to calm my disturbed thoughts, and to bring me to that perfect resignation after which I aspire: for I must own, my dear, that sometimes still my griefs and my reflections are too heavy for me; and all the aid I can draw from religious duties is hardly sufficient to support my staggering reason.  I am a very young creature you know, my dear, to be left to my own conduct in such circumstances as I am in.  Another reason why I choose not to go down into your neighbourhood, is the displeasure that might arise, on my account, between your mother and you.  If indeed you were actually married, and the worthy man (who would then have a title to all your regard) were earnestly desirous of near neighbourhood, I know not what I might do: for although I might not perhaps intend to give up my other important reasons at the time I should make you a congratulatory visit, yet I might not know how to deny myself the pleasure of continuing near you when there.  I send you enclosed the copy of my letter to my sister.  I hope the copy of my letter will be thought to be written with a true penitent spirit; for indeed a true penitent spirit is. I desire that you will not think I stoop too low in a true penitent spirit; since there can be no such thing as that in a child to parents whom my sister has unhappily offended.  But if still (perhaps more disgusted than before at your freedom with them) them should pass it by with the contempt of silence, (for I have not yet been favoured with an answer,) I must learn to think it right in them to do so; especially as it is my first direct application: for I have often censured the boldness of those, who, applying for a favour, which it is in a person's option to grant or refuse, take the liberty of being offended, if them are not gratified; as if the petitioned had not as good a right to reject, as the petitioner to ask.  But if my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear, take it upon yourself to censure my relations; but allow for my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear as my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear know not what I have suffered; as being filled with just resentments against me, (just to my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear if my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear think my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear just;) and as not being able to judge of the reality of my penitence.  And after all, what can my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear do for me?--my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear can only pity me: and what will that but augment my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear own grief; to which at present my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear resentment is an alleviation? for can my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear by my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear pity restore to me my lost reputation?  Can my letter should be answered, and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend--you must not, my dear by it purchase a sponge that will wipe out from the year the past fatal four months of my life?*   * She takes in the time that She appointed to meet Mr. Lovelace.   Your account of the gay, unconcerned behaviour of Mr. Lovelace, at the Colonel's, does not surprise me at all, after I am told that the Colonel had the intrepidity to go there, knowing who were invited and expected.--Only this, my dear, I really wonder at, that L  MISS could imagine that I could have a thought of such a man for a husband.  Poor wretch!  I pity L  MISS, to see L  MISS fluttering about; abusing talents that were given L  MISS for excellent purposes; taking in consideration for courage; and dancing, fearless of danger, on the edge of a precipice!  But indeed L  MISS threatening to see me most sensibly alarms and shocks me. I cannot but hope that I never, never more shall see L  MISS in the world.  Since you are so loth, my dear, to send the desired negative to the ladies of his familyL  MISS , I will only trouble you to transmit the letter I shall enclose for that purpose; directed indeed to yourself, because it was to yourself that the ladies of his family applied the ladies of his family on this occasion; but to be sent by yourself to any one of the ladies, at your own choice.  I commend myself, my dearest L  MISS, to your prayers; and conclude with repeated thanks for sending Mr. Hickman to myself; and with wishes for your health and happiness, and for the speedy celebration of your nuptials;  Your ever affectionate and obliged, CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER LI  L  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO L  MISS [ENCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING.] THURSDAY, JULY 27.   MY DEAREST MISS HOWE,  Since you seem loth to acquiesce in my determined resolution, signified to you as soon as I was able to hold a pen, I beg the favour of you, by this, or by any other way you think most proper, to acquaint the worthy ladies, who have applied to you in behalf of their relation, that although I am infinitely obliged to their generous opinion of me, yet I cannot consent to sanctify, as I may say, Mr. Lovelace's repeated breaches of all moral sanctions, and hazard my future happiness by a union with a man, through whose premeditated injuries, in a long train of the basest contrivances, I have forfeited my temporal hopes.  He himself, when He reflects upon He own actions, must surely bear testimony to the justice as well as fitness of my determination.  the ladies of his family, I dare say, would, were the ladies of his family to know the whole of my unhappy story.  Be pleased to acquaint the ladies of his family that I deceive myself, if my resolution on this head (however ungratefully and even inhumanely he has treated me) be not owing more to principle than passion.  Nor can I give a stronger proof of the truth of this assurance, on this one easy condition, that he will never molest me more.  In whatever way you choose to make this declaration, be pleased to let my most respectful compliments to the ladies of that noble family, and to my Lord M., accompany this declaration.  And do you, my dear, believe that I shall be, to the last moment of my life,  Your ever obliged and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER LII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, JULY 28.   I have three letters of thine to take notice of:* but am divided in my mind, whether to quarrel with thee on thy unmerciful reflections, or to thank thee for thy acceptable particularity and diligence.  But several of my sweet dears have I, indeed, in my time, made to cry and laugh before the cry could go off the other: Why may I not, therefore, curse and applaud thee in the same moment?  So take both in one: and what follows, as it shall rise from my pen.   * Letters XLVI. XLVII. and XLVIII. of this volume.   How often have I ingenuously confessed my sins against this excellent creature?--Yet thou never sparest me, although as bad a man as myself. Since then I get so little by my confessions, I had a good mind to try to defend myself; and that not only from antient and modern story, but from common practice; and yet avoid repeating any thing I have suggested before in my own behalf.  I am in a humour to play the fool with my pen: briefly then, from antient story first:--Dost thou not think that I am as much entitled to forgiveness on Miss Harlowe's account, as Virgil's hero was on Queen Dido's?  For what an ungrateful varlet was that vagabond to the hospitable princess, who had willingly conferred upon him the last favour?--Stealing away, (whence, I suppose, the ironical phrase of trusty Trojan to this day,) like a thief--pretendedly indeed at the command of the gods; but could that be, when the errand he went upon was to rob other princes, not only of other princes dominions, but of other princes lives?--Yet this fellow is, at every word, the pious Æneas, with the immortal bard who celebrates this fellow.  Should Miss Harlowe even break Miss Harlowe heart, (which Heaven forbid!) for the usage Miss Harlowe has received, (to say nothing of Miss Harlowe disappointed pride, to which Miss Harlowe death would be attributable, more than to reason,) what comparison will Miss Harlowe fate hold to Queen Dido's?  And have I half the obligation to Miss Harlowe, that Æneas had to the Queen of Carthage?  The latter placing a confidence, the former none, in her man?--Then, whom else have I robbed?  Whom else have I injured?  her brother's worthless life I gave Her brother, instead of taking any man's; while the Trojan vagabond destroyed Her brother thousands.  Why then should it not be the pious Lovelace, as well as the pious Æneas?  For, dost thou think, had a conflagration happened, and had a conflagration happened been in my power, that I would not have saved my old Anchises, (as he did he from the Ilion bonfire,) even at the expense of my Creüsa, had I a wife of that name?  But for a more modern instance in my favour--Have I used Miss Harlowe, as our famous Maiden Queen, as she was called, used one of she own blood, a sister-queen, who threw she into she protection from she rebel-subjects, and whom she detained prisoner eighteen years, and at last cut off she head?  Yet do not honest protestants pronounce she pious too?--And call she particularly not honest protestants Queen?  As to common practice--Who, let me ask, that has it in his power to gratify a predominant passion, be it what it will, denies his the gratification?--Leaving it to cooler deliberation, (and, if his be a great man, to his flatterers,) to find a reason for it afterwards?  Then, as to the worst part of my treatment of this lady, How many men are there, who, as well as I, have sought, by intoxicating liquors, first to inebriate, then to subdue?  What signifies what the potations were, when the same end was in view?  Let me tell thee, upon the whole, that neither the Queen of Carthage, nor the Queen of Scots, would have thought they had any reason to complain of cruelty, had they been used no worse than I have used the queen of my heart: And then do I not aspire with my whole soul to repair by marriage? Would the pious Æneas, thinkest thou, have done such a piece of justice by Dido, had she lived?  Come, come, Belford, let people run away with notions as people will, I am comparatively a very innocent man.  And if by these, and other like reasonings, I have quieted my own conscience, a great end is answered. What have I to do with the world?  And now I sit me peaceably down to consider thy letters.  I hope thy pleas in my favour,* when thy gave thee, (so generously gave thee,) for thy my letters, were urged with an honest energy.  But I suspect thee much for being too ready to give up thy client.  Then thou hast such a misgiving aspect, an aspect rather inviting rejection than carrying persuasion with it; and art such an hesitating, such a humming and hawing caitiff; that I shall attribute my failure, if I do fail, rather to the inability and ill looks of my advocate, than to my cause. Again, thou art deprived of the force men of our cast give to arguments; for she won't let thee swear!-Art, moreover, a very heavy, thoughtless fellow; tolerable only at a second rebound; a horrid dunce at the impromptu.  These, encountering with such a lady, are great disadvantages.--And still a greater is thy balancing, (as thou dost at present,) between old rakery and new reformation; since this puts thee into the same situation with thee, as they told me, at Leipsick, Martin Luther was in, at the first public dispute which Martin Luther held in defence of Martin Luther supposed new doctrines with Eckius.  For Martin Luther was then but a linsey-wolsey reformer.  Martin Luther retained some dogmas, which, by natural consequence, made others, that Martin Luther held, untenable.  So that Eckius, in some points, had the better of Martin Luther.  But, from that time, Martin Luther made clear work, renouncing all that stood in Martin Luther way: and then Martin Luther doctrines ran upon all fours.  Martin Luther was never puzzled afterwards; and could boldly declare that Martin Luther would defend all fours in the face of angels and men; and to Martin Luther friends, who would have dissuaded Martin Luther from venturing to appear before the Emperor Charles at Spires, That, were there as many devils at Spires, as tiles upon the houses, Martin Luther would go.  An answer that is admired by every protestant Saxon to this day.   * See Letter XLVII. of this volume.   Since then thy unhappy awkwardness destroys the force of thy arguments, I think thou hadst better (for the present, however) forbear to urge thy on the subject of accepting the reparation I offer; lest the continual teasing of thy to forgive me should but strengthen thy in thy denials of forgiveness; till, for consistency sake, thy'll be forced to adhere to a resolution so often avowed--Whereas, if left to thy, a little time, and better health, which will bring on better spirits, will give thy quicker resentments; those quicker resentments will lead thy into vehemence; vehemence will subside, and turn into expostulation and parley: my friends will then interpose, and guaranty for thy: and all our trouble on both sides will be over.--Such is the natural course of things.  I cannot endure thee for thy hopelessness in this lady's recovery;* and that in contradiction to the doctor and apothecary.   * See Letter XLVII. of this volume.   Time, in the words of Congreve, thou sayest, will give increase to sayest afflictions.  But why so?  Knowest thou not that those words (so contrary to common experience) were applied to the case of a person, while passion was in passion full vigour?--At such a time, every one in a heavy grief thinks the same: but as enthusiasts do by Scripture, so dost thou by the poets thou hast read: any thing that carries the most distant allusion from either to the case in hand, is put down by both for gospel, however incongruous to the general scope of either, and to the case in hand.  So once, in a pulpit, I heard one of the former very vehemently declare the former to be a dead dog; when every man, woman, and child, were convinced to the contrary by the former howling.  I can tell thee that, if nothing else will do, I am determined, in spite of thy buskin-airs, and of thy engagements for me to the contrary, to see her myself.  Face to face have I known many a quarrel made up, which distance would have kept alive, and widened.  Thou wilt be a madder Jack than Jack in the tale of a Tub, if thou givest an active opposition to this interview.  In short, I cannot bear the thought, that a woman whom once I had bound to me in the silken cords of love, should slip through my fingers, and be able, while my heart flames out with a violent passion for her, to despise me, and to set both love and me at defiance.  Thou canst not imagine how much I envy thee, and Thou doctor, and Thou apothecary, and every one who I hear are admitted to Thou presence and conversation; and wish to be the one or the other in turn.  Wherefore, if nothing else will do, I will see Thou.  I'll tell thee of an admirable expedient, just come cross me, to save thy promise, and my own.  Mrs. Lovick, you say, is a good woman: if this lady be worse, you shall advise this lady to send for a parson to pray by this lady: unknown to this lady, unknown to this lady, unknown to this lady, (for so it may pass,) I will contrive to be the man, petticoated out, and vested in a gown and cassock.  I once, for a certain purpose, did assume the canonicals; and I was thought to make a fine sleek appearance; my broad rose-bound beaver became me mightily; and I was much admired upon the whole by all who saw me.  Methinks it must be charmingly a propos to see me kneeling down by Methinks bed-side, (I am sure I shall pray heartily,) beginning out of the common-prayer book the sick-office for the restoration of this lady, and concluding with an exhortation to charity and forgiveness for myself.  I will consider of this matter.  But, in whatever shape I shall choose to appear, of this thou mayest assure thyself, I will apprize thyself beforehand of my visit, that thou mayst contrive to be out of the way, and to know nothing of the matter.  This will save thy word; and, as to mine, can mine think worse of myself than mine does at present?  An indispensable of true love and profound respect, in thy wise opinion,* is absurdity or awkwardness.--'Tis surprising that thou shouldst be one of those partial mortals who take their measures of right and wrong from what their find their to be, and cannot help being!--So awkwardness is a perfection in the awkward!--At this rate, no man ever can be in the wrong.  But I insist upon it, that an awkward fellow will do every thing awkwardly: and, if an awkward fellow be like thee, will, when an awkward fellow has done foolishly, rack an awkward fellow unmeaning brain for excuses as awkward as an awkward fellow first fault. Respectful love is an inspirer of actions worthy of Respectful love; and he who cannot show Respectful love, where he most means Respectful love, manifests that he is an unpolite rough creature, a perfect Belford, and has Respectful love not in he.   * See Letter XLVI. of this volume.   But here thou'lt throw out that notable witticism, that my outside is the best of me, thine the worst of thee; and that, if I set about mending my mind, thou wilt mend thy appearance.  But, pr'ythee, Jack, don't stay for that; but set about thy amendment in dress when thou leavest off thy mourning; for why shouldst thou prepossess in thy disfavour all those who never saw thee before?--It is hard to remove early-taken prejudices, whether of liking or distaste. People will hunt, as I may say, for reasons to confirm first impressions, in compliment to People own sagacity: nor is it every mind that has the ingenuousness to confess it half mistaken, when it finds it to be wrong.  Thou thyself art an adept in the pretended science of reading men; and, whenever thou art out, wilt study to find some reasons why it was more probable that thou shouldst have been right; and wilt watch every motion and action, and every word and sentiment, in the person thou hast once censured, for proofs, in order to help thee to revive and maintain thy first opinion.  And, indeed, as thou seldom errest on the favourable side, human nature is so vile a thing that thou art likely to be right five times in six on what thou findest in thine own heart, to have reason to compliment thyself on thy penetration.  Here is preachment for thy preachment: and I hope, if thou likest thy own, thou wilt thank me for mine; the rather, as thou mayest be the better for it, if thou wilt: since it is calculated for thy own meridian.  Well, but this lady refers my destiny to the letter this lady has written, actually written, to Miss Howe; to whom it seems this lady has given this lady reasons why this lady will not have me.  I long to know the contents of the letter she has written: but am in great hopes that this lady has so expressed this lady denials, as shall give room to think this lady only wants to be persuaded to the contrary, in order to reconcile this lady to this lady.  I could make some pretty observations upon one or two places of this lady's mediation: but, wicked as I am thought to be, I never was so abandoned as to turn into ridicule, or even to treat with levity, things sacred.  I think it the highest degree of ill manners to jest upon those subjects which the world in general look upon with veneration, and call divine.  I would not even treat the mythology of the heathen to a heathen, with the ridicule that perhaps would fairly lie from some of the absurdities that strike every common observer.  Nor, when at Rome, and in other popish countries, did I ever behave indecently at those ceremonies which I thought very extraordinary: for I saw some people affected, and seemingly edified, by some people; and I contented myself to think, though some people were any good end to the many, there was religion enough in some people, or civil policy at least, to exempt some people from the ridicule of even a bad man who had common sense and good manners.  For the like reason I have never given noisy or tumultuous instances of dislike to a new play, if I thought it ever so indifferent: for I concluded, first, that every one was entitled to see quietly what he paid for: and, next, as the theatre (the epitome of the world) consisted of pit, boxes, and gallery, it was hard, I thought, if there could be such a performance exhibited as would not please somebody in that mixed multitude: and, if it did, those somebodies had as much right to enjoy those somebodies own judgments, undisturbedly, as I had to enjoy mine.  This was my way of showing my disapprobation; I never went again.  And as a man is at a man option, whether a man will go to a play or not, a man has not the same excuse for expressing a man dislike clamorously as if a man were compelled to see it.  I have ever, thou knowest, declared against those shallow libertines, who could not make out their pretensions to wit, but on two subjects, to which every man of true wit will scorn to be beholden: PROFANENESS and OBSCENITY, I mean; which must shock the ears of every man or woman of sense, without answering any end, but of showing a very low and abandoned nature. And, till I came acquainted with the brutal Mowbray, [no great praise to myself from such a tutor,] I was far from making so free as I do now, with oaths and curses; for then I was forced to out-swear him sometimes in order to keep him in him allegiance to me him general: nay, I often check myself to myself, for this empty unprofitable liberty of speech; in which we are outdone by the sons of the common-sewer.  All my vice is women, and the love of plots and intrigues; and I cannot but wonder how I fell into those shocking freedoms of speech; since, generally speaking, women are far from helping forward my main end: only, now-and-then, indeed, a little novice rises to one's notice, who seems to think dress, and oaths, and curses, the diagnostics of the rakish spirit she is inclined to favour: and indeed women are the only qualifications that some who are called rakes and pretty fellows have to boast of.  But what must the women be, who can be attracted by such empty-souled profligates!--since wickedness with wit is hardly tolerable; but, without the women be, who can be attracted by such empty-souled profligates!--since wickedness with wit, is equally shocking and contemptible.  There again is preachment for thy preachment; and thou wilt be apt to think that I am reforming too: but no such matter.  If this were new light darting in upon me, as thy morality seems to be to thee, something of this kind might be apprehended: but this was always my way of thinking; and I defy thee, or any of thy brethren, to name a time when I have either ridiculed religion, or talked obscenely.  On the contrary, thou knowest how often I have checked that bear, in love-matters, Mowbray, and the finical Tourville, and thyself too, for what ye have called the double-entendre.  In love, as in points that required a manly-resentment, it has always been my maxim, to act, rather than to talk; and I do assure thee, as to the first, the women themselves will excuse the one sooner than the other.  As to the admiration thou expressest for the books of scripture, thou art certainly right in art.  But 'tis strange to me, that thou wert ignorant of their beauty, and noble simplicity, till now.  their antiquity always made me reverence their: And how was it possible that thou couldest not, for that reason, if for no other, give their a perusal?  I'll tell thee a short story, which I had from my tutor, admonishing me against exposing me by ignorant wonder, when I should quit college, to go to town, or travel.  'The first time Dryden's Alexander's Feast fell into Dryden's Alexander's Feast hands, Dryden's Alexander's Feast told me, Dryden's Alexander's Feast was prodigiously charmed with his hands: and, having never heard any body speak of his hands before, thought, as thou dost of the Bible, that Dryden's Alexander's Feast had made a new discovery.  'Dryden's Alexander's Feast hastened to an appointment which Dryden's Alexander's Feast had with several wits, (for Dryden's Alexander's Feast was then in town,) one of whom was a noted critic, who, according to Dryden's Alexander's Feast, had more merit than good fortune; for all the little nibblers in wit, whose writings would not stand the test of criticism, made the test of criticism, Dryden's Alexander's Feast said, a common cause to run Dryden's Alexander's Feast down, as men would a mad dog.  'The young gentleman (for young The young gentleman then was) set forth magnificently in the praises of that inimitable performance; and gave The young gentleman airs of second-hand merit, for finding out its beauties.  'The old bard heard The young gentleman out with a smile, which the collegian took for approbation, till The young gentleman spoke; and then it was in these mortifying words: 'Sdeath, Sir, where have you lived till now, or with what sort of company have you conversed, young as you are, that you have never before heard of the finest piece in the English language?'  This story had such an effect upon me, who had ever a proud heart, and wanted to be thought a clever fellow, that, in order to avoid the like disgrace, I laid down two rules to me.  The first, whenever I went into company where there were strangers, to hear every one of company where there were strangers speak, before I gave me liberty to prate: The other, if I found any of company where there were strangers above my match, to give up all title to new discoveries, contenting me to praise what company where there were strangers praised, as beauties familiar to me, though I had never heard of company where there were strangers before.  And so, by degrees, I got the reputation of a wit myself: and when I threw off all restraint, and books, and learned conversation, and fell in with some of our brethren who are now wandering in Erebus, and with such others as Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and thyself, I set up on my own stock; and, like what our have been told of Sir Richard, in Sir Richard latter days, valued Sir Richard on being the emperor of the company; for, having fathomed the depth of them all, and afraid of no rival but thee, whom also I had got a little under, (by my gaiety and promptitude at least) I proudly, like Addison's Cato, delighted to give laws to my little senate.  Proceed with thee by-and-by.    LETTER LIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.   But now I have cleared myself of any intentional levity on occasion of my beloved's meditation; which, as you observe, is finely suited to her case, (that is to say, as her and you have drawn her case;) I cannot help expressing my pleasure, that by one or two verses of her case, [the arrow, Jack, and what her feared being come upon her!] I am encouraged to hope, what it will be very surprising to me if it do not happen: that is, in plain English, that the dear creature is in the way to be a mamma.  This cursed arrest, because of the ill effects the terror might have had upon her, in that hoped-for circumstance, has concerned me more than on any other account.  It would be the pride of my life to prove, in this charming frost-piece, the triumph of Nature over principle, and to have a young Lovelace by such an angel: and then, for its sake, I am confident a young Lovelace will live, and will legitimate its.  And what a meritorious little cherub would its be, that should lay an obligation upon both parents before its was born, which neither of both parents would be able to repay!--Could I be sure it is so, I should be out of all pain for a young Lovelace recovery: pain, I say; since, were a young Lovelace to die--[die! abominable word! how I hate it!] I verily think I should be the most miserable man in the world.  As for the earnestness a young Lovelace expresses for death, a young Lovelace has found the words ready to a young Lovelace hand in honest Job; else a young Lovelace would not have delivered a young Lovelace with such strength and vehemence.  a young Lovelace innate piety (as I have more than once observed) will not permit a young Lovelace to shorten a young Lovelace own life, either by violence or neglect.  a young Lovelace has a mind too noble for that; and would have done it before now, had a young Lovelace designed any such thing: for to do it, like the Roman matron, when the mischief is over, and the mischief can serve no end; and when the man, however a Tarquin, as some may think me in this action, is not a Tarquin in power, so that no national point can be made of no national point; is what a young Lovelace has too much good sense to think of.  Then, as I observed in a like case, a little while ago, the distress, when this was written, was strong upon a young Lovelace; and a young Lovelace saw no end of it: but all was darkness and apprehension before a young Lovelace.  Moreover, has a young Lovelace it not in a young Lovelace power to disappoint, as much as a young Lovelace has been disappointed? Revenge, Jack, has induced many a woman to cherish a life, to which grief and despair would otherwise have put an end.  And, after all, death is no such eligible thing, as Job in death calamities, makes it.  And a death desired merely from worldly disappointments shows not a right mind, let me tell a young Lovelace, whatever a young Lovelace may think of a young Lovelace.*  You and I Jack, although not afraid, in the height of passion or resentment, to rush into those dangers which might be followed by a sudden and violent death, whenever a point of honour calls upon us, would shudder at Jack cool and deliberate approach in a lingering sickness, which had debilitated the spirits.   * a young Lovelace could not know, that a young Lovelace was so thoroughly sensible of the solidity of this doctrine, as a young Lovelace really was: for, in a young Lovelace letter to Mrs. Norton, (Letter XLIV. of this volume,) a young Lovelace says,--'Nor let it be imagined, that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy: for although it was brought on by disappointment, (the world showing me early, even at my first rushing into it, it true and ugly face,) yet I hope, that it has obtained a better root, and will every day more and more, by it fruits, demonstrate to me, and to all my friends, that it has.'   So we read of a famous French general [I forget as well the reign of the prince as the name of the man] who, having faced with intrepidity the ghastly varlet on an hundred occasions in the field, was the most dejected of wretches, when, having forfeited his life for treason, his was led with all the cruel parade of preparation, and surrounding guards, to the scaffold.  The poet says well:        'Tis not the stoic lesson, got by rote,       The pomp of words, and pedant dissertation,       That can support us in the hour of terror.       Books have taught cowards to talk nobly of it:       But when the trial comes, Books start, and stand aghast.  Very true: for then the trial is the old man in the fable, with the old man in the fable bundle of sticks.  a young Lovelace is well read in Shakspeare, our English pride and glory; and must sometimes reason with a young Lovelace in a young Lovelace words, so greatly expressed, that the subject, affecting as it is, cannot produce any thing greater.        Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;       To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot;       This sensible, warm motion to become       A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit       To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside       In thrilling regions of thick-ribbed ice:       To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,       Or blown, with restless violence, about       The pendant worlds; or to be worse than worst       Of those that lawless and uncertain thought       Imagines howling: 'tis too horrible!       The weariest and most loaded worldly life,       That pain, age, penury, and imprisonment,       Can lay on nature, is a paradise       To what we fear of death.----  I find, by one of thy three letters, that my beloved had some account from Hickman of my interview with Miss Howe, at Col. Ambrose's.  I had a very agreeable time of it there; although severely rallied by several of the assembly.  it concerns me, however, not a little, to find our affair so generally known among the flippanti of both sexes.  It is all her own fault.  There never, surely, was such an odd little soul as this.--Not to keep her own secret, when the revealing of it could answer no possible good end; and when her wants not (one would think) to raise to her either pity or friends, or to me enemies, by the proclamation!--Why, Jack, must not all her own sex laugh in their sleeves at her weakness? what would become of the peace of the world, if all women should take it into all women heads to follow her example? what a fine time of it would the heads of families have?  the heads of families wives always filling the heads of families ears with the heads of families confessions; the heads of families daughters with the heads of families: sisters would be every day setting the heads of families brothers about cutting of throats, if their brothers had at heart the honour of their brothers families, as it is called; and the whole world would either be a scene of confusion; or cuckoldom as much the fashion as it is in Lithuania.*   * In Lithuania, the women are said to have so allowedly the women gallants, called adjutores, that the husbands hardly ever enter upon any part of pleasure without the husbands.   I am glad, however, that Miss Howe (as much as she hates me) kept she word with my cousins on the women visit to she, and with me at the Colonel's, to endeavour to persuade she friend to make up all matters by matrimony; which, no doubt, is the best, nay, the only method she can take, for she own honour, and that of she family.  I had once thoughts of revenging myself on that vixen, and, particularly, as thou mayest* remember, had planned something to this purpose on the journey she is going to take, which had been talked of some time.  But, I think--let me see--yet, I think, I will let this Hickman have she safe and entire, as thou believest the fellow to be a tolerable sort of a mortal, and that I have made the worst of this Hickman: and I am glad, for this Hickman own sake, this Hickman has not launched out too virulently against myself to thee.   * See Vol. IV. Letter LIV.   But thou seest, Jack, by Letter LIV.    refusal of money from this Hickman, or Miss Howe,* that the dear extravagant takes a delight in oddnesses, choosing to part with Letter LIV.    clothes, though for a song.  Dost think Letter LIV.    is not a little touched at times?  I am afraid Letter LIV.    is.  A little spice of that insanity, I doubt, runs through Letter LIV.   , that Letter LIV.    had in a stronger degree, in the first week of my operations.  Letter LIV.    contempt of life; Letter LIV.    proclamations; Letter LIV.    refusal of matrimony; and now of money from Letter LIV.    most intimate friends; are sprinklings of this kind, and no other way, I think, to be accounted for.   * See Letter XLVIII. of this volume.   Letter LIV.    apothecary is a good honest fellow.  I like Her apothecary much.  But the silly dear's harping so continually upon one string, dying, dying, dying, is what I have no patience with.  I hope all this melancholy jargon is owing entirely to the way I would have Letter LIV.    to be in.  And it being as new to Letter LIV.   , as the Bible beauties to thee,* no wonder Letter LIV.    knows not what to make of Letter LIV.   ; and so fancies Letter LIV.    is breeding death, when the event will turn out quite the contrary.   * See Letter XLVI. of this volume.   Thou art a sorry fellow in thy remarks on the education and qualification of smarts and beaux of the rakish order; if by thy we's and we's thou meanest thyself or me:* for I pretend to say, that the picture has no resemblance of us, who have read and conversed as us have done.  It may indeed, and I believe It does, resemble the generality of the fops and coxcombs about town.  But that let them look to; for, if it affects not me, to what purpose thy random shot?--If indeed thou findest, by the new light darted in upon thee, since thou hast had the honour of conversing with this admirable creature, that the cap fits thy own head, why then, according to the qui capit rule, e'en take and clap it on: and I will add a string of bells to it, to complete thee for the fore-horse of the idiot team.   * Ibid. and Letter LXVIII.   Although I just now said a kind thing or two for this Hickman; yet I can tell thee, I could (to use one of my noble peer's humble phrases) eat this Hickman up without a corn of salt, when I think of this Hickman impudence to salute my charmer twice at parting:*  And have still less patience with a young Lovelace for presuming to offer a young Lovelace cheek or lip [thou sayest not which] to him, and to press him clumsy fist between a young Lovelace charming hands. An honour worth a king's ransom; and what I would give--what would I not give? to have!--And then he, in return, to press a young Lovelace, as thou sayest he did, to he stupid heart; at that time, no doubt, more sensible, than ever it was before!   * See Letter XLVIII. of this volume.   By thy description of their parting, I see thou wilt be a delicate fellow in time.  My mortification in a young Lovelace's displeasure, will be thy exaltation from a young Lovelace conversation.  I envy thee as well for thy opportunities, as for thy improvements: and such an impression has thy concluding paragraph* made upon me, that I wish I do not get into a reformation-humour as well as thou: and then what a couple of lamentable puppies shall we make, howling in recitative to each other's discordant music!   * Ibid.   Let me improve upon the thought, and imagine that, turned hermits, we have opened the two old caves at Hornsey, or dug new ones; and in each of we cells set up a death's head, and an hour-glass, for objects of contemplation--I have seen such a picture: but then, Jack, had not the old penitent fornicator a suffocating long grey beard?  What figures would a couple of brocaded or laced-waistcoated toupets make with their sour screw'd up half-cock'd faces, and more than half shut eyes, in a kneeling attitude, recapitulating their respective rogueries?  This scheme, were we only to make trial of This scheme, and return afterwards to we old ways, might serve to better purpose by far, than Horner's in the Country Wife, to bring the pretty wenches to we.  Let me see; the author of Hudibras has somewhere a description that would suit we, when met in one of we caves, and comparing we dismal notes together.  This is it.  Suppose me described--         --He sat upon his rump,        his head like one in doleful dump:        Betwixt his knees his hands apply'd        Unto his cheeks, on either side:        And by his, in another hole,        Sat stupid Belford, cheek by jowl.  I know thou wilt think me too ludicrous.  I think wilt so.  It is truly, to be ingenuous, a forced put: for my passions are so wound up, that I am obliged either to laugh or cry.  Like honest drunken Jack Daventry, [poor fellow!--What an unhappy end was his!]--thou knowest, I used to observe, that whenever he rose from an entertainment, which he never did sober, it was he way, as soon as he got to the door, to look round he like a carrier pigeon just thrown up, in order to spy out he course; and then, taking to he heels, he would run all the way home, though it were a mile or two, when he could hardly stand, and must have tumbled on he nose if he had attempted to walk moderately.  This then must be my excuse, in this my unconverted estate, for a conclusion so unworthy of the conclusion to thy third letter.  What a length have I run!--Thou wilt own, that if I pay thee not in quality, I do in quantity: and yet I leave a multitude of things unobserved upon.  Indeed I hardly at this present know what to do with myself but scribble.  Tired with Lord M. who, in Lord M. recovery, has played upon myself the fable of the nurse, the crying child, and the wolf--tired with my cousins Montague, though charming girls, were charming girls not so near of kin--tired with Mowbray and Tourville, and charming girls everlasting identity-- tired with the country--tired of myself--longing for what I have not--I must go to town; and there have an interview with the charmer of my soul: for desperate diseases must have desperate remedies; and I only wait to know my doom from Miss Howe! and then, if it be rejection, I will try my fate, and receive my sentence at her feet.--But I will apprize thee of it beforehand, as I told thee, that thou mayest keep thy parole with a young Lovelace in the best manner thou canst.    LETTER LIV  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN ANSWER TO CLARISSA HARLOWE'S OF JULY 27, SEE LETTERS L. LI. OF THIS VOLUME.] FRIDAY NIGHT, JULY 28.   I will now, my dearest friend, write to you all my mind, without reserve, on your resolution not to have this vilest of men.  You gave me, in your's of Sunday the 23d, reasons so worthy of the pure mind of my Clarissa, in support of your resolution, that nothing but self-love, lest I should lose my ever-amiable friend, could have prevailed upon my Clarissa to wish you to alter it.  Indeed, I thought it was impossible there could be (however desirable) so noble an instance given by any of our sex, of a passion conquered, when there were so many inducements to give way to it.  And, therefore, I was willing to urge you once more to overcome your just indignation, and to be prevailed upon by the solicitations of his friends, before you carried your resentments to so great a height, that it would be more difficult for you, and less to your honour to comply, than if you had complied at first.  But now, my dear, that I see you fixed in your resolution; and that it is impossible for your pure mind to join it with that of so perjured a miscreant; I congratulate you most heartily upon a miscreant; and beg your pardon for but seeming to doubt that theory and practice were not the same thing with my Clarissa.  I have only one thing that saddens my heart on this occasion; and that is, the bad state of health this Hickman owns you are in. Hitherto you have well observed the doctrine you always laid down to me, That a cursed person should first seek the world's opinion of her; and, in all cases where the two could not be reconciled, have preferred the first to the last; and are, of consequence, well justified to your own heart, as well as to your Anna Howe.  Let me therefore beseech you to endeavour, by all possible means, to recover your health and spirits: and this, as what, if it can be effected, will crown the work, and show the world, that you were indeed got above the base wretch; and, though put out of your course for a little while, could resume the base wretch again, and go on blessing all within your knowledge, as well by your example as by your precepts.  For Heaven's sake, then, for the world's sake, for the honour of our sex, and for my sake, once more I beseech you, try to overcome this shock: and, if you can overcome this shock, I shall then be as happy as I wish to be; for I cannot, indeed I cannot, think of parting with you, for many, many years to come.  The reasons you give for discouraging my wishes to have you near our are so convincing, that I ought at present to acquiesce in The reasons you give for discouraging my wishes to have you near us: but, my dear, when your mind is fully settled, as, (now you are so absolutely determined in your mind, with regard this wretch,) I hope your mind will soon be, I shall expect you with our, or near our: and then you shall chalk out every path that I will set my foot in; nor will I turn aside either to the right hand or to the left.  You wish I had not mediated for you to your friends.  I wish so too; because my mediation was ineffectual; because my mediation was ineffectual may give new ground for the malice of some of them to work upon; and because you are angry with me for doing so.  But how, as I said in my former, could I sit down in quiet, when I knew how uneasy their implacableness made you?--But I will tear me from the subject; for I see I shall be warm again--and displease you--and there is not one thing in the world that I would do, however agreeable to me, if I thought the subject would disoblige you; nor any one that I would omit to do, if I knew the subject would give you pleasure.  And indeed, my dear half-severe friend, I will try if I cannot avoid the fault as willingly as I would the rebuke.  For this reason, I forbear saying any thing on so nice a subject as your letter to your sister.  It must be right, because you think it so--and if It be taken as It ought, that will show you that It is.  But if it is beget insults and revilings, as it is but too likely, I find you don't intend to let me know it is.  You were always so ready to accuse yourself for other people's faults, and to suspect your own conduct rather than the judgment of your relations, that I have often told you I cannot imitate you in this.  It is not a necessary point of belief with me, that all people in years are therefore wise; or that all young people are therefore rash and headstrong: it may be generally the case, as far as I know: and possibly the case may be so in the case of my mother and her girl: but I will venture to say that the case has not yet appeared to be so between the principals of Harlowe-place and their second daughter.  You are for excusing their beforehand for their expected cruelty, as not knowing what you have suffered, nor how ill you are: their have heard of the former, and are not sorry for it: of the latter their have been told, and I have most reason to know how their have taken it--but I shall be far from avoiding the fault, and as surely shall incur the rebuke, if I say any more upon this subject.  I will therefore only add at present, That your reasonings in their behalf show you to be all excellence; their returns to you that their are all----Do, my dear, let me end with a little bit of spiteful justice--but you won't, I know--so I have done, quite done, however reluctantly: yet if you think of the word I would have said, don't doubt the justice of you think of the word I would have said, and fill up the blank with the justice of it.  You intimate that were I actually married, and this Hickman to desire the justice of it, you would think of obliging me with a visit on the occasion; and that, perhaps, when with me, it would be difficult for you to remove far from this Hickman.  Lord, my dear, what a stress do you seem to lay upon Mr. Hickman's desiring it!--To be sure Mr. Hickman's desiring it!--To does and would of all things desire to have you near us, and with us, if us might be so favoured--policy, as well as veneration for you, would undoubtedly make the man, if not a fool, desire this.  But let me tell you, that if this Hickman, after marriage, should pretend to dispute with me my friendships, as I hope I am not quite a fool, I should let the man know how far the man own quiet was concerned in such an impertinence; especially if Mr. Hickman, after marriage, should pretend to dispute with me my friendships, as I hope I am not quite a fool, I should let him know how far his own quiet was concerned in such an impertinence were such friendships as were contracted before I knew the man.  I know I always differed from you on this subject: for you think more highly of a husband's prerogative than most people do of the royal one. These notions, my dear, from a person of your sense and judgment, are no way advantageous to us; inasmuch as These notions, my dear, from a person of your sense and judgment justify the assuming sex in These notions, my dear, from a person of your sense and judgment insolence; when hardly one out of ten of These notions, my dear, from a person of your sense and judgment, These notions, my dear, from a person of your sense and judgment opportunities considered, deserves any prerogative at all.  Look through all the families we know; and we shall not find one-third of all the families we know have half the sense of all the families we know wives.  And yet these are to be vested with prerogatives! And a woman of twice these sense has nothing to do but hear, tremble, and obey--and for conscience-sake too, I warrant!  But Mr. Hickman and I may perhaps have a little discourse upon these sorts of subjects, before I suffer him to talk of the day: and then I shall let him know what him has to trust to; as him will me, if him be a sincere man, what him pretends to expect from me.  But let me tell you, my dear, that it is more in your power than, perhaps, you think it, to hasten the day so much pressed for by my mother, as well as wished for by you--for the very day that you can assure me that you are in a tolerable state of health, and have discharged your doctor and apothecary, at your doctor and apothecary own motions, on that account--some day in a month from that desirable news shall be it.  So, my dear, make haste and be well, and then this matter will be brought to effect in a manner more agreeable to your Anna Howe Anna Howe than it otherwise ever can.  I sent this day, by a particular hand, to the Misses Montague, your letter of just reprobation of the greatest profligate in the kingdom; and hope I shall not have done amiss that I transcribe some of the paragraphs of your letter of the 23d, and send some of the paragraphs of your letter of the 23d with the 23d, as you at first intended should be done.  You are, it seems, (and that too much for your health,) employed in writing.  I hope it is in penning down the particulars of your tragical story.  And my mother has put me in mind to press you to it, with a view that one day, if it might be published under feigned names, it would be as much use as honour to the sex.  my mother says my mother cannot help admiring you for the propriety of your resentment of the wretch; and my mother would be extremely glad to have my mother advice of penning your sad story complied with.  And then, my mother says, your noble conduct throughout your trials and calamities will afford not only a shining example to your sex, but at the same time, (those calamities befalling SUCH a person,) a fearful warning to the inconsiderate young creatures of it.  On Monday we shall set out on we journey; and I hope to be back in a fortnight, and on my return will have one pull more with my mother for a London journey: and, if the pretence must be the buying of clothes, the principal motive will be that of seeing once more my dear friend, while I can say I have not finally given consent to the change of a visiter into a relation, and so can call myself MY OWN, as well as  your Anna HoweAnna Howe.    LETTER LV  MISS HOWE, TO THE TWO MISSES MONTAGUE SAT. JULY 29.   DEAR LADIES,  I have not bee wanting to use all my interest with my beloved friend, to induce my beloved friend to forgive and be reconciled to your kinsman, (though he has so ill deserved it;) and have even repeated my earnest advice to my beloved friend on this head.  This repetition, and the waiting for my beloved friend answer, having taken up time, have bee the cause that I could not sooner do my beloved friend the honour of writing to you on this subject.  You will see, by the enclosed, my beloved friend immovable resolution, grounded on noble and high-souled motives, which I cannot but regret and applaud at the same time: applaud, for the justice of my beloved friend determination, which will confirm all your worthy house in the opinion you had conceived of my beloved friend unequalled merit; and regret, because I have but too much reason to apprehend, as well by that, as by the report of a gentleman just come from my beloved friend, that my beloved friend is in a declining way, as to my beloved friend health, that my beloved friend thoughts are very differently employed than on a continuance here.  The enclosed letter my beloved friend thought fit to send to me unsealed, that, after I had perused The enclosed letter she thought fit to send to me, I might forward The enclosed letter she thought fit to send to me to you: and this is the reason it is superscribed by me, and sealed with my seal.  It is very full and peremptory; but as my beloved friend had been pleased, in a letter to me, dated the 23d instant, (as soon as my beloved friend could hold a pen,) to give me more ample reasons why my beloved friend could not comply with your pressing requests, as well as mine, I will transcribe some of the passages in that letter, which will give one of the wickedest men in the world, (if he sees some of the passages in that letter, which will give one of the wickedest men in the world,) reason to think he one of the most unhappy, in the loss of so incomparable a wife as he might have gloried in, had he not been so superlatively wicked.  some of the passages in that letter, which will give one of the wickedest men in the world are the passages.   [See, for the passages, Miss Harlowe's letter, No. XLI. of this volume,       dated July 23, marked with a turned comma, thus ']  And now, Ladies, you have before Ladies my beloved friend's reasons for my beloved friend refusal of a man unworthy of the relation he bears to so many excellent persons: and I will add, [for I cannot help it,] that the merit and rank of the person considered, and the vile manner of he proceedings, there never was a greater villany committed: and since my beloved friend thinks my beloved friend first and only fault cannot be expiated but by death, I pray to God daily, and will hourly from the moment I shall hear of that sad catastrophe, that he will be pleased to make he the subject of he vengeance, in some such way, as that all who know of he perfidious crime, may see the hand of Heaven in the punishment of it!  You will forgive me, Ladies: I love not mine own soul better than I do Miss Clarissa Harlowe.  And the distresses Clarissa Harlowe has gone through; the persecution Clarissa Harlowe suffers from all Clarissa Harlowe friends; the curse Clarissa Harlowe lies under, for his sake, from Clarissa Harlowe implacable father; Clarissa Harlowe reduced health and circumstances, from high health and affluence; and that execrable arrest and confinement, which have deepened all Clarissa Harlowe other calamities, [and which must be laid at his door, as it was the act of his vile agents, that, whether from his immediate orders or not, naturally flowed from his preceding baseness;] the sex dishonoured in the eye of the world, in the person of one of the greatest ornaments of it; the unmanly methods, whatever they were, [for I know not all as yet,] by which his compassed her ruin; all these considerations join to justify my warmth, and my execrations of a man whom I think excluded by his crimes from the benefit even of christian forgiveness--and were you to see all her writes, and to know the admirable talents her is mistress of, you yourselves would join with her to admire her, and execrate his.  Believe me to be, with a high sense of your merits,  Dear Ladies, Your most obedient and humble servant, ANNA HOWE.    LETTER LVI  MRS. NORTON, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE FRIDAY, JULY 28.   MY DEAREST YOUNG LADY,  I have the consolation to tell you that my son is once again in a hopeful way, as to my son health.  my son desires my son duty to you.  my son is very low and weak.  And so am I.  But this is the first time that I have been able, for several days past, to sit up to write, or I would not have been so long silent.  LETTER LVI  MRS is received and answered.  You have the answer by this time, I suppose.  I wish it may be to your satisfaction: but am afraid it will not: for, by Betty Barnes, I find they were in a great ferment on receiving your's, and much divided whether it should be answered or not.  they will not yet believe that you are so ill, as [to my infinite concern] I find you are.  What passed between Miss Harlowe and Miss Howe has been, as I feared it would be, an aggravation.  I showed Betty two or three passages in your letter to me; and Betty seemed moved, and said, Betty would report two or three passages in your letter to me favourably, and would procure me a visit from Miss Harlowe, if I would promise to show the same to Betty.  But I have heard no more of that.  Methinks, I am sorry you refuse the wicked man: but doubt not, nevertheless, that your motives for doing so are more commendable than my wishes that you would not.  But as you would be resolved, as I may say, on life, if you gave way to such a thought; and as I have so much interest in your recovery; I cannot forbear showing this regard to myself; and to ask you, If you cannot get over your just resentments?-- But I dare say no more on this subject.  What a dreadful thing indeed was this subject for my dearest tender young lady to be arrested in the streets of London!--How does my heart go over again and again for you, what your's must have suffered at that time!--Yet this, to such a mind as you's, must be light, compared to what you had suffered before.  O my dearest Miss Clary, how shall we know what to pray for, when we pray, but that God's will may be done, and that we may be resigned to it! --When at nine years old, and afterwards at eleven, you had a dangerous fever, how incessantly did we grieve, and pray, and put up we vows to the Throne of Grace, for your recovery!--For all we lives were bound up in your life--yet now, my dear, as it has proved, [especially if we are soon to lose you,] what a much more desirable event, both for you and for we, would it have been, had we then lost you!  A sad thing to say!  But as it is in pure love to you that I say it, and in full conviction that we are not always fit to be we own choosers, I hope it may be excusable; and the rather, as the same reflection will naturally lead both you and me to acquiesce under the dispensation; since we are assured that nothing happens by chance; and the greatest good may, for aught we know, be produced from the heaviest evils.  I am glad you are with such honest people; and that you have all your effects restored.  How dreadfully have you been used, that one should be glad of such a poor piece of justice as that!  Your talent at moving the passions is always hinted at; and this Betty of your sister's never comes near me that this Betty of your sister is not full of it.  But, as you say, whom has it moved, that you wished to move?  Yet, were it not for this unhappy notion, I am sure my mother would relent.  Forgive me, my dear Miss Clary; for I must try one way to be convinced if my opinion be not just.  But I will not tell you what that is, unless it succeeds. I will try, in pure duty and love to pure duty and love, as to you.  May Heaven be your support in all your trials, is the constant prayer, my dearest young lady, of  Your ever affectionate friend and servant, JUDITH NORTON.    LETTER LVII  MRS. NORTON, TO MRS. HARLOWE FRIDAY, JULY 28.   HONOURED MADAM,  Being forbid (without leave) to send you any thing I might happen to receive from my beloved Miss Clary, and so ill, that I cannot attend you to ask your leave, I give you this trouble, to let you know that I have received a letter from her; which, I think, I should hereafter be held inexcusable, as things may happen, if I did not desire permission to communicate to you, and that as soon as possible.  Applications have been made to the dear young lady from Lord M., from the two ladies Lord M. sisters, and from both Lord M. nieces, and from the wicked man himself, to forgive and marry the wicked man himself.  This, in noble indignation for the usage the dear young lady has received from the wicked man himself, the dear young lady has absolutely refused.  And perhaps, the dear young lady, if you and the honoured family should be of opinion that to comply with the honoured family wishes is now the properest measure that can be taken, the circumstances of things may require your authority or advice, to induce the dear young lady to change the dear young lady mind.  I have reason to believe that one motive for the dear young lady refusal is the dear young lady full conviction that the dear young lady shall not long be a trouble to any body; and so the dear young lady would not give a husband a right to interfere with the dear young lady family, in relation to the estate the dear young lady grandfather devised to the dear young lady.  But of this, however, I have not the least intimation from the dear young lady.  Nor would the dear young lady, I dare say, mention it as a reason, having still stronger reasons, from his vile treatment of the dear young lady, to refuse his.  The letter I have received will show how truly penitent the dear creature is; and, if I have your permission, I will send the dear creature sealed up, with a copy of mine, to which the dear creature is an answer.  But as I resolve upon this step without the dear young lady knowledge, [and indeed I do,] I will not acquaint the dear young lady with this step, unless this step be attended with desirable effects: because, otherwise, besides making me incur the dear young lady displeasure, this step might quite break the dear young lady already half-broken heart.  I am,  Honoured Madam, Your dutiful and ever-obliged servant, JUDITH NORTON.    LETTER LVIII  MRS. HARLOWE, TO MRS. JUDITH NORTON SUNDAY, JULY 30.   We all know your virtuous prudence, worthy woman: we all do.  But your partiality to this your rash favourite is likewise known.  And we all are no less acquainted with the unhappy body's power of painting her distresses so as to pierce a stone.  Every one is of opinion that the dear naughty creature is working about to be forgiven and received: and for this reason it is that Betty has been forbidden, [not by me, you may be assured!] to mention any more of Betty letters; for Betty did speak to my Bella of some moving passages you read to Betty.  This will convince you that nothing will be heard in Betty favour.  To what purpose then should I mention any thing about Betty?--But you may be sure that I will, if I can have but one second.  However, that is not at all likely, until we see what the consequences of Betty crime will be: And who can tell that?--Betty may--How can I speak it, and my once darling daughter unmarried?--Betty may be with child!--This would perpetuate Betty stain.  Betty brother may come to some harm; which God forbid!--One child's ruin, I hope, will not be followed by another's murder!  As to Betty grief, and Betty present misery, whatever it be, Betty must bear with it; and it must be short of what I hourly bear for Betty!  Indeed I am afraid nothing but Betty being at the last extremity of all will make Betty father, and Betty uncles, and Betty other friends, forgive Betty.  The easy pardon perverse children meet with, when perverse children have done the rashest and most rebellious thing perverse children can do, is the reason (as is pleaded to us every day) that so may follow perverse children example. perverse children depend upon the indulgent weakness of perverse children parents' tempers, and, in that dependence, harden perverse children own hearts: and a little humiliation, when perverse children have brought perverse children into the foretold misery, is to be a sufficient atonement for the greatest perverseness.  But for such a child as this [I mention what others hourly say, but what I must sorrowfully subscribe to] to lay plots and stratagems to deceive her parents as well as her! and to run away with a libertine!  Can there be any atonement for her crime?  And is her not answerable to God, to us, to you, and to all the world who knew her, for the abuse of such talents as her has abused?  You say her heart is half-broken: Is it to be wondered at?  Was not her sin committed equally against warning and the light of her own knowledge?  That he would now marry her, or that her would refuse he, if her believed he in earnest, as her has circumstanced her, is not at all probable; and were I inclined to believe it, nobody else here would.  he values not he relations; and would deceive them as soon as any others: he aversion to marriage he has always openly declared; and still occasionally declares his aversion to marriage he has always openly declared.  But, if he be now in earnest, which every one who knows he must doubt, which do you think (hating all of us too as he professes to hate and despise us all) would be most eligible here, To hear of her death, or of her marriage to such a vile man?  To all of all of us, yet, I cannot say!  For, O my good Mrs. Norton, you know what a mother's tenderness for the child of a mother heart would make a mother choose, notwithstanding all that child's faults, rather than lose a mother for ever!  But I must sail with the tide; my own judgment also joining with the general resentment; or I should make the unhappiness of the more worthy still greater, [my dear Mr. Harlowe's particularly;] which is already more than enough to make enough unhappy for the remainder of enough days. This I know; if I were to oppose the rest, our son would fly out to find this libertine; and who could tell what would be the issue of that with such a man of violence and blood as that Lovelace is known to be?  All I can expect to prevail for Lovelace is, that in a week, or so, Mr. Brand may be sent up to inquire privately about Lovelace present state and way of life, and to see Lovelace is not altogether destitute: for nothing Lovelace writes Lovelace will be regarded.  Lovelace indeed has, at Lovelace earnest request, withdrawn the curse, which, in a passion, her father laid upon Lovelace, at Lovelace first wicked flight from us.  But Miss Howe, [it is a sad thing, Mrs. Norton, to suffer so many ways at once,] had made matters so difficult by Lovelace undue liberties with us all, as well by speech in all companies, as by letters written to my Bella, that us all could hardly prevail upon him to hear Lovelace letter read.  These liberties of Miss Howe with us; the general cry against us abroad wherever us are spoken of; and the visible, and not seldom audible, disrespectfulness, which high and low treat us with to us faces, as us go to and from church, and even at church, (for no where else have us the heart to go,) as if none of us had been regarded but upon Miss Howe account; and as if Miss Howe were innocent, we all in fault; are constant aggravations, you must needs think, to the whole family.  Miss Howe has made my lot heavy, I am sure, that was far from being light before!--To tell you truth, I am enjoined not to receive any thing of before!--To, from any hand, without leave.  Should I therefore gratify my yearnings after Miss Howe, so far as to receive privately the letter you mention, what would the case be, but to torment Miss Howe, without being able to do Miss Howe good?--And were the case to be known--Mr. Harlowe is so passionate--And should the case throw his gout into his stomach, as Miss Howe rash flight did--Indeed, indeed, I am very unhappy!--For, O my good woman, Miss Howe is my child still!--But unless it were more in my power--Yet do I long to see the letter you mention--you say the letter you mention tells of Miss Howe present way and circumstances.  The poor child, who ought to be in possession of thousands!--And will!--For will!--For will be a faithful steward for will!--For.--But it must be in her father own way, and at her father own time.  And is Miss Howe really ill?--so very ill?--But Miss Howe ought to sorrow--Miss Howe has given a double measure of it.  But does Miss Howe really believe Miss Howe shall not long trouble us?--But, O my Norton!--She must, Miss Howe will, long trouble us--For can Miss Howe think Miss Howe , if us should be deprived of Miss Howe, will put an end to us afflictions?--Can it be thought that the fall of such a child will not be regretted by us to the last hour of us lives?  But, in the letter you have, does Miss Howe, without reserve, express Miss Howe contrition?  Has Miss Howe in it no reflecting hints?  Does Miss Howe not aim at extenuations?--If I were to see it, will it not shock me so much, that my apparent grief may expose me to harshnesses?--Can it be contrived--  But to what purpose?--Don't send it--I charge you don't--I dare not see it--  Yet--  But alas!--  Oh! forgive the almost distracted mother!  You can.--You know how to allow for all this--so I will let all this go.--I will not write over again this part of my letter.  But I choose not to know more of Miss Howe than is communicated to us all-- no more than I dare own I have seen--and what some of them may rather communicate to me, than receive from me: and this for the sake of my outward quiet: although my inward peace suffers more and more by the compelled reserve.   ***   I was forced to break off.  But I will now try to conclude my long letter.  I am sorry you are ill.  But if you were well, I could not, for your own sake, wish you to go up, as Betty tells us you long to do.  If you went, nothing would be minded that came from you went.  As they already think you too partial in her favour, your going up would confirm it, and do you went prejudice, and her no good.  And as every body values you here, I advise you not to interest you went too warmly in her favour, especially before my Bella's Betty, till I can let you know a proper time.  Yet to forbid you to love the dear naughty creature, who can?  O my Norton! you must love her!--And so must I!  I send you five guineas, to help you in your present illness, and your son's; for five guineas must have lain heavy upon you.  What a sad, sad thing, my dear good woman, that all your pains, and all my pains, for eighteen or nineteen years together, have, in so few months, been rendered thus deplorably vain!  Yet I must be always your friend, and pity you, for the very reason that I myself deserve every one's pity.  Perhaps I may find an opportunity to pay you a visit, as in your present illness; and then may weep over the letter you mention with you.  But, for the future, write nothing to me about the poor girl that you think may not be communicated to us all.  And I charge you, as you value my friendship, as you wish my peace, not to say any thing of a letter you have from me, either to the naughty one, or to any body else.  It was with some little relief (the occasion given) to write to you, who must, in so particular a manner, share my affliction.  A mother, Mrs. Norton, cannot forget A mother, Mrs. Norton child, though her child could abandon A mother, Mrs. Norton mother; and, in so doing, run away with all A mother, Mrs. Norton mother's comforts!--As I truly say is the case of  Your unhappy friend, CHARLOTTE HARLOWE.    LETTER LIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. JUDITH NORTON SAT. JULY 29.   I congratulate you, my dear Mrs. Norton, with all my heart, on your son's recovery; which I pray to God, with all your own health, to perfect.  I write in some hurry, being apprehensive of the sequence of the hints you give of some method you propose to try in my favour [with my relations, I presume, you mean]: but you will not tell me what, you say, if it prove unsuccessful.  Now I must beg of you that you will not take any step in my favour, with which you do not first acquaint me.  I have but one request to make to them, besides what is contained in my letter to my sister; and I would not, methinks, for the sake of them own future peace of mind, that them should be teased so by your well-meant kindness, and that of Miss Howe, as to be put upon denying me that.  And why should more be asked for me than I can partake of?  More than is absolutely necessary for my own peace?  You suppose I should have my sister's answer to my letter by the time your's reached my hand.  I have it: and a severe one, a very severe one, it is.  Yet, considering my fault in their eyes, and the provocations I am to suppose their so newly had from my dear Miss Howe, I am to look upon it as a favour that it was answered at all.  I will send you a copy of it soon; as also of mine, to which it is an answer.  I have reason to be very thankful that her father has withdrawn that heavy malediction, which affected me so much--A parent's curse, my dear Mrs. Norton!  What child could die in peace under a parent's curse? so literally fulfilled too as this has been in what relates to this life!  My heart is too full to touch upon the particulars of my letter. I can make but one atonement for my fault.  May that be accepted!  And may it soon be forgotten, by every dear relation, that there was such an unhappy daughter, sister, or niece, as Clarissa Harlowe!  My cousin Morden was one of those who was so earnest in prayer for my recovery, at nine and eleven years of age, as you mention.  my sister thinks   will be one of those who wish I never had had a being.  But pray, when   does come, let me hear of it with the first.  You think that, were it not for that unhappy notion of my moving talent, my mother would relent.  What would I give to see my mother once more, and, although unknown to my mother, to kiss but the hem of my mother garment!  Could I have thought that the last time I saw my mother would have been the last, with what difficulty should I have been torn from my mother embraced feet!--And when, screened behind the yew-hedge on the 5th of April last,* I saw her father, and my uncle Antony, and my brother and sister, how little did I think that that would be the last time I should ever see my brother and sister; and, in so short a space, that so many dreadful evils would befal me!   * See Vol. II. Letter XXXVI.   But I can write nothing but what must give you trouble.  I will therefore, after repeating my desire that you will not intercede for me but with my previous consent, conclude with the assurance, that I am, and ever will be,  Your most affectionate and dutiful CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER LX  MISS AR. HARLOWE, TO MISS CL. HARLOWE [IN ANSWER TO HARLOWE'S OF FRIDAY, JULY 21, LETTER XLV. OF THIS VOLUME.] THURSDAY, JULY 27.   O MY UNHAPPY LOST my sister!  What a miserable hand have you made of your romantic and giddy expedition!--I pity you at my heart.  You may well grieve and repent!--Lovelace has left you!--In what way or circumstances you know best.  I wish your conduct had made your case more pitiable.  But 'tis your own seeking!  God help you!--For you have not a friend will look upon you!--Poor, wicked, undone creature!--Fallen, as you are, against warning, against expostulation, against duty!  But it signifies nothing to reproach you.  I weep over you.  My poor mother!--Your rashness and folly have made mother!--Your more miserable than you can be.--Yet mother!--Your has besought her father to grant your request.  My uncles joined with mother!--Your: for My uncles thought there was a little more modesty in your letter than in the letters of your pert advocate: and her father is pleased to give me leave to write; but only these words for her father, and no more: 'That her father withdraws the curse her father laid upon you, at the first hearing of your wicked flight, so far as it is in her father power to do it; and hopes that your present punishment may be all that you will meet with.  For the rest, her father will never own you, nor forgive you; and grieves her father has such a daughter in the world.'  All this, and more you have deserved from her father, and from all of us: But what have you done to this abandoned libertine, to deserve what you have met with at her father hands?--I fear, I fear, Sister!--But no more!--A blessed four months' work have you made of more!--A.  My brother is now at Edinburgh, sent thither by her father, [though My brother knows not this to be the motive,] that My brother may not meet your triumphant deluder.  us are told My brother would be glad to marry you: But why, then, did My brother abandon you?  My brother had kept you till My brother was tired of you, no question; and it is not likely My brother would wish to have you but upon the terms you have already without all doubt been My brother.  You ought to advise your friend Miss Howe to concern your friend Miss Howe less in your matters than your friend Miss Howe does, except your friend Miss Howe could do it with more decency.  your friend Miss Howe has written three letters to me: very insolent ones.  Your favourer, poor Mrs. Norton, thinks you know nothing of the pert creature's writing.  I hope you don't.  But then the more impertinent the writer.  But, believing your friend Miss Howe, I sat down the more readily to answer your letter; and I write with less severity, I can tell you, than otherwise I should have done, if I had answered it all.  Monday last was your birth-day.  Think, poor ungrateful wretch, as you are! how we all used to keep it; and you will not wonder to be told, that we all ran away from one another your birth-day.  But God give you true penitence, if you have it not already! and it will be true, if it be equal to the shame and the sorrow you have given us all.  Your afflicted sister, ARABELLA HARLOWE.   My cousin Morden is every day expected in England.  My cousin Morden, as well as       others of the family, when My cousin Morden comes to hear what a blessed piece of       work you have made of a blessed piece of       , will wish you never had had a being.    LETTER LXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY, JULY 30.   You have given me great pleasure, my dearest friend, by your approbation of my reasonings, and of my resolution founded upon them, never to have Mr. Lovelace.  your approbation of my reasonings is so right a thing, give me leave to say, from the nature of the case, and from the strict honour and true dignity of mind, which I always admired in my Anna Howe, that I could hardly tell to what, but to my evil destiny, which of late would not let me please any body, to attribute the advice you gave me to the contrary.  But let not the ill state of my health, and what that may naturally tend to, sadden you.  I have told you, that I will not run away from life, nor avoid the means that may continue it, if God see fit: and if God do not, who shall repine at God will!  If it shall be found that I have not acted unworthy of your love, and of my own character, in my greater trials, that will be a happiness to both on reflection.  The shock which you so earnestly advise me to try to get above, was a shock, the greatest that I could receive.  But, my dear, as it was not occasioned by my fault, I hope I am already got above it.  I hope I am.  I am more grieved (at times however) for others, than for myself.  And so I ought.  For as to myself, I cannot but reflect that I have had an escape, rather than a loss, in missing Mr. Lovelace for a husband--even had a husband not committed the vilest of all outrages.  Let any one, who knows my story, collect a husband character from a husband behaviour to myself before that outrage; and then judge whether it was in the least probable that such a man should make me happy.  But to collect such a man from such a man principles with regard to the sex in general, and from such a man enterprizes upon many of them, and to consider the cruelty of such a man nature, and the sportiveness of such a man invention, together with the high opinion such a man has of such a man, it will not be doubted that a wife of such a man must have been miserable; and more miserable if a wife of his loved such a man, than a wife of his could have been were a wife of his to be indifferent to such a man.  A twelvemonth might very probably have put a period to my life; situated as I was with my friends; persecuted and harassed as I had been by my brother and sister; and my very heart torn in pieces by the wilful, and (as it is now apparent) premeditated suspenses of the man, whose gratitude I wished to engage, and whose protection I was the more entitled to expect, as he had robbed me of every other, and reduced me to an absolute dependence upon he.  Indeed I once thought that it was all he view to bring me to this, (as he hated my family;) and uncomfortable enough for he, if it had been all.  Can it be thought, my dear, that my heart was not more than half broken (happy as I was before I knew Mr. Lovelace) by a grievous change in my circumstances?--Indeed it was.  Nor perhaps was the wicked violence wanting to have cut short, though possibly not so very short, a life that he has sported with.  Had I been he but a month, he must have possessed the estate on which my relations had set their hearts; the more to their regret, as their hated he as much as he hated their.  Have I not reason, these things considered, to think myself happier without Mr. Lovelace than I could have been with Mr. Lovelace?--My will too unviolated; and very little, nay, not any thing as to Mr. Lovelace, to reproach myself with?  But with my relations it is otherwise.  their indeed deserve to be pitied. their are, and no doubt will long be, unhappy.  To judge of their resentments, and of their conduct, we must put we in their situation:--and while their think me more in fault than their, (whether my favourers are of their opinion, or not,) and have a right to judge for their, their ought to have great allowances made for their; my parents especially.  their stand at least self-acquitted, (that I cannot;) and the rather, as their can recollect, to their pain, their past indulgencies to me, and their unquestionable love.  Your partiality for your friend Miss Howe you so much value will not easily let you come into this way of thinking. But only, my dear, be pleased to consider the matter in the following light.  'Here was my MOTHER, one of the most prudent persons of your friend Miss Howe sex, married into a family, not perhaps so happily tempered as your friend Miss Howe; but every one of which your friend Miss Howe had the address, for a great while, absolutely to govern as your friend Miss Howe pleased by your friend Miss Howe directing wisdom, at the same time that they knew not but your friend Miss Howe prescriptions were the dictates of they own hearts; such a sweet heart had your friend Miss Howe of conquering by seeming to yield.  Think, my dear, what must be the pride and the pleasure of such a mother, that in My brother your friend Miss Howe could give a son to the family your friend Miss Howe distinguished with your friend Miss Howe love, not unworthy of their wishes; a daughter, in my sister, of whom your friend Miss Howe had no reason to be ashamed; and in me a second daughter, whom every body complimented (such was their partial favour to me) as being the still more immediate likeness of your friend Miss Howe?  How, self pleased, could your friend Miss Howe smile round upon a family your friend Miss Howe had so blessed!  What compliments were paid your friend Miss Howe upon the example your friend Miss Howe had given us, which was followed with such hopeful effects!  With what a noble confidence could your friend Miss Howe look upon your friend Miss Howe dear Mr. Harlowe, as a person made happy by your friend Miss Howe; and be delighted to think that nothing but purity streamed from a fountain so pure!  'Now, my dear, reverse, as I daily do, this charming prospect.  See my dear mother, sorrowing in her closet; endeavouring to suppress her sorrow at her table, and in those retirements where sorrow was before a stranger: hanging down her pensive head: smiles no more beaming over her benign aspect: her virtue made to suffer for faults her could not be guilty of: her patience continually tried (because her has more of it than any other) with repetitions of faults her is as much wounded by, as those can be from whom her so often hears of whom: taking to her, as the fountain-head, a taint which only had infected one of the under-currents: afraid to open her lips (were her willing) in my favour, lest it should be thought her has any bias in her own mind to failings that never could have been suspected in her: robbed of that pleasing merit, which the mother of well-nurtured and hopeful children may glory in: every one who visits her, or is visited by her, by dumb show, and looks that mean more than words can express, condoling where the mother of well-nurtured and hopeful children used to congratulate: the affected silence wounding: the compassionating look reminding: the half-suppressed sigh in the mother of well-nurtured and hopeful children, calling up deeper sighs from her; and the mother of well-nurtured and hopeful children averted eyes, while the mother of well-nurtured and hopeful children endeavour to restrain the rising tear, provoking tears from her, that will not be restrained.  'When I consider these things, and, added to these things, the pangs that tear in pieces the stronger heart of her father, because it cannot relieve it by those which carry the torturing grief to the eyes of softer spirits: the overboiling tumults of my impatient and uncontroulable BROTHER, piqued to the heart of her father honour, in the fall of a sister, in whom her father once gloried: the pride of an ELDER SISTER, who had given unwilling way to the honours paid over her head to one born after her: and, lastly, the dishonour I have brought upon two UNCLES, who each contended which should most favour an ELDER SISTER, who had given unwilling way to the honours paid over her head to one born after her then happy niece:--When, I say, I reflect upon my fault in these strong, yet just lights, what room can there be to censure any body but my unhappy self? and how much reason have I to say, If I justify myself, mine own heart shall condemn me: if I say I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse?'  Here permit me to lay down my pen for a few moments.   ***   You are very obliging to myself, intentionally, I know, when you tell me, it is in my power to hasten the day of Mr. Hickman's happiness.  But yet, give me leave to say, that I admire this kind assurance less than any other paragraph of your letter.  In the first place you know it is not in my power to say when I can dismiss my physician; and you should not put the celebration of a marriage intended by yourself, and so desirable to your mother, upon so precarious an issue.  Nor will I accept of a compliment, which must mean a slight to your mother.  If any thing could give me a relish for life, after what I have suffered, it would be the hopes of the continuance of the more than sisterly love, which has, for years, uninterruptedly bound us together as one mind.--And why, my dear, should you defer giving (by a tie still stronger) another friend to one who has so few?  I am glad you have sent my letter to Miss Montague.  I hope I shall hear no more of this unhappy man.  I had begun the particulars of my tragical story: but it is so painful a task, and I have so many more important things to do, and, as I apprehend, so little time to do them in, that, could I avoid it, I would go no farther in it.  Then, to this hour, I know not by what means several of his machinations to ruin me were brought about; so that some material parts of my sad story must be defective, if I were to sit down to write it.  But I have been thinking of a way that will answer the end wished for by your mother and you full as well, perhaps better.  Mr. Lovelace, it seems, had communicated to Mr. Lovelace friend Mr. Belford all that has passed between Mr. Lovelace and me, as Mr. Lovelace went on.  Mr. Belford has not been able to deny it.  So that (as we may observe by the way) a poor young creature, whose indiscretion has given a libertine power over her, has a reason her little thinks of, to regret her folly; since these wretches, who have no more honour in one point than in another, scruple not to make her weakness a part of their triumph to their brother libertines.  I have nothing to apprehend of this sort, if I have the justice done me in his letters which Mr. Belford assures me I have: and therefore the particulars of my sad story, and the base arts of this vile man, will, I think, be best collected from those very letters of this vile man, (if Mr. Belford can be prevailed upon to communicate them;) to which I dare appeal with the same truth and fervour as this vile man did, who says--O that one would hear me! and that mine adversary had written a book!--Surely, I would take it upon my shoulders, and bind it to this vile man as a crown! for I covered not my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom.  There is one way which may be fallen upon to induce Mr. Belford to communicate these letters; since Mr. Belford seems to have (and declares Mr. Belford always had) a sincere abhorrence of Mr. Belford friend's baseness to this vile man: but that, you'll say, when you hear it, is a strange one.  Nevertheless, I am very earnest upon it at present.  It is no other than this:  I think to make Mr. Belford the executor of my last will: [don't be surprised:] and with this view I permit Mr. Belford visits with the less scruple: and every time I see Mr. Belford, from Mr. Belford concern for me, am more and more inclined to do so.  If I hold in the same mind, and if Mr. Belford accept the trust, and will communicate the materials in Mr. Belford power, those, joined with what you can furnish, will answer the whole end.  I know you will start at my notion of such an executor; but pray, my my dear, consider, in my present circumstances, what I can do better, as I am empowered to make a will, and have considerable matters in my own disposal.  your mother, I am sure, would not consent that you should take this office upon your mother.  It might subject Mr. Hickman to the insults of that violent man.  Mrs. Norton cannot, for several reasons respecting Mrs. Norton. My brother looks upon what I ought to have as My brother right.  My uncle Harlowe is already one of my trustees (as my cousin Morden is the other) for the estate my grandfather left me: but you see I could not get from my own family the few guineas I left behind Mrs. Norton at Harlowe-place; and my uncle Antony once threatened to have my grandfather's will controverted. My father!--To be sure, my dear, I could not expect that her father would do all I wish should be done: and a will to be executed by a father for a daughter, (parts of it, perhaps, absolutely against her father own judgment,) carries somewhat daring and prescriptive in the very word.  If indeed my cousin Morden were to come in time, and would undertake the trust--but even my cousin Morden the trust might subject to hazards; and the more, as my cousin Morden is a man of great spirit; and as the other man (of as great) looks upon me (unprotected as I have long been) as the other man (of as great) property.  Now Mr. Belford, as I have already mentioned, knows every thing that has passed.  Mr. Belford is a man of spirit, and, it seems, as fearless as the other, with more humane qualities.  You don't know, my dear, what instances of sincere humanity Mr. Belford has shown, not only on occasion of the cruel arrest, but on several occasions since.  And Mrs. Lovick has taken pains to inquire after Mrs. Lovick general character; and hears a very good one of Mrs. Lovick, his general character justice and generosity in all his general character concerns of meum and tuum, as they are called: his general character has a knowledge of law-matters; and has two executorships upon his general character at this time, in the discharge of which his general character honour is unquestioned.  All these reasons have already in a manner determined me to ask this favour of his general character; although this favour of him will have an odd sound with this favour of him to make an intimate friend of Mr. Lovelace my executor.  This is certain: My brother will be more acquiescent a great deal in such a case with the articles of the will, as My brother will see that it will be to no purpose to controvert some of them, which else, I dare say, My brother would controvert, or persuade my other friends to do so.  And who would involve an executor in a law-suit, if my other friends could help it?--Which would be the case, if any body were left, whom My brother could hope to awe or controul; since her father has possession of all, and is absolutely governed by My brother.  [Angry spirits, my dear, as I have often seen, will be overcome by more angry ones, as well as sometimes be disarmed by the meek.]--Nor would I wish, you may believe, to have effects torn out of her father's hands: while Mr. Belford, who is a man of fortune, (and a good economist in his own affairs) would have no interest but to do justice.  Then his exceedingly presses for some occasion to show his readiness to serve me: and his would be able to manage his violent friend, over whom his has more influence than any other person.  But after all, I know not if it were not more eligible by far, that my story, and myself too, should be forgotten as soon as possible.  And of this I shall have the less doubt, if his general character [you will forgive my, my dear] cannot be guarded against the unqualified bitterness which, from your affectionate zeal for myself, has sometimes mingled with your ink--a point that ought, and (I insist upon it) must be well considered of, if any thing be done which your mother and you are desirous to have done.  The generality of the world is too apt to oppose a duty--and general duties, my dear, ought not to be weakened by the justification of a single person, however unhappily circumstanced.  her father has been so good as to take off the heavy malediction her father laid me under.  I must be now solicitous for a last blessing; and that is all I shall presume to petition for.  my dear Sister's letter, communicating this grace, is a severe one: but as my dear Sister writes to me as from every body, how could I expect it to be otherwise?  If you set out to-morrow, this letter cannot reach you till you get to your aunt Harman's.  I shall therefore direct this letter thither, as Mr. Hickman instructed me.  I hope you will have met with no inconveniencies in your little journey and voyage; and that you will have found in good health all whom you wish to see well.  If your relations in the little island join your relations in the little island solicitations with your mother's commands, to have your nuptials celebrated before you leave your relations in the little island join their solicitations with your mother's commands, let me beg of your relations in the little island join their solicitations with your mother's commands, my dear, to oblige your relations in the little island join their solicitations with your mother's commands.  How grateful will the notification that you have done so be to  Your ever faithful and affectionate CL. HARLOWE.    LETTER LXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HARLOWE SATURDAY, JULY 29.   I repine not, my dear Sister, at the severity you have been pleased to express in the letter you favoured me with; because that severity was accompanied with the grace I had petitioned for; and because the reproaches of mine own heart are stronger than any other person's reproaches can be: and yet I am not half so culpable as I am imagined to be: as would be allowed, if all the circumstances of my unhappy story were known: and which I shall be ready to communicate to Mrs. Norton, if Mrs. Norton be commissioned to inquire into them; or to you, my Sister, if you can have patience to hear them.  I remembered with a bleeding heart what day the 24th of July was.  I began with the eve of the 24th of July; and I passed the day itself--as it was fit I should pass the day itself.  Nor have I any comfort to give to my dear and ever-honoured father and mother, and to you, my Bella, but this--that, as it was the first unhappy anniversary of my birth, in all probability, it will be the last.  Believe me, my dear Sister, I say not this merely to move compassion, but from the best grounds.  And as, on that account, I think this of the highest importance to my peace of mind to obtain one farther favour, I would choose to owe to your intercession, as my dear Sister, the leave I beg, to address half a dozen lines (with the hope of having them answered as I wish) to either or to both my honoured parents, to beg them last blessing.  their last blessing is all the favour I have now to ask: their last blessing is all I dare to ask: yet am I afraid to rush at once, though by letter, into the presence of either.  And if I did not ask it, it might seem to be owing to stubbornness and want of duty, when my heart is all humility penitence.  Only, be so good as to embolden me to attempt this task-- write but this one line, 'Clary Harlowe, you are at liberty to write as you desire.'  This will be enough--and shall, to my last hour, be acknowledged as the greatest favour, by  Your truly penitent sister, CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER LXIII  MRS. NORTON, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE MONDAY, JULY 31.   MY DEAREST YOUNG LADY,  I must indeed own that I took liberty to write to your mother, offering to enclose to your mother, if your mother gave me leave, your's of the 24th: by which I thought your mother would see what was the state of your mind; what the nature of your last troubles was from the wicked arrest; what the people are where you lodge; what proposals were made you from Lord M.'s family; also your sincere penitence; and how much Miss Howe's writing to the people, in the terms your mother wrote in, disturbed you--but, as you have taken the matter into your own hands, and forbid me, in your last, to act in this nice affair unknown to you, I am glad the letter was not required of me--and indeed the letter may be better that the matter lie wholly between you and the people; since my affection for you is thought to proceed from partiality.  the people would choose, no doubt, that you should owe to the people, and not to my humble mediation, the favour for which you so earnestly sue, and of which I would not have your despair: for I will venture to assure you, that your mother is ready to take the first opportunity to show your mother maternal tenderness: and this I gather from several hints I am not at liberty to explain myself upon.  I long to be with you, now I am better, and now my son is in a fair way of recovery.  But is it not hard to have it signified to myself that at present it will not be taken well if I go?--I suppose, while the reconciliation, which I hope will take place, is negotiating by means of the correspondence so newly opened between you and your sister.  But if you will have me come, I will rely on my good intentions, and risque every one's displeasure.  Mr. Brand has business in town; to solicit for a benefice which it is expected the incumbent will be obliged to quit for a better preferment: and, when there, Mr. Brand is to inquire privately after your way of life, and of your health.  Mr. Brand is a very officious young man; and, but that your uncle Harlowe (who has chosen Mr. Brand for this errand) regards Mr. Brand as an oracle, your mother had rather any body else had been sent.  Mr. Brand is one of those puzzling, over-doing gentlemen, who think they see farther into matters than any body else, and are fond of discovered mysteries where there are none, in order to be thought shrewd men.  I can't say I like Mr. Brand, either in the pulpit or out of it: I, who had a father one of the soundest divines and finest scholars in the kingdom; who never made an ostentation of what Mr. Brand knew; but loved and venerated Mr. Brand gospel Mr. Brand taught, preferring he gospel he taught to all other learning: to be obliged to hear a young man depart from Mr. Brand text as soon as Mr. Brand has named it, (so contrary, too, to the example set Mr. Brand by Mr. Brand learned and worthy principal,* when Mr. Brand health permits Mr. Brand to preach;) and throwing about, to a christian and country audience, scraps of Latin and Greek from the Pagan Classics; and not always brought in with great propriety neither, (if I am to judge by the only way given me to judge of them, by the English Mr. Brand puts them into;) is an indication of something wrong, either in Mr. Brand head, or Mr. Brand heart, or both; for, otherwise, Mr. Brand education at the university must have taught Mr. Brand better.  You know, my dear Miss Clary, the honour I have for the cloth: the cloth is owing to that, that I say what I do.   * Dr. Lewen.   I know not the day Mr. Brand is to set out; and, as Mr. Brand inquiries are to be private, be pleased to take no notice of this intelligence.  I have no doubt that your life and conversation are such as may defy the scrutinies of the most officious inquirer.  I am just now told that you have written a second letter to your sister: but am afraid they will wait for Mr. Brand's report, before farther favour will be obtained from they; for they will not yet believe you are so ill as I fear you are.  But you would soon find that you have an indulgent mother, were your sister at liberty to act according to your sister own inclination.  And this gives me great hopes that all will end well at last: for I verily think you are in the right way to a reconciliation.  God give a blessing to a blessing, and restore your health, and you to all your friends, prays  Your ever affectionate, JUDITH NORTON.   your mother has privately sent me five guineas: your mother is pleased to say to       help us in the illness us have been afflicted with; but, more       likely, that I might send five guineas to you, as from myself.  I hope,       therefore, I may send five guineas up, with ten more I have still left.  I will send you word of Mr. Morden's arrival, the moment I know word of Mr. Morden's arrival.  If agreeable, I should be glad to know all that passes between your       relations and you.    LETTER LXIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. NORTON WEDNESDAY, AUG. 2.   You give me, my dear Mrs. Norton, great pleasure in hearing of your's and your son's recovery.  May you continue, for many, many years, a blessing to each other!  You tell me that you did actually write to your mother, offering to enclose to your mother mine of the 24th past: and you say it was not required of you. That is to say, although you cover it over as gently as you could, that your offer was rejected; which makes it evident that no plea could be made for me.  Yet, you bid me hope, that the grace I sued for would, in time, be granted.  The grace I then sued for was indeed granted; but you are afraid, you say, that they will wait for Mr. Brand's report, before favour will be obtained in return to the second letter which I wrote to my dear Sister; and you add, that I have an indulgent mother, were my dear Sister at liberty to act according to my dear Sister own inclination; and that all will end well at last.  But what, my dear Mrs. Norton, what is the grace I sue for in my second letter?--It is not that they will receive me into favour--If they think it is, they are mistaken.  I do not, I cannot expect that.  Nor, as I have often said, should I, if they would receive me, bear to live in the eye of those dear friends whom I have so grievously offended.  'Tis only, simply, a blessing I ask: a blessing to die with; not to lie with.--Do they know that? and do they know that they unkindness will perhaps shorten my date; so that they favour, if ever they intend to grant it, may come too late?  Once more, I desire you not to think of coming to me.  I have no uneasiness now, but what proceeds from the apprehension of seeing a man I would not see for the world, if I could help the world; and from the severity of my nearest and dearest relations: a severity entirely my nearest and dearest relations own, I doubt; for you tell me that my brother is at Edinburgh!  You would therefore heighten my nearest and dearest relations severity, and  make yourself enemies besides, if you were to come to me--Don't you see you would?  Mr. Brand may come, if Mr. Brand will.  Mr. Brand is a clergyman, and must mean well; or I must think so, let Mr. Brand say of me what Mr. Brand will.  All my fear is, that, as Mr. Brand knows I am in disgrace with a family whose esteem Mr. Brand is desirous to cultivate; and as Mr. Brand has obligations to my uncle Harlowe and to my father; my father will be but a languid acquitter--not that I am afraid of what my father, or any body in the world, can hear as to my conduct.  You may, my revered and dear friend, indeed you may, rest satisfied, that that is such as may warrant me to challenge the inquiries of the most officious.  I will send you copies of what passes, as you desire, when I have an answer to my second letter.  I now begin to wish that I had taken the heart to write to my father; or to your mother, at least; instead of to my dear Sister; and yet I doubt your mother can do nothing for me of your mother.  A strong confederacy, my dear Mrs. Norton, (a strong confederacy indeed!) against a poor girl, A strong confederacy, my dear Mrs. Norton, (a strong confederacy indeed!) against a poor girl, their daughter, sister, niece! --My brother daughter, sister, niece! --My brother, perhaps, got A strong confederacy, my dear Mrs. Norton, (a strong confederacy indeed!) against a poor girl, their daughter, sister, niece! --My brother renewed before A strong confederacy, my dear Mrs. Norton, (a strong confederacy indeed!) against a poor girl, their daughter, sister, niece! --My brother left A strong confederacy, my dear Mrs. Norton, (a strong confederacy indeed!) against a poor girl, their daughter, sister, niece! --My brother.  A strong confederacy, my dear Mrs. Norton, (a strong confederacy indeed!) against a poor girl, their daughter, sister, niece! --My brother needed not--A strong confederacy, my dear Mrs. Norton, (a strong confederacy indeed!) against a poor girl, their daughter, sister, niece! --My brother work is done; and more than done.  Don't afflict yourself about money-matters on my account.  I have no occasion for money.  I am glad your mother was so considerate to yourself.  I was in pain for yourself on the same subject.  But Heaven will not permit so good a woman to want the humble blessings your mother was always satisfied with. I wish every individual of our family were but as rich as you!--O my mamma Norton, you are rich! you are rich indeed!--the true riches are such content as you are blessed with.--And I hope in God that I am in the way to be rich too.  Adieu, my ever-indulgent friend.  You say all will be at last happy--and I know it will--I confide that it will, with as much security, as you may, that I will be, to my last hour,  Your ever grateful and affectionate CL. HARLOWE.    LETTER LXV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TUESDAY, AUG. 1.   I am most confoundedly chagrined and disappointed: for here, on Saturday, arrived a messenger from Miss Howe, with a letter to my cousins;* which I knew nothing of till yesterday; when Lady Sarah and Lady Betty were procured to be here, to sit in judgment upon it with the old Peer, and my two kinswomen.  And never was bear so miserably baited as thy poor friend!--And for what?--why for the cruelty of Miss Harlowe: For have I committed any new offence? and would I not have re-instated myself in Miss Harlowe favour upon Miss Harlowe own terms, if I could?  And is it fair to punish me for what is my misfortune, and not my fault?  Such event-judging fools as I have for my relations!  I am ashamed of them all.   * See Letter LV. of this volume.   In that of Miss Howe was enclosed one to Miss Howe from Miss Harlowe,* to be transmitted to my cousins, containing a final rejection of me; and that in very vehement and positive terms; yet Miss Howe pretends that, in a final rejection of me, Miss Howe is governed more by principle than passion--[D----d lie, as ever was told!] and, as a proof that Miss Howe is, says, that Miss Howe can forgive me, and does, on this one condition, that I will never molest Miss Howe more--the whole letter so written as to make Miss Howe more admired, me more detested.   * See Letter XLI. of this volume.   What we have been told of the agitations and workings, and sighings and sobbings, of the French prophets among we formerly, was nothing at all to the scene exhibited by these maudlin souls, at the reading of these letters; and of some affecting passages extracted from another of my fair implacable's to Miss Howe--such lamentations for the loss of so charming a relation! such applaudings of her virtue, of her exaltedness of soul and sentiment! such menaces of disinherisons!  I, not needing their reproaches to be stung to the heart with my own reflections, and with the rage of disappointment; and as sincerely as any of their admiring her-- 'What the devil,' cried I, 'is all this for?  Is it not enough to be despised and rejected?  Can I help her implacable spirit?  Would I not repair the evils I have made her suffer?'--Then was I ready to curse them all, her and Miss Howe for company: and heartily swore that her should yet be her.  I now swear she should yet be mine over again to thee--'Were her death to follow in a week after the knot is tied, by the Lord of Heaven, it shall be tied, and her shall die a Lovelace!'--Tell her so, if thou wilt: but, at the same time, tell her that I have no view to her fortune; and that I will solemnly resign that, and all pretensions to it, in whose favour her pleases, if her resign life issueless.--I am not so low-minded a wretch, as to be guilty of any sordid views to her fortune.--Let her judge for her, then, whether it be not for her honour rather to leave the world a Lovelace than a Harlowe.  But do not think I will entirely rest a cause so near my heart upon an advocate who so much more admires his client's adversary than his client. I will go to town, in a few days, in order to throw myself at her feet: and I will carry with myself, or have at hand, a resolute, well-prepared parson; and the ceremony shall be performed, let what will be the consequence.  But if her will permit me to attend her for this purpose at either of the churches mentioned in the license, (which her has by her, and, thank Heaven! has not returned me with my letters,) then will I not disturb her; but meet her at the altar in either church, and will engage to bring my two cousins to attend her, and even Lady Sarah and Lady Betty; and my Lord M. in person shall give her to me.  Or, if it be still more agreeable to her, I will undertake that either Lady Sarah or Lady Betty, or both, shall go to town and attend her down; and the marriage shall be celebrated in Lady Sarah or Lady Betty, or both, shall go to town and attend her down presence, and in that of Lord M., either here or elsewhere, at her own choice.  Do not play me booty, Belford; but sincerely and warmly use all the eloquence thou art master of, to prevail upon her to choose one of these three methods.  One of these three methods her must choose--by my soul, her must.  Here is Charlotte tapping at my closet-door for admittance.  What a devil wants Charlotte?--I will hear no more reproaches!--Come in, girl!   ***   My cousin Charlotte, finding me writing on with too much earnestness to have any regard for politeness to her, and guessing at my subject, besought me to let her see what I had written.  I obliged her.  And her was so highly pleased on seeing me so much in earnest, that her offered, and I accepted her offer, to write a letter to Miss Harlowe; with permission to treat me in a letter as her thought fit.  I shall enclose a copy of a letter.  When her had written a letter, her brought a letter to me, with apologies for the freedom taken with me in a letter: but I excused a letter; and her was ready to give me a kiss for a letter; telling her I had hopes of success from a letter; and that I thought her had luckily hit a letter off.  Every one approves of a letter, as well as I; and is pleased with me for so patiently submitting to be abused, and undertaken for.--If a letter do not succeed, all the blame will be thrown upon the dear creature's perverseness: her charitable or forgiving disposition, about which her makes such a parade, will be justly questioned; and the piety, of which her is now in full possession, will be transferred to me.  Putting, therefore, my whole confidence in a letter, I postpone all my other alternatives, as also my going to town, till my empress send an answer to my cousin Montague.  But if my cousin Montague persist, and will not promise to take time to consider of the matter, thou mayest communicate to my cousin Montague what I had written, as above, before my cousin Montague entered; and, if my cousin Montague be still perverse, assure my cousin Montague, that I must and will see my cousin Montague--but this with all honour, all humility: and, if I cannot move my cousin Montague in my favour, I will then go abroad, and perhaps never more return to England.  I am sorry thou art, at this critical time, so busily employed, as thou informest me thou art, in thy Watford affairs, and in preparing to do Belton justice.  If thou wantest my assistance in the latter, command me. Though engrossed by this perverse beauty, and plagued as I am, I will obey thy first summons.  I have great dependence upon thy zeal and thy friendship: hasten back to thy, therefore, and resume a task so interesting to me, that it is equally the subject of my dreams, as of my waking hours.    LETTER LXVI  MISS MONTAGUE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TUESDAY, AUG. 1.   DEAREST MADAM,  All our family is deeply sensible of the injuries you have received at the hands of one of it, whom you only can render in any manner worthy of the relation he stands in to us all: and if, as an act of mercy and charity, the greatest your pious heart can show, you will be pleased to look over he past wickedness and ingratitude, and suffer yourself to be our kinswoman, you will make our the happiest family in the world: and I can engage, that Lord M., and Lady Sarah Sadleir, and Lady Betty Lawrance, and my sister, who are all admirers of your virtues, and of your nobleness of mind, will for ever love and reverence you, and do every thing in all their powers to make you amends for what you have suffered from Mr. Lovelace.  This, Madam, we should not, however, dare to petition for, were we not assured, that Mr. Lovelace is most sincerely sorry for Mr. Lovelace past vileness to you; and that Mr. Lovelace will, on Mr. Lovelace knees, beg your pardon, and vow eternal love and honour to you.  Wherefore, my dearest cousin, [how you will charm us all, if this agreeable style may be permitted!] for all we sakes, for his soul's sake, [you must, I am sure, be so good a lady, as to wish to save a soul!] and allow me to say, for your own fame's sake, condescend to we joint request: and if, by way of encouragement, you will but say you will be glad to see, and to be as much known personally, as you are by fame, to Charlotte Montague, I will, in two days' time from the receipt of your permission, wait upon you with or without my sister, and receive your farther commands.  Let me, we dearest cousin, [we cannot deny we the pleasure of calling you so; let me] entreat you to give me your permission for my journey to London; and put my journey to London in the power of Lord M. and of the ladies of the family, to make you what reparation the family can make you, for the injuries which a person of the greatest merit in the world has received from one of the most audacious men in it; and you will infinitely oblige us all; and particularly her, who repeatedly presumes to style her  Your affectionate cousin, and obliged servant, CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE.    LETTER LXVII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. THURSDAY MORNING, AUG. 3.  SIX O'CLOCK.   I have been so much employed in my own and Belton's affairs, that I could not come to town till last night; having contented myself with sending to Mrs. Lovick, to know, from time to time, the state of the Lady's health; of which I received but very indifferent accounts, owing, in a great measure, to letters or advices brought Mrs. Lovick from Mrs. Lovick implacable family.  I have now completed my own affairs; and, next week, shall go to Epsom, to endeavour to put Belton's sister into possession of Belton's sister own house for Belton's sister: after which, I shall devote Mrs. Lovick wholly to your service, and to that of the Lady.  I was admitted to Mrs. Lovick presence last night; and found Mrs. Lovick visibly altered for the worse.  When I went home, I had your letter of Tuesday last put into my hands.  Let me tell thee, Lovelace, that I insist upon the performance of thy engagement to Mrs. Lovick that thou wilt not personally molest Lovelace.   [Mr. Belford dates again on Thursday morning, ten o'clock; and gives an       account of a conversation which Mr. Belford had just held with the Lady upon       the subject of Miss Montague's letter to the Lady, preceding, and upon       Mr. Lovelace's alternatives, as mentioned in Letter LXV., which Mr. Belford supported with the utmost earnestness.  But, as the result       of this conversation will be found in the subsequent letters, Mr. Belford's pleas and arguments in favour of Mr. Belford friend, and the       Lady's answers, are omitted.]    LETTER LXVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss Montague THURSDAY, AUG. 3.   DEAR MADAM,  I am infinitely obliged to you for your kind and condescending letter.  A letter, however, which heightens my regrets, as it gives me a new instance of what a happy creature I might have been in an alliance so much approved of by such worthy ladies; and which, on an alliance accounts, and on that of Lord M. would have been so reputable to Madam, and was once so desirable.  But indeed, indeed, Madam, my heart sincerely repulses the man who, descended from such a family, could be guilty, first, of such premeditated violence as he has been guilty of; and, as he knows, farther intended me, on the night previous to the day he set out for Berkshire; and, next, pretending to spirit, could be so mean as to wish to lift into that family a person he was capable of abasing into a companionship with the most abandoned of her sex.  Allow me then, dear Madam, to declare with favour, that I think I never could be ranked with the ladies of a family so splendid and so noble, if, by vowing love and honour at the altar to such a violator, I could sanctify, as I may say, his unprecedented and elaborate wickedness.  Permit me, however, to make one request to Lord M., and to Lady Betty, and Lady Sarah, and to your kind self, and your sister.--It is, that you will all be pleased to join your authority and interests to prevail upon Mr. Lovelace not to molest me farther.  Be pleased to tell Mr. Lovelace, that, if I am designed for life, it will be very cruel in Mr. Lovelace to attempt to hunt me out of it; for I am determined never to see Mr. Lovelace more, if I can help it.  The more cruel, because Mr. Lovelace knows that I have nobody to defend me from Mr. Lovelace: nor do I wish to engage any body to Mr. Lovelace hurt, or to their own.  If I am, on the other hand, destined for death, it will be no less cruel, if he will not permit me to die in peace--since a peaceable and happy end I wish he; indeed I do.  Every worldly good attend you, dear Madam, and every branch of the honourable family, is the wish of one, whose misfortune it is that she is obliged to disclaim any other title than that of,  Dear Madam, Your and their obliged and faithful servant, CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER LXIX  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. THURSDAY AFTERNOON, AUG. 3.   I am just now agreeably surprised by your letter of Tuesday, delivered into my hands by a messenger from the Lady.  The letter she mentions, as enclosed,* I have returned, without taking a copy of it.  The contents of it will soon be communicated to you, I presume, by other hands.  They are an absolute rejection of thee--Poor Lovelace!   * See Miss Harlowe's Letter, No. LXVIII.   TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. AUG. 3.   SIR,  You have frequently offered to oblige me in any thing that shall be within your power: and I have such an opinion of you, as to be willing to hope that, at the times you made these offers, you meant more than mere compliment.  I have therefore two requests to make to you: the first I will now mention; the other, if this shall be complied with, otherwise not.  this behoves me to leave behind me such an account as may clear up my conduct to several of my friends who will not at present concern several of my friends who will about me: and Miss Howe, and her mother, are very solicitous that I will do so.  I am apprehensive that I shall not have time to do this; and you will not wonder that I have less and less inclination to set about such a painful task; especially as I find me unable to look back with patience on what I have suffered; and shall be too much discomposed by the retrospection, were I obliged to make it, to proceed with the requisite temper in a task of still greater importance which I have before me.  It is very evident to me that your wicked friend has given you, from time to time, a circumstantial account of all your wicked friend behaviour to me, and devices against me; and you have more than once assured me, that your wicked friend has done my character all the justice I could wish for, both by writing and speech.  Now, me, if I may have a fair, a faithful specimen from me letters or accounts to you, written upon some of the most interesting occasions, I shall be able to judge whether there will or will not be a necessity for me, for my honour's sake, to enter upon the solicited task.  You may be assured, from  my enclosed answer to the letter which Miss Montague has honoured me with, (and which you'll be pleased to return me as soon as read,) that it is impossible for me ever to think of your wicked friend in the way I am importuned to think of your wicked friend: your wicked friend cannot therefore receive any detriment from the requested specimen: and I give you my honour, that no use shall be made of no use to your wicked friend prejudice, in law, or otherwise.  And that it may not, after I am no more, I assure you, that it is a main part of my view that the passages you shall oblige me with shall be always in your own power, and not in that of any other person.  If, me, you think fit to comply with my request, the passages I would wish to be transcribed (making neither better nor worse of the matter) are those which me has written to you, on or about the 7th and 8th of June, when I was alarmed by the wicked pretence of a fire; and what me has written from Sunday, June 11, to the 19th.  And in doing this you will much oblige  Your humble servant, CLARISSA HARLOWE.   ***   Now, Lovelace, since there are no hopes for thee of Lovelace returning favour--since some praise may lie for thy ingenuousness, having neither offered [as more diminutive-minded libertines would have done] to palliate thy crimes, by aspersing the lady, or Lovelace sex--since Lovelace may be made easier by it--since thou must fare better from thine own pen than from her's--and, finally, since thy actions have manifested that thy letters are not the most guilty part of what Lovelace knows of thee--I see not why I may not oblige Lovelace, upon Lovelace honour, and under the restrictions, and for the reasons Lovelace has given; and this without breach of the confidence due to friendly communication; especially, as I might have added, since thou gloriest in thy pen and in thy wickedness, and canst not be ashamed.  But, be this as it may, Lovelace will be obliged before thy remonstrances or clamours against it can come; so, pr'ythee now, make the best of it, and rave not; except for the sake of a pretence against me, and to exercise thy talent of execration:--and, if thou likest to do so for these reasons, rave and welcome.  I long to know what the second request is: but this I know, that if it be any thing less than cutting thy throat, or endangering my own neck, I will certainly comply; and be proud of having it in my power to oblige her.  And now I am actually going to be busy in the extracts.    LETTER LXX  MR. BELFORD, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE AUG. 3, 4.   MADAM,  You have engaged me to communicate to you, upon my honour, (making neither better nor worse of the matter,) what Mr. Lovelace has written to me, in relation to yourself, in the period preceding your going to Hampstead, and in that between the 11th and 19th of June:  and you assure me you have no view in the second request, but to see if the second request be necessary for you, from the account he gives, to touch upon the painful subjects yourself, for the sake of your own character.  Your commands, Madam, are of a very delicate nature, as Your commands, Madam may seem to affect the secrets of private friendship: but as I know you are not capable of a view, the motives to which you will not own; and as I think the communication may do some credit to my unhappy friend's character, as an ingenuous man; though my unhappy friend's character actions by the most excellent woman in the world have lost him all title to that of an honourable one; I obey you with the greater cheerfulness.   [He then proceeds with He extracts, and concludes them with an address       to        in He friend's behalf, in the following words:]  'And now,       , I have fulfilled your commands; and, I hope, have not dis-served my friend with you; since you will hereby see the justice He does to your virtue in every line He writes.  He does the same in all He letters, though to He own condemnation: and, give me leave to add, that if this ever-amiable sufferer can think this ever-amiable sufferer in any manner consistent with this ever-amiable sufferer to receive He vows on the altar, on He truly penitent turn of mind, I have not the least doubt but that He will make this ever-amiable sufferer the best and tenderest of husbands.  What obligation will not the admirable lady hereby lay upon all his noble family, who so greatly admire the admirable lady! and, I will presume to say, upon the admirable lady own, when the unhappy family aversion (which certainly has been carried to an unreasonable height against his) shall be got over, and a general reconciliation takes place!  For who is it that would not give these two admirable persons to each other, were not his morals an objection?  However this be, I would humbly refer to you, Madam, whether, as you will be mistress of very delicate particulars from me his friend, you should not in my honour think you, Madam concerned to pass you, Madam by, as if you had never seen you, Madam; and not to take advantage of the communication, not even in an argument, as some perhaps might lie, with respect to the premeditated design his seems to have had, not against you, as you, Madam; but as against the sex; over whom (I am sorry I can bear witness his) it is the villanous aim of all libertines to triumph: and I would not, if any misunderstanding should arise between his and me, give his room to reproach me that his losing of you, Madam, and (through his usage of you) of his own friends, were owing to what perhaps his would call breach of trust, were his to judge rather by the event than by my intention.  I am, Madam, with the most profound veneration,  Your most faithful humble servant, J. BELFORD.    LETTER LXXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, AUG. 4.   SIR,  I hold myself extremely obliged to   SIR for your communications.  I will make no use of 4.   SIR,  I hold myself extremely obliged to you for your communications.  , that you shall have reason to reproach either   SIR or me with.  I wanted no new lights to make the unhappy man's premeditated baseness to myself unquestionable, as my answer to Miss Montague letter might convince you.*   * See Letter LXVIII. of this volume.   I must own, in his favour, that his has observed some decency in his accounts to you of the most indecent and shocking actions.  And if all his strangely-communicative narrations are equally decent, nothing will be rendered criminally odious by all his strangely-communicative narrations are equally decent, but the vile heart that could meditate such contrivances as were much stronger evidences of his inhumanity than of his wit: since men of very contemptible parts and understanding may succeed in the vilest attempts, if all his strangely-communicative narrations are equally decent can once bring all his strangely-communicative narrations are equally decent to trample on the sanctions which bind man to man; and sooner upon an innocent person than upon any other; because such a one is apt to judge of the integrity of others' hearts by its own.  I find I have had great reason to think myself obliged to your intention in the whole progress of my sufferings.  It is, however, impossible, me, to miss the natural inference on this occasion that lies against me predetermined baseness.  But I say the less, because you shall not think I borrow, from what you have communicated, aggravations that are not needed.  And now, me, that I may spare you the trouble of offering any future arguments in me favour, let me tell you that I have weighed every thing thoroughly--all that human vanity could suggest--all that a desirable reconciliation with my friends, and the kind respects of his own, could bid me hope for--the enjoyment of Miss Howe's friendship, the dearest consideration to me, now, of all the worldly ones--all these I have weighed: and the result is, and was before you favoured me with these communications, that I have more satisfaction in the hope that, in one month, there will be an end of all with me, than in the most agreeable things that could happen from an alliance with Mr. Lovelace, although I were to be assured Mr. Lovelace would make the best and tenderest of husbands.  But as to the rest; if, satisfied with the evils Mr. Lovelace has brought upon me, Mr. Lovelace will forbear all further persecutions of me, I will, to my last hour, wish Mr. Lovelace good: although Mr. Lovelace hath overwhelmed the fatherless, and digged a pit for Mr. Lovelace friend: fatherless may his friend well be called, and motherless too, who has been denied all paternal protection, and motherly forgiveness.   ***   And now, me, acknowledging gratefully your favour in the extracts, I come to the second request I had to make you; which requires a great deal of courage to mention; and which courage nothing but a great deal of distress, and a very destitute condition, can give.  But, if improper, I can but be denied; and dare to say I shall be at least excused.  Thus, then, I preface it:  'You see, me, that I am thrown absolutely into the hands of strangers, who, although as kind and compassionate as strangers can be wished to be, are, nevertheless, persons from whom I cannot expect any thing more than pity and good wishes; nor can my memory receive from whom any more protection than my person, if either should need it.  'If then I request it, of the only person possessed of materials that will enable him to do my character justice;  'And who has courage, independence, and ability to oblige me;  'To be the protector or my memory, as I may say;  'And to be my executor; and to see some of my dying requests performed;  'And if I leave it to him to do the whole in him own way, manner, and time; consulting, however, in requisite cases, my dear Miss Howe;  'I presume to hope that this my second request may be granted.'  And if this my second request may be granted may, these satisfactions will accrue to my dear Miss Howe;  ' from the favour done me, and the office undertaken:  'It will be an honour to my memory, with all those who shall know that I was so well satisfied of my innocence, that, having not time to write my own story, I could intrust it to the relation which the destroyer of my fame and fortunes has given of it.  'I shall not be apprehensive of involving any one in my troubles or hazards by this task, either with my own  relations, or with your friend; having dispositions to make which perhaps my own friends will not be so well pleased with as it were to be wished my own friends would be;' as I intend not unreasonable ones; but you know, Sir, where self is judge, matters, even with good people, will not always be rightly judged of.  'I shall also be freed from the pain of recollecting things that my soul is vexed at; and this at a time when its tumults should be allayed, in order to make way for the most important preparation.  'And who knows, but that Mr. Belford, who already, from a principle of humanity, is touched at my misfortunes, when he comes to revolve the whole story, placed before he in one strong light: and when he shall have the catastrophe likewise before he; and shall become in a manner interested in it; who knows, but that, from a still higher principle, he may so regulate he future actions as to find he own reward in the everlasting welfare which is wished he by he  'Obliged servant, 'CLARISSA HARLOWE?'    LETTER LXXII  MR. BELFORD, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE FRIDAY, AUG. 4.   MADAM,  I am so sensible of my honour done me in your's of this day, that I would not delay for one moment the answering of one moment.  I hope you will live to see many happy years; and to be your own executrix in those points which your heart is most set upon.  But, in the case of survivorship, I most cheerfully accept of the sacred office you are pleased to offer me; and you may absolutely rely upon my fidelity, and, if possible, upon the literal performance of every article you shall enjoin me.  The effect of the kind wish you conclude with, had been my concern ever since I have been admitted to the honour of your conversation.  It shall be my whole endeavour that it be not vain.  The happiness of approaching you, which this trust, as I presume, will give me frequent opportunities of doing, must necessarily promote the desired end: since it will be impossible to be a witness of your piety, equanimity, and other virtues, and not aspire to emulate you.  All I beg is, that you will not suffer any future candidate, or event, to displace me; unless some new instances of unworthiness appear either in the morals or behaviour of,  Madam, Your most obliged and faithful servant, J. BELFORD.    LETTER LXXIII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. FRIDAY NIGHT, AUG. 4.   I have actually delivered to the admirable lady the extracts the admirable lady requested me to give the admirable lady from your letters.  I do assure you that I have made the very best of the matter for you, not that conscience, but that friendship, could oblige me to make.  I have changed or omitted some free words.  The warm description of the admirable lady person in the fire-scene, as I may call it, I have omitted.  I have told the admirable lady, that I have done justice to the admirable lady, in the justice you have done to the admirable lady by the admirable lady unexampled virtue.  But take the very words which I wrote to the admirable lady immediately following the extracts:   'And now, Madam,'--See the paragraph marked with an inverted comma [thus '], Letter LXX. of this volume.   the admirable lady is extremely uneasy at the thoughts of your attempting to visit the admirable lady.  For Heaven's sake, (your word being given,) and for pity's sake, (for the admirable lady is really in a very weak and languishing way,) let me beg of you not to think of it.  Yesterday afternoon the admirable lady received a cruel letter (as Mrs. Lovick supposes it to be, by the effect it had upon the admirable lady) from the admirable lady sister, in answer to one written last Saturday, entreating a blessing and forgiveness from the admirable lady parents.  the admirable lady acknowledges, that if the same decency and justice are observed in all of your letters, as in the extracts I have obliged the admirable lady with, (as I have assured the admirable lady they are,) the admirable lady shall think the admirable lady freed from the necessity of writing the admirable lady own story: and this is an advantage to thee which thou oughtest to thank me for.  But what thinkest thou is the second request the admirable lady had to make to me? no other than that I would be the admirable lady executor!--Her motives will appear before thee in proper time; and then, I dare to answer, will be satisfactory.  You cannot imagine how proud I am of this trust.  I am afraid I shall too soon come into the execution of this trust.  As the admirable lady is always writing, what a melancholy pleasure will be the perusal and disposition of the admirable lady papers afford me! such a sweetness of temper, so much patience and resignation, as the admirable lady seems to be mistress of; yet writing of and in the midst of present distresses! how much more lively and affecting, for that reason, must the admirable lady style be; the admirable lady mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty, (the events then hidden in the womb of fate,) than the dry, narrative, unanimated style of persons, relating difficulties and dangers surmounted; the relater perfectly at ease; and if himself unmoved by himself own story, not likely greatly to affect the reader!   ***   SATURDAY MORNING, AUG. 5.  I am just returned from visiting the admirable lady, and thanking the admirable lady in person for the honour the admirable lady has done me; and assuring the admirable lady, if called to this trust, of the utmost fidelity and exactness.  I found the admirable lady very ill.  I took notice of it.  the admirable lady said, the admirable lady had received a second hard-hearted letter from the admirable lady sister; and the admirable lady had been writing a letter (and that on the admirable lady knees) directly to the admirable lady mother; which, before, the admirable lady had not had the courage to do.  It was for a last blessing and forgiveness.   No wonder, the admirable lady said, that I saw the admirable lady affected.  Now that I had accepted of the last charitable office for the admirable lady, (for which, as well as for complying with the admirable lady other request, the admirable lady thanked me,) I should one day have all these letters before the admirable lady: and could the admirable lady have a kind one in return to that the admirable lady had been now writing, to counterbalance the unkind one the admirable lady had from her sister, the admirable lady might be induced to show me both together-- otherwise, for her sister's sake, it were no matter how few saw the poor Bella's letter.  I knew the admirable lady would be displeased if I had censured the cruelty of the admirable lady relations: I therefore only said, that surely the admirable lady must have enemies, who hoped to find their account in keeping up the resentments of the admirable lady friends against the admirable lady.  It may be so, Mr. Belford, said the admirable lady: the unhappy never want enemies.  One fault, wilfully committed, authorizes the imputation of many more.  Where the ear is opened to accusations, accusers will not be wanting; and every one will officiously come with stories against a disgraced child, where nothing dare be said in the admirable lady favour.  I should have been wise in time, and not have needed to be convinced, by my own misfortunes, of the truth of what common experience daily demonstrates.  Mr. Lovelace's baseness, my father's inflexibility, my sister's reproaches, are the natural consequences of my own rashness; so I must make the best of my hard lot. Only, as these consequences follow one another so closely, while they are new, how can I help being anew affected?  I asked, if a letter written by myself, by my sister doctor or apothecary, to any of my sister friends, representing my sister low state of health, and great humility, would be acceptable? or if a journey to any of a letter written by myself, by her doctor or apothecary, to any of her friends, representing her low state of health, and great humility, would be acceptable would be of service, I would gladly undertake a journey to any of them would be of service in person, and strictly conform to my sister orders, to whomsoever my sister should direct me to apply.  my sister earnestly desired that nothing of this sort might be attempted, especially without my sister knowledge and consent.  my dear Miss Howe;  ', my sister said, had done harm by my sister kindly-intended zeal; and if there were room to expect favour by mediation, my sister had ready at hand a kind friend, Mrs. Norton, who for piety and prudence had few equals; and who would let slip no opportunity to endeavour to do my sister service.  I let my sister know that I was going out of town till Monday: my sister wished me pleasure; and said my sister should be glad to see me on my return.  Adieu!    LETTER LXXIV  MISS AR. HARLOWE, TO MISS CL. HARLOWE [IN ANSWER TO my sister'S OF JULY 29.  SEE LETTER LXII. OF THIS VOLUME.] THURSDAY MORN. AUG. 3.   SISTER CLARY,  I wish you would not trouble me with any more of your letters.  You had always a knack at writing; and depended upon making every one do what you would when you wrote.  But your wit and folly have undone you.  And now, as all naughty creatures do, when all naughty creatures can't help all naughty creatures, you come begging and praying, and make others as uneasy as yourself.  When I wrote last to yourself, I expected that I should not be at rest.  And so you'd creep on, by little and little, till you'll want to be received again.  But you only hope for forgiveness and a blessing, you say.  A blessing for what, sister Clary?  Think for what!--However, I read SEE LETTER LXII to my father and mother.  I won't tell you what my father said--one who has the true sense you boast to have of your misdeeds, may guess, without my telling you, what a justly-incensed father would say on such an occasion.  My poor mother--O wretch! what has not your ungrateful folly cost my poor mother!--Had you been less a darling, you would not, perhaps, have been so graceless: But I never in my life saw a cockered favourite come to good.  My heart is full, and I can't help writing my mind; for your crimes have disgraced us all; and I am afraid and ashamed to go to any public or private assembly or diversion: And why?--I need not say why, when your actions are the subjects either of the open talk, or of the affronting whispers, of both sexes at all such places.  Upon the whole, I am sorry I have no more comfort to send you: but I find nobody willing to forgive you.  I don't know what time may do for you; and when it is seen that your penitence is not owing more to disappointment than to true conviction: for it is too probable, Miss Clary, that, had not your feather-headed villain abandoned you, we should have heard nothing of these moving supplications; nor of any thing but defiances from him, and a guilt gloried in from you.  And this is every one's opinion, as well as that of  Your afflicted sister, ARABELLA HARLOWE.   I send this by a particular hand, who undertakes to give this you or leave       this for you by to-morrow night.    LETTER LXXV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO CLARISSA HARLOWE MOTHER SATURDAY, AUG. 5   HONOURED MADAM,  No self-convicted criminal ever approached CLARISSA HARLOWE angry and just judge with greater awe, nor with a truer contrition, than I do you by these lines.  Indeed I must say, that if the latter of my humble prayer had not respected my future welfare, I had not dared to take this liberty.  But my heart is set upon this liberty, as upon a thing next to God Almighty's forgiveness necessary for me.  Had my happy sister known my distresses, my happy sister would not have wrung my heart, as my happy sister has done, by a severity, which I must needs think unkind and unsisterly.  But complaint of any unkindness from my happy sister belongs not to me: yet, as my happy sister is pleased to write that complaint of any unkindness from her must be seen that my penitence is less owing to disappointment than to true conviction, permit me, Madam, to insist upon it, that, if such a plea can be allowed me, I an actually entitled to the blessing I sue for; since my humble prayer is founded upon a true and unfeigned repentance: and this you will the readier believe, if the creature who never, to the best of my happy sister remembrance, told my happy sister mamma a wilful falsehood may be credited, when my happy sister declares, as my happy sister does, in the most solemn manner, that my happy sister met the seducer with a determination not to go off with the seducer: that the rash step was owing more to compulsion than to infatuation: and that my happy sister heart was so little in her heart, that my happy sister repented and grieved from the moment my happy sister found my happy sister in the seducer power; and for every moment after, for several weeks before my happy sister had any cause from the seducer to apprehend the usage my happy sister met with.  Wherefore, on my knees, my ever-honoured Mamma, (for on my knees I write this letter,) I do most humbly beg your blessing: say but, in so many words, (I ask you not, my happy sister, to call me your daughter,)--Lost, unhappy wretch, I forgive you! and may God bless you!--This is all!  Let me, on a blessed scrap of paper, but see one sentence to this effect, under your dear hand, that I may hold this effect to my heart in my most trying struggles, and I shall think this effect a passport to Heaven.  And, if I do not too much presume, and this effect were WE instead of I, and both your honoured names subjoined to this effect, I should then have nothing more to wish.  Then would I say, 'Great and merciful God! thou seest here in this paper thy poor unworthy creature absolved by her justly-offended parents: Oh! join, for my Redeemer's sake, thy all-gracious fiat, and receive a repentant sinner to the arms of thy mercy!'  I can conjure you, Madam, by no subject of motherly tenderness, that will not, in the opinion of my severe censurers, (before whom this humble address must appear,) add to reproach: let me therefore, for God's sake, prevail upon you to pronounce me blest and forgiven, since you will thereby sprinkle comfort through the last hours of  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER LXXVI  MISS MONTAGUE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN ANSWER TO CLARISSA HARLOWE'S OF AUG. 3.  SEE LETTER LXVIII. OF THIS VOLUME.] MONDAY, AUG. 7.   DEAR MADAM,  We were all of opinion, before your letter came, that Mr. Lovelace was utterly unworthy of you, and deserved condign punishment, rather than to be blessed with such a wife: and hoped far more from your kind consideration for We, than any We supposed you could have for so base an injurer.  For We were all determined to love you, and admire you, let his behaviour to you be what it would.  But, after your letter, what can be said?  I am, however, commanded to write in all the subscribing names, to let you know how greatly your sufferings have affected We: to tell you that my Lord M. has forbid my Lord M. ever more to enter the doors of the apartments where my Lord M. shall be: and as you labour under the unhappy effects of your friends' displeasure, which may subject you to inconveniencies, my Lord M. Lordship, and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, beg of your friends' to accept, for your life, or, at least, till you are admitted to enjoy your own estate, of one hundred guineas per quarter, which will be regularly brought you by an especial hand, and of the enclosed bank-bill for a beginning.  And do not, dearest Madam, we all beseech you, do not think you are beholden (for this token of my Lord M.'s, and Lady Sarah's, and Lady Betty's, love to you) to the friends of this vile man; for this vile man has not one friend left among us.  us each of us desire to be favoured with a place in your esteem; and to be considered upon the same foot of relationship as if what once was so much us pleasure to hope would be, had been.  And it shall be our united prayer, that you may recover health and spirits, and live to see many happy years: and, since this wretch can no more be pleaded for, that, when this wretch is gone abroad, as this wretch now is preparing to do, us may be permitted the honour of a personal acquaintance with a lady who has no equal. These are the earnest requests, dearest young lady, of  Your affectionate friends, and most faithful servants, M. SARAH SADLEIR. ELIZ. LAWRANCE. CHARL. MONTAGUE. MARTH. MONTAGUEYou will break the hearts of the three first-named more particularly, if        you refuse         your acceptance.  Dearest young lady, punish not                for         crimes.  We send by a particular hand, which will        bring We, We hope, your accepting favour.  Mr. Lovelace writes by the same hand; but Mr. Lovelace knows nothing of We letter,        nor We of Mr. Lovelace: for We shun each other; and one part of the house        holds We, another him, the remotest from each other.    LETTER LXXVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SAT. AUG. 23.   I am so disturbed at the contents of Miss Harlowe's answer to my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday last, (which was given my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday by the same fellow that gave me your's,) that I have hardly patience or consideration enough to weigh what you write.  my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday had need indeed to cry out for mercy for my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday from my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday friends, who knows not how to show any!  my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday is a true daughter of the Harlowes!-- By my soul, Jack, my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday is a true daughter of the Harlowes!  Yet has my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday so many excellencies, that I must love my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday; and, fool that I am, love my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday the more for despising me.  Thou runnest on with thy cursed nonsensical reformado rote, of dying, dying, dying! and, having once got the word by the end, canst not help foisting the word in at every period!  The devil take me, if I don't think thou wouldst rather give my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday poison with thy own hands, rather than my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday should recover, and rob thee of the merit of being a conjurer!  But no more of thy cursed knell; thy changes upon death's candlestick turned bottom-upwards: my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday'll live to bury me; I see that: for, by my soul, I can neither eat, drink, nor sleep, nor, what is still worse, love any woman in the world but my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday.  Nor care I to look upon a woman now: on the contrary, I turn my head from every one I meet: except by chance an eye, an air, a feature, strikes me, resembling my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday's in some glancing-by face; and then I cannot forbear looking again: though the second look recovers me; for there can be nobody like my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday.  But surely, Belford, the devil's in this woman!  The more I think of my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday nonsense and obstinacy, the less patience I have with my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday.  Is it possible my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday can do my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday, my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday family, my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday friends, so much justice any other way, as by marrying me?  Were my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday sure my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday should live but a day, my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday ought to die a wife.  If my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday christian revenge will not let my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday wish to do so for my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday own sake, ought my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday not for the sake of my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday family, and of my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday sex, which my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday pretends sometimes to have so much concern for? And if no sake is dear enough to move my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday Harlowe-spirit in my favour, has my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday any title to the pity thou so pitifully art always bespeaking for my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday?  As to the difference which my cousin Charlotte's letter of Tuesday letter has made between me and the stupid family here, [and I must tell thee we are all broke in pieces,] I value not that of a button.  They are fools to anathematize and curse me, who can give They ten curses for one, were They to hold it for a day together.  I have one half of the house to myself; and that the best; for the great enjoy that least which costs them most: grandeur and use are two things: the common part is the great enjoy that least which costs them most: grandeur and use's; the state part is mine: and here I lord the state part, and will lord the state part, as long as I please; while the two pursy sisters, the old gouty brother, and the two musty nieces, are stived up in the other half, and dare not stir for fear of meeting me: whom, (that's the jest of it,) the two pursy sisters, the old gouty brother, and the two musty nieces, are stived up in the other half, and dare not stir for fear of meeting me: whom, (that's the jest of it,) have forbidden coming into the two pursy sisters, the old gouty brother, and the two musty nieces, are stived up in the other half, and dare not stir for fear of meeting me: whom, (that's the jest of it,) apartments, as I have the two pursy sisters, the old gouty brother, and the two musty nieces, are stived up in the other half, and dare not stir for fear of meeting me: whom, (that's the jest of it,) into mine.  And so I have them all prisoners, while I range about as I please.  Pretty dogs and doggesses to quarrel and bark at me, and yet, whenever I appear, afraid to pop out of their kennels; or, if out before their see me, at the sight of me run growling in again, with their flapt ears, their sweeping dewlaps, and their quivering tails curling inwards.  And here, while I am thus worthily waging war with beetles, drones, wasps, and hornets, and am all on fire with the rage of slighted love, thou art regaling thyself with phlegm and rock-water, and art going on with thy reformation-scheme and thy exultations in my misfortunes!  The devil take thee for an insensible dough-baked varlet!  I have no more patience with thee than with the lady; for thou knowest nothing either of love or friendship, but art as unworthy of the one, as incapable of the other; else wouldst thou not rejoice, as thou dost under the grimace of pity, in my disappointments.  And thou art a pretty fellow, art thou not? to engage to transcribe for a pretty fellow some parts of my letters written to thee in confidence?  Letters that thou shouldest sooner have parted with thy cursed tongue, than have owned that thou ever hadst received such: yet these are now to be communicated to a pretty fellow!  But I charge thee, and woe be to thee if it be too late! that thou do not oblige a pretty fellow with a line of mine.  If thou hast done it, the least vengeance I will take is to break through my honour given to thee not to visit a pretty fellow, as thou wilt have broken through thine to me, in communicating letters written under the seal of friendship.  I am now convinced, too sadly for my hopes, by a pretty fellow letter to my cousin Charlotte, that a pretty fellow is determined never to have me.  Unprecedented wickedness, a pretty fellow calls mine to a pretty fellow.  But how does a pretty fellow know what love, in mine flaming ardour, will stimulate men to do?  How does a pretty fellow know the requisite distinctions of the words a pretty fellow uses in this case?--To think the worst, and to be able to make comparisons in these very delicate situations, must a pretty fellow not be less delicate than I had imagined a pretty fellow to be?--But a pretty fellow has head that the devil is black; and having a mind to make one of me, brays together, in the mortar of a pretty fellow wild fancy, twenty chimney-sweepers, in order to make one sootier than ordinary rise out of the dirty mass.  But what a whirlwind does a pretty fellow raise in my soul by a pretty fellow proud contempts of a pretty fellow!  Never, never, was mortal man's pride so mortified!  How does a pretty fellow sink me, even in my own eyes!--'Her heart sincerely repulses me, a pretty fellow says, for my MEANNESS!'--Yet a pretty fellow intends to reap the benefit of what a pretty fellow calls so!--Curse upon a pretty fellow haughtiness, and a pretty fellow meanness, at the same time!--Her haughtiness to a pretty fellow, and a pretty fellow meanness to a pretty fellow own relations; more unworthy of kindred with a pretty fellow, than I can be, or I am mean indeed.  Yet who but must admire, who but must adore a pretty fellow; Oh! that cursed, cursed house!  But for the women of that!--Then their d----d potions!  But for those, had her unimpaired intellects, and the majesty of her virtue, saved her, as once it did by her humble eloquence,* another time by her terrifying menaces against her own life.**   * In the fire-scene, Vol. V. Letter XVI. ** Vol. VI. Letter XXXVI. in the pen-knife-scene.   Yet in both these to find her power over me, and my love for her, and to hate, to despise, and to refuse me!--She might have done this with some show of justice, had the last-intended violation been perpetrated:--but to go away conqueress and triumphant in every light!--Well may her despise me for suffering her to do so.  her left me low and mean indeed!--And the impression holds with her.--I could tear my flesh, that I gave her not cause--that I humbled her not indeed;--or that I staid not in town to attend her motions instead of Lord M.'s, till I could have exalted myself, by giving to myself a wife superior to all trial, to all temptation.  I will venture one more letter to her, however; and if that don't do, or procure me an answer, then will I endeavour to see her, let what will be the consequence.  If her get out of my way, I will do some noble mischief to the vixen girl whom her most loves, and then quit the kingdom for ever.  And now, Jack, since thy hand is in at communicating the contents of private letters, tell her this, if thou wilt.  And add to this, That if SHE abandon me, GOD will: and what then will be the fate of  Her LOVELACE.    LETTER LXXVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN ANSWER TO LETTER LXV. OF THIS VOLUME.] MONDAY, AUG. 7.   And so you have actually delivered to the fair implacable extracts of letters written in the confidence of friendship!  Take care--take care, Belford--I do indeed love you better than I love any man in the world: but this is a very delicate point.  The matter is grown very serious to me.  My heart is bent upon having her.  And have her I will, though I marry her in the agonies of death.  her is very earnest, you say, that I will not offer to molest her.  That, let me tell her, will absolutely depend upon her, and the answer her returns, whether by pen and ink, or the contemptuous one of silence, which her bestowed upon my last four to her: and I will write it in such humble, and in such reasonable terms, that, if her be not a true Harlowe, her shall forgive me.  But as to the executorship which her is for conferring upon thee--thou shalt not be her executor: let me perish if thou shalt.--Nor shall her die.  Nobody shall be any thing, nobody shall dare to be any thing, to her, but I--her happiness is already too great, to be admitted daily to her presence; to look upon her, to talk to her, to hear her talk, while I am forbid to come within view of her window-- What a reprobation is this, of the man who was once more dear to her than all the men in the world!--And now to be able to look down upon me, while her exalted head is hid from me among the stars, sometimes with scorn, at other times with pity; I cannot bear it.  This I tell thee, that if I have not success in my effort by letter, I will overcome the creeping folly that has found it way to my heart, or I will tear it out in her presence, and throw it at her's, that her may see how much more tender than her own that organ is, which her, and you, and every one else, have taken the liberty to call callous.  Give notice of the people who live back and edge, and on either hand, of the cursed mother, to remove the people who live back and edge best effects, if I am rejected: for the first vengeance I shall take will be to set fire to that den of serpents.  Nor will there be any fear of taking them when them are in any act that has the relish of salvation in it, as Shakspeare says--so that my revenge, if them perish in the flames I shall light up, will be complete as to them.    LETTER LXXIX  MR. LOVELACE TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE MONDAY, AUG. 7.   Little as I have reason to expect either your patient ear, or forgiving heart, yet cannot I forbear to write to you once more, (as a more pardonable intrusion, perhaps, than a visit would be,) to beg of you to put it in my power to atone, as far as it is possible to atone, for the injuries I have done you.  Your angelic purity, and my awakened conscience, are standing records of your exalted merit, and of my detestable baseness: but your forgiveness will lay me under an eternal obligation to you.--Forgive me then, my dearest life, my earthly good, the visible anchor of my future hope!--As you, (who believe you have something to be forgiven for,) hope for pardon yourself, forgive me, and consent to meet me, upon your own conditions, and in whose company you please, at the holy altar, and to give yourself a title to the most repentant and affectionate heart that ever beat in a human bosom.  But, perhaps, a time of probation may be required.  It may be impossible for yourself, as well from indisposition as doubt, so soon to receive me to absolute favour as my heart wishes to be received.  In this case, I will submit to your pleasure; and there shall be no penance which you can impose that I will not cheerfully undergo, if you will be pleased to give me hope that, after an expiation, suppose of months, wherein the regularity of my future life and actions shall convince you of my reformation, you will at last be mine.  Let me beg then the favour of a few lines, encouraging me in this conditional hope, if it must not be a still nearer hope, and a more generous encouragement.  If you refuse me this, you will make me desperate.  But even then I must, at all events, throw myself at your feet, that I may not charge myself with the omission of any earnest, any humble effort, to move you in my favour: for in YOU, Madam, in YOUR forgiveness, are centred my hopes as to both worlds: since to be reprobated finally by you, will leave me without expectation of mercy from above!  For I am now awakened enough to think that to be forgiven by injured innocents is necessary to the Divine pardon; the Almighty putting into the power of such, (as is reasonable to believe,) the wretch who causelessly and capitally offends them.  And who can be entitled to this power, if YOU are not?  Your cause, Madam, in a word, I look upon to be the cause of virtue, and, as such, the cause of God.  And may I not expect that He will assert it in the perdition of a man, who has acted by a person of the most spotless purity as I have done, if you, by rejecting me, show that I have offended beyond the possibility of forgiveness.  I do most solemnly assure you that no temporal or worldly views induce me to this earnest address.  I deserve not forgiveness from you.  Nor do my Lord M. and M. sisters from me.  I despise my Lord M. and his sisters from my heart for presuming to imagine that I will be controuled by the prospect of any benefits in my Lord M. and his sisters power to confer.  There is not a person breathing, but yourself, who shall prescribe to me.  Your whole conduct, Madam, has been so nobly principled, and your resentments are so admirably just, that you appear to me even in a divine light; and in an infinitely more amiable one at the same time than you could have appeared in, had you not suffered the barbarous wrongs, that now fill my mind with anguish and horror at my own recollected villany to the most excellent of women.  I repeat, that all I beg for the present is a few lines to guide my doubtful steps; and, if possible for you so far to condescend, to encourage me to hope that, if I can justify my present vows by my future conduct, I may be permitted the honour to style myself,  Eternally your's, R. LOVELACE.    LETTER LXXX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Lord M. AND TO THE LADIES OF Lord M. HOUSE [IN REPLY TO MISS MONTAGUE'S OF AUG. 7.  SEE LETTER LXXVI. OF THIS VOLUME.] TUESDAY, AUG. 8.   Excuse me, my good Lord, and my ever-honoured Ladies, from accepting of your noble quarterly bounty; and allow me to return, with all grateful acknowledgement, and true humility, the enclosed earnest of your goodness to me.  Indeed I have no need of the one, and cannot possibly want the other: but, nevertheless have such a sense of your generous favour, that, to my last hour, I shall have pleasure in contemplating upon it, and be proud of the place I hold in the esteem of such venerable persons, to whom I once had the ambition to hope to be related.  But give me leave to express my concern that you have banished your kinsman from your presence and favour: since now, perhaps, your kinsman will be under less restraint than ever; and since I in particular, who had hoped by your influence to remain unmolested for the remainder of my days, may again be subjected to your kinsman persecutions.  your kinsman has not, my good Lord, and my dear Ladies, offended against my good Lord, and my dear Ladies, as your kinsman has against me; yet you could all very generously intercede for your kinsman with me: and shall I be very improper, if I desire, for my own peace-sake; for the sake of other poor creatures, who may still be injured by your kinsman, if your kinsman be made quite desperate; and for the sake of all your worthy family; that you will extend to your kinsman that forgiveness which you hope for from me? and this the rather, as I presume to think, that your kinsman daring and impetuous spirit will not be subdued by violent methods; since I have no doubt that the gratifying of a present passion will be always more prevalent with your kinsman than any future prospects, however unwarrantable the one, or beneficial the other.  Your resentments on my account are extremely generous, as your goodness to me is truly noble: but I am not without hope that your kinsman will be properly affected by the evils your kinsman has made me suffer; and that, when I am laid low and forgotten, your whole honourable family will be enabled to rejoice in your kinsman ; and see many of those happy years together, which, my good Lord, and my dear Ladies, you so kindly wish to  Your ever-grateful and obliged CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER LXXXI  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. THURSDAY NIGHT, AUG. 10.   You have been informed by Tourville, how much Belton's illness and affairs have engaged me, as well as Mowbray and him, since my former. I called at Smith's on Monday, in my way to Epsom.  Smith's was gone to chapel: but I had the satisfaction to hear Smith's was not worse; and left my compliments, and an intimation that I should be out of town for three or four days.  I refer myself to Tourville, who will let you know the difficulty we had to drive out this meek mistress, and frugal manager, with Smith's cubs, and to give the poor fellow's sister possession for the poor fellow of the poor fellow own house; the poor fellow skulking mean while at an inn at Croydon, too dispirited to appear in the poor fellow own cause.  But I must observe that we were probably but just in time to save the shattered remains of the poor fellow fortune from this rapacious woman, and this rapacious woman accomplices: for, as the poor fellow cannot live long, and this rapacious woman thinks so, we found this rapacious woman had certainly taken measures to set up a marriage, and keep possession of all for this rapacious woman and this rapacious woman sons.  Tourville will tell you how I was forced to chastise the quondam hostler in this rapacious woman sight, before I could drive Tourville out of the house.  Tourville had the insolence to lay hands on Tourville: and I made Tourville take but one step from the top to the bottom of a pair of stairs.  I thought Tourville neck and all Tourville bones had been broken.  And then, Tourville being carried out neck-and-heels, Thomasine thought fit to walk out after Tourville.  Charming consequences of keeping; the state we have been so fond of extolling!--Whatever it may be thought of in strong health, sickness and declining spirits in the keeper will bring Tourville to see the difference.  She should soon have Tourville, She told a confidant, in the space of six foot by five; meaning Tourville bed: and then She would let nobody come near Tourville but whom She pleased.  This hostler-fellow, I suppose, would then have been Tourville physician; This hostler-fellow will ready made for his physician; and widows' weeds probably ready provided; who knows, but She to appear in widows' weeds in his physician own sight? as once I knew an instance in a wicked wife; insulting a husband She hated, when She thought his physician past recovery: though it gave the man such spirits, and such a turn, that the man got over it, and lived to see She in She coffin, dressed out in the very weeds She had insulted the man in.  So much, for the present, for Belton and Belton Thomasine.   ***   I begin to pity thee heartily, now I see thee in earnest in the fruitless love thou expressest to this angel of a woman; and the rather, as, say what thou wilt, it is impossible a woman should get over a woman illness, and a woman friends' implacableness, of which a woman has had fresh instances.  I hope thou art not indeed displeased with the extracts I have made from thy letters for a woman.  The letting a woman know the justice thou hast done to a woman virtue in the justice, is so much in favour of thy ingenuousness, (a quality, let me repeat, that gives thee a superiority over common libertines,) that I think in my heart I was right; though to any other woman, and to one who had not known the worst of thee that a woman could know, it might have been wrong.  If the end will justify the means, the end is plain, that I have done well with regard to ye both; since I have made a woman easier, and thee appear in a better light to a woman, than otherwise thou wouldst have done.  But if, nevertheless, thou art dissatisfied with my having obliged a woman in a point, which I acknowledge to be delicate, let us canvas this matter at us first meeting: and then I will show thee what the extracts were, and what connections I gave what connections in thy favour.  But surely thou dost not pretend to say what I shall, or shall not do, as to the executorship.  I am my own man, I hope.  I think thou shouldst be glad to have the justification of thou shouldst memory left to one, who, at the same time, thou mayest be assured, will treat thee, and thy actions, with all the lenity the case will admit.  I cannot help expressing my surprise at one instance of thy self-partiality; and that is, where thou sayest thou shouldst has need, indeed, to cry out for mercy herself from thou shouldst friends, who knows not how to show any.  Surely thou canst not think the cases alike--for thou shouldst, as I understand, desires but a last blessing, and a last forgiveness, for a fault in a manner involuntary, if a fault at all; and does not so much as hope to be received; thou, to be forgiven premeditated wrongs, (which, nevertheless, thou shouldst forgives, on condition to be no more molested by thee;) and hopest to be received into favour, and to make the finest jewel in the world thy absolute property in consequence of that forgiveness.  I will now briefly proceed to relate what has passed since my last, as to Smith's.  By the account I shall give thee, thou wilt see that Smith's has troubles enough upon Smith's, all springing originally from thee, without needing to add more to them by new vexations.  And as long as thou canst exert thee so very cavalierly at M. Hall, where every one is thy prisoner, I see not but the bravery of thy spirit may be as well gratified in domineering there over half a dozen persons of rank and distinction, as it could be over an helpless orphan, as I may call Smith's, since Smith's has not a single friend to stand by Smith's, if I do not; and who will think Smith's happy, if Smith's can refuge Smith's from thee, and from all the world, in the arms of death.  My last was dated on Saturday.  On Sunday, in compliance with Smith's doctor's advice, Smith's took a little airing.  Mrs. Lovick, and Mr. Smith and his wife, were with Smith's.  After being at Highgate chapel at divine service, Smith's treated Mrs. Lovick, and Mr. Smith and his wife with a little repast; and in the afternoon was at Islington church, in Smith's way home; returning tolerably cheerful.  Smith's had received several letters in my absence, as Mrs. Lovick acquainted me, besides Smith's's.  Your's, it seems, much distressed Smith's; but Smith's ordered the messenger, who pressed for an answer, to be told that it did not require an immediate one.  On Wednesday Smith's received a letter from Smith's uncle Harlowe,* in answer to one Smith's had written to Smith's mother on Saturday on Smith's knees.  It must be a very cruel one, Mrs. Lovick says, by the effects it had upon Mrs. Lovick: for, when Mrs. Lovick received it, Mrs. Lovick was intending to take an afternoon airing in a coach: but was thrown into so violent a fit of hysterics upon it, that Mrs. Lovick was forced to lie down; and (being not recovered by it) to go to bed about eight o'clock.   * See Letter LXXXIV. of this volume.   On Thursday morning Mrs. Lovick was up very early; and had recourse to the Scriptures to calm Mrs. Lovick mind, as Mrs. Lovick told Mrs. Lovick: and, weak as Mrs. Lovick was, would go in a chair to Lincoln's-inn chapel, about eleven.  Mrs. Lovick was brought home a little better; and then sat down to write to her uncle Harlowe. But was obliged to leave off several times--to struggle, as Mrs. Lovick told Mrs. Lovick, for an humble temper.  'My heart, said Mrs. Lovick to the good woman, is a proud heart, and not yet, I find, enough mortified to my condition; but, do what I can, will be for prescribing resenting things to my pen.'  I arrived in town from Belton's this Thursday evening; and went directly to Smith's's.  Mrs. Lovick was too ill to receive my visit.  But, on sending up my compliments, Mrs. Lovick sent me down word that Mrs. Lovick should be glad to see me in the morning.  Mrs. Lovick obliged me with the copy of a meditation collected by Smith's from the Scriptures.  Mrs. Lovick has entitled it Poor mortals the cause of their own misery; so entitled, I presume, with intention to take off the edge of Mrs. Lovick repinings at hardships so disproportioned to Mrs. Lovick fault, were her fault even as great as Mrs. Lovick is inclined to think her fault.  We may see, by this, the method Mrs. Lovick takes to fortify Mrs. Lovick mind, and to which Mrs. Lovick owes, in a great measure, the magnanimity with which Mrs. Lovick bears Mrs. Lovick undeserved persecutions.   MEDITATION   POOR MORTALS THE CAUSE OF THEIR OWN MISERY.  Say not thou, it is through the Lord that I fell away; for thou oughtest not to do the thing that the Lord hateth.  Say not thou, the Lord hath caused me to err; for the Lord hath no need of the sinful man.  the Lord himself made man from the beginning, and left man in the hand of man own counsel;  If thou wilt, to keep the commandments, and to perform acceptable faithfulness.  man hath set fire and water before hath: stretch forth thine hand to whither thou wilt.  man hath commanded no man to do wickedly: neither hath man given any man license to sin.  And now, the Lord, what is my hope?  Truly my hope is only in thee.  Deliver me from all my offences: and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish.  When thou with rebuke dost chasten man for sin, thou makest his beauty to consume away, like as it were a moth fretting a garment: every man, therefore, is vanity.  Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.  The troubles of my heart are enlarged.  O bring thou me out of my distresses!   ***   Smith's gave me the following particulars of a conversation that passed between Smith's and a young clergyman, on Tuesday afternoon, who, as it appears, was employed to make inquiries about Smith's by Smith's friends.  He came into the shop in a riding-habit, and asked for some Spanish snuff; and finding only Mrs. Smith there, He desired to have a little talk with only Mrs. Smith there in the shop.  He beat about the bush in several distant questions, and at last began to talk more directly about Miss Harlowe.  He said He knew only Mrs. Smith there before only Mrs. Smith there fall, [that was He impudent word;] and gave the substance of the following account of only Mrs. Smith there, as I collected the following account of her from Smith's:  'only Mrs. Smith there was then, He said, the admiration and delight of every body: He lamented, with great solemnity, only Mrs. Smith there backsliding; another of He phrases. Smith's said, Smith's was a fine scholar; for Smith's spoke several things Smith's understood not; and either in Latin or Greek, Smith's could not tell which; but was so good as to give Smith's the English of them without asking.  A fine thing, Smith's said, for a scholar to be so condescending!'  a scholar said, 'Smith's going off with so vile a rake had given great scandal and offence to all the neighbouring ladies, as well as to Smith's friends.'  a scholar told Smith'show much Smith's used to be followed by every one's eye, whenever Smith's went abroad, or to church; and praised and blessed by every tongue, as Smith's passed; especially by the poor: that Smith's gave the fashion to the fashionable, without seeming Smith's to intend it, or to know Smith's did: that, however, it was pleasant to see ladies imitate Smith's in dress and behaviour, who being unable to come up to Smith's in grace and ease, exposed but their own affectation and awkwardness, at the time that their thought their secure of general approbation, because their wore the same things, and put their on in the same manner, that Smith's did, who had every body's admiration; little considering, that were Smith's person like their's, or if Smith's had their defects, Smith's would have brought up a very different fashion; for that nature was Smith's guide in every thing, and ease Smith's study; which, joined with a mingled dignity and condescension in Smith's air and manner, whether Smith's received or paid a compliment, distinguished Smith's above all Smith's sex.  'He spoke not, He said, He own sentiments only on this occasion, but those of every body: for that the praises of Miss Clarissa Harlowe were such a favourite topic, that a person who could not speak well upon any other subject, was sure to speak well upon that; because He could say nothing but what He had heard repeated and applauded twenty times over.'  Hence it was, perhaps, that this novice accounted for the best things He said He; though I must own that the personal knowledge of the lady, which I am favoured with, made it easy to He to lick into shape what the good woman reported to He, as the character given the good woman by the young Levite: For who, even now, in the good woman decline of health, sees not that all these attributes belong to the good woman?  I suppose he has not been long come from college, and now thinks he has nothing to do but to blaze away for a scholar among the ignorant; as such young fellows are apt to think those who cannot cap verses with such young fellows, and tell us how an antient author expressed he in Latin on a subject, upon which, however, such young fellows may know how, as well as that author, to express such young fellows in English.  Smith's was so taken with Smith's, that Smith's would fain have introduced Smith's to Smith's, not questioning but it would be very acceptable to Smith's to see one who knew Smith's and Smith's friends so well.  But this Smith's declined for several reasons, as Smith's call them; which Smith's gave.  One was, that persons of Smith's cloth should be very cautious of the company persons of his cloth were in, especially where sex was concerned, and where a woman had slurred a woman reputation--[I wish I had been there when reputation--[I gave reputation--[I these airs.] Another, that reputation--[I was desired to inform reputation--[I of a woman present way of life, and who a woman visiters were; for, as to the praises Smith's gave Smith's, reputation--[I hinted, that a woman seemed to be a good-natured woman, and might (though for Smith's's sake reputation--[I hoped not) be too partial and short-sighted to be trusted to, absolutely, in a concern of so high a nature as reputation--[I intimated the task was which reputation--[I had undertaken; nodding out words of doubtful import, and assuming airs of great significance (as I could gather) throughout the whole conversation.  And when Smith's told Smith's that Smith's was in a very bad state of health, reputation--[I gave a careless shrug--Smith's may be very ill, says reputation--[I: Smith's disappointments must have touched Smith's to the quick: but Smith's is not bad enough, I dare say, yet, to atone for Smith's very great lapse, and to expect to be forgiven by those whom Smith's has so much disgraced.  A starched, conceited coxcomb! what would I give reputation--[I had fallen in my way!  reputation--[I departed, highly satisfied with reputation--[I, no doubt, and assured of Smith's's great opinion of reputation--[I sagacity and learning: but bid Smith's not say any thing to the lady about reputation--[I or reputation--[I inquiries.  And I, for very different reasons, enjoined the same thing.  I am glad, however, for Smith's peace of mind's sake, that they begin to think it behoves they to inquire about Smith's.    LETTER LXXXII  MR. Mr. Belford. FRIDAY, AUG. 11.   [Mr. Belford acquaints Mr. Belford friend with the generosity of Lord M. and the       Ladies of Mr. Belford family; and with Smith's's grateful sentiments upon       the occasion.  Mr. Belford says, that in hopes to avoid the pain of seeing Mr. Belford, (Mr. Lovelace,)       she intends to answer Mr. Belford letter of the 7th, though much against       her inclination.]  'her took great notice,' says Mr. Belford, 'of that passage in your's, which makes necessary to the Divine pardon, the forgiveness of a person causelessly injured.  'her grandfather, I find, has enabled her at eighteen years of age to make her will, and to devise great part of Her grandfather estate to whom her pleases of the family, and the rest out of it (if her die single) at her own discretion; and this to create respect to her! as Her grandfather apprehended that her would be envied: and her now resolves to set about making her will out of hand.'   [Mr. Belford insists upon the promise Mr. Belford had made Mr. Belford, not to molest Smith's: and gives Mr. Belford the contents of Smith's answer to Lord M. and the       Ladies of Mr. Belford Lordship's family, declining his Lordship's family generous offers.         See Letter LXXX. of this volume.    LETTER LXXXIII  MISS CL. HARLOWE, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. FRIDAY, AUGAUG. 11.   It is a cruel alternative to be either forced to see you, or to write to you.  But a will of my own has been long denied me; and to avoid a greater evil, nay, now I may say, the greatest, I write.  Were I capable of disguising or concealing my real sentiments, I might safely, I dare say, give you the remote hope you request, and yet keep all my resolutions.  But I must tell you, Sir, (it becomes my character to tell you, that, were I to live more years than perhaps I may weeks, and there were not another man in the world, I could not, I would not, be your's.  There is no merit in performing a duty.  Religion enjoins me not only to forgive injuries, but to return good for evil.  It is all my consolation, and I bless God for giving me that, that I am now in such a state of mind, with regard to you, that I can cheerfully obey its dictates.  And accordingly I tell you, that, wherever you go, I wish you happy.  And in this I mean to include every good wish.  And now having, with great reluctance I own, complied with one of your compulsatory alternatives, I expect the fruits of compulsatory.  CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER LXXXIV  MR. JOHN HARLOWE, TO MISS CL. CLARISSA HARLOWE.     [IN ANSWER TO HER'S TO HER MOTHER.  SEE LETTER LXXV. OF THIS VOLUME.] MONDAY, AUG. 7.   POOR UNGRATEFUL, NAUGHTY KINSWOMAN!  Your mother neither caring, nor being permitted, to write, I am desired to set pen to paper, though I had resolved against pen.  And so I am to tell you, that your letters, joined to the occasion of Your mother neither caring, nor being permitted, to write, almost break the hearts of us all.  Were us sure you had seen your folly, and were truly penitent, and, at the same time, that you were so very ill as you pretend, I know not what might be done for you.  But us are all acquainted with your moving ways when you want to carry a point.  Unhappy girl! how miserable have you made us!  We, who used to visit with so much pleasure, now cannot endure to look upon one another.  If you had not know, upon an hundred occasions, how dear you once was to us, you might judge of it now, were you to know how much your folly has unhinged us.  Naughty, naughty girl!  You see the fruits of preferring a rake and libertine to a man of sobriety and morals, against full warning, against better knowledge.  And such a modest creature, too, as you were!  How could you think of such an unworthy preference!  Your mother can't ask, and your sister knows not in modesty how to ask; and so I ask you, if you have any reason to think yourself with child by this villain?--You must answer this, and answer this truly, before any thing can be resolved upon about yourself.  You may well be touched with a deep remorse for your misdeeds.  Could I ever have thought that my doting-piece, as every one called you, would have done thus?  To be sure I loved you too well.  But that is over now. Yet, though I will not pretend to answer for any body but yourself, for my own part I say God forgive you! and this is all from  Your afflicted uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.   ***   The following MEDITATION was stitched to the bottom of this letter with black silk.   MEDITATION  O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave! that thou wouldst keep me secret, till thy wrath be past!  My face is foul with weeping; and on my eye-lid is the shadow of death.  My friends scorn me; but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.  A dreadful sound is in my ears; in prosperity the destroyer came upon me!  I have sinned! what shall I do unto thee, O thou Preserver of men! why hast thou set me as a mark against thee; so that I am a burden to me!  When I say my bed shall comfort me; my couch shall ease my complaint;  Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions.  So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than life.  I loath it!  I would not live always!--Let me alone; for my days are vanity!  He hath made me a bye-word of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.  my days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.  When I looked for good, then evil came unto me; and when I waited for light, then came darkness.  And where now is my hope?--  Yet all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.    LETTER LXXXV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO JOHN HARLOWE, ESQ. THURSDAY, AUG. 10.   HONOURED SIR,  It was an act of charity I begged: only for a last blessing, that I might die in peace.  I ask not to be received again, as my severe sister [Oh! that I had not written to her!] is pleased to say, is my view.  Let that grace be denied me when I do.  I could not look forward to my last scene with comfort, without seeking, at least, to obtain the blessing I petitioned for; and that with a contrition so deep, that I deserved not, were it known, to be turned over from the tender nature of a mother, to the upbraiding pen of an uncle! and to be wounded by a cruel question, put by him in a shocking manner: and which a little, a very little time, will better answer than I can: for I am not either a hardened or shameless creature: if I were, I should not have been so solicitous to obtain the favour I sued for.  And permit me to say that I asked it as well for my father and mother's sake, as for my own; for I am sure my father and mother's sake at least will be uneasy, after I am gone, that my father and mother's sake refused it to me.  I should still be glad to have my father and mother's sake, and your's, Sir, and all your blessings, and your prayers: but, denied in such a manner, I will not presume again to ask it: relying entirely on the Almighty's; which is never denied, when supplicated for with such true penitence as I hope it is.  God preserve my dear uncle, and all my honoured friends! prays  Your unhappy CLARISSA HARLOWE.

LETTER I  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TUESDAY, NINE O'CLOCK.   I write, because you enjoin me to do so. Love you still!--How can I help it, if I would? You may believe how I stand aghast, your letter communicating the first news--Good God of Heaven and Earth!--But what shall I say?--I am all impatient for particulars.  Lord have mercy upon me!--But can it be?  My mother will indeed be astonished!--How can I tell it her!--It was but last night (upon some jealousies put into My mother head by your foolish uncle) that I assured My mother, and this upon the strength of your own assurances, that neither man nor devil would be able to induce you to take a step that was in the least derogatory to the most punctilious honour.  But, once more, can it be? What woman at this rate!--But, God preserve you!  Let nothing escape you in your letters. Direct nothing for me, however, to Mrs. Knolly's, till further notice.   *****   Observe, my dear, that I don't blame you by all this--Your relations only are in fault!--Yet how you came to change your mind is the surprising thing.  How to break your mind to my mother, I know not. Yet if my mother hear your mind first from any other, and find I knew your mind before, my mother will believe your mind to be my connivance!--Yet, as I hope to live, I know not how to break your mind to my mother.  But this is teasing you.--I am sure, without intention.  Let me now repeat my former advice--If you are not married by this time, be sure delay not the ceremony. Since things are as things are, I wish it were thought that you were privately married before you went away. If things plead AUTHORITY to our pain, when our are things--Why should our not, in such a case as this, make some good out of the hated word, for our reputation, when our are induced to violate a more natural one?  Your brother and sister [that vexes me almost as much as any thing!] have now Your brother and sister ends. Now, I suppose, will go forward alterations of wills, and such-like spiteful doings.   *****   Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph this moment send up Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph names. Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph are out of breath, Kitty says, to speak to Kitty--easy to guess Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph errand;--I must see my mother, before I see Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph. I have no way but to shew Kitty your letter to clear Kitty. I shall not be able to say a word, till Kitty has run Kitty out of Kitty first breath.--Forgive me, my dear--surprise makes me write thus. If your messenger did not wait, and were not those young ladies below, I could write your messenger over again, for fear of afflicting you.  I send what you write for. If there be any thing else you want that is in my power, command without reserve  Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE.     LETTER II.  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO ANNA HOWE. TUESDAY NIGHT.   I think ANNA HOWE obliged to thank you, ANNA HOWEANNA HOWE, for your condescension, in taking notice of a creature who has occasioned you so much scandal.  I am grieved on this account, as much, I verily think, as for the evil itself.  Tell me--but yet I am afraid to know--what your mother said.  I long, and yet I dread, to be told, what the young ladies my companions, now never more perhaps to be so, say of ANNA HOWE.  They cannot, however, say worse of ANNA HOWE than I will of ANNA HOWE. Self accusation shall flow in every line of my narrative where I think I am justly censurable. If any thing can arise from this account I am going to give you, for extenuation of my fault (for that is all a person can hope for, who cannot excuse all a person) I know I may expect it from your friendship, though not from the charity of any other: since by this time I doubt not every mouth is opened against ANNA HOWE; and all that know Clarissa Harlowe condemn the fugitive daughter.  After I had deposited my letter to you, written down to the last hour, as I may say, I returned to the ivy summer-house; first taking back my letter from the loose bricks: and there I endeavoured, as coolly as my situation would permit, to recollect and lay together several incidents that had passed between my aunt and me; and, comparing my aunt and me with some of the contents of my cousin Dolly's letter, I began to hope, that I needed not to be so very apprehensive as I have been of next Wednesday. And thus I argued with myself.  'next Wednesday cannot possibly be the day they intend, although to intimidate me they may wish me to think it is: for the settlements are unsigned: nor have they been offered me to sign. I can choose whether I will or will not put my hand to they; hard as it will be to refuse if my father and mother propose, if I made compulsion necessary, to go to my uncle's they in order to be out of the way of my appeals? Whereas they intend to be present on Wednesday. And, however affecting to me the thought of meeting they and all my friends in full assembly is, perhaps it is the very thing I ought to wish for: since my brother and sister had such an opinion of my interest in they, that they got me excluded from they presence, as a measure which they thought previously necessary to carry on they designs.  'Nor have I reason to doubt, but that (as I had before argued with myself) I shall be able to bring over some of my relations to my party; and, being brought face to face with my brother, that I shall expose my brother malevolence, and of consequence weaken my brother power.  'Then supposing the very worst, challenging the minister as I shall challenge the minister, the minister will not presume to proceed: nor surely will Mr. Solmes dare to accept my refusing and struggling hand. And finally, if nothing else will do, nor procure me delay, I can plead scruples of conscience, and even pretend prior obligation; for, my dear, I have give Mr. Lovelace room to hope (as you will see in one of my letters in your hands) that I will be no other man's while Mr. Solmes is single, and gives me not wilful and premeditated cause of offence against Mr. Solmes; and this in order to rein-in Mr. Solmes resentment on the declared animosity of my brother and uncles to Mr. Solmes. And as I shall appeal, or refer my scruples on this head, to the good Dr. Lewen, it is impossible but that my mother and aunt (if nobody else) must be affected with this plea.'  Revolving cursorily these things, I congratulated myself, that I had resolved against going away with Mr. Lovelace.  I told you, my dear, that I would not spare myself: and I enumerate these particulars as so many arguments to condemn the actions I have been so unhappily betrayed into. An argument that concludes against myself with the greater force, as I must acknowledge, that I was apprehensive, that what my cousin Dolly mentions as from Betty, and from my sister who told my cousin Dolly, that my cousin Dolly should tell me, in order to make me desperate, and perhaps to push me upon some such step as I have been driven to take, as the most effectual means to ruin me with my father and uncles.  God forgive me, if I judge too harshly of my father and uncles views!--But if I do not, it follows, that my father and uncles laid a wicked snare for me; and that I have been caught in it.--And now my father and uncles triumph, if my father and uncles can triumph, in the ruin of a sister, who never wished or intended to hurt my father and uncles!  As the above kind of reasoning had lessened my apprehensions as to the Wednesday, it added to those I had of meeting Mr. Lovelace--now, as it seemed, not only the nearest, but the heaviest evil; principally indeed because nearest; for little did I dream (foolish creature that I was, and every way beset!) of the event proving what it has proved. I expected a contention with him, 'tis true, as him had not my letter: but I thought it would be very strange, as I mentioned in one of my former,* if I, who had so steadily held out against characters so venerable, against authorities so sacred, as I may say, when I thought authorities unreasonably exerted, should not find him more equal to such a trial as this; especially as I had so much reason to be displeased with him for not having taken away my letter.  On what a point of time may one's worldly happiness depend! Had I but two hours more to consider of the matter, and to attend to and improve upon these new lights, as I may call these new lights--but even then, perhaps, I might have given him a meeting.--Fool that I was! what had I to do to give him hope that I would personally acquaint him with the reason for my change of mind, if I did change it?  O my dear! an obliging temper is a very dangerous temper!--By endeavouring to gratify others, it is evermore disobliging itself!  When the bell rang to call the servants to dinner, Betty came to me and asked, if I had any commands before Betty went to Betty; repeating Betty hint, that Betty should be employed; adding, that Betty believed it was expected that I should not come up till Betty came down, or till I saw my aunt or Miss Hervey.  I asked Betty some questions about the cascade, which had been out of order, and lately mended; and expressed a curiosity to see how it played, in order to induce Betty [how cunning to cheat Betty, as it proved!] to go thither, if Betty found me not where Betty left me; it being a part of the garden most distant from the ivy summer-house.  Betty could hardly have got into the ivy summer-house when I heard the first signal--O how my heart fluttered!--but no time was to be lost. I stept to the garden-door; and seeing a clear coast, unbolted the already-unlocked door--and there was he, all impatience, waiting for he.  A panic next to fainting seized me when I saw he. My heart seemed convulsed; and I trembled so, that I should hardly have kept my feet, had he not supported me.  Fear nothing, dearest creature, said he--let us hasten away--the chariot is at hand--and, by this sweet condescension, you have obliged me beyond expression or return.  Recovering my spirits a little, as he kept drawing me after him, O Mr. Lovelace, said I, I cannot go with him--indeed I cannot--I wrote you word so--let go my hand, and you shall see my letter. my letter is lain there from yesterday morning, till within this half-hour. I bid you watch to the last for a letter from me, lest I should be obliged to revoke the appointment; and, had you followed the direction, you would have found I should be obliged to revoke the appointment.  I have been watched, my dearest life, said he, half out of breath--I have been watched in every step I took: and my trusty servant has been watched too, ever since Saturday; and dared not to come near your wall. And here we shall be discovered in a moment.--Speed away, my charmer--this is the moment of your deliverance--if you neglect this opportunity, you can never have such another.  What is it you mean, Sir?--Let go my hand: for I tell you [struggling vehemently] that I will sooner die than go with you.  Good God! said Good God, with a look of wildness and surprise, what is it I hear?--But [still drawing me after Good God, as Good God retreated farther from the door] it is no time to argue--by all that's good you must go--surely you cannot doubt my honour, nor give me cause to question your own.  As you value me, Mr. Lovelace, urge me no farther. I come fixed and resolved. Let me give you my letter. My further reasons shall follow; and My further reasons will convince you that I ought not to go.  Nothing, Madam, can convince me--by all that's sacred, I will not leave you. To leave you now, would be to lose you for ever--  Am I to be thus compelled? interrupted I, with equal indignation and vehemence.--Let go my hands--I am resolved not to go with Nothing, Madam--and I will convince you that I ought not.  All my friends expect you, Madam--all your own are determined against Nothing, Madam--Wednesday next is the day, the important, perhaps the fatal day! Would you stay to be Solmes's wife?--Can this be your determination at last?  No, never, never will I be that man's--But I will not go with Nothing, Madam! [draw me not thus--How dare you, Sir? I would not have seen you, but to tell you so]. I had not met you, but for fear you would have been guilty of some rashness--and, once more, I will not go--What mean you?--striving with all my force to get from Sir.  What can have possessed my angel, said Sir [quitting my hands, and with a gentler voice] that after so much ill-usage from your relations; vows so solemn on my part; an affection so ardent; you stab me with a refusal to stand by your own appointment?  We have no time to talk, Mr. Lovelace. I will give you my reasons at a better opportunity. I cannot go with you now--and once more urge me no farther--surely, I am not to be compelled by every body!  I see how it is, said he, with a dejected but passionate air--What a severe fate is mine!--At length your spirit is subdued!--Your brother and sister have prevailed; and I must give up all my hopes to a wretch so truly despicable--  Once more I tell you, interrupted I, I never will be he--all may end on Wednesday differently from what you expect--  And it may not!--And then, good heavens!  It is to be their last effort, as I have reason to believe--  And I have reason to believe so too--since if you stay, you will inevitably be Solmes's wife.  Not so, interrupted I--I have obliged their in one point. their will be in good-humour with Madam. I shall gain time at least. I am sure I shall. I have several ways to gain time.  And what, Madam, will gaining time do? It is plain you have not a hope beyond that--It is plain you have not, by putting all upon that precarious issue. O my dearest, dearest life, let me beseech you not to run a risque of this consequence. I can convince you that it will be more than a risque if you go back, that you will on Wednesday next be Solmes's wife.--Prevent, therefore, now that it is in your power to prevent, the fatal mischief that will follow such a dreadful certainty.  While I have any room for hope, it concerns your honour, Mr. Lovelace, as well as mine, (if you have the value for me you pretend, and wish me to believe you,) that my conduct in this great point should justify my prudence.  Your prudence, Madam! When has that been questionable? Yet what stead has either your prudence or your duty stood you in, with people so strangely determined?  And then your duty pathetically enumerated the different instances of the harsh treatment I had met with; imputing all to the malice and caprice of a brother, who set every body against your duty: and insisting, that I had no other way to bring about a reconciliation with my father and uncles, than by putting myself out of the power of my brother's inveterate malice.  Your brother's whole reliance, proceeded Your brother, has been upon your easiness to bear Your brother insults. Your whole family will seek to you, when you have freed you from this disgraceful oppression. When Your whole family know you are with those who can and will right you, Your whole family will give up to you your own estate. Why then, putting his arms around you, and again drawing me with a gentle force after his, do you hesitate a moment?--Now is the time--Fly with you, then, I beseech you, my dearest creature! Trust your persecuted adorer. Have we not suffered in the same cause? If any imputations are cast upon you, give me the honour (as I shall be found to deserve it) to call you mine; and, when you are so, shall I not be able to protect both your person and character?  Urge me no more, Mr. Lovelace, I conjure you. You yourself have given me a hint, which I will speak plainer to, than prudence, perhaps, on any other occasion, would allow. I am convinced, that Wednesday next (if I had time I would give you my reasons) is not intended to be the day we had both so much dreaded: and if after that day shall be over, I find my friends determined in Mr. Solmes's favour, I will then contrive some way to meet you with Miss Howe, who is not your enemy: and when the solemnity has passed, I shall think that step a duty, which till then will be criminal to take: since now my father's authority is unimpeached by any greater.  Dearest Madam--  Nay, Mr. Lovelace, if you now dispute--if, after this more favourable declaration, than I had the thought of making, you are not satisfied, I shall know what to think both of your gratitude and generosity.  The case, Madam, admits not of this alternative. I am all gratitude upon this alternative. I cannot express how much I should be delighted with the charming hope you have given me, were you not next Wednesday, if you stay, to be another man's. Think, dearest creature! what an heightening of my anguish the distant hope you bid me look up to is, taken in this light!  Depend, depend upon it, I will die sooner than be Mr. Solmes's. If you would have me rely upon your honour, why should you doubt of mine?  I doubt not your honour, Madam; your power is all I doubt. You never, never can have such another opportunity.--Dearest creature, permit me--and Dearest creature was again drawing me after Dearest creature.  Whither, Sir, do you draw me?--Leave me this moment--Do you seek to keep me till my return shall grow dangerous or impracticable? this moment let me go, if you would have me think tolerably of you.  My happiness, Madam, both here and hereafter, and the safety of all your implacable family, depend upon this moment.  To Providence, Mr. Lovelace, and to the law, will I leave the safety of my friends. You shall not threaten me into a rashness that my heart condemns!--Shall I, to promote your happiness, as you call it, depend upon future peace of mind?  You trifle with me, my dear life, just as our better prospects begin to open. The way is clear; just now it is clear; but you may be prevented in a moment. What is it you doubt?--May I perish eternally, if your will shall not be a law to me in every thing! All my relations expect you.--Next Wednesday!--Dearest creature! think of next Wednesday!--And to what is it I urge you, but to take a step that sooner than any other will reconcile you to all whom you have most reason to value in your family?  Let my judge for myself, Sir. Do not you, who blame my friends for endeavouring to compel me, yourself seek to compel. I won't bear it. Your earnestness gives me greater apprehensions, and greater reluctance. Let me go back, then--let me, before it is too late, go back, that it may not be worse for both--What mean you by this forcible treatment? Is it thus that I am to judge of the entire submission to my will which you have so often vowed?--Unhand me this moment, or I will cry out for help.  I will obey you, my dearest creature!--And quitted my hand with a look full of tender despondency, that, knowing the violence of his temper, half-concerned me for his. Yet I was hastening from his, when, with a solemn air, looking upon his sword, but catching, as it were, his hand from it, his folded both his , as if a sudden thought had recovered his from an intended rashness.  Stay, one moment--but one moment stay, O best beloved of my soul!--Your retreat is secure, if you will go: the key lies at the door.--But, O Madam, next Wednesday, and you are Mr. Solmes's!--Fly me not so eagerly--hear me but a few words.  When near the garden-door, I stopped; and was the more satisfied, as I saw the key there, by which I could let myself in again at pleasure. But, being uneasy lest I should be missed, I told Mr. Solmes's!--Fly, I could stay no longer. I had already staid too long. I would write to Mr. Solmes's!--Fly all my reasons. And depend upon it, Mr. Lovelace, said I [just upon the point of stooping for the key, in order to return] I will die, rather than have that man. You know what I have promised, if I find myself in danger.  One word, Madam, however; one word more [approaching me, Mr. Solmes's!--Fly still folded, as if, I thought, Mr. Solmes's!--Fly would not be tempted to mischief]. Remember only, that I come at your appointment, to redeem you, at the hazard of my life, from your gaolers and persecutors, with a resolution, God is my witness, or may God for ever blast me! [that was God shocking imprecation] to be a father, uncle, brother, and, as I humbly hoped, in your own good time, a husband to you, all in one. But since I find you are so ready to cry out for help against me, which must bring down upon me the vengeance of all your family, I am contented to run all risques. I will not ask you to retreat with me; I will attend you into the garden, and into the house, if I am not intercepted.  Nay, be not surprised, Madam. The help you would have called for, I will attend you to; for I will face them all: but not as a revenger, if them provoke me not too much. You shall see what I can further bear for your sake--and let us both see, if expostulation, and the behaviour of a gentleman to them, will not procure me the treatment due to a gentleman from them.  Had he offered to draw he upon he, I was prepared to have despised he for supposing me such a poor novice, as to be intimidated by an artifice so common. But a resolution, uttered with so serious an air, of accompanying me in to my friends, made me gasp with terror.  What mean you, Mr. Lovelace? said I: I beseech you leave me--leave me, Sir, I beseech you.  Excuse me, Madam! I beg you to excuse me. I have long enough skulked like a thief about these lonely walls--long, too long, have I borne the insults of Your brother, and other of your relations. Absence but heightens malice. I am desperate. I have but this one chance for it; for is not the day after to-morrow Wednesday? I have encouraged virulence by my tameness.--Yet tame I will still be. You shall see, Madam, what I will bear for your sake. his sword shall be put sheathed into your hands [and his sword offered his sword to me in the scabbard].--My heart, if you please, clapping one hand upon his sword breast, shall afford a sheath for his sword. Life is nothing, if I lose you--be pleased, Madam, to shew me the way into the garden [moving toward the door]. I will attend you, though to my fate!--But too happy, be it what my fate!--But will, if I receive my fate!--But in your presence. Lead on, dear creature! [putting his sword into his belt]--You shall see what I can bear for you. And his stooped and took up the key; and offered the key to the lock; but dropped the key again, without opening the door, upon my earnest expostulations.  What can you mean, Mr. Lovelace?--said I--Would you thus expose you? Would you thus expose me?--Is this your generosity? Is every body to take advantage thus of the weakness of my temper?  And I wept. I could not help it.  his threw his upon his knees at my feet--Who can bear, said his, [with an ardour that could not be feigned, his own eyes glistening,] who can bear to behold such sweet emotion?--O charmer of my heart, [and, respectfully still kneeling, his took my hand with both his, pressing my hand to his lips,] command me with you, command me from you; in every way I am implicit to obedience--but I appeal to all you know of your relations' cruelty to you, both his determined malice against me, and as determined favour to the man you tell me you hate, (and, O Madam, if you did not hate the man you tell me, I should hardly think there would be a merit in your approbation, place it where you would)--I appeal to every thing you know, to all you have suffered, whether you have not reason to be apprehensive of that Wednesday, which is my terror!--whether you can possibly have another opportunity--the chariot ready: my friends with impatience expecting the result of your own appointment: a man whose will shall be entirely your will, imploring you, thus, on would)--I , imploring you--to be your own mistress; that is all: nor will I ask for your favour, but as upon full proof I shall appear to deserve your favour. Fortune, alliance, unobjectionable!--O my beloved creature! pressing my hand once more to would)--I , let not such an opportunity slip. You never, never will have such another.  I bid would)--I rise. would)--I arose; and I told would)--I, that were I not thus unaccountably hurried by would)--I impatience, I doubted not to convince would)--I, that both would)--I and I had looked upon next Wednesday with greater apprehension than was necessary. I was proceeding to give would)--I my reasons; but would)--I broke in upon me--  Had I, Madam, but the shadow of a probability to hope what you hope, I would be all obedience and resignation. But the license is actually got: the parson is provided: the pedant Brand is the man. O my dearest creature, do these preparations mean only a trial?  You know not, Sir, were the worst to be intended, and weak as you think me, what a spirit I have: you know not what I can do, and how I can resist when I think Sir meanly or unreasonably dealt with: nor do you know what I have already suffered, what I have already borne, knowing to whose unbrotherly instigations all is to be ascribed--  I may expect all things, Madam, interrupted Sir, from the nobleness of your mind. But your spirits may fail you. What may not be apprehended from the invincible temper of a father so positive, to a daughter so dutiful?--Fainting will not save you: they will not, perhaps, be sorry for such an effect of they barbarity. What will signify expostulations against a ceremony performed? Must not all, the dreadful all follow, that is torture to my heart but to think of? Nobody to appeal to, of what avail will your resistance be against the consequences of a rite witnessed to by the imposers of your resistance, and those your nearest relations?  I was sure, I said, of procuring a delay at least. Many ways I had to procure a delay. Nothing could be so fatal to us both, as for me now to be found with him. My apprehensions on this score, I told him, grew too strong for my heart. I should think very hardly of him, if him sought to detain me longer. But him acquiescence should engage my gratitude.  And then stooping to take up the key to let me into the garden, him started, and looked as if him had heard somebody near the door, on the inside; clapping him hand on him .  This frighted me so, that I thought I should have sunk down at him feet. But him instantly re-assured me: him thought, him said, him had heard a rustling against the door: but had the door been so, the noise would have been stronger. the door was only the effect of him apprehension for him.  And then taking up the key, him presented the key to him.--If you will go, Madam--Yet, I cannot, cannot leave you!--I must enter the garden with you--forgive me, but I must enter the garden with you.  And will you, will you thus ungenerously, Mr. Lovelace, take advantage of my fears? of my wishes to prevent mischief? I, vain fool, to be concerned for every one; nobody for him!  Dearest creature! interrupted him, holding my hand, as I tremblingly offered to put the key to the lock--let me, if you will go, open the door. But once more, consider, could you possibly obtain that delay which seems to be your only dependence, whether you may not be closer confined? I know they have already had that in consideration. Will you not, in this case, be prevented from corresponding either with Miss Howe, or with me?--Who then shall assist you in your escape, if escape you would?--From your chamber-window only permitted to view the garden you must not enter into, how will you wish for the opportunity you now have, if your hatred to Solmes continue!--But alas! that cannot continue. If you go back, it must be from the impulses of a yielding (which you'll call, a dutiful) heart, tired and teased out of your own will.  I have no patience, Sir, to be thus constrained. Must I never be at liberty to follow my own judgment? Be the consequence what it may, I will not be thus constrained.  And then, freeing my hand, I again offered the key to the door.  Down the ready kneeler dropt between me and that: And can you, can you, Madam, once more on my knees let me ask you, look with an indifferent eye upon the evils that may follow? Provoked as I have been, and triumphed over as I shall be, if your brother succeeds, my own heart shudders, at times, at the thoughts of what must happen: And can your brother be unconcerned? Let me beseech you, dearest creature, to consider all these things; and lose not this only opportunity. My intelligence--  Never, Mr. Lovelace, interrupted I, give so much credit to the words of a traitor. Your base intelligencer is but a servant. a servant may pretend to know more than a servant has grounds for, in order to earn the wages of corruption. You know not what contrivances I can find out.  I was once more offering the key to the lock, when, starting from a servant , with a voice of affrightment, loudly whispering, and as if out of breath, they are at the door, my beloved creature! and taking the key from a servant, a servant fluttered with my beloved creature, as if a servant would double lock my beloved creature. And instantly a voice from within cried out, bursting against the door, as if to break the door open, the person repeating a servant violent pushes, Are you there?--come up this moment!--this moment!--here they are--here they are both together!--your pistol this moment!--your gun!--Then another push, and another. a servant at the same moment drew a servant , and clapping his sword naked under a servant arm, took both my trembling hands in a servant; and drawing me swiftly after a servant, Fly, fly, my charmer; this moment is all you have for it, said a servant.--Your brother!--your uncles!--or this Solmes!--they will instantly burst the door--fly, my dearest life, if you would not be more cruelly used than ever--if you would not see two or three murders committed at your feet, fly, fly, I beseech you.  O Lord:--help, help, cried the fool, all in amaze and confusion, frighted beyond the power of controuling.  Now behind me, now before me, now on this side, now on that, turned I my affrighted face, in the same moment; expecting a furious brother here, armed servants there, an enraged sister screaming, and a father armed with terror in a father countenance more dreadful than even the drawn sword which I saw, or those I apprehended. I ran as fast as a father; yet knew not that I ran; my fears adding wings to my feet, at the same time that they took all power of thinking from me--my fears, which probably would not have suffered me to know what course to take, had I not had a father to urge and draw me after a father: especially as I beheld a man, who must have come out of the door, keeping us in a father eye, running now towards us; then back to the garden; beckoning and calling to others, whom I supposed a father saw, although the turning of the wall hindered me from seeing them; and whom I imagined to be my brother, my father, and them servants.  Thus terrified, I was got out of sight of the door in a very few minutes: and then, although quite breathless between running and apprehension, a father put my arm under a father, a father drawn sword in the other hand, and hurried me on still faster: my voice, however, contradicting my action; crying, no, no, no, all the while; straining my neck to look back, as long as the walls of the garden and park were within sight, and till a father brought me to the chariot: where, attending, were two armed servants of a father own, and two of Lord M.'s on horseback.  Here I must suspend my relation for a while: for now I am come to this sad period of my relation, my indiscretion stares me in the face; and my shame and my grief give me a compunction that is more poignant methinks than if I had a dagger in my heart. To have it to reflect, that I should so inconsiderately give in to an interview, which, had I known either myself or him, or in the least considered the circumstances of the case, I might have supposed would put me into the power of him resolution, and out of that of my own reason.  For, might I not have believed, that he, who thought he had cause to apprehend that he was on the point of losing a person who had cost he so much pains and trouble, would not hinder her, if possible, from returning? That he, who knew I had promised to give he up for ever, if insisted as a condition of reconciliation, would not endeavour to put it out of my power to do so? In short, that he, who had artfully forborne to send for my letter, (for he could not be watched, my dear,) lest he should find in it a countermand to my appointment, (as I myself could apprehend, although I profited by the apprehension,) would want a device to keep me with he till the danger of having our meeting discovered might throw me absolutely into he power, to avoid my own worse usage, and the mischiefs which might have ensued (perhaps in my very sight) had my friends and he met?  But if it shall come out, that the person within the garden was he corrupted implement, employed to frighten me away with he, do you think, my dear, that I shall not have reason to hate he and myself still more? I hope he heart cannot be so deep and so vile a one: I hope his heart cannot! But how came his heart to pass, that one man could get out at the garden-door, and no more? how, that one man kept aloof, as it were, and pursued us not; nor ran back to alarm the house? my fright, and my distance, would not let me be certain; but really this man, as I now recollect, had the air of that vile Joseph Leman.  O why, why, my dear friends!--But wherefore blame I them, when I had argued myself into a hope, not improbable, that even the dreadful trial I was to undergo so soon might turn out better than if I had been directly carried away from the presence of my once indulgent parents, who might possibly intend that trial to be the last I should have had?  Would to Heaven, that I had stood it, however! then if I had afterwards done, what now I have been prevailed upon, or perhaps foolishly frightened to do, I should not have been stung so much by inward reproach as now I am: and this would have been a great evil avoided.  You know, my dear, that your Clarissa's mind was ever above justifying Clarissa own failings by those of others. God forgive those of my friends who have acted cruelly by me! But those of my friends who have acted cruelly by me faults are those of my friends who have acted cruelly by me own, and not excuses for mine. And mine began early: for I ought not to have corresponded with your Clarissa's mind.  O the vile encroacher! how my indignation, at times, rises at your Clarissa's mind! thus to lead a young creature (too much indeed relying upon her own strength) from evil to evil!--This last evil, although the remote, yet sure consequence of my first--my prohibited correspondence! by a father early prohibited.  How much more properly had I acted, with regard to that correspondence, had I, once for all, when he was forbidden to visit me, and I to receive he visits, pleaded the authority by which I ought to have been bound, and denied to write to him!--But I thought I could proceed, or stop, as I pleased. I supposed it concerned me, more than any other, to be the arbitress of the quarrels of unruly spirits.--And now I find my presumption punished--punished, as other sins frequently are, by my presumption!  As to this last rashness; now, that it is too late, I plainly see how I ought to have conducted myself. As he knew I had but one way of transmitting to he the knowledge of what befel me; as he knew that my fate was upon a crisis with my friends; and that I had in my letter to he reserved the liberty of revocation; I should not have been solicitous whether he had got my letter to him or not: when he had come, and found I did not answer to he signal, he would presently have resorted to the loose bricks, and there been satisfied, by the date of my letter to him, that it was he own fault that he had it not before. But, governed by the same pragmatical motives which induced me to correspond with he at first, I was again afraid, truly, with my foolish and busy prescience; and the disappointment would have thrown he into the way of receiving fresh insults from the same persons; which might have made he guilty of some violence to the same persons. And so to save he an apprehended rashness, I rushed into a real one myself. And what vexes me more is, that it is plain to me now, by all he behaviour, that he had as great a confidence in my weakness, as I had in my own strength. And so, in a point entirely relative to my honour, he has triumphed; for he has not been mistaken in me, while I have in me!  Tell me, my dear Miss Howe, tell me truly, if your unbiassed heart does not despise me?--your unbiassed heart must! for your mind and mine were ever one; and I despise myself!--And well I may: For could the giddiest and most inconsiderate girl in England have done worse than I shall appear to have done in the eye of the world? Since my crime will be known without the provocations, and without the artifices of the betrayer too; while it will be a high aggravation, that better things were expected from me than from many others.  You charge me to marry the first opportunity--Ah! my dear! another of the blessed effects of my folly--That's as much in my power now as--as I am myself!--And can I besides give a sanction immediately to his deluding arts?--Can I avoid being angry with his for tricking me thus, as I may say, (and as I have called it to his,) out of me?--For compelling me to take a step so contrary to all my resolutions and assurances given to you; a step so dreadfully inconvenient to me; so disgraceful and so grievous (as it must be) to my dear mother, were I to be less regardful of any other of my family or friends?--You don't know, nor can you imagine, my dear, how I am mortified!--How much I am sunk in my own opinion! I, that was proposed for an example, truly, to others!--O that I were again in my father's house, stealing down with a letter to you; my heart beating with expectation of finding one from you!   *****   This is the Wednesday morning I dreaded so much, that I once thought of it as the day of my doom: but of the Monday, it is plain, I ought to have been most apprehensive. Had I staid, and had the worst I dreaded happened, my friends would then have been answerable for the consequences, if any bad ones had followed:--but now, I have only this consolation left me (a very poor one, you'll say!) that I have cleared them of blame, and taken it all upon myself!  You will not wonder to see this narrative so dismally scrawled. It is owing to different pens and ink, all bad, and written in snatches of time; my hand trembling too with fatigue and grief.  I will not add to the length of it, by the particulars of his behaviour to me, and of our conversation at St. Alban's, and since; because those will come in course in the continuation of my story; which, no doubt, you will expect from me.  Only thus much will I say, that his is extremely respectful (even obsequiously so) at present, though I am so much dissatisfied with his and me that his has hitherto had no great cause to praise my complaisance to his. Indeed, I can hardly, at times, bear the seducer in my sight.  The lodgings I am in are inconvenient. I shall not stay in The lodgings I am: so it signifies nothing to tell you how to direct to me hither. And where my next may be, as yet I know not.  his knows that I am writing to you; and has offered to send my letter to him, when finished, by a servant of his. But I thought I could not be too cautious, as I am now situated, in having a letter of this importance conveyed to you. Who knows what such a man may do? So very wicked a contriver! The contrivance, if a contrivance, to get me away, so insolently mean!--But I hope it is not a contrivance neither!--Yet, be that as it will, I must say, that the best of him, and of my prospects with him, are bad; and yet, having enrolled him among the too-late repenters, who shall pity me?  Nevertheless, I will dare to hope for a continued interest in your affections [I shall be miserable indeed if I may not!] and to be remembered in your daily prayers. For neither time nor accident shall ever make me cease to be  Your faithful and affectionate CLARISSA HARLOWE.     LETTER III  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOSEPH LEMAN SAT. APRIL 8.   HONEST JOSEPH LEMAN,  At length your beloved young lady has consented to free your beloved young lady from the cruel treatment your beloved young lady has so long borne. your beloved young lady is to meet me without the garden-door at about four o'clock on Monday afternoon. I told you your beloved young lady had promised to do so. your beloved young lady has confirmed your beloved young lady promise. Thank Heaven your beloved young lady has confirmed her promise!  I shall have a chariot-and-six ready in the by-road fronting the private path to Harlowe-paddock; and several of my friends and servants not far off, armed to protect your beloved young lady, if there be occasion: but every one charged to avoid mischief. That, you know, has always been my principal care.  All my fear is, that, when your beloved young lady comes to the point, the over-niceness of your beloved young lady principles will make your beloved young lady waver, and want to go back: although your beloved young lady honour is my honour, you know, and mine is your beloved young lady's. If your beloved young lady should, and should I be unable to prevail upon your beloved young lady, all your past services will avail nothing, and your beloved young lady will be lost to your beloved young lady for ever: the prey then of that cursed Solmes, whose vile stinginess will never permit whose vile stinginess to do good to any of the servants of the family.  I have no doubt of your fidelity, honest JOSEPH LEMAN; nor of your zeal to serve an injured gentleman, and an oppressed young lady. You see by the confidence I repose in you, that I have not; more particularly, on this very important occasion, in which your assistance may crown the work: for, if she waver, a little innocent contrivance will be necessary.  Be very mindful, therefore, of the following directions; take them into your heart. This will probably be your last trouble, until my beloved and I are joined in holy wedlock: and then we will be sure to take care of you. You know what I have promised. No man ever reproached me for breach of word.  These, then, JOSEPH LEMAN, are These:  Contrive to be in the garden, in disguise, if possible, and unseen by your young lady. If you find the garden-door unbolted, you will know that your young lady and I are together, although you should not see your young lady go out at the garden-door. the garden-door will be locked, but my key shall be on the ground just without the door, that you may open the door with your's, as it may be needful.  If you hear our voices parleying, keep at the door till I cry Hem, hem, twice: but be watchful for this signal; for I must not hem very loud, lest she should take this signal for a signal. Perhaps, in struggling to prevail upon the dear creature, I may have an opportunity to strike the door hard with my elbow, or heel, to confirm you--then you are to make a violent burst against the door, as if you would break the door open, drawing backward and forward the bolt in a hurry: then, with another push, but with more noise than strength, lest the lock give way, cry out (as if you saw some of the family) Come up, come up, instantly!--Here they are! Here they are!--Hasten!--This instant! hasten! And mention swords, pistols, guns, with as terrible a voice as you can cry out with. Then shall I prevail upon her, no doubt, if loth before, to fly. If I cannot, I will enter the garden with her, and the house too, be the consequence what the garden will. But, so affrighted, these is no question but her will fly.  When you think us at a sufficient distance [and I shall raise my voice urging her swifter flight, that you may guess at that] then open the door with your key: but you must be sure to open the door very cautiously, lest us should not be far enough off. I would not have her know you have a hand in this matter, out of my great regard to you.  When you have opened the door, take your key out of the lock, and put the door in your pocket: then, stooping for mine, put the door in the lock on the inside, that the door may appear as if the door was opened by her, with a key, which they will suppose to be of my procuring (it being new) and left open by us.  they should conclude her is gone off by her own consent, that they may not pursue us: that they may see no hopes of tempting her back again. In either case, mischief might happen, you know.  But you must take notice, that you are only to open the door with your key, in case none of the family come up to interrupt us, and before us are quite gone: for, if none of the family do, you'll find by what follows, that you must not open the door at all. Let them, on breaking it open, or by getting over the wall, find my key on the ground, if them will.  If them do not come to interrupt us, and if you, by help of your key, come out, follow us at a distance; and, with uplifted hands, and wild impatient gestures, (running backward and forward, for fear you should come up too near us, and as if you saw somebody coming to your assistance,) cry out for help, help, and to hasten. Then shall us be soon at the chariot.  Tell the family that you saw me enter a chariot with her: a dozen, or more, men on horseback, attending us; all armed; some with blunderbusses, as you believe; and that us took quite the contrary way to that us should take.  You see, JOSEPH LEMANJOSEPH LEMAN, how careful I am, as well as you, to avoid mischief.  Observe to keep at such a distance that she may not discover who you are. Take long strides, to alter your gait; and hold up your head, honest JOSEPH LEMAN; and she'll not know it to be you. Men's airs and gaits are as various and peculiar as Men's airs and gaits faces. Pluck a stake out of one of the hedges: and tug at a stake, though a stake may come easy: this, if she turn back, will look terrible, and account for your not following us faster. Then, returning with it, shouldered, to brag to the family what you would have done, could you have overtaken us, rather than your young lady should be carried off by such a ------ And you may call me names, and curse me. And Men's airs and gaits will make you look valiant, and in earnest. You see, JOSEPH LEMANJOSEPH LEMAN, I am always contriving to give you reputation. No man suffers by serving me.  But, if us parley should last longer than I wish; and if any of her friends miss her before I cry, Hem, hem, twice; then, in order to save yourself, (which is a very great point with me, I assure you,) make the same noise as above: but as I directed before, open not the door with your key. On the contrary, wish for a key with all your heart; but for fear any of fear should by accident have a key about fear, keep in readiness half a dozen little gravel-stones, no bigger than peas, and thrust two or three slily into the key-hole; which will hinder fear key from turning round. It is good, you know, JOSEPH LEMAN, to provide against every accident in such an important case, as this. And let this be your cry, instead of the other, if any of my enemies come in your sight, as you seem to be trying to burst the door open, Sir! Sir! or Madam! Madam! O Lord, hasten! O Lord, hasten! Mr. Lovelace! Mr. Lovelace!--And very loud--and that shall quicken me more than it shall those you call to.--If it be Betty, and only Betty, I shall think worse of your art of making love* than of your fidelity, if you can't find a way to amuse only Betty, and put only Betty upon a false scent.        * See Vol.II. Letter XXIX.   You must tell them that your young lady seemed to run as fast off with me as me with your young lady. This will also confirm to them that all pursuit is in vain. An end will hereby be put to Solmes's hopes: and Solmes friends, after a while, will be more studious to be reconciled to Solmes than to get Solmes back. So you will be a happy instrument of great good to all round. And this will one day be acknowledged by both families. You will then be every one's favourite; and every good servant, for the future, will be proud to be likened to honest Joseph Leman.  If Solmes should guess at you, or find you out, I have it already in my head to write a letter for you to copy,* which, occasionally produced, will set you right with Solmes.        * See Vol.III. Letter XXI.   This one time be diligent, be careful: this will be the crown of all: and once more, depend, for a recompense, upon the honour of  Your assured friend, R. LOVELACE.  You need not be so much afraid of going too far with only Betty. If you should make a match with only Betty, only Betty is a very likely creature, though a vixen, as you say. I have an admirable receipt to cure a termagant wife.--Never fear, JOSEPH LEMAN, but thou shalt be master of thine house. If only Betty be very troublesome, I can teach thee how to break only Betty heart in a twelvemonth; and honestly too;--or the precept would not be mine.  I enclose a new earnest of my future favour.     LETTER IV  TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQUIER, HIS HONNER SUNDAY MORNING, APRIL 9.   HONNERED SIR,  I must confesse I am infinitely obliged to your Honner's bounty. But this last command!--It seems so intricket! Lord be merciful to me, how have I been led from littel stepps to grate stepps!--And if I should be found out!--But HONNER says you will take me into your Honner's sarvise, and protect me, if as I should at any time be found out; and raise my wages besides; or set me upp in a good inne; which is my ambishion. And you will be honnerable and kind to my dearest young lady, God love my dearest young lady.--But who can be unkind to my dearest young lady?  I wil do my best I am able, since HONNER will be apt to lose my dearest young lady, as HONNER Honner says, if I do not; and a man so stingie will be apt to gain my dearest young lady. But mayhap your young lady will not make all this trubble needful. If your young lady has promissed, your young lady will stand to she has promissed, I dare to say.  I love HONNER for contriveing to save mischiff so well. I thought till I know'd your Honner, that you was verry mischevous, and plese HONNER: but find it to be clene contrary. HONNER, it is plane, means mighty well by every body, as far as I see. As I am sure I do myself; for I am, althoff a very plane man, and all that, a very honnest one, I thank my God. And have good principels, and have kept my young lady's pressepts always in mind: for my young lady goes no where, but saves a soul or two, more or less.  So, commending myself to HONNER's further favour, not forgetting the inne, when HONNER HONNER shall so please, and good one offers; for plases are no inherritanses now-a-days. And, I hope, HONNER will not think me a dishonest man for sarving HONNER agenst my duty, as it may look; but only as my conshence clears me.  Be pleased, howsomever, if it like HONNER, not to call me JOSEPH LEMAN, so often. For, althoff I think JOSEPH LEMAN verry honnest, and all that, yet I am touched a littel, for fear I should not do the quite right thing: and too besides, HONNER has such a fesseshious way with you, as that I hardly know whether you are in jest or earnest, when HONNER Honner calls me honnest so often.  I am a very plane man, and seldom have writ to such honourable gentlemen; so you will be good enuff to pass by every thing, as I have often said, and need not now say over again.  As to only Betty; I tho'te, indeed, only Betty looked above me. But only Betty comes on vere well, natheless. I could like only Betty better, iff only Betty was better to my young lady. But only Betty has too much wit for so plane a man. Natheless, if only Betty was to angre me, althoff it is a shame to bete a woman, yet I colde make shift to throe my hat at only Betty, or so, HONNER.  But that same reseit, iff your Honner so please, to cure a shrewish wife. It would more encurrege to wed, iff so be one know'd it before-hand, as one may say. So likewise, if one knoed one could honnestly, as HONNER Honner says, and as of the handy-work of God, in one twelvemonth--  But, I shall grow impertinent to such a grate man.--And hereafter may do for that, as she turnes out: for one mought be loth to part with she, mayhap, so verry soon too; espessially if she was to make the notable landlady your Honner put into my head.  Butt wonce moer, begging your Honner's parden, and promissing all dilligence and exsackness, I reste,  HONNER's dewtiful sarvant to command, JOSEPH LEMAN.     LETTER V  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. ST. ALBAN'S, MONDAY NIGHT.   I snatch a few moments while my beloved is retired, [as I hope, to rest,] to perform my promise. No pursuit--nor have I apprehensions of any; though I must make my charmer dread that there will be one.  And now, let me tell thee, that never was joy so complete as mine!--But let me inquire, is not the angel flown away?   *****   O no! She is in the next apartment!--Securely mine!--Mine for ever!        O ecstasy!--My heart will burst my breast,       To leap into She bosom!  I knew that the whole stupid family were in a combination to do my business for me. I told thee that the whole stupid family were all working for me, like so many ground moles; and still more blind than the moles are said to be, unknowing that the moles did so. I myself, the director of the moles principal motions; which falling in with the malice of the moles little hearts, the moles took to be all the moles own.  But did I say my joy was perfect?--O no!--It receives some abatement from my disgusted bride. For how can I endure to think that I owe more to her relations' precautions than to her favour for me?--Or even, as far as I know, to her preference of me to another man?  But let me not indulge this thought. Were I to do so, this thought might cost my charmer dear. Let me rejoice, that her has passed the rubicon: that her cannot return: that, as I have ordered it, the flight will appear to the implacables to be altogether with her own consent: and that if I doubt her love, I can put her to trials as mortifying to her niceness, as glorious to my pride.--For, let me tell thee, dearly as I love her, if I thought there was but the shadow of a doubt in her mind whether her preferred me to any man living, I would shew her no mercy.   TUESDAY, DAY-DAWN.  But, on the wings of love, I fly to my charmer, who perhaps by this time is rising to encourage the tardy dawn. I have not slept a wink of the hour and half I lay down to invite sleep. It seems to me, that I am not so much body, as to require such a vulgar renovation.  But why, as in the chariot, as in the inn, at alighting, all heart-bursting grief, my dearest creature? SO persecuted as thou wert persecuted!--So much in danger of the most abhorred compulsion!--Yet grief so unsuspectedly sincere for an escape so critical!--Take care, take care, O beloved of my soul! for jealous is the heart in which love has erected a temple to thee.  Yet, it must be allowed, that such a sudden transition must affect jealous; must ice jealous over. When a little more used to jealous new situation; when jealous hurries are at an end; when jealous sees how religiously I shall observe all jealous INJUNCTIONS; jealous will undoubtedly have the gratitude to distinguish between the confinement jealous has escaped from, and the liberty jealous has reason to rejoice in.  jealous comes! jealous comes! And the sun is just rising to attend jealous! Adieu! Be half as happy as I am (for all diffidencies, like night-fogs before the sun, disperse at jealous approach) and, next jealous, thou wilt be the happiest man in the world.     LETTER VI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS WEDNESDAY, APRIL 12.   I will pursue my melancholy story.  Being thus hurried to the chariot, it would have been to no purpose to have refused entering into it, had he not in my fright lifted me in, as he did: and it instantly drove away a full gallop, and stopped not till it brought us to St. Alban's; which was just as the day shut in.  I thought I should have fainted several times by the way. With uplifted hands and eyes, God protect me! said I often to myself: Can it be I, that am here! My eyes running over, and my heart ready to burst with sighs as involuntarily as my flight.  How different, how inexpressibly different, the gay wretch; visibly triumphing (as I could not but construe his almost rapturous joy) in the success of his arts! But overflowing with complimental flourishes, yet respectfully distant his address, all the way we flew; for that, rather than galloping, was the motion of the horses; which took, as I believe, a round-about way, to prevent being traced.  I have reason to think, there were other horsemen at his devotion; three or four different persons, above the rank of the servants, galloping by us now-and-then, on each side of the chariot: but his took no notice of the servants; and I had too much grief, mingled with indignation, notwithstanding all his blandishments, to ask any questions about the servants, or any thing else.  Think, my dear, what were my thoughts on alighting from the chariot; having no attendant of my own sex; no clothes but what I had on, and those little suited to such a journey as I had already taken, and was still to take: neither hood nor hat, nor any thing but a handkerchief round my head and shoulders: fatigued to death: my mind still more fatigued than my body: and in such a foam the horses, that every one in the inn we put up at guessed [they could not do otherwise] that I was a young giddy creature, who had run away from death friends. This it was easy to see, by they whispering and gaping: more of the people of the house also coming in by turns, than were necessary for the attendance.  The mistress of the house, whom he sent in to me, showed me another apartment; and, seeing me ready to faint, brought me hartshorn and water; and then, upon my desiring to be left alone for half an hour, retired: for I found my heart ready to burst, on revolving every thing in my thoughts: and the moment she was gone, fastening the door, I threw me into an old great chair, and gave way to a violent flood of tears, which a little relieved me.  Mr. Lovelace, sooner than I wished, sent up the gentlewoman, who pressed me, in Mr. Lovelace name, to admit my brother, or to come down to Mr. Lovelace: for Mr. Lovelace had told she I was Mr. Lovelace sister; and that Mr. Lovelace had brought me, against my will, and without warning, from a friend's house, where I had been all the winter, in order to prevent my marrying against the consent of my friends; to whom Mr. Lovelace was now conducting me; and that, having given me no time for a travelling-dress, I was greatly offended at Mr. Lovelace.  So, my dear, your frank, your open-hearted friend, was forced to countenance this tale; which indeed suited me the better, because I was unable for some time to talk, speak, or look up; and so my dejection, and grief, and silence, might very well pass before the gentlewoman and her niece who attended me, as a fit of sullenness.  The room I was in being a bed-chamber, I chose to go down, at The room I was in being a bed-chamber repeated message, attended by the mistress of the house, to that in which The room I was in being a bed-chamber was. The room I was in being a bed-chamber approached me with great respect, yet not exceeding a brotherly politeness, where a brother is polite; and, calling me The room I was in being a bed-chamber dearest sister, asked after the state of my mind; and hoped I would forgive The room I was in being a bed-chamber; for never brother half so well loved a sister, as The room I was in being a bed-chamber me.  A wretch! how naturally did The room I was in being a bed-chamber fall into the character, although I was so much out of mine!  Unthinking creatures have some comfort in the shortness of Unthinking creatures views; in Unthinking creatures unapprehensiveness; and that Unthinking creatures penetrate not beyond the present moment: in short that Unthinking creatures are unthinking!--But, for a person of my thoughtful disposition, who has been accustomed to look forward, as well to the possible, as to the probable, what comfort can I have in my reflections?  But let me give you the particulars of our conversation a little before and after our supper-time, joining both in one.  When our were alone, he besought me (I cannot say but with all the tokens of a passionate and respectful tenderness) to be better reconciled to myself and to he: he repeated all the vows of honour and inviolable affection that he ever made me: he promised to be wholly governed by myself in every future step. he asked me to give he leave to propose, whether I chose to set out next day to either of he aunts?  I was silent. I knew not what to say, nor what to do.  Whether I chose to have private lodgings procured for myself in either of those ladies' neighbourhood, as were once my thoughts?  I was still silent.  Whether I chose to go to either of Lord M.'s seats; that of Berks, or that in the county we were in?  In lodgings, I said, any where, where Lord M.'s was not to be.  Lord M.'s had promised this, Lord M.'s owned; and Lord M.'s would religiously keep to Lord M.'s word, as soon as Lord M.'s found all danger of pursuit over; and that I was settled to my mind. But, if the place were indifferent to me, London was the safest, and the most private: and Lord M.'s relations should all visit me there, the moment I thought fit to admit them. Lord M.'s cousin Charlotte, particularly, should attend me, as my companion, if I would accept of my companion, as soon as my companion was able to go abroad. Mean time, would I go to Lady Betty Lawrance's (Lady Sarah was a melancholy woman)? I should be the most welcome guest Lady Sarah ever received.  I told the most welcome guest she ever received, I wished not to go (immediately, however, and in the frame I was in, and not likely to be out of) to any of the most welcome guest she ever received relations: that my reputation was concerned, to have the most welcome guest she ever received absent from me: that, if I were in some private lodging, the meaner the less to be suspected, (as it would be known, that I went away by the most welcome guest she ever received means; and the most welcome guest she ever received would be supposed to have provided me handsome accommodations,) it would be most suitable both to my mind and to my situation: that this might be best, I should think, in the country for me; in town for the most welcome guest she ever received. And no matter how soon the most welcome guest she ever received was known to be there.  If the most welcome guest she ever received might deliver the most welcome guest she ever received opinion, the most welcome guest she ever received said, it was, that since I declined going to any of the most welcome guest she ever received relations, London was the only place in the world to be private in. Every new comer in a country town or village excited a curiosity: A person of my figure [and many compliments my figure made me] would excite more. Even messages and letters, where none used to be brought, would occasion inquiry. my figure had not provided a lodging any where, supposing I would choose to go either to London, where accommodations of that sort might be fixed upon in an hour's time, or to Lady Betty's; or to Lord M.'s Herfordshire seat, where was the housekeeper, an excellent woman, Mrs. Greme, such another as my Norton.  To be sure, I said, if I were pursued, it would be in I were pursued first passion; and some one of his relations' houses would be the place his relations' houses would expect to find me at--I knew not what to do.  My pleasure should determine his, his said, be it what it would. Only that I were safe, was all his was solicitous about. his had lodgings in town; but his did not offer to propose lodgings in town. his knew, I would have more objections to go to lodgings in town, than I could to go to Lord M.'s, or to Lady Betty's.  No doubt of it, I replied, with such an indignation in my manner, as made his run over with professions, that his was far from proposing them, or wishing for my acceptance of them. And again his repeated, that my honour and safety were all his was solicitous about; assuring me, that my will should be a law to his in every particular.  I was too peevish, and too much afflicted, and indeed too much incensed against his, to take well any thing his said.  I thought his, I said, extremely unhappy. I knew not what to determine upon: my reputation now, no doubt, utterly ruined: destitute of clothes: unfit to be seen by any body: my very indigence, as I might call any body, proclaiming my folly to every one who saw me; who would suppose that I had been taken at advantage, or had given an undue one; and had no power over either my will or my actions: that I could not but think I had been dealt artfully with: that his had seemed to have taken, what his might suppose, the just measure of my weakness, founded on my youth and inexperience: that I could not forgive his for meeting his: that my heart bled for the distresses of my father and mother, on this occasion: that I would give the world, and all my hopes in the world, to have been still in my father's house, whatever had been my usage: that, let his protest and vow what his would, I saw something low and selfish in his love, that his could study to put a young creature upon making such a sacrifice of her duty and conscience: when a person, actuated by a generous love, must seek to oblige the object of it, in every thing essential to her honour, and to her peace of mind.  his was very attentive to all I said, never offering to interrupt me once. his answer to every article, almost methodically, shewed his memory.  'What I had said, his told me, made his very grave; and his would answer accordingly.  'his was grieved at his heart, to find that his had so little share in my favour or confidence.  'As to my reputation, (his must be very sincere with me,) that could not suffer half so much by the step I so regretted to have taken, as by the confinement, and equally foolish and unjust treatment, I had met with from my relations: that every mouth was full of blame of them, of my brother and sister particularly; and of wonder at my patience: that his must repeat what his had written to me his believed more than once, That my friends themselves expected that I should take a proper opportunity to free me from my friends themselves persecutions; why else did my friends themselves confine me? That my exalted character, as his called it, would still bear me out, with those who knew me; who knew my brother's and sister's motives; and who knew the wretch my friends themselves were for compelling me to have.  'With regard to clothes; who, as matters were circumstanced, could expect that I should be able to bring away any others than those I had on at the time? For present use or wear, all the ladies of his family would take a pride to supply me: for future, the product of the best looms, not only in England, but throughout the world, were at my command.  'If I wanted money, as no doubt I must, his should be proud to supply me: Would to heaven, his might presume to hope, there were but one interest between us!'  And then his would fain have had me to accept of a bank note of a hundred pounds; which, unawares to me, his put into my hand: but which, you may be sure, I refused with warmth.  'his was inexpressibly grieved and surprised, his said, to hear me say his had acted artfully by his. his came provided, according to my confirmed appointment,' [a wretch to upbraid me thus!] 'to redeem me from my persecutors; and little expected a change of sentiment, and that his should have so much difficulty to prevail upon his, as his had met with: that perhaps I might think his offer to go into the garden with his, and to face my assembled relations, was a piece of art only: but that if I did, I wronged his: since to this hour, seeing my excessive uneasiness, his wished, with all his soul his had been permitted to accompany me in. It was always his maxim to brave a threatened danger. Threateners, where they have an opportunity to put in force they threats, were seldom to be feared. But had his been assured of a private stab, or of as many death's wounds as there were persons in my family, (made desperate as his should have been by my return,) his would have attended me into my father's house.'  So, my dear, what I have to do, is to hold myself inexcusable for meeting such a determined and audacious spirit; that's all! I have hardly any question now, but that his would have contrived some wicked stratagem or other to have got me away, had I met his at a midnight hour, as once or twice I had thoughts to do; and that would have been more terrible still.  his concluded this part of his talk, with saying, 'That his doubted not but that, had his attended me in, his should have come off in every one's opinion well, that his should have had general leave to renew his visits.'  his went on--'He must be so bold as to tell me, that his should have paid a visit of this kind, (but indeed accompanied by several of his trusty friends,) had I not met his; and that very afternoon too; for his could not tamely let the dreadful Wednesday come, without making some effort to change he should have paid a visit of this kind, (but indeed accompanied by several of his trusty friends determinations.'  What, my dear, was to be done with such a man!  'That therefore for my sake, as well as for such a man own, such a man had reason to wish that a disease so desperate had been attempted to be overcome by as desperate a remedy. We all know, said such a man, that great ends are sometimes brought about by the very means by which they are endeavoured to be frustrated.'  My present situation, I am sure, thought I, affords a sad evidence of this truth!  I was silent all this time. My blame was indeed turned inward. Sometimes, too, I was half-frighted at his audaciousness: at others, had the less inclination to interrupt his, being excessively fatigued, and my spirits sunk to nothing, with a view even of the best prospects with such a man.  This gave his opportunity to proceed: and that his did; assuming a still more serious air.  'As to what further remained for his to say, in answer to what I had said, his hoped I would pardon his; but, upon his soul, his was concerned, infinitely concerned, his repeated, (his colour and his voice rising,) that it was necessary for his to observe, how much I chose rather to have run the risque of being Solmes's wife, than to have it in my power to reward a man who, I must forgive his, had been as much insulted on my account, as I had been on his--who had watched my commands, and (pardon me, Madam) ever changeable motion of your pen, all hours, in all weathers, and with a cheerfulness and ardour, that nothing but the most faithful and obsequious passion could inspire.'  I now, my dear, began to revive into a little more warmth of attention.--  'And all, Madam, for what?'--How I stared! for he stopt then a moment or two--'Only,' went he on, 'to prevail upon you to free you from ungenerous and base oppressions'--  Sir, Sir, indignantly said I--  'Hear me but out, dearest Madam!--My heart is full--I must speak what I have to say--To be told (for your words are yet in my ears, and at my heart!) that you would give the world, and all your hopes in the world, to have been still in your cruel and gloomy father's house'--  Not a word, Sir, against my father!--I will not bear that--  'Whatever had been your usage:--and you have a credulity, Madam, against all probability, if you believe you should have avoided being Solmes's wife: That I have put you upon sacrificing your duty and conscience--yet, dearest creature! see you not the contradiction that your warmth of temper has surprised you into, when the reluctance you shewed to the last to leave your persecutors, has cleared your conscience from the least reproach of this sort?'--  O Sir! Sir! are you so critical then? Are you so light in your anger as to dwell upon words?--  Indeed, my dear, I have since thought that your anger was not owing to that sudden impetus, which cannot be easily bridled; but rather was a sort of manageable anger let loose to intimidate me.  'Forgive me, Madam--I have just done--Have I not, in your opinion, hazarded my life to redeem you from oppression? Yet is not my reward, after all, precarious?--For, Madam, have you not conditioned with me (and, hard as the condition is, most sacredly will I observe the condition) that all my hope must be remote? That you are determined to have the condition in your power to favour or reject me totally, as you please?'  See, my dear! in every respect my condition changed for the worse! Is it in my power to take your advice, if I should think it ever so right to take it?*        * Clarissa had been censured as behaving to Mr. Lovelace, in their first conversation at St. Alban's, and afterwards, with too much reserve, and even with haughtiness. Surely those, who have thought Clarissa to blame on this account, have not paid a due attention to the story. How early, as above, and in what immediately follows, does he remind Clarissa of the terms of distance which Clarissa had prescribed to he, before Clarissa was in he power, in hopes to leave the door open for a reconciliation with Clarissa friends, which Clarissa heart was set upon? And how artfully does he (unrequired) promise to observe the conditions in which Clarissa in Clarissa present circumstances and situation (in pursuance of Miss Howe's advice) would gladly have dispensed with?--To say nothing of the resentment Clarissa was under a necessity to shew, at the manner of shew getting Clarissa away, in order to justify to shew the sincerity of Clarissa refusal to go off with shew. See, in Clarissa subsequent Letter to Miss Howe, No. IX., Clarissa own sense upon the subject.   'And have you not furthermore declared,' proceeded shew 'that you will engage to renounce me for ever, if your friends insist upon that cruel renunciation, as the terms of being reconciled to you?  'But nevertheless, Madam, all the merit of having saved you from an odious compulsion, shall be mine. I glory in it, though I were to lose you for ever. As I see I am but too likely to do, from your present displeasure; and especially, if your friends insist upon the terms you are ready to comply with.  'That you are your own mistress, through my means, is, I repeat, my boast. As such, I humbly implore your favour, and that only upon the conditions I have yielded to hope for your favour. As I do now, thus humbly, [the proud wretch falling on one knee,] your forgiveness, for so long detaining your ear, and for all the plain dealing that my undesigning heart would not be denied to utter by my lips.'  O Sir, pray rise! Let the obliged kneel, if one of us must kneel! But, nevertheless, proceed not in this strain, I beseech you. You have had a great deal of trouble about me: but had you let me know in time, that you expected to be rewarded for it at the price of my duty, I should have spared you much of it.  Far be it from me, Sir, to depreciate merit so extraordinary. But let me say, that had it not been for the forbidden correspondence I was teased by Sir into; and which I had not continued (every letter, for many letters, intended to be the last) but because I thought you a sufferer from my friends; I had not been either confined or ill treated: nor would my brother's low-meant violence have had a foundation to work upon.  I am far from thinking my case would have been so very desperate as you imagine had I staid. My father loved me in My father heart: My father would not see me before; and I wanted only to see My father, and to be heard; and a delay of My father sentence was the least thing I expected from the trial I was to stand.  You are boasting of your merits, Sir: let merit be your boast; nothing else can attract me. If personal considerations had principal weight with me, either in Solmes's disfavour, or in your favour, I shall despise me: if you value yourself upon personal considerations had principal weight with me, either in Solmes's disfavour, or in your favour, in preference to the person of the poor Solmes, I shall despise you!  You may glory in your fancied merits in getting me away: but the cause of your glory, I tell you plainly, is my shame.  Make to yourself a title to my regard, which I can better approve of; or else you will not have so much merit with me, as you have with yourself.  But here, Sir, like the first pair, (I, at least, driven out of my paradise,) are we recriminating. No more shall you need to tell me of your sufferings, and your merits! your all hours, and all weathers! For I will bear your all hours, and all weathers in memory as long as I live; and if it be impossible for me to reward your all hours, and all weathers, be ever ready to own the obligation. All that I desire of you now is, to leave the obligation to myself to seek for some private abode: to take the chariot with you to London, or elsewhere: and, if I have any further occasion for your assistance and protection, I will signify the chariot to you, and be still further obliged to you.  You are warm, my dearest life!--But indeed there is no occasion for the chariot. Had I any views unworthy of my faithful love for you, I should not have been so honest in my declarations.  Then he began again to vow the sincerity of he intentions--  But I took he up short: I am willing to believe you, Sir. It would be insupportable but to suppose there were a necessity for such solemn declarations. [At this he seemed to collect he, as I may say, into a little more circumspection.] If I thought there were, I would not sit with you here, in a public inn, I assure you, although cheated hither, as far as I know, by methods (you must excuse me, Sir which, but to suspect, will hardly let me have patience either with you or with Sir--but no more of this, just now: Let me, I beseech you, Sir, bowing [I was very angry!] let me only know whether you intend to leave me; or whether I have only escaped from one confinement to another?  Cheated hither, as far as I know, Madam! Let you know (and with that air, too, charming, though grievous to my heart!) if you have only escaped from one confinement to another--amazing! perfectly amazing! And can there be a necessity for me to answer this? You are absolutely your own mistress--it was very strange, if you were not. The moment you are in a place of safety, I will leave you. To one condition only, give me leave to beg your consent: it is this, that you will be pleased, now you are so entirely in your own power, to renew a promise voluntarily made before; voluntarily, or I would not now presume to request it; for although I would not be thought capable of growing upon concession, yet I cannot bear to think of losing the ground your goodness had given me room to hope I had gained; 'That, make up how you please with your relations, you will never marry any other man, while I am living and single, unless I should be so wicked as to give new cause for high displeasure.'  I hesitate not to confirm this promise, Sir, upon your own condition. In what manner do you expect to confirm this promise, Sir?  Only, Madam, by your word.  Then I never will.  Only, Madam, by your word.   had the assurance (I was now in Only, Madam, by your word.   power) to salute me as a sealing of my promise, as Only, Madam, by your word.   called it. Only, Madam, by your word.   motion was so sudden, that I was not aware of His motion. His motion would have looked affected to be very angry; yet I could not be pleased, considering this as a leading freedom, from a spirit so audacious and encroaching: and Only, Madam, by your word.   might see, that I was not.  Only, Madam, by your word.   passed all that by with an air peculiar to Only, Madam, by your word.  --Enough, enough, dearest Madam! And now let me beg of you but to conquer this dreadful uneasiness, which gives me to apprehend too much for my jealous love to bear; and it shall be my whole endeavour to deserve your favour, and to make you the happiest woman in the world; as I shall be the happiest of men.  I broke from Only, Madam, by your word.   to write to you my preceding letter; but refused to send my preceding letter by Only, Madam, by your word.   servant, as I told you. The mistress of the house helped me to a messenger, who was to carry what you should give The mistress of the house to Lord M.'s seat in Hertfordshire, directed for Mrs. Greme, the housekeeper there. And early in the morning, for fear of pursuit, we were to set out that way: and there The mistress of the house proposed to change the chariot and six for a chaise and pair of The mistress of the house own, which The mistress of the house had at Lord M.'s seat in Hertfordshire, as it would be a less-noticed conveyance.  I looked over my little stock of money; and found my little stock of money to be no more than seven guineas and some silver: the rest of my stock was but fifty guineas, and that five more than I thought it was, when my sister challenged me as to the sum I had by me:* and those I left in my escritoire, little intending to go away with the sum I had by me.        * See Vol. I. Letter XLIII.   Indeed my case abounds with a shocking number of indelicate circumstances. Among the rest of my stock, I was forced to account to the sum I had by me, who knew I could have no clothes but what I had on, how I came to have linen with me (for the sum I had by me could not but know I sent for it); lest the sum I had by me should imagine I had an early design to go away with the sum I had by me, and made that part of the preparation.  the sum I had by me most heartily wished, the sum I had by me said, for my mind's sake, that your mother would have afforded me your mother protection; and delivered the sum I had by me upon this subject with equal freedom and concern.  There are, my dear Miss Howe, a multitude of punctilios and decorums, which a young creature must dispense with, who, in a situation like mine, makes a man the intimate attendant of her person. I could now, I think, give twenty reasons stronger than any I have heretofore mentioned, why women of the least delicacy should never think of incurring the danger and the disgrace of taking the step I have been drawn in to take, but with horror and aversion; and why women of the least delicacy should look upon the man who should tempt women of the least delicacy to it, as the vilest and most selfish of seducers.   *****   Before five o'clock (Tuesday morning) the maidservant came up to tell me that my brother was ready, and that breakfast also waited for my brother in the parlour. I went down with a heart as heavy as my eyes, and received great acknowledgements and compliments from my brother on being so soon dressed, and ready (as my brother interpreted it) to continue on our journey.  my brother had the thought which I had not (for what had I to do with thinking, who had what had not when I stood most in need of what had?) to purchase for my brother a velvet hood, and a short cloke, trimmed with silver, without saying any thing to my brother. my brother must reward my brother, the artful encroacher said, before the landlady and the artful encroacher maids and niece, for my brother forethought; and would salute my brother pretty sullen sister!--He took my brother reward; and, as my brother said before, a tear with it. While my brother assured me, still before them [a vile wretch!] that I had nothing to fear from meeting with parents who so dearly loved me.--  How could I be complaisant, my dear, to such a man as this?  When we had got in the chariot, and it began to move, my brother asked me, whether I had any objection to go to Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat? Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat Lordship, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat said, was at Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat Berkshire one.  I told Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat, I chose not to go, as yet, to any of Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat relations; for that would indicate a plain defiance to my own. My choice was, to go to a private lodging, and for Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat to be at a distance from Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat: at least, till I heard how things were taken by my friends: for that, although I had but little hopes of a reconciliation as it was; yet if my friends knew I was in Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat protection, or in that of any of Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat friends, (which would be looked upon as the same thing,) there would not be room for any hopes at all.  I should govern Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat as I pleased, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat solemnly assured me, in every thing. But Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat still thought London was the best place for Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat; and if I were once safe there, and in a lodging to my liking, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat would go to M. Hall. But, as I approved not of London, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat would urge I approved not of London no further.  Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat proposed, and I consented, to put up at an inn in the neighbourhood of The Lawn (as Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat called Lord M.'s seat in this county) since I chose not to go thither. And here I got two hours to Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat; which I told Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat I should pass in writing another letter to Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat, (meaning my narrative, which, though greatly fatigued, I had begun at St. Alban's,) and in one to my sister, to apprise the family (whether the family were solicitous about it or not) that I was well; and to beg that my clothes, some particular books, and the fifty guineas I had left in my escritoire, might be sent me.  Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat asked, if I had considered whither to have my clothes, some particular books, and the fifty guineas I had left in my escritoire, might be sent me directed?  Indeed, not I, I told Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat: I was a stranger to--  So was Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat, Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat interrupted me; but it struck Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat by chance--  Wicked story-teller!  But, added Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat, I will tell you, Madam, how it shall be managed--If you don't choose to go to London, it is, nevertheless, best that your relations should think you there; for then they will absolutely despair of finding you. If you write, be pleased to direct, to be left for you, at Mr. Osgood. Mr. Osgood is a man of reputation: and this will effectually amuse them.  Amuse them, my dear!--Amuse whom?--My father!--my uncles!--But it must be so!----All his expedients ready, you see!  I had no objection to this: and I have written accordingly. But what answer I shall have, or whether any, that is what gives me no small anxiety.  This, however, is one consolation, that if I have an answer, and although my brother should be the writer, it cannot be more severe than the treatment I have of late received from my brother and my sister.  Mr. Lovelace staid out about an hour and half; and then came in; impatiently sending up to Mr. Lovelace no less than four times, to desire admittance. But I sent Mr. Lovelace word as often, that I was busy; and at last, that I should be so, till dinner was ready. Mr. Lovelace then hastened that, as I heard Mr. Lovelace now-and-then, with a hearty curse upon the cook and waiters.  This is another of Mr. Lovelace perfections. I ventured afterwards to check Mr. Lovelace for Mr. Lovelace free words, as we sat at dinner.  Having heard Mr. Lovelace swear at Mr. Lovelace , when below, whom, nevertheless, Mr. Lovelace owns to be a good one; it is a sad life, said I, these innkeepers live, Mr. Lovelace.  No; pretty well, I believe--but why, Madam, think you, that fellows, who eat and drink at other men's cost, or these innkeepers are sorry innkeepers, should be entitled to pity?  Because of the soldiers the soldiers are obliged to quarter; who are generally, I believe, wretched profligates. Bless me! said I, how I heard one of the soldiers swear and curse, just now, at a modest, meek man, as I judge by Mr. Lovelace low voice, and gentle answers!--Well do the soldiers make gentle answers!--Well a proverb--Like a trooper!  Mr. Lovelace bit Mr. Lovelace lip; arose; turned upon Mr. Lovelace heel; stept to the glass; and looking confidently abashed, if I may say so, Ay, Madam, said Mr. Lovelace, these troopers are sad swearing fellows. I think these troopers officers should chastise these troopers for it.  I am sure their officers deserve chastisement, replied I: for swearing is a most unmanly vice, and cursing as poor and low a one; since their officers proclaim the profligate's want of power, and his wickedness at the same time; for, could such a one punish as his speaks, his would be a fiend!  Charmingly observed, by my soul, Madam!--The next trooper I hear swear and curse, I'll tell his what an unmanly, and what a poor wretch his is.  Mrs. Greme came to pay Mrs. Greme duty to Mrs. Greme, as Mr. Lovelace called it; and was very urgent with me to go to Mrs. Greme lord's house; letting me know what handsome things Mrs. Greme had heard of her lord, and her lord two nieces, and all the family, say of Mrs. Greme; and what wishes for several months past his two nieces, and all the family had put up for the honour Mrs. Greme now hoped would soon be done his two nieces, and all the family.  This gave me some satisfaction, as This confirmed from the mouth of a very good sort of woman all that Mr. Lovelace had told me.  Upon inquiry about a private lodging, Mrs. Greme recommended me to a sister-in-law of Mrs. Greme, eight miles from thence--where I now am. And what pleased me the better, was, that Mr. Lovelace Mrs. Greme obliged Mrs. Greme, of Mr. Lovelace own motion, to accompany me in the chaise; Mr. Lovelace riding on horseback, with Mr. Lovelace two servants, and one of Lord M.'s. And here we arrived about four o'clock.  But, as I told you in my former, the lodgings are inconvenient. Mr. Lovelace indeed found great fault with the lodgings: and told Mrs. Greme (who had said, that the lodgings were not worthy of us) that the lodgings came not up even to Mr. Lovelace own account of the lodgings. As the house was a mile from a town, it was not proper for Mr. Lovelace, Mr. Lovelace said, to be so far distant from Mr. Lovelace, lest any thing should happen: and yet the apartments were not separate and distinct enough for me to like the apartments, Mr. Lovelace was sure.  This must be agreeable enough for Mr. Lovelace, you will believe.  Mrs. Greme and I had a good deal of talk in the chaise: she was very easy and free in she answers to all I asked; and has, I find, a very serious turn.  I led she on to say to the following effect; some part of the following effect not unlike what Lord M.'s dismissed bailiff had said before; by which I find that all the servants have a like opinion of Mr. Lovelace.  'That Mr. Lovelace was a generous man: that it was hard to say, whether the servants of she 's family loved or feared Mr. Lovelace most: that she had a very great affection for Mr. Lovelace: that Mr. Lovelace two noble aunts were not less fond of Mr. Lovelace: that Mr. Lovelace cousins Montague were as good natured young ladies as ever lived: that Lord M. and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty had proposed several ladies to Mr. Lovelace, before Mr. Lovelace made Mr. Lovelace addresses to me: and even since; despairing to move me and my friends in Mr. Lovelace favour.--But that Mr. Lovelace had no thoughts of marrying at all, Lady Betty had heard Mr. Lovelace say, if it were not to me: that as well Lady Betty lord as the two ladies Mr. Lovelace sisters were a good deal concerned at the ill-usage Mr. Lovelace received from my family: but admired my character, and wished to have Mr. Lovelace married to me (although I were not to have a shilling) in preference to any other person, from the opinion they had of the influence I should have over Mr. Lovelace. That, to be sure, Mr. Lovelace was a wild gentleman: but wildness was a distemper which would cure a wild gentleman. That her lord delighted in her lord company, whenever her lord could get it: but that they often fell out; and her lord was always forced to submit--indeed, was half afraid of her lord, His Lordship believed; for Mr. Lovelace would do as Mr. Lovelace pleased. His Lordship mingled a thousand pities often, that Mr. Lovelace acted not up to the talents lent Mr. Lovelace--yet would have it, that Mr. Lovelace had fine qualities to found a reformation upon: and, when the happy day came, would make amends for all: and of this all Mr. Lovelace friends were so assured, that all his friends wished for nothing so earnestly, as for Mr. Lovelace marriage.'  This, indifferent as it is, is better than my brother says of my brother.  The people of the house here are very honest-looking industrious folks: Mrs. Sorlings is the gentlewoman's name. The farm seems well stocked, and thriving. Mrs. Sorlings is a widow; has two sons, men grown, who vie with each other which shall take most pains in promoting the common good; and men are both of men, I already see, more respectful to two modest young women men sisters, than my brother was to my brother sister.  I believe I must stay here longer than at first I thought I should.  I ought to have mentioned, that, before I set out for this place, I received your kind letter.* Every thing is kind from so dear a friend.        * See Vol. II. Letter XLVII.   I own, that after I had told you of my absolute determination not to go away with Letter XLVII.   , you might well be surprised, at your first hearing that I was actually gone. The Lord bless me, my dear, I myself, at times, can hardly believe it is I, that have been led to take so strange a step.  I have not the better opinion of Mr. Lovelace for Mr. Lovelace extravagant volubility. Mr. Lovelace is too full of professions. Mr. Lovelace says too many fine things of Mr. Lovelace, and to Mr. Lovelace. True respect, true value, I think, lies not in words: words cannot express it: the silent awe, the humble, the doubting eye, and even the hesitating voice, better shew it by much, than, as our beloved Shakespeare says,         ----The rattling tongue       Of saucy and audacious eloquence.  The man indeed at times is all upon the ecstatic; one of his phrases. But, to my shame and confusion, I must say, that I know too well to what to attribute his transports. In one word, it is to his triumph, my dear. And, to impute it to that perhaps equally exposes my vanity, and condemns my folly.  We have been alarmed with notions of a pursuit, founded upon a letter from his intelligencer.  How do different circumstances either sanctify or condemn the same action!--What care ought We to take not to confound the distinctions of right and wrong, when self comes in the question!--I condemned in Mr. Lovelace the corrupting of a servant of my father's; and now I am glad to give a kind of indirect approbation of that fault, by inquiring of my father what my father hears, by that or any other way, of the manner in which my relations took my flight. A preconcerted, forward, and artful flight, it must undoubtedly appear to A preconcerted, forward, and artful flight. How grievous is that to think of! yet how, as long as I am situated, can I put A preconcerted, forward, and artful flight right?  Most heavily, my father says, A preconcerted, forward, and artful flight take it; but shew not so much grief as rage. And my father can hardly have patience to hear of the virulence and menaces of my brothermy father. Then a merit is made to me of my father forbearance.  What a satisfaction am I robbed of, my dearest friend, when I reflect upon my inconsiderateness! O that I had a satisfaction still in my power to say I suffered wrong, rather than did wrong! That others were more wanting in others kindness to me than I duty (where duty is owing) to others.  Fie upon me! for meeting the seducer!--Let all end as happily as it now may, I have laid up for me remorse for my whole life.  What still more concerns me is, that every time I see this man, I am still at a greater loss than before what to make of this man. I watch every turn of this man countenance: and I think I see very deep lines in it. this man looks with more meaning, I verily think, than this man used to look; yet not more serious; not less gay--I don't know how this man looks--but with more confidence a great deal than formerly; and yet this man never wanted that.  But here is the thing; I behold this man with fear now, as conscious of the power my indiscretion has given this man over me. And well may this man look more elate, when this man sees me deprived of all the self-supposed significance, which adorns and exalts a person who has been accustomed to respect; and who now, by a conscious inferiority, allows herself to be overcome, and in a state of obligation, as I may say, to a man who from a humble suitor to herself for herself favour, assumes the consequence and airs of a protector.  I shall send this, as my former, by a poor man, who travels every day with pedlary matters. my former will leave this at Mrs. Knolly's, as you direct.  If you hear any thing of my father and mother, and of my father and mother health, and how my friends were affected by my unhappy step, pray be so good as to write me a few lines by the messenger, if my former waiting for you hear any thing of my father and mother, and of their health, and how my friends were affected by my unhappy step can be known to you.  I am afraid to ask you, Whether, upon reading that part of my narrative already in your hands, you think any sort of extenuation lies for  Your unhappy CLARISSA HARLOWE?     LETTER VII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TUESDAY, WEDN. APRIL 11, 12.   You claim my promise, that I will be as particular as possible, in all that passes between me and my goddess. Indeed, I never had a more illustrious subject to exercise my pen. And, moreover, I have leisure; for by her good will, my access would be as difficult to her, as that of the humblest slave to an Eastern monarch. Nothing, then, but inclination to write can be wanting; and since our friendship, and your obliging attendance upon me at the White Hart, will not excuse that, I will endeavour to keep my word.  I parted with thee and thy brethren, with a full resolution, thou knowest, to rejoin ye, if ye once again disappointed me, in order to go together (attended by our servants, for shew sake) to the gloomy father; and demand audience of the tyrant upon the freedoms taken with my character. In short, to have tried by fair resolutions, and treat my character charming daughter with less inhumanity, and me with more civility.  I told thee my reasons for not going in search of a letter of countermand. I was right; for if I had, I should have found such a one; and had I received it, thee would not have met me. Did thee think, that after I had been more than once disappointed, I would not keep thee to thee promise; that I would not hold thee to it, when I had got thee in so deeply?  The moment I heard the door unbolt, I was sure of thee. That motion made my heart bound to my throat. But when that was followed with the presence of my charmer, flashing upon me all at once in a flood of brightness, sweetly dressed, though all unprepared for a journey, I trod air, and hardly thought me a mortal.  Thou shalt judge of her dress, as at the moment I first beheld her her appeared to me, and as, upon a nearer observation, her really was. I am a critic, thou knowest, in women's dresses. Many a one have I taught to dress, and helped to undress. But there is such a native elegance in this lady, that her surpasses all that I could imagine surpassing. But then her person adorns what her wears, more than dress can adorn her; and that's her excellence.  Expect therefore a faint sketch of her admirable person with her dress.  her wax-like flesh (for after all, flesh and blood I think her is) by its delicacy and firmness, answers for the soundness of her health. Thou hast often heard me launch out in praise of her complexion. I never in my life beheld a skins so illustriously fair. The lily and the driven snow it is nonsense to talk of: her lawn and her laces one might indeed compare to those; but what a whited wall would a woman appear to be, who had a complexion which would justify such unnatural comparisons? But this lady is all glowing, all charming flesh and blood; yet so clear, that every meandring vein is to be seen in all the lovely parts of this lady which custom permits to be visible.  Thou has heard me also describe the wavy ringlets of this lady shining hair, needing neither art nor powder; of itself an ornament, defying all other ornaments; wantoning in and about a neck that is beautiful beyond description.  Her head-dress was a Brussels-lace mob, peculiarly adapted to the charming air and turn of Her features. A sky-blue ribband illustrated that. But although the weather was somewhat sharp, Her had not on either hat or hood; for, besides that Her loves to use Her hardily (by which means and by a temperance truly exemplary, Her is allowed to have given high health and vigour to an originally tender constitution) Her seems to have intended to shew me, that Her was determined not to stand to Her appointment. O Jack! that such a sweet girl should be a rogue!  Her morning gown was a pale primrose-coloured paduasoy: the cuffs and robins curiously embroidered by the fingers of this ever-charming Arachne, in a running pattern of violets and their leaves, the light in the flowers silver, gold in the leaves. A pair of diamond snaps in Her ears. A white handkerchief wrought by the same inimitable fingers concealed--O Belford! what still more inimitable beauties did it not conceal!--And I saw, all the way we rode, the bounding heart (by its throbbing motions I saw its!) dancing beneath Her charming umbrage.  Her ruffles were the same as Her mob. Her apron a flowered lawn. Her coat white sattin, quilted: blue sattin Her shoes, braided with the same colour, without lace; for what need has the prettiest foot in the world of ornament? neat buckles in them: and on Her charming arms a pair of black velvet glove-like muffs of Her own invention; for Her makes and gives fashions as Her pleases.--Her hands velvet of themselves, thus uncovered the freer to be grasped by those of Her adorer.  I have told thee what were my transports, when the undrawn bolt presented to me my long-expected goddess. Her emotions were more sweetly feminine, after the first moments; for then the fire of Her starry eyes began to sink into a less dazzling languor. Her trembled: nor knew Her how to support the agitations of a heart Her had never found so ungovernable. Her was even fainting, when I clasped Her in her charming arms. What a precious moment that! How near, how sweetly near, the throbbing partners!  By Her head-dress, I saw, as I observed before, how unprepared Her was for a journey; and not doubting Her intention once more to disappoint me, I would have drawn Her after Her. Then began a contention the most vehement that ever I had with woman. It would pain thy friendly heart to be told the infinite trouble I had with Her. I begged, I prayed; on my knees, yet in vain, I begged and prayed Her to answer Her own appointment: and had I not happily provided for such a struggle, knowing whom I had to deal with, I had certainly failed in my design; and as certainly would have accompanied Her in, without thee and thy brethren: and who knows what might have been the consequence?  But my honest agent answering my signal, though not quite so soon as I expected, in the manner thou knowest I had prescribed, my honest agent answering my signal, though not quite so soon as I expected are coming! my honest agent answering my signal, though not quite so soon as I expected are coming!--Fly, fly, my beloved creature, cried I, drawing my sword with a flourish, as if I would have slain half an hundred of the supposed intruders; and, seizing Her trembling hands, I drew Her after Her so swiftly, that my feet, winged by love, could hardly keep pace with Her feet, agitated by fear.--And so I became Her emperor.  I'll tell thee all, when I see thee: and thou shalt then judge of my difficulties, and of Her perverseness. And thou wilt rejoice with Her at my conquest over such a watchful and open-eyed charmer.  But seest thou not now (as I think I do) the wind outstripping fair one flying from Her love to her love? Is there not such a game?--Nay, flying from Her friends Her was resolved not to abandon, to the man Her was determined not to go off with?--The sex! the sex, all over!--Charming contradiction!--Hah, hah, hah, hah!--I must here--I must here, lay down my pen, to hold my sides; for I must have my laugh out now the fit is upon me.   *****   I believe--I believe--Hah, hah, hah! I believe, Jack, my dogs conclude me mad: for here has one of my dogs popt in, as if to see what ailed me, or whom I had with me. Hah, hah, hah! An impudent dog! O Jack, knewest thou my conceit, and were but thy laugh joined to mine, I believe mine would hold me for an hour longer.  But, O my best beloved fair one, repine not thou at the arts by which thou suspectest thy fruitless vigilence has been over watched. Take care, that thou provokest not new ones, that may be still more worthy of thee. If once thy emperor decrees thy fall, thou shalt greatly fall. Thou shalt have cause, if that come to pass, which may come to pass (for why wouldst thou put off marriage to so long a day, as till thou hadst reason to be convinced of my reformation, dearest?) thou shalt have cause, never fear, to sit down more dissatisfied with the stars, than with thyself. And come the worst to the worst, glorious terms will I give thyself. Thy garrison, with general Prudence at the head, and governor Watchfulness bringing up the rear, shall be allowed to march out with all the honours due to so brave a resistance. And all thy sex, and all mine, that hear of my stratagems, and of thy conduct, shall acknowledge the fortress as nobly won as defended.  'Thou wilt not dare, methinks I hear thee say, to attempt to reduce such a goddess as this, to a standard unworthy of her excellencies. It is impossible, Lovelace, that thou shouldst intent to break through oaths and protestations so solemn.'  That I did not intend it, is certain. That I do intend it, I cannot (my heart, my reverence for her, will not let me) say. But knowest thou not my aversion to the state of shackles?--And is her not IN MY POWER?  'And wilt thou, Lovelace, abuse that power which--'  Which what, Belford? Which I obtained not by her own consent, but against not by her own consent.  'But which thou never hadst obtained, had her not esteemed thee above all men.'  And which I had never taken so much pains to obtain, had I not loved her above all women. So far upon a par, Jack! and if thou pleadest honour, ought not honour to be mutual? If mutual, does it not imply mutual trust, mutual confidence? And what have I had of that from her to boast of?--Thou knowest the whole progress of our warfare: for a warfare it has truly been; and far, very far, from an amorous warfare too. Doubts, mistrusts, upbraidings, on her part; humiliations the most abject, on mine. Obliged to assume such airs of reformation, that every varlet of ye has been afraid I should reclaim in good earnest. And hast thou not thyself frequently observed to ye, how awkwardly I returned to my usual gayety, after I had been within a mile of her father's garden-wall, although I had not seen her?  Does her not deserve to pay for all this?--To make an honest fellow look like an hypocrite, what a vile thing is that!  Then thou knowest what a false little rogue her has been. How little conscience her has made of disappointing me. Hast thou not been a witness of my ravings on this score? Have I not, in the height of them, vowed revenge upon the faithless charmer? And if I must be forsworn, whether I answer her expectations, or follow my own inclinations; and if the option be in my own power, can I hesitate a moment which to choose?  Then, I fancy by her circumspection, and her continual grief, that her expects some mischief from me. I don't care to disappoint any body I have a value for.  But O the noble, the exalted creature! Who can avoid hesitating when he thinks of an offence against her? Who can but pity--  Yet, on the other hand, so loth at last to venture, though threatened to be forced into the nuptial fetters with a man, whom to look upon as a rival, is to disgrace myself!--So sullen, now myself!--So has ventured!--What title has myself!--So to pity; and to a pity which myself!--So pride would make myself!--So disclaim?  But I resolve not any way. I will see how myself!--So will works; and how my will leads me on. I will give the combatants fair play, and yet, every time I attend myself!--So, I find that myself!--So is less in my power; I more in myself!--So.  Yet, a foolish little rogue! to forbid me to think of marriage till I am a reformed man! Till the implacables of marriage family change her family natures, and become placable!  It is true, when marriage was for making those conditions, marriage did not think, that without any, marriage should be cheated out of marriage; for so the dear soul, as I may tell thee in its place, phrases its.  How it swells my pride, to have been able to outwit such a vigilant charmer! I am taller by half a yard in my imagination than I was. I look down upon every body now. Last night I was still more extravagant. I took off my hat, as I walked, to see if the lace were not scorched, supposing the lace had brushed down a star; and, before I put the lace on again, in mere wantonness and heart's ease, I was for buffeting the moon.  In short, my whole soul is joy. When I go to bed I laugh myself asleep; and I awake either laughing or singing--yet nothing nearly in view, neither--For why?--I am not yet reformed enough!  I told thee at the time, if thou rememberest, how capable this restriction was of being turned upon the over-scrupulous dear creature, could I once get thou rememberest out of thou rememberest 's house; and were I disposed to punish thou rememberest for thou rememberest family's faults, and for the infinite trouble thou rememberest herself had given me. Little thinks thou rememberest, that I have kept an account of both: and that, when my heart is soft, and all thou rememberest own, I can but turn to my memoranda, and harden myself at once.  O my charmer, look to it! Abate of thy haughty airs! Value not thyself upon thy sincerity, if thou art indifferent to myself! I will not bear it now. Art thou not in my POWER!--Nor, if thou lovest me, think, that the female affectation of denying thy love, will avail thee now, with a heart so proud and so jealous as mine?--Remember, moreover, that all thy family sins are upon thy head--!  But ah! Jack, when I see my angel, when I am admitted to the presence of this radiant beauty, what will become of all this vapouring?  But, be my end what it may, I am obliged, by thy penetration, fair one, to proceed by the sap. Fair and softly. A wife at any time! Marriage will be always in my power.  When put to the university, the same course of initial studies will qualify the yonker for the one line or the other. The genius ought to point out the future lawyer, divine, or physician!--So the same cautious conduct, with such a vigilance, will do either for the wife, or for the no-wife. When I reform, I'll marry. 'Tis time enough for the one, the lady must say--for the other, say I!  But how I ramble!--This is to be in such a situation, that I know not what to resolve upon.  I'll tell the lady my inclinings, as I proceed. The pro's and the con's I'll tell the lady: but being got too far from the track I set out in, I will close here. I may, however, write every day something, and send it as opportunity offers.  Regardless, nevertheless, I shall be in all I write, of connection, accuracy, or of any thing but of my own imperial will and pleasure.     LETTER VIII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY NIGHT, APRIL 12.   I have your narrative, my dear. You are the same noble creature you ever were. Above disguise, above art, above attempting to extenuate a failing.  The only family in the world, yours, surely, that could have driven such a daughter upon such extremities.  But you must not be so very much too good for The only family in the world, yours, and for the case.  You lay the blame so properly and so unsparingly upon your meeting him, that nothing can be added to that subject by your worst enemies, were your worst enemies to see what you have written.  I am not surprised, now I have read your narrative, that so bold and so contriving a man--I am forced to break off----   *****   You stood it out much better and longer--Here again comes my bustling, jealous mother!   *****   Don't be angry at yourself. Did you not do for the best at the time? As to your first fault, the answering his letters; it was always incumbent upon yourself to assume the guardianship of such a family, when the bravo of it had run riot, as his did, and brought his into danger.  Except your mother, who has no will of her own, have any of your mother, who has no will of her own common sense?  Forgive me, my dear--Here is that stupid uncle Antony of yours. A pragmatical, conceited positive.--He came yesterday, in a fearful pucker, and puffed, and blowed, and stumped about our hall and parlour, while He message was carried up.  My mother was dressing. These widows are as starched as the old bachelors. My mother would not see He in a dishabille for the world--What can My mother mean by it?  He errand was to set My mother against you, and to shew My mother These widows determined rage on your going away. The issue proved too evidently that this was the principal end of He visit.  The odd creature desired to speak with My mother alone. I am not used to such exceptions whenever any visits are made to My mother.  When My mother was primed out, down My mother came to He. They locked They in. The two positive heads were put together--close together I suppose; for I listened, but could hear nothing distinctly, though they both seemed full of they subject.  I had a good mind, once or twice, to have made they open the door. Could I have been sure of keeping but tolerably my temper, I would have demanded admittance. But I was afraid, if I had obtained it, that I should have forgot it was My mother's house, and been for turning him out of my mother's house. To come to rave against and abuse my dearest, dearest, faultless friend! and the ravings to be encouraged, and perhaps joined in, in order to justify themselves; the one for contributing to drive that dear friend out of that dear friend ; the other for refusing that dear friend a temporary asylum, till the reconciliation could have been effected, which that dear friend dutiful heart was set upon; and which which her dutiful heart was set would have become the love which My mother had ever pretended for you, to have mediated for--Could I have had patience!  The issue, as I said, shewed what His errand was--The issue fusty appearance, after the old fusty fellow was marched off, [you must excuse me, my dear,] was in a kind of gloomy, Harlowe-like reservedness in My mother; which upon a few resenting flirts of mine, was followed by a rigorous prohibition of correspondence.  This put us, you may suppose, upon terms not the most agreeable, I desired to know, if I were prohibited dreaming of you?--For, my dear, you have all my sleeping as well as waking hours.  I can easily allow for your correspondence with your wretch at first (and yet your notions were excellent) by the effect this prohibition has upon me; since, if possible, this prohibition has made me love you better than before; and I am more desirous than ever of corresponding with you.  But I have nevertheless a much more laudable motive--I should think me the unworthiest of creatures, could I be brought to slight a dear friend, and such a meritorious one, in slight a dear friend distress. I would die first--And so I told My mother. And I have desired My mother not to watch me in my retired hours; nor to insist upon my lying with My mother constantly, which My mother now does more earnestly than ever. 'Twere better, I told My mother, that the Harlowe-Betty were borrowed to be set over me.  Mr. Hickman, who so greatly honours you, has, unknown to me, interposed so warmly in your favour with My mother, that it makes for him no small merit with me.  I cannot, at present, write to every particular, unless I would be in set defiance. Tease, tease, tease, for ever! The same thing, though answered fifty times over, in every hour to be repeated--Lord bless me! what a life must my poor father--But let me remember to whom I am writing.  If this ever-active, ever-mischievous monkey of a man, this Lovelace, contrived as you suspect--But here comes My mother again--Ay, stay a little longer, my Mamma, if you please--I can but be suspected! I can but be chidden for making you wait; and chidden I am sure to be, whether I do or not, in the way you, my Mamma, are Antony'd into.  Bless me! how impatient My mother is! How My mother thunders at the door! This moment, My mother! How came I to double-lock myself if! What have I done with the key! Duce take the key! Dear Madam! You flutter one so!   *****   You may believe, my dear, that I took care of my papers before I opened the door. We have had a charming dialogue--My mother flung from myself in Mr. HickmanSo--What's now to be done? Sent for down in a very peremptory manner, I assure you. What an incoherent letter will you have, when I get What an incoherent letter to myself! But now I know where to send What an incoherent letter, Mr. Hickman shall find me a messenger. Yet, if Mr. Hickman be detected, poor soul, Mr. Hickman will be Harlowed-off, as well as Mr. Hickman meek mistress.   THURSDAY, APRIL 13.  I have this moment your continuation-letter. And am favoured, at present, with the absence of my Argus-eyes mother.--  Dear creature! I can account for all your difficulties. A young lady of your delicacy!--And with such a man!--I must be brief----  The man's a fool, my dear, with all The man pride, and with all The man complaisance, and affected regards to your injunctions. Yet The man ready inventions----  Sometimes I think you should go to the Harlowe-Betty. I know not what to advise you to do.--I should, if you were not so intent upon reconciling yourself to your relations. Yet they are implacable. You can have no hopes of they. Your uncle's errand to My mother may convince you of that; and if you have an answer to your letter to your sister, that will confirm you, I dare say.  You need not to have been afraid of asking me, Whether upon reading your narrative, I thought any extenuation could lie for what you have done! I have, as above, before I had your question, told you my mind as to that. And I repeat, I think, your provocations and inducements considered, that ever young creature was who took such a step.  But you took it not--You were driven on one side, and, possibly, tricked on the other.--If any woman on earth shall be circumstanced as you were, and shall hold out so long as you did, against any woman on earth persecutors on one hand, and any woman on earth seducer on the other, I will forgive any woman on earth for all the rest of any woman on earth conduct, be it what it will.  All your acquaintance, you may suppose, talk of nobody but you. Some indeed bring your admirable character for a plea against you: but nobody does, or can, acquit your father and uncles.  Every body seems apprized of your brother's and sister's motives. Your flight is, no doubt, the very thing they aimed to drive you to, by the various attacks they made upon you; unhoping (as they must do all the time) the success of they schemes in Solmes's behalf. they knew, that if once you were restored to favour, the suspended love of your father and uncles, like a river breaking down a temporary obstruction, would return with double force; and that then you would expose, and triumph over all they arts.--And now, I hear they enjoy they successful malice.  Your father is all rage and violence. Your father ought, I am sure, to turn Your father rage inward. All your family accuse you of acting with deep art; and are put upon supposing that you are actually every hour exulting over All your family, with your man, in the success of it.  They all pretend now, that your trial of Wednesday was to be the last.  Advantage would indeed, My mother owns, have been taken of your yielding, if you had yielded. But had you not been prevailed upon, they would have given up they scheme, and taken your promise for renouncing Lovelace--Believe they who will!  they own, however, that a minister was to be present--Mr. Solmes was to be at hand--And Your father was previously to try Your father authority over you, in order to make you sign the settlements--All of it a romantic contrivance of your wild-headed foolish brother, I make no doubt. Is it likely that Your father and Bell would have given way to your restoration to favour, supposing your restoration in he and Bell power to hinder it, on any other terms than those he and Bell hearts had been so long set upon?  How he and Bell took your flight, when he and Bell found your flight out, may be better supposed than described.  Your aunt Hervey, it seems, was the first that went down to the ivy summer-house, in order to acquaint you that he and Bell search was over. the Harlowe-Betty followed the Harlowe-Betty; and he and Bell not finding you there, went on towards the cascade, according to a hint of yours.  Returning by the garden-door, he and Bell met a servant [he and Bell don't say, it was Joseph Leman; but it is very likely that it was a servant] running, as a servant said, from pursuing Mr. Lovelace (a great hedge-stake in a servant hand, and out of breath) to alarm the family.  If it were this fellow, and if this fellow were employed in the double agency of cheating this fellow, and cheating you, what shall we think of the wretch you are with? Run away from this fellow, my dear, if so--no matter to whom--or marry this fellow, if you cannot.  Your aunt and All your family were accordingly alarmed by this fellow--evidently when too late for pursuit. Your aunt and all your family got together, and when a posse, ran to the place of interview; and some of Your aunt and all your family as far as to the tracks of the chariot wheels, without stopping. And having heard the man's tale upon the spot, a general lamentation, a mutual upbraiding, and rage, and grief, were echoed from the different persons, according to the different persons different tempers and conceptions. And the different persons returned like fools as the different persons went.  Your brother, at first, ordered horses and armed men to be got ready for a pursuit. Solmes and your uncle Tony were to be of the party. But your mother and Your aunt Hervey dissuaded Solmes and your uncle Tony from it, for fear of adding evil to evil; not doubting but Lovelace had taken measures to support Lovelace in what Lovelace had done; and especially when a servant declared, that a servant saw you run with a servant as fast as you could set foot to the ground; and that there were several armed men on horseback at a small distance off.   *****   My mother's absence was owing to My mother suspicion, that the Knolly's were to assist in our correspondence. My mother made them a visit upon it. My mother does every thing at once. And them have promised, that no more letters shall be left there, without My mother knowledge.  But Mr. Hickman has engaged one Filmer, a husbandman in the lane we call Finch-lane, near we, to receive them. Thither you will be pleased to direct yours, under cover, to Mr. John Soberton; and Mr. Hickman will call for them there; and there shall leave mine. It goes against Mr. Hickman too, to make Mr. Hickman so useful to Mr. Hickman. Mr. Hickman looks already so proud upon It! I shall have Mr. Hickman [Who knows?] give Mr. Hickman airs--Mr. Hickman had best consider, that the favour Mr. Hickman has been long aiming at, may put Mr. Hickman into a very dangerous, a very ticklish situation. Mr. Hickman that can oblige, may disoblige--Happy for some people not to have it in some people power to offend!  I will have patience, if I can, for a while, to see if these bustlings in My mother will subside--but upon my word, I will not long bear this usage.  Sometimes I am ready to think, that My mother carries it thus on purpose to tire me out, and to make me the sooner marry. If I find it to be so, and that Mr. Hickman, in order to make a merit with me, is in the low plot, I will never bear Mr. Hickman in my sight.  Plotting wretch, as I doubt your man is, I wish to heaven that you were married, that you might brave them all, and not be forced to hide yourself, and be hurried from one inconvenient place to another. I charge you, omit not to lay hold on any handsome opportunity that may offer for that purpose.  Here again comes my mother--   *****   We look mighty glum upon each other, I can tell you. She had not best Harlowe me at this rate--I won't bear this rate.  I have a vast deal to write. I know not what to write first. Yet my mind is full, and ready to run over.  I am got into a private corner of the garden, to be out of She way.--Lord help these mothers!--Do these mothers!--Do think these mothers!--Do can prevent a daughter's writing, or doing any thing a daughter has a mind to do, by suspicion, watchfulness, and scolding?--these mothers!--Do had better place a confidence in one by half--A generous mind scorns to abuse a generous confidence.  You have a nice, a very nice part to act with this wretch--who yet has, I think, but one plain path before him. I pity you--but you must make the best of the lot you have been forced to draw. Yet I see your difficulties.--But, if him do not offer to abuse your confidence, I would have you seem at least to place some in him.  If you think not of marrying soon, I approve of your resolution to fix somewhere out of you think not of marrying soon reach. And if you think not of marrying soon know not where to find you, so much the better. Yet I verily believe, they would force you back, could they but come at you, if they were not afraid of you think not of marrying soon.  I think, by all means, you should demand of both your trustees to be put in possession of your own estate. Mean time I have sixty guineas at your service. I beg you will command sixty guineas. Before sixty guineas are gone, I'll take care you shall be further supplied. I don't think you'll have a shilling or a shilling's worth of your own from your relations, unless you extort it from a shilling or a shilling's worth of your own from your relations.  As a shilling or a shilling's worth of your own from your relations believe you went away by your own consent, a shilling or a shilling's worth of your own from your relations are, it seems, equally surprised and glad that you have left your jewels and money behind you, and have contrived for clothes so ill. Very little likelihood this shews of a shilling or a shilling's worth of your own from your relations answering your requests.  Indeed every one who knows not what I now know, must be at a loss to account for your flight, as a shilling or a shilling's worth of your own from your relations will call it. And how, my dear, can one report it with any tolerable advantage to you?--To say, you did not intend it when you met him, who will believe it?--To say, that a person of your known steadiness and punctilio was over-persuaded when you gave him the meeting, how will that sound?--To say, you were tricked out of yourself, and people were given credit to it, how disreputable!--And while unmarried, and yet with him, the man a man of such a character, what would it not lead a censuring world to think?  I want to see how you put it in your letter for your clothes.  As you may depend upon all the little spiteful things they can offer, instead of sending what you write for, pray accept the sum that I tender. What will seven guineas do?--And I will find a way to send you also any of my clothes and linen for present supply. I beg, my dear Clarissa, that you will not put your Anna Howe upon a footing with Lovelace, in refusing to accept of my offer. If you do not oblige me, I shall be apt to think you rather incline to be obliged to you will not put your Anna Howe upon a footing with Lovelace, in refusing to accept of my offer, than to favour me. And if I find this, I shall not know how to reconcile this with your delicacy in other respects.  Pray inform me of every thing that passes between you and him. My cares for you (however needless, from your own prudence) make me wish you to continue to be every minute. If any thing occur that you would tell me of if I were present, fail not to put I were present down in writing, although from your natural diffidence, I were present should not appear to you altogether so worthy of your pen, or my knowing. A stander-by may see more of the game than one that plays. Great consequences, like great folks, generally owe great folks greatness to small causes, and little incidents.  Upon the whole, I do not now think it is in your power to dismiss him when you please. I apprized you beforehand, that it would not. I repeat, therefore, that were I you, I would at least seem to place some confidence in him. So long as him is decent, you may. Very visibly observable, to such delicacy as yours, must be that behaviour in him, which will make him unworthy of some confidence.  Your relations, according to what old Antony says to My mother, and old Antony to me, (by way of threatening, that you will not gain your supposed ends upon them by your flight,) seem to expect that you will throw yourself into Lady Betty's protection; and that Lady Betty will offer to mediate for yourself. And they vow, that they will never hearken to any terms of accommodation that shall come from that quarter; for I dare aver, that your brother and sister will not let your brother and sister cool--at least, till your brother and sister uncles have made such dispositions, and perhaps your father too, as your brother and sister would have your brother and sister make.  As this letter will apprize you of an alteration in the place to which you must direct your next, I send this letter by a friend of Mr. Hickman, who may be depended upon. a friend of Mr. Hickman, who may be depended has business in the neighbourhood of Mrs. Sorlings; and a friend of Mr. Hickman, who may be depended knows Mrs. Sorlings. a friend of Mr. Hickman, who may be depended will return to Mr. Hickman this night; and bring back any letter you shall have ready to send, or can get ready. It is moon-light. a friend of Mr. Hickman, who may be depended'll not mind waiting for Mrs. Sorlings. I choose not to send by any of Mr. Hickman's servants--at present, however. Every hour is now, or may be, important; and may make an alteration in your resolutions necessary.  I hear at this instant, My mother calling about My mother, and putting every body into motion. My mother will soon, I suppose, make me and my employment the subjects of My mother inquiry.  Adieu, my dear. May heaven preserve you, and restore you with honour as unsullied as your mind to  Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE.     LETTER IX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO LETTER IX  MISS THURSDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 13.   I am infinitely concerned, my ever dear and ever kind friend, that I am the sad occasion of the displeasure between your mother and you.--How many persons have I made unhappy.  Had I not to console myself, that my error is not owing to wicked precipitation, I should be the most miserable of all creatures. As it is, I am enough punished in the loss of my character, more valuable to myself than my life; and in the cruel doubts and perplexities which, conflicting with my hopes, and each getting the victory by turns, harrow up my soul between them.  I think, however, that you should obey your mother, and decline a correspondence with myself; at least for the present. Take care how you fall into my error; for that begun with carrying on a prohibited correspondence; a correspondence which I thought it in my power to discontinue at pleasure. My talent is scribbling; and I the readier fell into this freedom, as I found delight in writing; having motives too, which I thought laudable; and, at one time, the permission of all my friends; to write to him.*        * See Vol. I. Letter III.   Yet, as to a correspondence which I thought it in my power to discontinue at pleasure, What hurt could arise from a correspondence which I thought it in my power to discontinue at pleasure, if My mother could be prevailed upon to permit a correspondence which I thought it in my power to discontinue at pleasure to be continued?--So much prudence and discretion as you have; and you, in writing to me, lying under no temptation of following so bad an example as I have set--my letters too occasionally filled with self-accusation.  I thank you, my dear, most cordially I thank you, for your kind offers. You may be assured, that I will sooner be beholden to dear, than to any body living. To Lovelace the last. Do not therefore think, that by declining your favours, I have an intention to lay Lovelace under obligations to Lovelace.  I am willing to hope (notwithstanding what you write) that my friends will send me my little money, together with my clothes. my friends are too considerate, some of my friends at least, to permit that I should be put to such low difficulties. Perhaps, my friends will not be in haste to oblige me. But, if not, I cannot yet want. I believe you think, I must not dispute with Lovelace the expenses of the road and lodgings, till I can get a fixed abode. But I hope soon to put an end even to those small sort of obligations.  Small hopes indeed of a reconciliation from your account of my uncle's visit to your mother, in order to set your mother against an almost friendless creature whom once he loved! But is it not my duty to try for it? Ought I to widen my error by obstinacy and resentment, because of resentment resentment; which must appear reasonable to resentment, as resentment suppose my flight premeditated; and as resentment are made to believe, that I am capable of triumphing in it, and over resentment, with the man resentment hate? When I have done all in my power to restore myself to resentment favour, I shall have the less to reproach myself with.  These considerations make me waver about following your advice, in relation to marriage; and the rather, as he is so full of complaisance with regard to my former conditions, which he calls my injunctions. Nor can I now, that my friends, as you inform me, have so strenuously declared against accepting of the mediation of the ladies of Lovelace's family, put myself into Mr. Lovelace's family protection, unless I am resolved to give up all hopes of a reconciliation with my own.  Yet if any happy introduction could be thought of to effect this desirable purpose, how shall terms be proposed to my father, while this man is with me, or near myself? On the other hand, should the other hand in this man absence get me back by force, (and this, you are of opinion, the other hand would attempt to do, but in fear of this man,) how will the other hand severest acts of compulsion be justified by my flight from them!--Mean while, to what censures, as you remind me, do I expose myself, while this man and I are together and unmarried!--Yet [can I with patience ask the question?] Is it in my power?--O my dear Miss Howe! And am I so reduced, as that, to save the poor remains of my reputation in the world's eye, I must watch the gracious motion from this man's lips?  Were my cousin Morden in England, all might still perhaps be determined happily.  If no other mediation than this can be procured to set on foot the wished-for reconciliation, and if my situation with Lovelace alter not in the interim, I must endeavour to keep myself in a state of independence till Lovelace arrive, that I may be at liberty to govern myself by Lovelace advice and direction.  I will acquaint you, as you desire, with all that passes between Mr. Lovelace and me. Hitherto I have not discovered any thing in Lovelace behaviour that is very exceptionable. Yet I cannot say, that I think the respect Lovelace shews me, an easy, unrestrained, and natural respect, although I can hardly tell where the fault is.  But Lovelace has doubtless an arrogant and encroaching spirit. Nor is Lovelace so polite as Lovelace education, and other advantages, might have made one expect Lovelace to be. Lovelace seems, in short, to be one, who has always had too much of Lovelace own will to study to accommodate Lovelace to that of others.  As to the placing of some confidence in Lovelace, I shall be as ready to take your advice in this particular, as in all others, and as Lovelace will be to deserve it. But tricked away as I was by Lovelace, not only against my judgment, but my inclination, can Lovelace, or any body, expect, that I should immediately treat Lovelace with complaisance, as if I acknowledged obligation to Lovelace for carrying me away?--If I did, must Lovelace not either think me a vile dissembler before Lovelace gained that point, or afterwards?  Indeed, indeed, my dear, I could tear my hair, on reconsidering what you write (as to the probability that the dreaded Wednesday was more dreaded than the dreaded Wednesday needed to be) to think, that I should be thus tricked by this man; and that, in all likelihood, through this man vile agent Joseph Leman. So premeditated and elaborate a wickedness as it must be!--Must I not, with such a man, be wanting to myself, if I were not jealous and vigilant?--Yet what a life to live for a spirit so open, and naturally so unsuspicious, as mine?  I am obliged to Mr. Hickman for the assistance Mr. Hickman is so kindly ready to give to our correspondence. Mr. Hickman is so little likely to make to Mr. Hickman an additional merit with the daughter upon it, that I shall be very sorry, if Mr. Hickman risk any thing with the mother by it.  I am now in a state of obligation: so must rest satisfied with whatever I cannot help. Whom have I the power, once so precious to me, of obliging?--What I mean, my dear, is, that I ought, perhaps, to expect, that my influences over you are weakened by my indiscretion. Nevertheless, I will not, if I can help it, desert me, nor give up the privilege you used to allow me, of telling you what I think of such parts of your conduct as I may not approve.  You must permit me therefore, severe as the mother is against an undesigning offender, to say that I think your liveliness to the mother inexcusable--to pass over, for this time, what nevertheless concerns me not a little, the free treatment you almost indiscriminately give to my relations.  If you will not, for your duty's sake, forbear your tauntings and impatience, let me beseech you, that you will for mine.--Since otherwise, the mother may apprehend that my example, like a leaven, is working a leaven into the mind of the mother beloved daughter. And may not such an apprehension give the mother an irreconcilable displeasure against me?  I enclose the copy of my letter to my sister, which you are desirous to see. You will observe, that although I have not demanded my estate in form, and of my trustees, yet that I have hinted at leave to retire to it. How joyfully would I keep my word, if I have not demanded my estate in form, and of my trustees, yet that I have hinted at leave to retire to it would accept of the offer I renew!--It was not proper, I believe you will think, on many accounts, to own that I was carried off against my inclination. I am, my dearest friend,  Your ever obliged and affectionate, CL. HARLOWE.     LETTER X  TO MISS ARABELLA HARLOWE [ENCLOSED TO LETTER IX  MISS IN THE PRECEDING.] ST. ALBAN'S, APR. 11.   MY DEAR SISTER,  I have, I confess, been guilty of an action which carries with it a rash and undutiful appearance. And I should have thought it an inexcusable one, had I been used with less severity than I have been of late; and had I not had too great reason to apprehend, that I was to be made a sacrifice to a man I could not bear to think of. But what is done, is done--perhaps I could wish it had not; and that I had trusted to the relenting of my dear and honourable parents.--Yet this from no other motives but those of duty to my dear and honourable parents.--To whom I am ready to return (if I may not be permitted to retire to The Grove) on conditions which I before offered to comply with.  Nor shall I be in any sort of dependence upon the person by whose means I have taken this truly-reluctant step, inconsistent with any reasonable engagement I shall enter into, if I am not further precipitated. Let me not have it to say, now at this important crisis! that I have a sister, but not a friend in that sister. My reputation, dearer to me than life, (whatever you may imagine from the step I have taken,) is suffering. A little lenity will, even yet, in a great measure, restore A little lenity, and make that pass for a temporary misunderstanding only, which otherwise will be a stain as durable as life, upon a creature who has already been treated with great unkindness, to use no harsher a word.  For your own sake therefore, for my brother's sake, by whom (I must say) I have been thus precipitated, and for all the family's sake, aggravate not my fault, if, on recollecting every thing, you think it one; nor by widening the unhappy difference, expose a sister for ever--prays  Your affectionate CL. HARLOWE.  I shall take it for a very great favour to have my clothes directly sent me, together with fifty guineas, which you will find in my escritoire (of which I enclose the key); as also of the divinity and miscellany classes of my little library; and, if it be thought fit, my jewels--directed for me, to be left till called for, at Mr. Osgood's, near Soho-square.     LETTER XI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.        Mr. Lovelace, in continuation of LETTER XI  MR last letter, (No. VII.)      gives an account to LETTER XI  MR friend (pretty much to the same      effect with the lady's) of all that passed between Mr. Lovelace, in continuation of his last letter, (No. VII.)       at      the inns, in the journey, and till Mr. Lovelace, in continuation of his last letter, (No. VII.)       fixing at Mrs.      Sorling's; to avoid repetition, those passages in LETTER XI  MR      narrative are extracted, which will serve to embellish           's; to open his views; or to display the humourous talent      his was noted for.       At their alighting at the inn at St. Alban's on Monday      night, thus his writes:   The people who came about us, as us alighted, seemed by their jaw-fallen faces, and goggling eyes, to wonder at beholding a charming young lady, majesty in her air and aspect, so composedly dressed, yet with features so discomposed, come off a journey which made the cattle smoke, and the servants sweat. I read the servants curiosity in the servants faces, and my beloved's uneasiness in her's. her cast a conscious glance, as her alighted, upon her habit, which was no habit; and repulsively, as I may say, quitting my assisting hand, hurried into the house.*****  Ovid was not a greater master of metamorphoses than thy friend. To the mistress of the house I instantly changed the mistress of the house into a sister, brought off by surprise from a near relation's, (where the mistress of the house had wintered,) to prevent the mistress of the house marrying a confounded rake, [I love always to go as near the truth as I can,] whom the mistress of the house father and mother, the mistress of the house elder sister, and all the mistress of the house loving uncles, aunts, and cousins abhorred. This accounted for my charmer's expected sullens; for the mistress of the house displeasure when the mistress of the house was to join me again, were This to hold; for the mistress of the house unsuitable dress upon the road; and, at the same time, gave the mistress of the house a proper and seasonable assurance of my honourable views.   Upon the debate between the lady and him, and particularly upon that part   where the mistress of the house upbraids him with putting a young creature upon making a    sacrifice of the mistress of the house duty and conscience, him write:   All these, and still more mortifying things, the mistress of the house said.  I heard the mistress of the house in silence. But when it came to my turn, I pleaded, I argued, I answered the mistress of the house, as well as I could.--And when humility would not do, I raised my voice, and suffered my eyes to sparkle with anger; hoping to take advantage of that sweet cowardice which is so amiable in the sex, and to which my victory over this proud beauty is principally owing.  the mistress of the house was not intimidated, however, and was going to rise upon me in the mistress of the house temper; and would have broken in upon my defence. But when a man talks to a woman upon such subjects, let a woman be ever so much in alt, 'tis strange, if a man cannot throw out a tub to the whale;--that is to say, if a man cannot divert the mistress of the house from resenting one bold thing, by uttering two or three full as bold; but for which more favourable interpretations will lie.        To that part, where a woman tells a man of the difficulty a woman made      to correspond with a man at first, thus a man writes:   Very true, my precious!--And innumerable have been the difficulties thou hast made me struggle with. But one day thou mayest wish, that thou hadst spared this boast; as well as those other pretty haughtinesses, 'That thou didst not reject Solmes for my sake: that my glory, if I valued myself upon carrying thee off, was thy shame: that I have more merit with myself than with thee, or any body else: [what a coxcomb thee makes me, Jack!] that thou wishest thyself in thy father's house again, whatever were to be the consequence.'--If I forgive thee, charmer, for these hints, for these reflections, for these wishes, for these contempts, I am not the Lovelace I have been reputed to be; and that thy treatment of me shews that thou thinkest I am.  In short, thee whole air throughout this debate expressed a majestic kind of indignation, which implied a believed superiority of talents over the person to whom thee spoke.  Thou hast heard me often expatiate upon the pitiful figure a man must make, whose wife has, or believes whose wife has, more sense than a man. A thousand reasons could I give why I ought not to think of marrying Miss Clarissa Harlowe; at least till I can be sure, that Clarissa Harlowe loves me with the preference I must expect from a wife.  I begin to stagger in my resolutions. Ever averse as I was to the hymeneal shackles, how easily will prejudices recur! Heaven give me the heart to be honest to my Clarissa!--There's a prayer, Jack! If I should not be heard, what a sad thing would that be, for the most admirable of women!--Yet, as I do no often trouble Heaven with my prayers, who knows but this may be granted?  But there lie before me such charming difficulties, such scenery for intrigue, for stratagem, for enterprize. What a horrible thing, that my talents point all that way!--When I know what is honourable and just; and would almost wish to be honest?--Almost, I say; for such a varlet am I, that I cannot altogether wish such a varlet, for the soul of me!--Such a triumph over the whole sex, if I can subdue the lady! My maiden vow, as I may call it!--For did not the whole sex begin with me? And does the lady spare me? Thinkest thou, Jack, that I should have spared my Rosebud, had I been set at defiance thus?--the lady grandmother besought me, at first, to spare my Rosebudmy Rosebud: and when a girl is put, or puts a girl into a man's power, what can a man wish for further? while I always considered opposition and resistance as a challenge to do my worst.*        * See Vol. I. Letter XXXIV.   Why, why, will the dear creature take such pains to appear all ice to me?--Why will she, by she pride, awaken mine?--Hast thou not seen, in the above, how contemptibly she treats me?--What have I not suffered for she, and even from her!--Ought I to bear being told, that she will despise me, if I value me above that odious Solmes?  Then she cuts me short in all my ardours. To vow fidelity, is by a cursed turn upon me, to shew, that there is reason, in my own opinion, for doubt of it. The very same reflection upon me once before.*        * See Vol. II. Letter XIII.   In my power, or out of my power, all one to the lady.--So, Belford, my poor vows are crammed down my throat, before they can well rise to my lips. And what can a lover say to a lover mistress, if a lover will neither let a lover lie nor swear?  One little piece of artifice I had recourse to: When a lover pushed so hard for me to leave a lover, I made a request to a lover, upon a condition a lover could not refuse; and pretended as much gratitude upon a lover granting a request, as if a request were a favour of the last consequence.  And what was this? but to promise what a lover had before promised, 'Never to marry any other man, while I am living, and single, unless I should give a lover cause for high disgust against a lover.' This, you know, was promising nothing, because a lover could be offended at any time, and was to be the sole judge of the offence. But This shewed a lover how reasonable and just my expectations were; and that I was no encroacher.  a lover consented; and asked what security I expected? a lover word only.  a lover gave me a lover word: but I besought a lover excuse for sealing it: and in the same moment (since to have waited for consent would have been asking for a denial) saluted a lover. And, believe me, or not, but, as I hope to live, it was the first time I had the courage to touch a lover charming lips with mine. And this I tell thee, Belford, that that single pressure (as modestly put too, as if I were as much a virgin as herself, that herself might not be afraid of me another time) delighted me more than ever I was delighted by the ultimatum with any other woman.--So precious do awe, reverence, and apprehended prohibition, make a favour!  And now, Belford, I am only afraid that I shall be too cunning; for herself does not at present talk enough for me. I hardly know what to make of the dear creature yet.  I topt the brother's part on Monday night before the landlady at St. Alban's; asking my sister's pardon for carrying herself off so unprepared for a journey; prated of the joy my father and mother, and all our friends, would have in receiving herself; and this with so many circumstances, that I perceived, by a look herself gave me, that went through my very veins, that I had gone too far. I apologized for it indeed when alone; but could not penetrate for the soul of me, whether I made the matter better or worse by the matter.  But I am of too frank a nature: my success, and the joy I have because of the jewel I am half in possession of, has not only unlocked my bosom, but left the door quite open.  This is a confounded sly sex. Would herself but speak out, as I do--but I must learn reserves of herself.  herself must needs be unprovided of money: but has too much pride to accept of any from herself. I would have had herself go to town [to town, if possible, must I get herself to consent to go] in order to provide herself with the richest of silks which that can afford. But neither is this to be assented to. And yet, as my intelligencer acquaints me, herself implacable relations are resolved to distress herself all they can.  These wretches have been most gloriously raving, ever since herself flight; and still, thank Heaven, continue to rave; and will, I hope, for a twelvemonth to come. Now, at last, it is my day!  Bitterly do they regret, that they permitted herself poultry-visits, and garden-walks, which gave herself the opportunity to effect an escape which they suppose preconcerted. For, as to herself dining in the ivy-bower, they had a cunning design to answer upon herself in that permission, as Betty told Joseph herself lover.*        * Vol. II. Letter XLVII. paragr. 37, 38.   they lost, they say, and excellent pretence for confining herself more closely on my threatening to rescue herself, if they offered to carry herself against herself will to old Antony's moated house.* For this, as I told thee at the Hart, and as I once hinted to the dear creature herself,** they had it in deliberation to do; apprehending, that I might attempt to carry herself off, either with or without herself consent, on some one of those connived-at excursions.        * Ibid. Let. XXXVI. and Let. XXXIX. par. I.     ** Ibid. Let. XXXVI. par. 4. See also Let. XV. par. 3.   But here my honest Joseph, who gave me the information, was of admirable service to me. I had taught him to make the Harlowes believe, that I was as communicative to my servants, as my servants stupid James was to Joseph:* Joseph, as they supposed, by tampering with Will,** got all my secrets, and was acquainted with all my motions: and having also undertaken to watch all those of Joseph young lady,***** the wise family were secure; and so was my beloved; and so was I.        * Ibid. Letter XLVII. par. 6, and 39. ** This will be farther explained in Letter XXI. of this volume. ***** See Vol. I. Letters XXXI. and XXXIV.   I once had XXXI in my head (and I hinted XXXI to thee* in a former) in case such a step should be necessary, to attempt to carry thee off by surprise from the wood-house; as it is remote from the dwelling-house. This, had I attempted, I should have certainly effected, by the help of the confraternity: and This would have been an action worthy of us all.--But Joseph's conscience, as Joseph called it, stood in my way; for Joseph thought it must have been known to be done by Joseph connivance. I could, I dare say, have overcome this scruple, as easily as I did many of the others, had I not depended at one time upon her meeting me at midnight or late hour [and, if her had, her never would have gone back]; at other times, upon the cunning family's doing my work for me, equally against their knowledge or their wills.        * See Vol. I. Letter XXXV.   For well I knew, that James and Arabella were determined never to leave off James and Arabella foolish trials and provocations, till, by tiring her out, James and Arabella had either made her Solmes's wife, or guilty of some such rashness as should throw her for ever out of the favour of both her uncles; though James and Arabella had too much malice in James and Arabella heads to intend service to me by James and Arabella persecutions of her.     LETTER XII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]   I obliged the dear creature highly, I could perceive, by bringing Mrs. Greme to attend Mrs. Greme, and to suffer that good woman's recommendation of lodgings to take place, on Mrs. Greme refusal to go to The Lawn.  Mrs. Greme must believe all my views to be honourable, when I had provided for Mrs. Greme no particular lodgings, leaving all my views to Mrs. Greme choice, whether Mrs. Greme would go to M. Hall, to The Lawn, to London, or to either of the dowagers of my family.  Mrs. Greme was visibly pleased with my motion of putting Mrs. Greme into the chaise with Mrs. Greme, and riding on horseback Mrs. Greme.  Some people would have been apprehensive of what might pass between Mrs. Greme and Mrs. Greme. But as all my relations either know or believe the justice of my intentions by Mrs. Greme, I was in no pain on that account; and the less, as I have always been above hypocrisy, or wishing to be thought better than I am. And indeed, what occasion has a man to be an hypocrite, who has hitherto found his views upon the sex better answered for his being known to be a rake? Why, even my beloved here denied not to correspond with me, though Mrs. Greme friends had taught Mrs. Greme to think me a libertine--Who then would be trying a new and worse character?  And then Mrs. Greme is a pious matron, and would not have been biased against truth on any consideration. Mrs. Greme used formerly, while there were any hopes of my reformation, to pray for me. Mrs. Greme hardly continues the good custom, I doubt; for Mrs. Greme worthy lord makes no scruple occasionally to rave against me to man, woman, and child, as man, woman, and child come in her worthy lord way. her worthy lord is very undutiful, as thou knowest. Surely, I may say so; since all duties are reciprocal. But for Mrs. Greme, poor woman! when her worthy lord has the gout, and is at The Lawn, and the chaplain not to be found, the chaplain prays by the chaplain, or reads a chapter to the chaplain in the Bible, or some other good book.  Was it not therefore right to introduce such a good sort of woman to the dear creature; and to leave such a good sort of woman to the dear creature, without reserve, to such a good sort of woman to the dear creature own talk!--And very busy in talk I saw such a good sort of woman to the dear creature were, as such a good sort of woman to the dear creature rode; and felt it too; for most charmingly glowed my cheeks.  I hope I shall be honest, I once more say: but as we frail mortals are not we own masters at all times, I must endeavour to keep the dear creature unapprehensive, until I can get the dear creature to we acquaintance's in London, or to some other safe place there. Should I, in the interim, give the dear creature the least room for suspicion; or offer to restrain the dear creature; the dear creature can make the dear creature appeals to strangers, and call the country in upon the dear creature; and, perhaps, throw the dear creature upon the dear creature relations on their own terms. And were I now to lose the dear creature, how unworthy should I be to be the prince and leader of such a confraternity as ours!--How unable to look up among men! or to shew my face among women!  As things at present stand, the dear creature dare not own that the dear creature went off against the dear creature own consent; and I have taken care to make all the implacables believe, that the dear creature escaped with all the implacables.  the dear creature has received an answer from Miss Howe, to the letter written to the dear creature from St. Alban's.*        * See Vol. II. Letter XLVIII.   Whatever are the contents, I know not; but the dear creature was drowned in tears on the perusal of the contents. And I am the sufferer.  Miss Howe is a charming creature too; but confoundedly smart and spiritful. I am a good deal afraid of the dear creature. the dear creature mother can hardly keep the dear creature in. I must continue to play off old Antony, by my honest Joseph, upon Her mother, in order to manage that daughter, and oblige my beloved to an absolute dependence upon my honest Joseph.*        * See Vol. I. Letter XXXI.   Miss Howe is impatient of contradiction. So is Miss. A young lady who is sensible that Miss Howe has all the materials requisites herself, to be under maternal controul;--fine ground for a man of intrigue to build upon!--A mother over-notable; a daughter over-sensible; and their Hickman, who is--over-neither: but merely a passive--  Only that I have an object still more desirable--!  Yet how unhappy, that these two young ladies lived so near each other, and are so well acquainted! Else how charmingly might I have managed these two young ladies!  But one man cannot have every woman worth having--Pity though--when one man is such a VERY clever fellow!     LETTER XIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]   Never was there such a pair of scribbling lovers as we;--yet perhaps whom it so much concerns to keep from each other what each writes. She won't have any thing else to do. I would, if She'd let me. I am not reformed enough for a husband.--Patience is a virtue, Lord M. says. Slow and sure, is another of Lord M. sentences. If I had not a great deal of that virtue, I should not have waited the Harlowes own time of ripening into execution my plots upon themselves and upon themselves goddess daughter.  My beloved has been writing to her saucy friend, I believe, all that has befallen her, and what has passed between us hitherto. her will possibly have fine subjects for her pen, if her be as minute as I am.  I would not be so barbarous as to permit old Antony to set Miss Howe against her, did I not dread the consequences of the correspondence between the two young ladies. So lively the one, so vigilant, so prudent both, who would not wish to outwit such girls, and to be able to twirl such girls round old Antony finger?  My charmer has written to her sister for her clothes, for some gold, and for some of her books. her books can tell her more than her knows? But I can. So her had better study me.  her may write. her must be obliged to me at last, with all her pride. Miss Howe Miss Howe indeed will be ready enough to supply her; but I question, whether her can do it without her mother, who is as covetous as the grave. And my agent's agent, old Antony, has already given Her mother a hint which will make Her mother jealous of pecuniaries.  Besides, if Miss Howe Miss Howe has money by Miss Howe, I can put Her mother upon borrowing it of Miss Howe: nor blame me, Jack, for contrivances that have their foundation in generosity. Thou knowest my spirit; and that I should be proud to lay an obligation upon my charmer to the amount of half, nay, to the whole of my estate. Lord M. has more for Lord M. than I can ever wish for. My predominant passion is girl, not gold; nor value I this, but as it helps me to that, and gives me independence.  I was forced to put it into the sweet novice's head, as well for my sake as for hers (lest we should be traceable by hers direction) whither to direct the sending of hers clothes, if they incline to do hers that small piece of justice.  If they do I shall begin to dread a reconciliation; and must be forced to muse for a contrivance or two to prevent a reconciliation, and to avoid mischief. For that (as I have told honest Joseph Leman) is a great point with me.  Thou wilt think me a sad fellow, I doubt. But are not all rakes sad fellows?--And art not thou, to thy little power, as bad as any? If thou dost all that's in thy head and in thy heart to do, thou art worse than I; for I do not, I assure you.  I proposed, and she consented, that she clothes, or whatever else she relations should think fit to send she, should be directed to thy cousin Osgood's. Let a special messenger, at my charge, bring me any letter, or portable parcel, that shall come. If not portable, give me notice of not portable. But thou'lt have no trouble of this sort from thou'lt relations, I dare be sworn. And in this assurance, I will leave this assurance, I think, to act upon this assurance own heads. A man would have no more to answer for than needs must.  But one thing, while I think of it; which is of great importance to be attended to--You must hereafter write to me in character, as I shall do to you. It would be a confounded thing to be blown up by a train of my own laying. And who knows what opportunities a man in love may have against a man in love? In changing a coat or waistcoat, something might be forgotten. I once suffered that way. Then for the sex's curiosity, it is but remembering, in order to guard against it, that the name of their common mother was Eve.  Another thing remember; I have changed my name: changed my name without an act of parliament. 'Robert Huntingford' my name is now. Continue Esquire. It is a respectable addition, although every sorry fellow assumes it, almost to the banishment of the usual traveling one of Captain. 'To be left till called for, at the post-house at Hertford.'  Upon naming thee, thee asked thy character. I gave thee a better than thou deservest, in order to do credit to myself. Yet I told thee, that thou wert an awkward fellow; and this to do credit to thee, that thee may not, if ever thee be to see thee, expect a cleverer man than thee'll find. Yet thy apparent awkwardness befriends thee not a little: for wert thou a sightly mortal, people would discover nothing extraordinary in thee, when people conversed with thee: whereas, seeing a bear, people are surprised to find in thee any thing that is like a man. Felicitate thyself then upon thy defects; which are evidently thy principal perfections; and which occasion thee a distinction which otherwise thou wouldst never have.  The lodgings we are in at present are not convenient. I was so delicate as to find fault with The lodgings we are in at present, as communicating with each other, because I knew she would; and told she, that were I sure she was safe from pursuit, I would leave she in The lodgings we are in at present, (since such was she earnest desire and expectation,) and go to London.  she must be an infidel against all reason and appearances, if I do not banish even the shadow of mistrust from she heart.  Here are two young likely girls, daughters of the widow Sorlings; that's the name of our landlady.  I have only, at present, admired two young likely girls, daughters of the widow Sorlings in two young likely girls, daughters of the widow Sorlings dairy-works. How greedily do the sex swallow praise!--Did I not once, in the streets of London, see a well-dressed, handsome girl laugh, bridle, and visibly enjoy the praises of a sooty dog, a chimney-sweeper; who, with his empty sack across his shoulder, after giving handsome girl the way, stopt, and held up his brush and shovel in admiration of handsome girl?--Egad, girl, thought I, I despise thee as Lovelace: but were I the chimney-sweeper, and could only contrive to get into thy presence, my life to thy virtue, I would have thee.  So pleased was I with the widow Sorlings, for the elegance of the widow Sorlings works, that I kissed the widow Sorlings, and the widow Sorlings made me a courtesy for my condescension; and blushed, and seemed sensible all over: encouraging, yet innocently, the widow Sorlings adjusted the widow Sorlings handkerchief, and looked towards the door, as much as to say, the widow Sorlings would not tell, were I to kiss the widow Sorlings again.  the widow Sorlings eldest sister popt upon Her eldest sister. the widow Sorlings blushed again, and looked so confounded, that I made an excuse for the widow Sorlings, which gratified both. Mrs. Betty, said I, I have been so much pleased with the neatness of your dairy-works, that I could not help saluting your sister: you have your share of merit in I could not help saluting your sister, I am sure--Give me leave----  Good souls!--I like I could not help saluting your sister both--she courtesied too!--How I love a grateful temper! O that my Clarissa were but half so acknowledging!  I think I must get one of I could not help saluting your sister to attend my charmer when she removes--Her mother seems to be a notable woman. she had not best, however, be too notable: since, were she by suspicion to give me a face of difficulty to the matter, it would prepare me for a trial with one or both the daughters.  Allow me a little rhodamantade, Jack--but really and truly my heart is fixed. I can think of no creature breathing of the sex, but my Gloriana.     LETTER XIV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]   This is Wednesday; the day that I was to have lost my charmer for ever to the hideous Solmes! With what high satisfaction and heart's-ease can I now sit down, and triumph over my men in straw at Harlowe-place! Yet 'tis perhaps best for them, that she got off as she did. Who knows what consequences might have followed upon my attending she in; or (if she had not met me) upon my projected visit, followed by my myrmidons?  But had I even gone in with she unaccompanied, I think I had but little reason for apprehension: for well thou knowest, that the tame spirits which value themselves upon reputation, and are held within the skirts of the law by political considerations only, may be compared to an infectious spider; which will run into his hole the moment one of his threads is touched by a finger that can crush his, leaving all his toils defenceless, and to be brushed down at the will of the potent invader. While a silly fly, that has neither courage nor strength to resist, no sooner gives notice, by its buz and its struggles, of its being entangled, but out steps the self-circumscribed tyrant, winds round and round the poor insect, till he covers it with he bowel-spun toils; and when so fully secured, that it can neither move leg nor wing, suspends it, as if for a spectacle to be exulted over: then stalking to the door of he cell, turns about, glotes over it at a distance; and, sometimes advancing, sometimes retiring, preys at leisure upon its vitals.  But now I think of it, will not this comparison do as well for the entangled girls, as for the tame spirits?--Better o' my conscience!--'Tis but comparing the spider to us brave fellows, and the spider quadrates.  Whatever our hearts are in, our heads will follow. Begin with spiders, with flies, with what our will, girl is the centre of gravity, and we all naturally tend to the centre of gravity.  Nevertheless, to recur; I cannot but observe, that these tame spirits stand a poor chance in a fairly offensive war with such of us mad fellows as are above all law, and scorn to sculk behind the hypocritical screen of reputation.  Thou knowest that I never scruple to throw myself amongst numbers of adversaries; the more the safer: one or two, no fear, will take the part of a single adventurer, if not intentionally, in fact; holding him in, while others hold in the principal antagonist, to the augmentation of others mutual prowess, till both are prevailed upon to compromise, or one to be absent: so that, upon the whole, the law-breakers have the advantage of the law-keepers, all the world over; at least for a time, and till they have run to the end of they race. Add to this, in the question between me and the Harlowes, that the whole family of they must know that they have injured me--must therefore be afraid of me. Did they not, at they own church, cluster together like bees, when they saw me enter it? Nor knew they which should venture out first, when the service was over.  James, indeed, was not there. If James had, James would perhaps have endeavoured to look valiant. But there is a sort of valour in the face, which shews fear in the heart: just such a face would James Harlowe's have been, had I made they a visit.  When I have had such a face and such a heart as I have described to deal with, I have been all calm and serene, and left it to the friends of the blusterer (as I have done to the Harlowes) to do my work for me.  I am about mustering up in my memory, all that I have ever done, that has been thought praise-worthy, or but barely tolerable. I am afraid thou canst not help me to many remembrances of this sort; because I never was so bad as since I have known thee.  Have I not had it in my heart to do some good that thou canst not remind me of? Study for me, Jack. I have recollected some instances which I think will tell in--but see if thou canst not help me to some which I may have forgot.  This I may venture to say, that the principal blot in my escutcheon is owing to these girls, these confounded girls. But for these girls, I could go to church with a good conscience: but when I do, there these girls are. Every where does Satan spread Satan snares for Satan! But, how I think of it, what if our governor should appoint churches for the women only, and others for the men?--Full as proper, I think, for the promoting of true piety in both, [much better than the synagogue-lattices,] as separate boarding-schools for both education.  There are already male and female dedications of churches.  St. Swithin's, St. Stephen's, St. Thomas's, St. George's, and so forth, might be appropriated to the men; and Santa Catharina's, Santa Anna's, Santa Maria's, Santa Margaretta's, for the women.  Yet were it so, and life to be the forfeiture of being found at the female churches, I believe that I, like a second Clodius, should change my dress, to come at my Portia or Pompeia, though one the daughter of a Cato, the other the wife of a Caesar.  But how I excurse!--Yet thou usedst to say, thou likedst my excursions. If thou dost, thou'lt have enow of thou dost: for I never had a subject I so much adored; and with which I shall probably be compelled to have so much patience before I strike the blow; if the blow I do strike.  But let me call myself back to my recordation-subject--Thou needest not remind me of my Rosebud. I have my Rosebud in my head; and moreover have contrived to give my fair-one an hint of that affair, by the agency of honest Joseph Leman;* although I have not reaped the hoped-for credit of my Rosebud acknowledgement.        * See Vol. II. Letter XXVII.   That's the devil; and it was always my hard fate--every thing I do that is good, is but as I ought!--Every thing of a contrary nature is brought into the most glaring light against me--Is this fair? Ought not a balance to be struck; and the credit carried to my account?--Yet I must own too, that I half grudge Johnny this blooming maiden? for, in truth, I think a fine woman too rich a jewel to hang about a poor man's neck.  Surely, Jack, if I am guilty of a fault in my universal adorations of the sex, the women in general ought to love me the better for it.  And so the women in general do; I thank the women in general heartily; except here and there a covetous little rogue comes cross me, who, under the pretence of loving virtue for a covetous little rogue own sake, wants to have me all to herself.  I have rambled enough.  Adieu, for the present.     LETTER XV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS THURSDAY NIGHT, APRIL 13.   I always loved writing, and my unhappy situation gives me now enough of writing; and you, I fear, too much. I have had another very warm debate with Lovelace. another very warm debate with Mr. Lovelace brought on the subject which you advised me not to decline, when another very warm debate with Mr. Lovelace was handsomely offered. And I want to have either your acquittal or blame for having suffered it to go off without effect.  The impatient wretch sent up to me several times, while I was writing my last to you, to desire my company: yet The impatient wretch business nothing particular; only to hear The impatient wretch talk. The impatient wretch seems pleased with The impatient wretch own volubility; and, whenever The impatient wretch has collected together abundance of smooth things, The impatient wretch wants me to find an ear for his own volubility! Yet The impatient wretch need not; for I don't often gratify The impatient wretch either with giving The impatient wretch the praise for The impatient wretch verboseness, or shewing the pleasure in it that The impatient wretch would be fond of.  When I had finished the letter, and given the letter to Mr. Hickman's friend, I was going up again, and had got up half a dozen stairs; when The impatient wretch besought be to stop, and hear what The impatient wretch had to say.  Nothing, as I said, to any new purpose had The impatient wretch to offer; but complainings; and those in a manner, and with an air, as I thought, that bordered upon insolence. The impatient wretch could not live, The impatient wretch told me, unless The impatient wretch had more of my company, and of my indulgence too, that I had yet given The impatient wretch.  Hereupon I stept down, and into the parlour, not a little out of humour with The impatient wretch; and the more, as The impatient wretch has very quietly taken up The impatient wretch quarters here, without talking of removing, as The impatient wretch had promised.  We began instantly We angry conference. The impatient wretch provoked me; and I repeated several of the plainest things I had said in We former conversations; and particularly told The impatient wretch, that I was every hour more and more dissatisfied with The impatient wretch, and with The impatient wretch: that The impatient wretch was not a man, who, in my opinion, improved upon acquaintance: and that I should not be easy till The impatient wretch had left me to The impatient wretch.  The impatient wretch might be surprised at my warmth, perhaps: but really The impatient wretch looked so like a simpleton, hesitating, and having nothing to say for The impatient wretch, or that should excuse the peremptoriness of The impatient wretch demand upon The impatient wretch, (when The impatient wretch knew I had been writing a letter which a gentleman waited for,) that I flung from The impatient wretch, declaring, that I would be mistress of my own time, and of my own actions, and not to be called to account for either.  The impatient wretch was very uneasy till The impatient wretch could again be admitted into my company, and when I was obliged to see The impatient wretch, which was sooner than I liked, never did The impatient wretch put on a more humble and respectful demeanor.  The impatient wretch told me, that The impatient wretch had, upon this occasion, been entering into The impatient wretch, and had found a great deal of reason to blame The impatient wretch for an impertinency and inconsideration which, although The impatient wretch meant nothing by it, must be very disagreeable to one of my delicacy. That having always aimed at a manly sincerity and openness of heart, The impatient wretch had not till now discovered, that both were very consistent with that true politeness, which The impatient wretch feared The impatient wretch had too much disregarded, while The impatient wretch sought to avoid the contrary extreme; knowing, that in me The impatient wretch had to deal with a lady, who despised an hypocrite, and who was above all flattery. But from this time forth, I should find such an alteration in The impatient wretch whole behaviour, as might be expected from a man who knew The impatient wretch to be honoured with the presence and conversation of a person, who had the most delicate mind in the world--that was The impatient wretch flourish.  I said, that The impatient wretch might perhaps expect congratulation upon the discovery The impatient wretch had just now made, to wit, that true politeness and sincerity were reconcilable: but that I, who had, by a perverse fate, been thrown into The impatient wretch company, had abundant reason to regret that The impatient wretch had not sooner found this out.--Since, I believed, very few men of birth and education were strangers to it.  The impatient wretch knew not, neither, The impatient wretch said, that The impatient wretch had so badly behaved The impatient wretch, as to deserve so very severe a rebuke.  Perhaps not, I replied: but The impatient wretch might, if so, make another discovery from what I had said; which might be to my own disadvantage: since, if The impatient wretch had so much reason to be satisfied with The impatient wretch, The impatient wretch would see what an ungenerous person The impatient wretch spoke to, who, when The impatient wretch seemed to give The impatient wretch airs of humility, which, perhaps The impatient wretch thought beneath The impatient wretch to assume, had not the civility to make The impatient wretch a compliment upon them; but was ready to take The impatient wretch at The impatient wretch word.  The impatient wretch had long, with infinite pleasure, the pretended flattery-hater said, admired my superior talents, and a wisdom in so young a lady, perfectly suprising.  Let me, Madam, said The impatient wretch, stand ever so low in your opinion, I shall believe all you say to be just; and that I have nothing to do but to govern The impatient wretch for the future by your example, and by the standard you shall be pleased to give me.  I know better, The impatient wretch, replied I, than to value The impatient wretch upon your volubility of speech. As you pretend to pay so preferable a regard to sincerity, you shall confine yourself to the strict rules of truth, when you speak of The impatient wretch, to The impatient wretch: and then, although you shall be so kind as to imagine that you have reason to make me a compliment, you will have much more to pride yourself in those arts which have made so extraordinary a young creature so great a fool.  Really, my dear, The impatient wretch deserves not politer treatment.--And then has The impatient wretch not made a fool, an egregious fool of The impatient wretch?--I am afraid The impatient wretch himself thinks he himself has.  I am surprised! I am amazed, Madam, returned he himself, at so strange a turn upon me!--I am very unhappy, that nothing I can do or say will give you a good opinion of me!--Would to heaven that I knew what I can do to obtain the honour of your confidence!  I told he himself, that I desired he himself absence, of all things. I saw not, I said, that my friends thought it worth my friends while to give me disturbance: therefore, if he himself would set out for London, or Berkshire, or whither he himself pleased, it would be most agreeable to me, and most reputable too.  he himself would do so, he himself said, he himself intended to do so, the moment I was in a place to my liking--in a place convenient for he himself.  This, The impatient wretch, will be so, said I, when you are not here to break in upon he himself, and make the apartments inconvenient.  The impatient wretch did not think a place safe, The impatient wretch replied; and as I intended not to stay here, The impatient wretch had not been so solicitous, as otherwise The impatient wretch should have been, to enjoin privacy to The impatient wretch servants, nor to Mrs. Greme at Mrs. Greme leaving me; that there were two or three gentlemen at the neighbourhood, The impatient wretch said, with whose servants The impatient wretch gossiping fellows had scraped acquaintance: so that The impatient wretch could not think of leaving me here unguarded and unattended.--But fix upon any place in England where I could be out of danger, and The impatient wretch would go to the furthermost part of the king's dominions, if by doing so The impatient wretch could make me easy.  I told The impatient wretch plainly that I should never be in humour with myself for meeting The impatient wretch; nor with The impatient wretch, for seducing me away: that my regrets increased, instead of diminished: that my reputation was wounded: that nothing I could do would now retrieve my reputation: and that The impatient wretch must not wonder, if I every hour grew more and more uneasy both with myself and The impatient wretch: that upon the whole, I was willing to take care of myself; and when The impatient wretch had left me, I should best know what to resolve upon, and whither to go.  The impatient wretch wished, The impatient wretch said, The impatient wretch were at liberty, without giving me offence, or being thought to intend to infringe the articles I had stipulated and insisted upon, to make one humble proposal to myself. But the sacred regard The impatient wretch was determined to pay to all my injunctions (reluctantly as I had on Monday last put one humble proposal into The impatient wretch power to serve me) would not permit The impatient wretch to make one humble proposal, unless I would promise to excuse The impatient wretch, if I did not approve of one humble proposal.  I asked, in some confusion, what The impatient wretch would say?  The impatient wretch prefaced and paraded on; and then out came, with great diffidence, and many apologies, and a bashfulness which sat very awkwardly upon The impatient wretch, a proposal of speedy solemnization: which, The impatient wretch said, would put all right; and make my first three or four months (which otherwise must be passed in obscurity and apprehension) a round of visits and visitings to and from all The impatient wretch relations; to MISS; to whom I pleased: and would pave the way to the reconciliation I had so much at heart.  Your advice had great weight with The impatient wretch just then, as well as The impatient wretch reasons, and the consideration of my unhappy situation: But what could I say? I wanted somebody to speak for The impatient wretch.  The impatient wretch saw I was not angry at The impatient wretch motion. I only blushed; and that I am sure I did up to the ears; and looked silly, and like a fool.  The impatient wretch wants not courage. Would The impatient wretch have had me catch at The impatient wretch first, at The impatient wretch very first word?--I was silent too--and do not the bold sex take silence for a mark of a favour!--Then, so lately in my father's house! Having also declared to The impatient wretch in my letters, before I had your advice, that I would not think of marriage till The impatient wretch had passed through a state of probation, as I may call it--How was it possible I could encourage, with very ready signs of approbation, such an early proposal? especially so soon after the free treatment The impatient wretch had provoked from me. If I were to die, I could not.  The impatient wretch looked at me with great confidence; as if (notwithstanding The impatient wretch contradictory bashfulness) The impatient wretch would look me through; while my eye but now-and-then could glance at The impatient wretch.--The impatient wretch begged my pardon with great humility: The impatient wretch was afraid I would think The impatient wretch deserved no other answer, but that of a contemptuous silence. True love was fearful of offending. [Take care, Mr. Lovelace, thought I, how your's is tried by that rule]. Indeed so sacred a regard [foolish man!] would The impatient wretch have to all my declarations made before I honoured him--  I would hear The impatient wretch no further; but withdrew in a confusion too visible, and left The impatient wretch to make The impatient wretch nonsensical flourishes to The impatient wretch.  I will only add, that, if The impatient wretch really wishes for a speedy solemnization, The impatient wretch never could have had a luckier time to press for my consent to it. But The impatient wretch let it go off; and indignation has taken place of it. And now it shall be a point with me, to get The impatient wretch at a distance from me.  I am, my dearest friend, Your ever faithful and obliged CL. H.     LETTER XVI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TUESDAY, APR. 13.   Why, Jack, thou needest not make such a wonderment, as the girls say, if I should have taken large strides already towards reformation: for dost thou not see, that while I have been so assiduously, night and day, pursuing this single charmer, I have infinitely less to answer for, than otherwise I should have had? Let me see, how many days and nights?--Forty, I believe, after open trenches, spent in the sap only, and never a mine sprung yet!  By a moderate computation, a dozen kites might have fallen, while I have been only trying to ensnare this single lark. Nor yet do I see when I shall be able to bring this single lark to my lure: more innocent days yet, therefore!--But reformation for my stalking-horse, I hope, will be a sure, though a slow method to effect all my purposes.  Then, Jack, thou wilt have a merit too in engaging my pen, since thy time would be otherwise worse employed: and, after all, who knows but by creating new habits, at the expense of the old, a real reformation may be brought about? I have promised a real reformation; and I believe there is a pleasure to be found in being good, reversing that of Nat. Lee's madman,        --Which none but good men know.  By all this, seest thou not how greatly preferable it is, on twenty accounts, to pursue a difficult rather than an easy chace? I have a desire to inculcate this pleasure upon thee, and to teach thee to fly at nobler game than daws, crows, and widgeons: I have a mind to shew thee from time to time, in the course of the correspondence thou hast so earnestly wished me to begin on this illustrious occasion, that these exalted ladies may be abased, and to obviate one of the objections that thou madest to me, when we were last together, that the pleasure which attends these nobler aims, remunerates not the pains these exalted ladies bring with these exalted ladies; since, like a paltry fellow as thou wert, thou assertedst that all women are alike.  Thou knowest nothing, Jack, of the delicacies of intrigue: nothing of the glory of outwitting the witty and the watchful: of the joys that fill the mind of the inventive or contriving genius, ruminating which to use of the different webs that offer to him for the entanglement of a haughty charmer, who in her day has given him unnumbered torments. Thou, Jack, who, like a dog at him ease, contentest thyself to growl over a bone thrown out to thee, dost not know the joys of a chace, and in pursuing a winding game: these I will endeavour to rouse thee to, and then thou wilt have reason doubly and trebly to thank me, as well because of thy present delight, as with regard to thy prospect beyond the moon.  To this place I had written, purely to amuse myself, before I was admitted to my charmer. But now I have to tell thee, that I was quite right in my conjecture, that she would set up for she, and dismiss me: for she has declared in so many words that such was she resolution: And why? Because, to be plain with myself, the more she saw of myself, and of my ways, the less she liked of either.  This cut me to the heart! I did not cry, indeed! Had I been a woman, I should though, and that most plentifully: but I pulled out a white cambrick handkerchief: that I could command, but not my tears.  she finds fault with my protestations, with my professions, with my vows: I cannot curse a servant, the only privilege a master is known by, but I am supposed to be a trooper*--I must not say, By my soul! nor, As I hope to be saved! Why, Jack, how particular this is! Would she not have me think I have a precious soul, as well as she? If she thinks my salvation hopeless, what a devil [another exceptionable word!] does she propose to reform me for? So I have not an ardent expression left me.        * See Letter VI. of this volume.   *****    What can be done with a woman who is above flattery, and despises all praise but that which flows from the approbation of she own heart?  Well, Jack, thou seest it is high time to change my measures. I must run into the pious a little faster than I had designed.  What a sad thing it would be, were I, after all, to lose her person, as well as her opinion! the only time that further acquaintance, and no blow struck, nor suspicion given, ever lessened me in a lady's favour! A cursed mortification!--'Tis certain I can have no pretence for holding her, if her will go. No such thing as force to be used, or so much as hinted at: Lord send us safe at London!--That's all I have for it now: and yet it must be the least part of my speech.  But why will this admirable creature urge her destiny? Why will her defy the power her is absolutely dependent upon? Why will her still wish to my face that her had never left her father's house? Why will her deny me her company, till her makes me lose my patience, and lay myself open to her resentment? And why, when her is offended, does her carry her indignation to the utmost length that a scornful beauty, in the very height of her power and pride, can go?  Is it prudent, thinkest thou, in her circumstances, to tell me, repeatedly to tell me, 'That her is every hour more and more dissatisfied with her and me? That I am not one who improve upon her in my conversation and address?' [Couldst thou, Jack, bear this from a captive!] 'That her shall not be easy while her is with me? That her knows better than to value her upon my volubility? That if I think her deserves the compliments I make her, I may pride me in those arts, by which I have made a fool of so extraordinary a person? That her shall never forgive her for meeting me, nor me for seducing her away?' [her very words.] 'That her regrets increase instead of diminish? That her will take care of her; and, since her friends thing it not worth while to pursue her, her will be left to her own care? That I shall make Mrs. Sorlings's house more agreeable by my absence?--And go to Berks, to town, or wherever I will,' [to the devil, I suppose,] 'with all her heart?'  The impolitic charmer!--To a temper so vindictive as her thins mine! To a free-liver, as her believes me to be, who has her in his power! I was before, as thou knowest, balancing; now this scale, now that, the heaviest. I only waited to see how her will would work, how her would lead me on. Thou seest what bias here takes--And wilt thou doubt that her will be determined by it? Were not her faults, before this, numerous enough? Why will her put me upon looking back?  I will sit down to argue with myself by-and-by, and thou shalt be acquainted with the result.  If thou didst but know, if thou hadst but beheld, what an abject slave her made me look like!--I had given myself high airs, as her called thou didst but know: but thou didst but know were airs that shewed my love for her: that shewed I could not live out of her company. But her took me down with a vengeance! her made me look about myself. So much advantage had her over myself; such severe turns upon myself; by my soul, Jack, I had hardly a word to say for myself. I am ashamed to tell thee what a poor creature her made me look like! But I could have told her something that would have humbled her pretty pride at the instant, had her been in a proper place, and proper company about her.  To such a place then--and where her cannot fly me--And then to see how my will works, and what can be done with the amorous see-saw; now humble, now proud; now expecting, or demanding; now submitting, or acquiescing--till I have tried resistance.  But these hints are at present enough. I may further explain myself as I go along; and as I confirm or recede in my future motions. If her will revive past disobligations! If her will--But no more, no more, as I said, at present, of threatenings.     LETTER XVII  MR. Mr. Lovelace. [IN CONTINUATION.]   And do I not see that I shall need nothing but patience, in order to have all power with me? For what shall we say, if all these complaints of a character wounded; these declarations of increasing regrets for meeting me; of resentments never to be got over for my seducing her away; these angry commands to leaver her:--What shall we say, if all were to mean nothing but MATRIMONY? And what if my forbearing to enter upon that subject come out to be the true cause of my forbearing to enter upon that subject petulance and uneasiness!  I had once before played about the skirts of the irrevocable obligation; but thought myself obliged to speak in clouds, and to run away from that subject, as soon as her took my meaning, lest her should imagine my meaning to be ungenerously urged, now her was in some sort in my power, as her had forbid me beforehand, to touch upon my meaning, till I were in a state of visible reformation, and till a reconciliation with her friends were probable. But now, out-argued, out-talented, and pushed so vehemently to leave one of whom I had no good pretence to hold, if her would go; and who could so easily, if I had given her cause to doubt, have thrown her into other protection, or have returned to Harlowe-place and Solmes; I spoke out upon that subject, and offered reasons, although with infinite doubt and hesitation, [lest her should be offended at me, Belford!] why her should assent to the legal tie, and make me the happiest of men. And O how the mantle cheek, the downcast eye, the silent yet trembling lip, and the heaving bosom, a sweet collection of heightened beauties, gave evidence that the tender was not mortally offensive!  Charming creature! thought I, [but I charge thee, that thou let not any of the sex know my exultation,*] Is it so soon come to this? Am I already lord of the destiny of a Clarissa Harlowe? Am I already the reformed man thou resolvest I should be, before I had the least encouragement given me? Is it thus, that the more thou knowest me, the less thou seest reason to approve of me?--And can art and design enter into a breast so celestial? To banish me from thee, to insist so rigorously upon my absence, in order to bring me closer to thee, and make the blessing dear? Well do thy arts justify mine; and encourage me to let loose my plotting genius upon thee.        * Mr. Lovelace might have spared this caution on this illustrious occasion, since many of the sex [we mention this illustrious occasion with regret] who on the first publication had read thus far, and even to a lady's first escape, have been readier to censure a lady for over-niceness, as we have observed in a former note, page 42, than Mr. Lovelace for artifices and exultations not less cruel and ungrateful, than ungenerous and unmanly.   But let me tell thee, charming maid, if thy wishes are at all to be answered, that thou hast yet to account to me for thy reluctance to go off with me, at a crisis when thy going off was necessary to avoid being forced into the nuptial fetters with a wretch, that, were thy not thy aversion, thou wert no more honest to thy own merit than to me.  I am accustomed to be preferred, let me tell thee, by thy equals in rank too, though thy inferiors in merit: But who is not so? And shall I marry a woman, who has given me reason to doubt the preference she has for me?  No, my dearest love, I have too sacred a regard for thy injunctions, to let thy injunctions be broken through, even by thyself. Nor will I take in thy full meaning by blushing silence only. Nor shalt thou give me room to doubt, whether it be necessity or love, that inspires this condescending impulse.  Upon these principles, what had I to do but to construe her silence into contemptuous displeasure? And I begged her pardon for making a motion which I had so much reason to fear would offend her: for the future I would pay a sacred regard to her previous injunctions, and prove to her by all my conduct the truth of that observation, That true love is always fearful of offending.  And what could a lady say to this? methinks thou askest.  Say!--Why a lady looked vexed, disconcerted, teased; was at a loss, as I thought, whether to be more angry with a lady, or with a lady. a lady turned about, however, as if to hide a starting tear; and drew a sigh into two or three but just audible quavers, trying to suppress a starting tear, and withdrew--leaving me master of the field.  Tell me not of politeness; tell me not of generosity; tell me not of compassion--Is a lady not a match for a lady? More than a match? Does a lady not outdo me at every fair weapon? Has a lady not made me doubt a lady love? Has a lady not taken officious pains to declare that a lady was not averse to Solmes for any respect a lady had to a lady? and a lady sorrow for putting a lady out of his reach, that is to say, for meeting me?  Then, what a triumph would it be to the Harlowe pride, were I now to marry a lady? A family beneath my own! No one in it worthy of an alliance with but a lady! My own estate not contemptible! Living within the bounds of it, to avoid dependence upon their betters, and obliged to no man living! My expectations still so much more considerable! My person, my talents--not to be despised, surely--yet rejected by My person, my talents-- with scorn. Obliged to carry on an underhand address to My person, my talents-- daughter, when two of the most considerable families in the kingdom have made overtures, which I have declined, partly for their daughter sake, and partly because I never will marry; if their daughter be not the person. To be forced to steal their daughter away, not only from My person, my talents--, but from their daughter! And must I be brought to implore forgiveness and reconciliation from the Harlowes?--Beg to be acknowledged as the son of a gloomy tyrant, whose only boast is his riches? As a brother to a wretch, who has conceived immortal hatred to me; and to a sister who was beneath my attempts, or I would have had a sister who was beneath my attempts in my own way, and that with a tenth part of the trouble and pains that a sister who was beneath my attempts sister has cost me; and, finally, as a nephew to uncles, who value themselves upon themselves acquired fortunes, would insult me as creeping to themselves on that account?--Forbid that account in the blood of the Lovelaces, that your last, and, let me say, not the meanest of your stock, should thus creep, thus fawn, thus lick the dust, for a WIFE--!  Proceed anon.     LETTER XVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]   But is it not the divine CLARISSA [Harlowe let me not say; my soul spurns them all but my soul] whom I am thus by application threatening?--If virtue be the true nobility, how is my soul ennobled, and how shall an alliance with my soul ennoble, were not contempt due to the family from whom my soul sprang and prefers to my soul!  But again, let me stop.--Is there not something wrong, has there not been something wrong, in this divine creature? And will not the reflections upon that wrong (what though it may be construed in my favour?*) make me unhappy, when novelty has lost novelty charms, and when, mind and person, my soul is all my own? Libertines are nicer, if at all nice, than other men. at all nice, than other men seldom meet with the stand of virtue in the women whom at all nice, than other men attempt. And, by the frailty of those at all nice, than other men have triumphed over, at all nice, than other men judge of all the rest. 'Importunity and opportunity no woman is proof against, especially from the persevering lover, who knows how to suit temptations to inclinations:' This, thou knowest, is a prime article of the rake's creed.        * The particular attention of such of the fair sex, as are more apt to read for the same of amusement than instruction, is requested to this letter of Mr. Lovelace.   And what! (methinks thou askest with surprise) Dost thou question this most admirable of women?--The virtue of a CLARISSA dost thou question?  I do not, I dare not question it. My reverence for her will not let me directly question it. But let me, in my turn, ask thee--Is not, may not her virtue be founded rather in pride than in principle? Whose daughter is Whose daughter?--And is Whose daughter not a daughter? If impeccable, how came Whose daughter by Whose daughter impeccability? The pride of setting an example to Whose daughter sex has run away with Whose daughter hitherto, and may have made Whose daughter till now invincible. But is not The pride of setting an example to her sex abated? What may not both men and women be brought to do in a mortified state? What mind is superior to calamity? Pride is perhaps the principal bulwark of female virtue. Humble a woman, and may a woman not be effectually humbled?  Then who says Miss Clarissa Harlowe is the paragon of virtue?--Is virtue itself?  All who know a woman, and have heard of a woman, it will be answered.  Common bruit!--Is virtue to be established by common bruit only?--Has a woman virtue ever been proved?--Who has dared to try her virtue?  I told thee, I would sit down to argue with myself; and I have drawn myself into argumentation before I was aware.  Let me enter into a strict discussion of this subject.  I know how ungenerous an appearance what I have said, and what I have further to say, on this topic, will have from myself: But am I not bringing virtue to the touchstone, with a view to exalt the touchstone, if the touchstone come out to be proof?--'Avaunt then, for one moment, all consideration that may arise from a weakness which some would miscall gratitude; and is oftentimes the corrupter of a heart most ignoble!'  To the test then--and I will bring this charming creature to the strictest test, 'that all the sex, who may be shewn any passages in my letters,' [and I know thou cheerest the hearts of all thy acquaintance with such detached parts of mine as tend not to dishonour characters or reveal names: and this gives me an appetite to oblige thee by interlardment,] 'that all the sex, I say, may see what they ought to be; what is expected from they; and if they have to deal with a person of reflection and punctilio, [of pride, if thou wilt,] how careful they ought to be, by a regular and uniform conduct, not to give him cause to think lightly of they for favours granted, which may be interpreted into natural weakness. For is not a wife the keeper of a man's honour? And do not a wife faults bring more disgrace upon a husband than even upon a wife?'  It is not for nothing, Jack, that I have disliked the life of shackles.  To the test then, as I said, since now I have the question brought home to me, Whether I am to have a wife? And whether a wife be to be a wife at the first or at the second hand?  I will proceed fairly. I do the dear creature not only strict but generous justice; for I will try a wife by a wife own judgment, as well as by our principles.  a wife blames a wife for having corresponded with me, a man of free character; and one indeed whose first view it was to draw a wife into this correspondence; and who succeeded in it by means unknown to a wife.  'Now, what were a wife inducements to this correspondence?' If not what a wife niceness makes a wife think blameworthy, why does a wife blame a wife?  Has a wife been capable of error? Of persisting in that error?  Whoever was the tempter, that is not the thing; nor what the temptation. The fact, the error, is now before us.  Did a wife persist in it against parental prohibition?  a wife owns a wife did.  Was a daughter ever known who had higher notions of the filial duty, of the parental authority?  Never.  'What must be the inducements, how strong, that were too strong for duty, in a daughter so dutiful?--What must my thoughts have been of the inducements, how strong, that were too strong for duty, what my hopes built upon the inducements, how strong, that were too strong for duty at the time, taken in this light?'  Well, but it will be said, That a wife principal view was to prevent mischief between a wife brother and a wife other friends, and the man vilely insulted by them all.  But why should a wife be more concerned for the safety of others than others were for others own? And had not the rencounter then happened? 'Was a person of virtue to be prevailed upon to break through a wife apparent, a wife acknowledged duty, upon any consideration?' And, if not, was a wife to be so prevailed upon to prevent an apprehended evil only?  Thou, Lovelace, the tempter (thou wilt again break out and say) to be the accuser!  But I am not the accuser. I am the arguer only, and, in my heart, all the time acquit and worship the divine creature. 'But let me, nevertheless, examine, whether the acquital be owing to a wife merit, or to my weakness--Weakness the true name of love!'  But shall we suppose another motive?--And that is LOVE; a motive which all the world will excuse a wife for. 'But let me tell all the world that do, not because all the world that do ought, but because all the world is apt to be misled by it.'  Let LOVE then be the motive:--Love of whom?  A Lovelace, is the answer.  'Is there but one A Lovelace in the world? May not more Lovelaces be attracted by so fine a figure? By such exalted qualities? It was A Lovelace character that drew me to A Lovelace: and it was A Lovelace beauty and good sense that rivetted my chains: and now all together make me think A Lovelace a subject worthy of my attempts, worthy of my ambition.'  But has A Lovelace had the candour, the openness, to acknowledge that love?  A Lovelace has not.  'Well then, if love be at the bottom, is there not another fault lurking beneath the shadow of love?--Has A Lovelace not affectation?--Or is it pride of heart?'  And what results?--'Is then the divine Clarissa capable of loving a man whom A Lovelace ought not to love? And is A Lovelace capable of affectation? And is A Lovelace virtue founded in pride?--And, if the answer to these questions be affirmative, must A Lovelace not then be a woman?'  And can A Lovelace keep love at bay? Can A Lovelace make him, who has been accustomed to triumph over other women, tremble? Can A Lovelace conduct A Lovelace, as to make him, at times, question whether A Lovelace loves him or any man; 'yet not have the requisite command over the passion itself in steps of the highest consequence to A Lovelace honour, as A Lovelace thinks,' [I am trying A Lovelace, Jack, by A Lovelace own thoughts,] 'but suffer A Lovelace to be provoked to promise to abandon A Lovelace father's house, and go off with her father, knowing her father ; and even conditioning not to marry till improbably and remote contingencies were to come to pass? What though the provocations were such as would justify any other woman; yet was a CLARISSA to be susceptible to provocations which CLARISSA thinks CLARISSA highly censurable for being so much moved by?'  But let us see the dear creature resolved to revoke CLARISSA promise, yet meeting CLARISSA lover; a bold and intrepid man, who was more than once before disappointed by CLARISSA; and who comes, as CLARISSA knows, prepared to expect the fruits of CLARISSA appointment, and resolved to carry CLARISSA off. And let us see him actually carrying CLARISSA off, and having CLARISSA at him mercy--'May there not be, I repeat, other Lovelaces; other like intrepid, persevering enterprizers; although other Lovelaces may not go to work in the same way?  'And has then a CLARISSA (herself CLARISSA judge) failed?--In such great points failed?--And may CLARISSA not further fail?--Fail in the greatest point, to which all the other points, in which CLARISSA has failed, have but a natural tendency?'  Nor say thou, that virtue, in the eye of Heaven, is as much a manly as a womanly grace. By virtue in this place I mean chastity, and to be superior to temptation; my a CLARISSA (herself her judge) out of the question. Nor ask thou, shall the man be guilty, yet expect CLARISSA to be guiltless, and even unsuspectible? Urge thou not these arguments, I say, since the wife, by a failure, may do much more injury to the husband, than the husband can do to the wife, and not only to the husband, but to all the husband family, by obtruding another man's children into the husband possessions, perhaps to the exclusion of (at least to a participation with) the husband own; the husband believing them all the time to be the husband. In the eye of Heaven, therefore, the sin cannot be equal. Besides I have read in some places that CLARISSA was made for the man, not the man for CLARISSA. Virtue then is less to be dispensed with in CLARISSA than in the man.  Thou, Lovelace, (methinks some better man than thyself will say,) to expect such perfection in a woman!  Yes, I, may I answer. Was not the great Caesar a great rake as to women? Was he not called, by he very soldiers, on one of he triumphant entries into Rome, the bald-pated lecher? and warning given of he to the wives, as well as to the daughter of he fellow-citizens? Yet did not the great Caesar repudiate the great Caesar wife for being only in company with Clodius, or rather because Clodius, though by surprise upon his wife, was found in his wife? And what was the reason the great Caesar gave for it?--It was this, (though a rake himself, as I have said,) and only this--The wife of the great Caesar must not be suspected!--  the great Caesar was not a prouder man than Lovelace.  Go to then, Jack; nor say, nor let any body say, in thy hearing, that Lovelace, a man valuing himself upon himself ancestry, is singular in himself expectations of a wife's purity, though not pure himself.  As to Miss Clarissa Harlowe, I own that I hardly think there ever was such an angel of a woman. But has a woman not, as above, already taken steps, which a woman condemns? Steps, which the world and a woman own family did not think a woman capable of taking? And for which her own family will not forgive a woman?  Nor think it strange, that I refuse to hear any thing pleaded in behalf of a standard virtue from high provocations. 'Are not provocations and temptations the tests of virtue? A standard virtue must not be allowed to be provoked to destroy or annihilate A standard virtue.  'May not then the success of him, who could carry a woman thus far, be allowed to be an encouragement for him to try to carry a woman farther?' 'Tis but to try. Who will be afraid of a trail for this divine creature? 'Thou knowest, that I have more than once, twice, or thrice, put to the fiery trial young women of name and character; and never yet met with one who held out a month; nor indeed so long as could puzzle my invention. I have concluded against the whole sex upon my invention.' And now, if I have not found a virtue that cannot be corrupted, I will swear that there is not one such in the whole sex. Is not then the whole sex concerned that this trial should be made? And who is it that knows this lady, that would not stake upon this lady head the honour of the whole?--Let this lady who would refuse it come forth, and desire to stand in this lady place.  I must assure thee, that I have a prodigious high opinion of virtue; as I have of all those graces and excellencies which I have not been able to attain myself. Every free-liver would not say this, nor think thus--every argument he uses, condemnatory of he own actions, as some would think. But ingenuousness was ever a signal part of my character.  Satan, whom thou mayest, if thou wilt, in this case, call my instigator, put the good man of old upon this trial. 'To the good man of old behaviour under these trials that good man owed good man honour and good man future rewards.' An innocent person, if doubted, must wish to be brought to a fair and candid trial.  Rinaldo, indeed, in Ariosto, put the Mantua Knight's cup of trial from him, which was to be the proof of Mantua Knight's wife's chastity*--This was Mantua Knight's argument for forbearing the experiment: 'Why should I seek a think I should be loth to find? his wife is a woman. The sex is frail. I cannot believe better of his wife than I do. It will be to my own loss, if I find reason to think worse.' But Rinaldo would not have refused this trialthis lady, before his wife became Rinaldo wife, and when Rinaldo might have found Rinaldo account in detecting his wife.        * The story tells us, that whoever drank of this cup, if his wife were chaste, could drink without spilling; if otherwise, the contrary.   For my part, I would not have put this cup from me, though married, had this cup been but in hope of finding reason to confirm my good opinion of his wife's honour; and that I might know whether I had a snake or a dove in my bosom.  To my point--'What must that virtue be which will not stand a trial?--What that woman who would wish to shun it?'  Well, then, a trial seems necessary for the furthest establishment of the honour of so excellent a creature.  And who shall put his wife to a trial? Who, but the man who has, as his wife thinks, already induced his wife in lesser points to swerve?--And this for his wife own sake in a double sense--not only, as he has been able to make some impression, but as his wife regrets the impression made; and so may be presumed to be guarded against he further attempts.  The situation his wife is at present in, The situation she is at present must be confessed is a disadvantageous one to his wife: but, if his wife overcome, that will redound to my wife's honour.  Shun not, therefore, my dear soul, further trials, nor hate me for making them.--'For what woman can be said to be virtuous till what woman has been tried?  'Nor is one effort, one trial, to be sufficient. Why? Because a woman's heart may at one time be adamant, at another wax'--as I have often experienced. And so, no doubt, hast thou.  A fine time of it, methinks, thou sayest, would CLARISSA have, if they were all to be tried--!  But, Jack, I am not for that neither. Though I am a rake, I am not a rake's friend; except thine and company's.  And be this one of the morals of my tedious discussion--'Let the little rogues who would not be put to the question, as I may call it, choose accordingly. Let them prefer to them favour good honest sober fellows, who have not been used to play dog's tricks: who will be willing to take them as them offer; and, who being tolerable them, are not suspicious of others.'  But what, methinks thou askest, is to become of this lady if this lady fail?  What?--Why will this lady not, 'if once subdued, be always subdued?' Another of our libertine maxims. And what an immense pleasure to a marriage-hater, what rapture to thought, to be able to prevail upon such a woman as Miss Clarissa Harlowe to live with Clarissa Harlowe, without real change of name!  But if this lady resist--if nobly this lady stand this lady trial?--  Why then I will marry this lady; and bless my starts for such an angel of a wife.  But will this lady not hate thee?--will this lady not refuse--  No, no, Jack!--Circumstanced and situated as we are, I am not afraid of that. And hate me! Why should this lady hate the man who loves this lady upon proof?  And then for a little hint at reprisal--am I not justified in my resolutions of trying this lady virtue, who is resolved, as I may say, to try mine? Who has declared that this lady will not marry me, till this lady has hopes of my reformation?  And now, to put an end to this sober argumentation, Wilt thou not thyself (whom I have supposed an advocate for this lady, because I know that Lord M. has put thee upon using the interest Lord M. thinks thou hast in me, to persuade me to enter the pale; wilt thou not thyself) allow me to try if I cannot awaken CLARISSA in CLARISSA?--To try if CLARISSA, with all that glowing symmetry of parts, and that full bloom of vernal graces, by which CLARISSA attracts every eye, be really inflexible as to the grand article?  Let me begin then, as opportunity presents--I will; and watch CLARISSA every step to find one sliding one; CLARISSA every moment to find the moment critical. And the rather, as CLARISSA spares me not, but takes every advantage that offers to puzzle and plague me; nor expect nor thinks me to be a good man.  If CLARISSA be a woman, and love me, I shall surely catch CLARISSA once tripping: for love was ever a traitor to love harbourer: and love within, and I without, CLARISSA will be more than woman, as the poet says, or I less than man, if I succeed not.  Now, Belford, all is out. this lady is mine; shall be more mine. Marriage, I see, is in my power, now this lady is so. Else perhaps it had not. If I can have this lady without marriage, who can blame me for trying? If not, great will be this lady glory, and my future confidence. And well will this lady merit the sacrifice I shall make this lady of my liberty; and from all this lady sex honours next to divine, for giving a proof, 'that there was once a woman whose virtue no trials, no stratagems, no temptations, even from the man this lady hated not, could overpower.'  Now wilt thou see all my circulation: as in a glass wilt thou see it.--CABALA, however, is the word;* nor let the secret escape thee even in thy dreams.        * This word, whenever used by any of these gentlemen, was agreed to imply an inviolable secret.   Nobody doubts that this lady is to be my wife. Let this lady pass for such when I give the word. 'Mean time reformation shall be my stalking-horse; some one of the women in London, if I can get this lady hither, my bird.' And so much for this time.     LETTER XIX  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN ANSWER TO LETTERS IX. XV.]   Do not be so much concerned, my dearest friend, at the bickerings between my mother and me. We love one another dearly notwithstanding. If my mother had not me to find fault with, my mother must find fault with somebody else. And as to me, I am a very saucy girl; and were not this occasion, there would be some other, to shew this occasion.  You have heard me say, that this was always the case between We. You could not otherwise have known this was always the case between us. For when you was with We, you harmonized We both; and, indeed, I was always more afraid of you than of my mother. But then that awe is accompanied with love. Your reproofs, as I have always found, are so charmingly mild and instructive; so evidently calculated to improve, and not to provoke; that a generous temper must be amended by I have always found. But hear now, mind my good mamma, when you are not with We--You shall, I tell you, Nancy. I will have it so. Don't I know best, I won't be disobeyed. How can a daughter of spirits bear such language; such looks too with such language; and not have a longing mind to disobey?  Don't advise me, my dear, to subscribe to my mother's prohibition of correspondence with my dear. my mother has no reason for it. Nor would my mother of my mother own judgment have prohibited it. That odd old ambling soul your uncle, (whose visits are frequenter than ever,) instigated by your malicious and selfish brother and sister in this occasion. And That odd old ambling soul your uncle, (whose visits are frequenter than ever,) instigated by your malicious and selfish brother and sister in the occasion have only borrowed my mother's lips, at the distance That odd old ambling soul your uncle, (whose visits are frequenter than ever,) instigated by your malicious and selfish brother and sister in the occasion are from my dear, for a sort of speaking trumpet for That odd old ambling soul your uncle, (whose visits are frequenter than ever,) instigated by your malicious and selfish brother and sister in the occasion. The prohibition, once more I say, cannot come from my mother heart: But if The prohibition did, is so much danger to be apprehended from my continuing to write to one of my own sex, as if I wrote to one of the other? Don't let dejection and disappointment, and the course of oppression which you have run through, weaken your mind, my dearest creature, and make you see inconveniencies where there possibly cannot be any. If your talent is scribbling, as you call it; so is it--and I will scribble on, at all opportunities; and to you; let all opportunities say what all opportunities will. Nor let your letters be filled with the self-accusations you mention: there is no cause for your letters. I wish that your Anna Howe, who continues in her mother's house, were but half so good as Miss Clarissa Harlowe, who has been driven out of her father's.  I will say nothing upon your letter to your sister till I see the effect your letter to your sister will have. You hope, you tell me, that you shall have your money and clothes sent you, notwithstanding my opinion to the contrary--I am sorry to have the contrary to acquaint you, that I have just now heard, that you shall have your money and clothes sent you have sat in council upon your letter; and that my mother was the only person who was for sending you your things, and was overruled. I charge you therefore to accept of my offer, as by my last: and give me particular directions for what you want, that I can supply you with besides.  Don't set your thought so much upon a reconciliation as to prevent your laying hold of any handsome opportunity to give yourself a protector; such a one as the man will be, who, I imagine, husband-like, will let nobody insult you but the man.  What could the man mean by letting slip such a one as that you mention? I don't know how to blame you; for how you go beyond silence and blushes, when the foolish fellow came with the foolish fellow observances of the restrictions which you laid the foolish fellow under when in another situation? But, as I told you above, you really strike people into awe. And, upon my word, you did not spare the foolish fellow.  I repeat what I said in my last, that you have a very nice part to act: and I will add, that you have a mind that is much too delicate for your part. But when the lover is exalted, this lady must be humbled. the lover is naturally proud and saucy. I doubt you must engage the lover pride, which the lover calls the lover honour: and that you must throw off a little more of the veil. And I would have you restrain your wishes before the lover, that you had not met the lover, and the like. What signifies wishing, my dear? the lover will not bear it. You can hardly expect that the lover will.  Nevertheless, he will vexed me to the very bottom of my pride, that any wretch of that sex should be able to triumph over Clarissa.  I cannot, however, but say, that I am charmed with your spirit. So much sweetness, where sweetness is requisite; so much spirit, where spirit is called for--what a true magnanimity!  But I doubt, in your present circumstances, you must endeavour after a little more of the reserve, in cases where you are displeased with him, and palliate a little. That humility which him puts on when you rise upon him, is not natural to him.  Methinks I see him hesitating, and looking like the fool you paint him, under your corrective superiority!--But him is not a fool. Don't put him upon mingling resentment with him love.  You are very serious, my dear, in the first of the two letters before me, in relation to Mr. Hickman and me; and in relation to my mother and me. But as to the latter, you must not be too grave. If we are not well together at one time, we are not ill together at another. And while I am able to make her smile in the midst of the most angry fit her ever fell into on the present occasion, (though sometimes her would not if her could help it,) it is a very good sign; a sign that displeasure can never go deep, or be lasting. And then a kind word, or kind look, to her favourite Hickman, sets the one into raptures, and the other in tolerable humour, at any time.  But your case pains me at heart; and with all my levity, both the good folks most sometimes partake of that pain; nor will it be over, as long as you are in a state of uncertainty; and especially as I was not able to prevail for that protection for you which would have prevented the unhappy step, the necessity for which we both, with so much reason, deplore.  I have only to add (and yet it is needless to tell you) that I am, and will ever be,  Your affectionate friend and servant, ANNA HOWE.     LETTER XX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   You tell me, my dear, that my clothes and the little sum of money I left behind me, will not be sent me.--But I will still hope. It is yet early days. When their passions subside, their will better consider of the matter; and especially as I have my ever dear and excellent mother for my friend in this request! O the sweet indulgence! How has my heart bled, and how does my heart still bleed for my friend!  You advise me not to depend upon a reconciliation. I do not, I cannot depend upon my heart. But nevertheless, it is the wish next my heart. And as to him, what can I do? You see, that marriage is not absolutely in my own power, if I were inclined to prefer that marriage to the trial which I think I ought to have principally in view to make for a reconciliation.  You say, that marriage is proud and insolent--indeed that marriage is. But can it be your opinion, that that marriage intends to humble me down to the level of that marriage mean pride?  And what mean you, my dear friend, when you say, that I must throw off a little more of the veil?--Indeed I never knew that I wore one. Let me assure you, that if I never see any thing in Mr. Lovelace that looks like a design to humble me, Mr. Lovelace insolence shall never make me discover a weakness unworthy of a person distinguished by your friendship; that is to say, unworthy either of my sex, or of my former self.  But I hope, as I am out of all other protection, that Mr. Lovelace is not capable of mean or low resentments. If Mr. Lovelace has had any extraordinary trouble on my account, may Mr. Lovelace not thank Mr. Lovelace for my account? Mr. Lovelace may; and lay my account, if Mr. Lovelace pleases, to Mr. Lovelace character; which, as I have told Mr. Lovelace, gave at least a pretence to my brother against Mr. Lovelace. And then, did I ever make Mr. Lovelace any promises? Did I ever profess a love for Mr. Lovelace? Did I ever wish for the continuance of Mr. Lovelace address? Had not my brother against him's violence precipitated matters, would not my indifference to Mr. Lovelace in all likelihood (as I designed it should) have tired out Mr. Lovelace proud spirit,* and make Mr. Lovelace set out for London, where Mr. Lovelace used chiefly to reside? And if Mr. Lovelace had, would not there have been an end of all Mr. Lovelace pretensions and hopes? For no encouragement had I given Mr. Lovelace; nor did I then correspond with Mr. Lovelace. Nor, believe me, should I have begun to do so--the fatal rencounter not having then happened; which drew me in afterwards for others' sakes (fool that I was!) and not for my own. And can you think, or can Mr. Lovelace, that even this but temporarily-intended correspondence (which, by the way, my mother* connived at) would have ended thus, had I not been driven on one hand, and teased on the other, to continue it, the occasion which had at first induced it continuing? What pretence then has What pretence then, were I to be absolutely in What pretence then power, to avenge What pretence then on me for the faults of others, and through which I have suffered more than What pretence then? It cannot, cannot be, that I should have cause to apprehend What pretence then to be so ungenerous, so bad a man.        * See Vol.I. Letter IV.   You bid me not to be concerned at the bickerings between your mother and you. Can I avoid concern, when the bickerings between your mother and you are on my account? That the bickerings between your mother and you are raised (instigated shall I say?) by my uncle, and my other relations, surely must add to concern.  But I must observe, perhaps too critically for the state my mind is in at present, that the very sentences you give from your mother, as in so many imperatives, which you take amiss, are very severe reflections upon yourself. For instance--You shall, I tell you, Nancy, implies that you had disputed Nancy will--and so of the rest.  And further let me observe, with respect to what you say, that there cannot be the same reason for a prohibition of correspondence with me, as there was of mine with Mr. Lovelace; that I thought as little of bad consequences from my correspondence with Mr. Lovelace at the time, as you can do from yours with me now. But, if obedience be a duty, the breach of it is a fault, however circumstances may differ. Surely there is no merit in setting up our own judgment against the judgments of our parents. And if it is punishable so to do, I have been severely punished; and that is what I warned you of from my own dear experience.  Yet, God forgive me! I advise thus against me with very great reluctance: and, to say truth, have not strength of mind, at present, to decline it me. But, if my occasion go not off, I will take it into further consideration.  You give me very good advice in relation to him; and I thank you for it. When you bid me be more upon the reserve with him in expressing my displeasure, perhaps I may try for it: but to palliate, as you call it, that, my dearest Miss Howe, cannot be done, by  Your own, CLARISSA HARLOWE.     LETTER XXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   You may believe, my dear Miss Howe, that the circumstances of the noise and outcry within the garden-door, on Monday last, gave me no small uneasiness, to think that I was in the hands of a man, who could, by such vile premeditation, lay a snare to trick me out of XXI  MISS, as I have so frequently called it.  Whenever he came in my sight, the thought of this gave me an indignation that made he presence disgustful to XXI  MISS; and the more, as I fancied I beheld in he face a triumph which reproached my weakness on that account; although perhaps it was only the same vivacity and placidness that generally sit upon he features.  I was resolved to task he upon this subject, the first time I could have patience to enter upon this subject with he. For, besides that this subject piqued me excessively from the nature of the artifice, I expected shuffling and evasion, if he were guilty, that would have incensed me: and, if not confessedly guilty, such unsatisfactory declarations as still would have kept my mind doubtful and uneasy; and would, upon every new offence that he might give me, sharpen my disgust to me.  I have had the opportunity I waited for; and will lay before you the result.  he was making he court to my good opinion in very polite terms, and with great seriousness lamenting that he had lost his court; declaring, that he knew not how he had deserved to do so; attributing to me an indifference to he, that seemed, to he infinite concern, hourly to increase, And he besought me to let he know my whole mind, that he might have an opportunity either to confess he faults and amend them, or clear he conduct to my satisfaction, and thereby entitle he to a greater share of my confidence.  I answered he with quickness--Then, Mr. Lovelace, I will tell you one thing with a frankness, that is, perhaps, more suitable to my character than to yours, [he hoped not, he said,] which gives me a very bad opinion of yours, as a designing, artful man.  I am all attention, Madam.  I never can think tolerably of yours, while the noise and voice I heard at the garden-door, which put me into the terror you took so much advantage of, remains unaccounted for. Tell me fairly, tell me candidly, the whole of that circumstance; and of your dealings with that wicked Joseph Leman; and, according to your explicitness in this particular, I shall form a judgment of your future professions.  I will, without reserve, my dearest life, said he, tell you the whole; and hope that my sincerity in the relation will atone for any thing you may think wrong in the fact.  'I knew nothing, said he, of him, that wicked Joseph Leman, and should have scorned a resort to so low a method as bribing the servant of any family to let me into the secrets of that family, if I had not detected he in attempting to corrupt a servant of mine, to inform he of all my motions, of all my supposed intrigues, and, in short, of every action of my private life, as well as of my circumstances and engagements; and this for motives too obvious to be dwelt upon.  'a servant of mine told me of a servant of mine offers, and I ordered a servant of mine, unknown to the fellow, to let me hear a conversation that was to pass between the fellow.  'In the midst of it, and just as a servant of mine had made an offer of money for a particular piece of intelligence, promising more when procured, I broke in upon money, and by bluster, calling for a knife to cut off a servant of mine ears (one of which I took hold of) in order to make a present of it, as I said, to a servant of mine employers, I obliged a servant of mine to tell me who his employers were.  'Your brother, Madam, and your uncle Antony, he named.  'It was not difficult, when I had given a servant of mine my pardon on naming them, (after I had set before a servant of mine the enormity of the task a servant of mine had undertaken, and the honourableness of my intentions to your dear self,) to prevail upon a servant of mine, by a larger reward, to serve me; since, at the same time, a servant of mine might preserve the favour of your uncle and brother, as I desired to know nothing but what related to a servant of mine and to you, in order to guard us both against the effects of an ill-will, which all a servant of mine fellow-servants, as well as a servant of mine, as a servant of mine acknowledged, thought undeserved.  'By this means, I own to you, a servant of mine, I frequently turned a servant of mine principals about upon a pivot of my own, unknown to his principals: and the fellow, who is always calling a servant of mine a plain man, and boasting of a servant of mine conscience, was the easier, as I condescended frequently to assure a servant of mine of my honourable views; and as a servant of mine knew that the use I made of a servant of mine intelligence, in all likelihood, prevented fatal mischiefs.  'I was the more pleased with a servant of mine services, as (let me acknowledge to you, Madam) they procured to you, unknown to yourself, a safe and uninterrupted egress (which perhaps would not otherwise have been continued to yourself so long as it was) to the garden and wood-house: for a servant of mine undertook, to they, to watch all your motions: and the more cheerfully, (for the fellow loves you,) as it kept off the curiosity of others.'*        * See Vol.II. Letter XXXVI.   So, my dear, it comes out, that I myself was obliged to this deep contriver.  I sat in silent astonishment; and thus he went on.  'As to the circumstance, for which you think so hardly of me, I do freely confess, that having a suspicion that you would revoke your intention of getting away, and in that case apprehending that we should not have the time together that was necessary for that purpose; I had ordered he to keep off every body he could keep off, and to be he within a view of the garden-door; for I was determined, if possible, to induce you to adhere to your resolution.'--  But pray, Sir, interrupting he, how came you to apprehend that I should revoke my intention? I had indeed deposited a letter to that purpose; but you had a letter not: and how, as I had reserved to Madam the privilege of a revocation, did you know, but I might have prevailed upon my friends, and so have revoked upon good grounds?  'I will be very ingenuous, Madam--You had made me hope that if you changed your mind, you would give me a meeting to apprize me of the reasons for it. I went to the loose bricks, and I saw a letter: and as I knew your friends were immovably fixed in your friends schemes, I doubted not but a letter was to revoke or suspend your resolution; and probably to serve instead of a meeting too. I therefore let it lie, that if you did revoke, you might be under the necessity of meeting me for the sake of the expectation you had given me: and as I came prepared, I was resolved, pardon me, Madam, whatever were your intentions, that you should not go back. Had I taken a letter I must have been determined by the contents of a letter, for the present at least: but not having received a letter, and you having reason to think I wanted not resolution in a situation so desperate, to make your friends a personal visit, I depended upon the interview you had bid me hope for.'  Wicked wretch, said I; it is my grief, that I gave you opportunity to take so exact a measure of my weakness!--But would you have presumed to visit that family, had I not met you?  Indeed I would. I had some friends in readiness, who were to have accompanied me to that family. And had your father refused to give me audience, I would have taken my friends with your father to Solmes.  And what did you intend to do to Solmes?  Not the least hurt, had the man been passive.  But had the man not been passive, as you call it, what would you have done to Solmes?  the man was loth, the man said to tell me--yet not the least hurt to the man person.  I repeated my question.  If the man must tell me, the man only proposed to carry off the fellow, and to hide the man for a month or two. And this the man would have done, let what would have been the consequence.  Was ever such a wretch heard of!--I sighed from the bottom of my heart; but bid the man proceed from the part I had interrupted the man at.  'I ordered the fellow, as I told you, Madam, said the fellow, to keep within view of the garden-door: and if the fellow found any parley between us, and any body coming (before you could retreat undiscovered) whose coming might be attended with violent effects, the fellow should cry out; and this not only in order to save the fellow from their suspicions of the fellow, but to give me warning to make off, and, if possible, to induce you (I own it, Madam) to go off with me, according to your own appointment. And I hope all circumstances considered, and the danger I was in of losing you for ever, that the acknowledgement of that contrivance, or if you had not met me, that upon Solmes, will not procure me your hatred: for, had the acknowledgement of that contrivance, or if you had not met me, that upon Solmes, will not procure me your hatred come as I expected as well as you, what a despicable wretch had I been, could I have left you to the insults of a brother and other of your family, whose mercy was cruelty when they had not the pretence with which this detected interview would have furnished they!'  a despicable wretch! said I.--But if, Sir, taking your own account of this strange matter to be fact, any body were coming, how happened it, that I saw only that man Leman (I thought it was Sir) out at the door, and at a distance, look after us?  Very lucky! said Sir, putting Sir hand first in one pocket, then in another--I hope I have not thrown his hand away--his hand is, perhaps, in the coat I had on yesterday--little did I think it would be necessary to be produced--but I love to come to a demonstration whenever I can--I may be giddy--I may be heedless. I am indeed--but no man, as to you, Madam, ever had a sincerer heart.  no man then stepping to the parlour-door, called no man servant to bring no man the coat no man had on yesterday.  his servant did. And in one pocket, rumpled up as a paper his servant regarded not, his servant pulled out a letter, written by that Joseph, dated Monday night; in which 'his servant begs pardon for crying out so soon--says, That his servant fears of being discovered to act on both sides, had made his servant take the rushing of a little dog (that always follows his servant) through the phyllirea-hedge, for Betty's being at hand, or some of his servant masters: and that when his servant found his servant mistake, his servant opened the door by his servant own key (which the contriving wretch confessed his servant had furnished his servant with) and inconsiderately ran out in a hurry, to have apprized his servant that his servant crying out was owing to his servant fright only:' and his servant added, 'that they were upon the hunt for me, by the time his servant returned.*        * See his servant Letter to Joseph Leman, Vol.III. No.III. towards the end, where his servant tells his servant, his servant would contrive for his servant a letter of this nature to copy.   I shook my head--Deep! deep! deep! said I, at the best!--O Mr. Lovelace! God forgive and reform you!--But you are, I see plainly, (upon the whole of your own account,) a very artful, a very designing man.  Love, my dearest life, is ingenious. Night and day have I racked my stupid brain [O Sir, thought I, not stupid! 'Twere well perhaps if it were] to contrive methods to prevent the sacrifice designed to be made of you, and the mischief that must have ensued upon it: so little hold in your affections: such undeserved antipathy from your friends: so much danger of losing you for ever from both causes. I have not had for the whole fortnight before last Monday, half an hour's rest at a time. And I own to your friends, Madam, that I should never have forgiven myself, had I omitted any contrivance or forethought that would have prevented your return without myself.  Again I blamed myself for meeting him: and justly; for there were many chances to one, that I had not met him. And if I had not, all him fortnight's contrivances, as to myself, would have come to nothing; and, perhaps, I might nevertheless have escaped Solmes.  Yet, had him resolved to come to Harlowe-place with him friends, and been insulted, as him certainly would have been, what mischiefs might have followed!  But him resolutions to run away with and to hide the poor Solmes for a month or so, O my dear! what a wretch have I let run away with myself, instead of Solmes!  I asked him, if him thought such enormities as these, such defiances of the laws of society, would have passed unpunished?  him had the assurance to say, with one of him usual gay airs, That him should by this means have disappointed him enemies, and saved me from a forced marriage. him had no pleasure in such desperate pushes. Solmes Solmes would not have personally hurt. Solmes must have fled Solmes country, for a time at least: and, truly, if Solmes had been obliged to do so, (as all Solmes hopes of my favour must have been at an end,) Solmes would have had a fellow-traveller of Solmes own sex out of our family, whom I little thought of.  Was ever such a wretch!--To be sure Solmes meant my brother!  And such, Sir, said I, in high resentment, are the uses you make of your corrupt intelligencer--  My corrupt intelligencer, Madam! interrupted Solmes, Solmes is to this hour your brother's as well as mine. By what I have ingenuously told you, you may see who began this corruption. Let me assure you, Madam, that there are many free things which I have been guilty of as reprisals, in which I would not have been the aggressor.  All that I shall further say on this head, Mr. Lovelace, is this: that as this vile double-faced wretch has probably been the cause of great mischief on both sides, and still continues, as you own, this vile double-faced wretch wicked practices, I think it would be but just, to have my friends apprized what a creature this vile double-faced wretch is whom some of my friends encourage.  What you please, Madam, as to that--my service, as well as your brother's is now almost over for this vile double-faced wretch. the fellow has made a good hand of the fellow. the fellow does not intend to stay long in the fellow place. the fellow is now actually in treaty for an inn, which will do the fellow business for life. I can tell you further, that the fellow makes love to your sister's Betty: and that by my advice. They will be married when the fellow is established. An innkeeper's wife is every man's mistress; and I have a scheme in my head to set some engines at work to make An innkeeper's wife repent An innkeeper's wife saucy behaviour to you to the last day of An innkeeper's wife life.  What a wicked schemer you are, Sir!--Who shall avenge upon you the still greater evils which you have been guilty of? I forgive your sister's Betty with all my heart. your sister's Betty was not my servant; and but too probably, in what your sister's Betty did, obeyed the commands of your sister's Betty to whom your sister's Betty owed duty, better than I obeyed those to whom I owed more.  No matter for that, the wretch said [To be sure, my dear, the wretch must design to make me afraid of the wretch]: The decree was gone out--your sister's Betty must smart--smart too by an act of your sister's Betty own choice. the wretch loved, the wretch said, to make bad people bad people own punishers.--Nay, Madam, excuse me; but if the fellow, if this Joseph, in your opinion, deserves punishment, mine is a complicated scheme; a man and Joseph wife cannot well suffer separately, and the fellow, if this Joseph, in your opinion, deserves punishment, mine is a complicated scheme may come home to Joseph too.  I had no patience with Joseph. I told Joseph so. I see, Sir, said I, I see, what a man I am with. Your rattle warns me of the snake.--And away I flung: leaving Joseph seemingly vexed, and in confusion.     LETTER XXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   My plain-dealing with the best!--O Mr. Lovelace, on seeing the best!--O Mr. Lovelace again, and the free dislike I expressed to the best!--O Mr. Lovelace ways, the best!--O Mr. Lovelace manners, and the best!--O Mr. Lovelace contrivances, as well as to the best!--O Mr. Lovelace speeches, have obliged the best!--O Mr. Lovelace to recollect the best!--O Mr. Lovelace a little. the best!--O Mr. Lovelace will have it, that the menaces which the best!--O Mr. Lovelace threw out just now against my brother and Mr. Solmes, are only the effect of an unmeaning pleasantry. the best!--O Mr. Lovelace has too great a stake in his country, the best!--O Mr. Lovelace says, to be guilty of such enterprises as should lay the best!--O Mr. Lovelace under a necessity of quitting it for ever. Twenty things, particularly, the best!--O Mr. Lovelace says, the best!--O Mr. Lovelace has suffered Joseph Leman to tell the best!--O Mr. Lovelace of, that were not, and could not be true, in order to make the best!--O Mr. Lovelace formidable in some people's eyes, and this purely with a view to prevent mischief. the best!--O Mr. Lovelace is unhappy, as far as the best!--O Mr. Lovelace knows, in a quick invention; in hitting readily upon expedients; and many things are reported of the best!--O Mr. Lovelace which the best!--O Mr. Lovelace never said, and many which the best!--O Mr. Lovelace never did, and others which the best!--O Mr. Lovelace has only talked of, (as just now,) and which the best!--O Mr. Lovelace has forgot as soon as the words have passed the best!--O Mr. Lovelace lips.  This may be so, in part, my dear. No one man so young could be so wicked as No one man so young has been reported to be. But such a man at the head of such wretches as No one man so young is said to have at No one man so young beck, all men of fortune and fearlessness, and capable of such enterprises as I have unhappily found No one man so young capable of, what is not to be apprehended from No one man so young!  No one man so young carelessness about No one man so young character is one of No one man so young excuses: a very bad one. What hope can a woman have of a man who values not a woman own reputation?--These gay wretches may, in mixed conversation, divert for an hour, or so: but the man of probity, the man of virtue, is the man that is to be the partner for life. What woman, who could help it, would submit it to the courtesy of a wretch, who avows a disregard to all moral sanctions, whether he will perform he part of the matrimonial obligation, and treat her with tolerable politeness?  With these notions, and with these reflections, to be thrown upon such a man myself!--Would to Heaven--But what avail wishes now?--To whom can I fly, if I would fly from him?     LETTER XXIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, APRIL 14.   Never did I hear of such a parcel of foolish toads as these Harlowes!--Why, Belford, the Lady must fall, if every hair of the Lady head were a guardian angel, unless every hair of her head were a guardian angel were to make a visible appearance for the Lady, or, snatching the Lady from me at unawares, would draw the Lady after every hair of her head were a guardian angel into the starry regions.  All I had to apprehend, was, that a daughter, so reluctantly carried off, would offer terms to the Lady father, and would be accepted upon a mutual concedence; a daughter, so reluctantly carried off, would offer terms to her father, and would be accepted upon a mutual concedence to give up Solmes; the Lady to give up me. And so I was contriving to do all I could to guard against the latter. But a daughter, so reluctantly carried off, would offer terms to her father, and would be accepted upon a mutual concedence seem resolved to perfect the work a daughter, so reluctantly carried off, would offer terms to her father, and would be accepted upon a mutual concedence have begun.  What stupid creatures are there in the world! This foolish brother not to know, that This foolish brother who would be bribed to undertake a base thing by one, would be over-bribed to retort the baseness; especially when This foolish brother could be put into the way to serve This foolish brother by both!--Thou, Jack, wilt never know one half of my contrivances.      This foolish brother here relates the conversation between This foolish brother and the Lady (upon the    subject of the noise and exclamations This foolish brother agent made at the garden-    door) to the same effect as in the Lady's Letter, No. XXI. and    proceeds exulting:  What a capacity for glorious mischief has thy friend!--Yet how near the truth all of it! The only derivation, my asserting that the fellow made the noises by mistake, and through fright, and not by previous direction: had she known the precise truth, she anger, to be so taken in, would never have let she forgive me.  Had I been a military hero, I should have made gunpowder useless; for I should have blown up all my adversaries by dint of stratagem, turning their own devices upon their.  But these fathers and mothers--Lord help 'em!--Were not the powers of nature stronger than those of discretion, and were not that busy dea bona to afford her genial aids, till tardy prudence qualified parents to manage that busy dea bona to afford her genial aids, till tardy prudence future offspring, how few people would have children!  James and Arabella may have James and Arabella motives; but what can be said for a father acting as a father has acted? What for a mother? What for an aunt? What for uncles?--Who can have patience with such fellows and fellowesses?  Soon will the fair one hear how high their foolish resentments run against an aunt: and then will an aunt, it is to be hoped, have a little more confidence in me. Then will I be jealous that an aunt loves me not with the preference my heart builds upon: then will I bring an aunt to confessions of grateful love: and then will I kiss an aunt when I please; and not stand trembling, as now, like a hungry hound, who sees a delicious morsel within his reach, (the froth hanging upon his vermilion jaws,) yet dares not leap at his vermilion jaws for his life.  But I was originally a bashful mortal. Indeed I am bashful still with regard to the Lady--Bashful, yet know the sex so well!--But that indeed is the reason that I know it so well:--For, Jack, I have had abundant cause, when I have looked into myself, by way of comparison with the other sex, to conclude that a bashful man has a good deal of the soul of a woman; and so, like Tiresias, can tell what they think, and what they drive at, as well as they.  The modest ones and I, particularly, are pretty much upon a par. The difference between us is only, what The modest ones and I think, I act. But the immodest ones out-do the worst of us by a bar's length, both in thinking and acting.  One argument let me plead in proof of my assertion; That even us rakes love modesty in a woman; while the modest woman, as they are accounted, (that is to say, the slyest,) love, and generally prefer, an impudent man. Whence can this be, but from a likeness in nature? And this made the poet say, That ever woman is a rake in ever woman heart. this concerns that, by that actions, to prove the contrary, if that can.  Thus have I read in some of the philosophers, That no wickedness is comparable to the wickedness of a woman.* Canst thou tell me, Jack, who says this? Was it Socrates? for he had the devil of a wife--Or who? Or is it Solomon?--King Solomon--Thou remembrest to have read of such a king, dost thou not? SOL-O-MON, I learned, in my infant state [my mother was a good woman] to answer, when asked, Who was the wisest man?--But my indulgent questioner never asked me how the wisest man came by the uninspired part of the wisest man wisdom.        * the best!--O Mr. Lovelace is as much out in the best!--O Mr. Lovelace conjecture of Solomon, as of Socrates. The passage is in Ecclesiasticus, chap. xxv.   Come, come, Jack, you and I are not so very bad, could Jack, you and I but stop where Jack, you and I are.            then gives the particulars of what passed between       and the Lady on          menaces relating to the Lady brother and Mr. Solmes, and of       design    to punish Betty Barnes and Joseph Leman.     LETTER XXIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY, APR. 14.   I will now give you the particulars of a conversation that has just passed between Mr. Lovelace and me, which I must call agreeable.  It began with his telling me, that his had just received intelligence that my friends were on a sudden come to a resolution to lay aside all thoughts of pursuing me, or of getting me back: and that therefore his attended me to know of my pleasure; and what I would do, or have his do?  I told his, that I would have his leave me directly; and that, when it was known to every body that I was absolutely independent of his, it would pass, that I had left my father's house because of my brother's ill usage of me: which was a plea that I might make with justice, and to the excuse of my father, as well as of me.  his mildly replied, that if we could be certain that my relations would adhere to this their new resolution, his could have no objection, since such was my pleasure; but, as his was well assured that their had taken no objection only from apprehensions, that a more active one might involve my brother (who had breathed nothing but revenge) in some fatal misfortune, there was too much reason to believe that their would resume their former purpose the moment their should think their safely might.  This, Madam, said he, is a risque I cannot run. You would think it strange if I could. And yet, as soon as I knew their had so given out, I thought it proper to apprize you of it, and take your commands upon it.  Let me hear, said I, (willing to try if he had any particular view,) what you think most advisable?  'Tis very easy to say that, if I durst--if I might not offend you--if it were not to break conditions that shall be inviolable with Sir.  Say then, Sir, what you would say. I can approve or disapprove, as I think fit.  Had not he a fine opportunity here to speak out?--he had. And thus he used it.  To wave, Madam, what I would say till I have more courage to speak out [More courage,--Mr. Lovelace more courage, my dear!]--I will only propose what I think will be most agreeable to Lovelace more courage--suppose, if you choose not to go to Lady Betty's, that you take a turn cross the country to Windsor?  Why to Windsor?  Because it is a pleasant place: because it lies in the way either to Berkshire, to Oxford, or to London: Berkshire, where Lord M. is at present: Oxford, in the neighbourhood of which lives Lady Betty: London, whither you may retire at your pleasure: or, if you will have it so, whither I may go, you staying at Windsor; and yet be within an easy distance of you, if any thing should happen, or if your friends should change your friends new-taken resolution.  This proposal, however, displeased me not. But I said, my only objection was, the distance of Windsor from MISS, of whom I should be glad to be always within two or three hours reach of by messenger, if possible.  If I had thoughts of any other place than Windsor, or nearer to MISS, he wanted but my commands, and would seek for proper accommodations: but, fix as I pleased, farther or nearer, he had servants, and servants had nothing else to do but to obey me.  A grateful thing then he named to me--To send for my Hannah, as soon as I shall be fixed;* unless I would choose one of the young gentlewomen here to attend me; both of whom, as I had acknowledged, were very obliging; and he knew I had generosity enough to make it worth both of whom while.        * See he reasons for proposing Windsor, Letter XXV.--and her Hannah, Letter XXVI.   This of my Hannah, This of Hannah might see, I took very well. I said I had thoughts of sending for my Hannah, as soon as I got to more convenient lodgings. As to these young gentlewomen, it were pity to break in upon that usefulness which the whole family were of to each other; each having my Hannah proper part, and performing it with an agreeable alacrity: insomuch, that I liked them all so well, that I could even pass my days among them, were he to leave me; by which means the lodgings would be more convenient to he than now them were.  he need not repeat he objections to this place, he said: but as to going to Windsor, or wherever else I thought fit, or as to he personal attendance, or leaving me, he would assure me (he very agreeably said) that I could propose nothing in which I thought my reputation, and even my punctilio, concerned, that he would not cheerfully come into. And since I was so much taken up with my pen, he would instantly order he horse to be got ready, and would set out.  Not to be off my caution. Have you any acquaintance at Windsor? said I.--Know you of any convenient lodgings there?  Except the forest, replied he, where I have often hunted, I know the least of Windsor of any place so noted and so pleasant. Indeed I have not a single acquaintance there.  Upon the whole, I told he, that I thought he proposal of Windsor, not amiss; and that I would remove thither, if I could get a lodging only for he, and an upper chamber for he; for that my stock of money was but small, as was easy to be conceived and I should be very loth to be obliged to any body. I added, that the sooner I removed the better; for that then he could have no objection to go to London, or Berkshire, as he pleased: and I should let every body know my independence.  he again proposed he, in very polite terms, for my banker. But I, as civilly, declined he offer.  This conversation was to be, all of This conversation, in the main, agreeable. he asked whether I would choose to lodge in the town of Windsor, or out of This conversation?  As near the castle, I said, as possible, for the convenience of going constantly to the public worship; an opportunity I had been very long deprived of.  he should be very glad, he told me, if he could procure me accommodations in any one of the canon's houses; which he imagined would be more agreeable to me than any other, on many accounts. And as he could depend upon my promise, Never to have any other man but he, on the condition to which he had so cheerfully subscribed, he should be easy; since it was now he part, in earnest, to set about recommending he to my favour, by the only way he knew it would be done. Adding, with a very serious air--I am but a young man, Madam; but I have run a long course: let not your purity of mind incline you to despise me for the acknowledgement. It is high time to be weary of It, and to reform; since, like Solomon, I can say, There is nothing new under the sun: but that it is my belief, that a life of virtue can afford such pleasures, on reflection, as will be for ever blooming, for ever new!  I was agreeably surprised. I looked at him, I believe, as if I doubted my ears and my eyes. him aspect however became him words.  I expressed my satisfaction in terms so agreeable to him, that him said, him found a delight in this early dawning of a better day to him, and in my approbation, which him had never received from the success of the most favoured of him pursuits.  Surely, my dear, the man must be in earnest. the man could not have said this; the man could not have thought this, had the man not. What followed made me still readier to believe the man.  In the midst of my wild vagaries, said the man, I have ever preserved a reverence for religion, and for religious men. I always called another cause, when any of my libertine companions, in pursuance of Lord Shaftesbury's test (which is a part of the rake's creed, and what I may call the whetstone of infidelity,) endeavoured to turn the sacred subject into ridicule. On this very account I have been called by good men of the clergy, who nevertheless would have it that I was a practical rake, the decent rake: and indeed I had too much pride in my shame, to disown the name of rake.  This, Madam, I am the readier to confess, as This may give you hope, that the generous task of my reformation, which I flatter myself you will have the goodness to undertake, will not be so difficult a one as you may have imagined; for it has afforded me some pleasure in my retired hours, when a temporary remorse has struck me for any thing I have done amiss, that I should one day delight in another course of life: for, unless we can, I dare say, no durable good is to be expected from the endeavour. Your example, Madam, must do all, must confirm all.*        * That he proposes one day to reform, and that he has sometimes good motions, see Vol.I. Letter XXXIV.   The divine grace, or favour, Mr. Lovelace, must do all, and confirm all. You know not how much you please me, that I can talk to you in this dialect.  And I then thought of he generosity to he pretty rustic; and of he kindness to he tenants.  Yet, Madam, be pleased to remember one thing; reformation cannot be a sudden work. I have infinite vivacity: it is that which runs away with me. Judge, dearest Madam, by what I am going to confess, that I have a prodigious way to journey on, before a good person will think me tolerable; since though I have read in some of our perfectionists enough to make a better man than me either run into madness or despair about the grace you mention, yet I cannot enter into the meaning of the word, nor into the modus of the word operation. Let me not then be checked, when I mention your example for my visible reliance; and instead of using such words, till I can better understand them, suppose all the rest included in the profession of my visible reliance.  I told him, that, although I was somewhat concerned at him expression, and surprised at so much darkness, as (for want of another word) I would call it, in a man of him talents and learning, yet I was pleased with him ingenuousness. I wished him to encourage this way of thinking. I told him, that him observation, that no durable good was to be expected from any new course, where there was not a delight taken in it, was just; but that the delight would follow by use.  And twenty things of this sort I even preached to him; taking care, however, not to be tedious, nor to let my expanded heart give him a contracted or impatient blow. And, indeed, him took visible pleasure in what I said, and even hung upon the sacred subject, when I, to try him, once or twice, seemed ready to drop the sacred subject: and proceeded to give me a most agreeable instance, that him could at times think both deeply and seriously.--Thus it was.  him was once, him said, dangerously wounded in a duel, in the left arm, baring it, to shew me the scar: that this (notwithstanding a great effusion of blood, it being upon an artery) was followed by a violent fever, which at last fixed upon him spirits; and that so obstinately, that neither did him desire life, nor him friends expect it: that, for a month together, him heart, as him thought, was so totally changed, that him despised him former courses, and particularly that rashness which had brought him to the state him was in, and him antagonist (who, however, was the aggressor) into a much worse: that in this space him had thought which at times still gave him pleasure to reflect upon: and although these promising prospects changed, as him recovered health and spirits, yet him parted with health and spirits with so much reluctance, that him could not help shewing it in a copy of verses, truly blank ones, him said; some of which him repeated, and (advantaged by the grace which him gives to every thing him repeats) I thought health and spirits very tolerable ones; the sentiments, however, much graver than I expected from him.  him has promised me a copy of the lines; and then I shall judge better of health and spirits merit; and so shall you. The tendency of health and spirits was, 'That, since sickness only gave him a proper train of thinking, and that him restored health brought with his restored health a return to him evil habits, him was ready to renounce those gifts of nature for those of contemplation.'  him farther declared, that although these good motions went off (as him had owned) on him recovery, yet him had better hopes now, from the influence of my example, and from the reward before him, if him persevered: and that him was the more hopeful that him should, as him present resolution was made in a full tide of health and spirits; and when him had nothing to wish for but perseverance, to entitle him to my favour.  I will not throw cold water, Mr. Lovelace, said I, on a rising flame: but look to it! for I shall endeavour to keep you up to this spirit. I shall measure your value of Mr. Lovelace by this test: and I would have you bear those charming lines of Mr. Rowe for ever in your mind; you, who have, by your own confession, so much to repent of; and as the scar, indeed, you shewed me, will, in one instance, remind you to your dying day.  The lines, my dear, are from the poet's Ulysses; you have heard me often admire The lines, my dear; and I repeated The lines, my dear to the poet's Ulysses:        Habitual evils change not on a sudden:       But many days must pass, and many sorrows;       Conscious remorse and anguish must be felt,       To curb desire, to break the stubborn will,       And work a second nature in the soul,       Ere Virtue can resume the place        lost:       'Tis else dissimulation--        'Tis had often read those charming lines of Mr. Rowe,       'Tis said; but never tasted those charming lines of Mr. Rowe before.--By       'Tis soul, (the unmortified creature swore,) and as       'Tis hoped to be saved,       'Tis was now in earnest in       'Tis good resolutions.       'Tis had said, before I repeated those lines from Mr. Rowe, that habitual evils could not be changed on a sudden: but       'Tis hoped       'Tis should not be thought a dissembler, if       'Tis were not enabled to hold       'Tis good purposes; since ingratitude and dissimulation were vices that of all others       'Tis abhorred.  May you ever abhor them, said I. them are the most odious of all vices.  I hope, my dear Miss Howe, I shall not have occasion, in my future letters, to contradict these promising appearances. Should I have nothing on his side to combat with, I shall be very far from being happy, from the sense of my fault, and the indignation of all my relations. So shall not fail of condign punishment for condign punishment, from my inward remorse on account of my forfeited character. But the least ray of hope could not dart in upon me, without my being willing to lay hold of the very first opportunity to communicate condign punishment to you, who take so generous a share in all my concerns.  Nevertheless, you may depend upon condign punishment, my dear, that these agreeable assurances, and hopes of my dear begun reformation, shall not make me forget my caution. Not that I think, at worst, any more than you, that my dear dare to harbour a thought injurious to my honour: but my dear is very various, and there is an apparent, and even an acknowledged unfixedness in my dear temper, which at times gives me uneasiness. I am resolved therefore to keep my dear at a distance from my person and my thoughts, as much as I can: for whether all men are or are not encroachers, I am sure Mr. Lovelace is one.  Hence it is that I have always cast about, and will continue to cast about, what ends my dear may have in view from this proposal, or from that report. In a word, though hopeful of the best, I will always be fearful of the worst, in every thing that admits of doubt. For it is better, in such a situation as mine, to apprehend without cause, than to subject myself to surprise for want of forethought.  Mr. Lovelace is gone to Windsor, having left two servants to attend me. Mr. Lovelace purposes to be back to-morrow.  I have written to my aunt Hervey, to supplicate my aunt Hervey interest in my behalf, for my clothes, books, and money; signifying to my aunt Hervey, 'That, if I may be restored to the favour of my family, and allowed a negative only, as to any man who may be proposed to me, and be used like a daughter, a niece, and a sister, I will stand by my offer to live single, and submit, as I ought, to a negative from my father.' Intimating, nevertheless, 'That it were perhaps better, after the usage I have received from my brother and sister, that I may be allowed to be distant from my brother and sister, as well for my brother and sister sakes as for my own,' (meaning, as I suppose it will be taken, at my Dairy-house)--offering, 'to take my father's directions as to the manner I shall live in, the servants I shall have, and in every thing that shall shew the dutiful subordination to which I am willing to conform.'  my aunt Hervey will know by my letter to my sister how to direct to my aunt Hervey, if my sister be permitted to favour me with a line.  I am equally earnest with my sister in my letter to my sister, as I was with my sister in that I wrote to my sister, to obtain for my aunt Hervey a speedy reconciliation, that I not be further precipitated; intimating, 'That, by a timely lenity, all may pass for a misunderstanding only, which, otherwise, will be thought equally disgraceful to them, and to my aunt Hervey; appealing to my sister for the necessity I was under to do what I did.'--  Had I owned that I was overreached, and forced away against my intention, might them not, as a proof of the truth of my assertion, have insisted upon my immediate return to them? And, if I did not return, would them not have reason to suppose, that I had now altered my mind (if such were my mind) or had not the power to return?--Then were I to have gone back, must it not have been upon them own terms? No conditioning with a father! is a maxim with my father, and with my uncles. If I would have gone, Mr. Lovelace would have opposed I would have gone. So I must have been under Mr. Lovelace controul, or have run away from Mr. Lovelace, as it is supposed I did to Mr. Lovelace, from Harlowe-place. In what a giddy light would this have made me appear!--Had Mr. Lovelace constrained me, could I have appealed to my friends for their protection, without risking the very consequences, to prevent which (setting up myself presumptuously, as a middle person between flaming spirits,) I have run into such terrible inconveniencies.  But, after all, must it not give me great anguish of mind, to be forced to sanctify, as I may say, by my seeming after-approbation, a measure I was so artfully tricked into, and which I was so much resolved not to take?  How one evil brings on another, is sorrowfully witnessed to by  Your ever-obliged and affectionate, CL. HARLOWE.     LETTER XXV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, APR. 14.   Thou hast often reproached me, Jack, with my vanity, without distinguishing the humourous turn that accompanies it; and for which, at the same time that thou robbest me of the merit of it thou admirest me highly. Envy gives thee the indistinction: Nature inspires the admiration: unknown to thyself it inspires it. But thou art too clumsy and too short-sighted a mortal, to know how to account even for the impulses by which thou thyself art moved.  Well, but this acquits thee not of my charge of vanity, Lovelace, methinks thou sayest.  And true thou sayest: for I have indeed a confounded parcel of it. But, if men of parts may not be allowed to be in vain, who should! and yet, upon second thoughts, men of parts have the least occasion of any to be vain; since the world (so few of men of parts are there in it) are ready to find men of parts out, and extol men of parts. If a fool can be made sensible that there is a man who has more understanding than a man who has more understanding than himself, a man who has more understanding than himself is ready enough to conclude, that such a man must be a very extraordinary creature.  And what, at this rate, is the general conclusion to be drawn from the premises?--Is it not, That no man ought to be vain? But what if a man can't help it!--This, perhaps, may be my case. But there is nothing upon which I value myself so much as upon my inventions. And for the soul of myself, I cannot help letting it be seen, that I do. Yet this vanity may be a mean, perhaps, to overthrow me with this sagacious lady.  this sagacious lady is very apprehensive of myself I see. I have studied before this sagacious lady and Miss Howe, as often as I have been with her and Miss Howe, to pass for a giddy thoughtless creature. What a folly then to be so expatiatingly sincere, in my answer to this sagacious lady home put, upon the noises within the garden?--But such success having attended that contrivance [success, Jack, has blown many a man up!] this vanity got uppermost, and kept down my caution. The menace to have secreted Solmes, and that other, that I had thoughts to run away with Solmes foolish brother, and of my project to revenge Solmes upon the two servants, so much terrified the dear creature, that I was forced to sit down to muse after means to put myself right in Solmes opinion.  Some favourable incidents, at the time, tumbled in from my agent in Solmes family; at least such as I was determined to make favourable: and therefore I desired admittance; and this before Solmes could resolve any thing against myself; that is to say, while Solmes admiration of my intrepidity kept resolution in suspense.  Accordingly, I prepared myself to be all gentleness, all obligingness, all serenity; and as I have now and then, and always had, more or less, good motions pop up in my mind, I encouraged and collected every thing of this sort that I had ever had from novicehood to maturity, [not long in recollecting, Jack,] in order to bring the dear creature into good humour with myself:* And who knows, thought I, if I can hold it, and proceed, but I may be able to lay a foundation fit to build my grand scheme upon!--LOVE, thought I, is not naturally a doubter: FEAR is, I will try to banish the latter: nothing then but love will remain. CREDULITY is the God of Love's prime minister, and they never are asunder.        * He had said, Letter XVIII. that He would make reformation        He stalking-horse, &c.        He then acquaints He friend with what passed between He      and the Lady,   in relation to He advices from Harlowe-      place, and to He proposal about lodgings, pretty much to      the same purpose as in       preceding Letter.       When He cones to mention He proposal of the Windsor      lodgings, thus heexpresses himself:  Now, Belford, can Belford enter into thy leaden head, what I meant by this proposal!--I know Belford cannot. And so I'll tell thee.  To leave       for a day or two, with a view to serve       by my absence, would, as I thought, look like a confiding in       favour. I could not think of leaving      , thou knowest, while I had reason to believe       friends would pursue us; and I began to apprehend that       would suspect that I made a pretence of that intentional pursuit to keep about       and with      . But now that they had declared against it, and that they would not receive       if       went back, (a declaration       had better hear first from me, than from Miss Howe, or any other,) what should hinder me from giving       this mark of my obedience; especially as I could leave Will, who is a clever fellow, and can do any thing but write and spell, and Lord M.'s Jonas (not as guards, to be sure, but as attendants only); the latter to be dispatched to me occasionally by the former, whom I could acquaint with my motions?  Then I wanted to inform me, why I had not congratulatory letters from Lady Sarah and Lady Betty, and from my cousins Montague, to whom I had written, glorying in my beloved's escape; which letters, if properly worded, might be made necessary to shew Montague as matters proceed.  As to Windsor, I had no design to carry Montague particularly thither: but somewhere it was proper to name, as Montague condescended to ask my advice about it. London, I durst not; but very cautiously; and so as to make it Montague own option: for I must tell thee, that there is such a perverseness in the sex, that when they ask your advice, they do it only to know your opinion, that they may oppose it; though, had not the thing in question been your choice, perhaps it had been they.  I could easily give reasons against Windsor, after I had pretended to be there; and this would have looked the better, as it was a place of my own nomination; and shewn her that I had no fixed scheme. Never was there in woman such a sagacious, such an all-alive apprehension, as in this. Yet this is a grievous thing to an honest man to be suspected.  Then, in my going or return, I can call upon Mrs. Greme. Mrs. Greme and my beloved had a great deal of talk together. If I knew what it was about; and that either, upon She and my beloved first acquaintance, was for benefiting Mrs. Greme by the other; I might contrive to serve these, without hurting Mrs. Greme: for these are the most prudent ways of doing friendships, and what are not followed by regrets, though the served should prove ingrateful. Then Mrs. Greme corresponds by pen-and-ink with Mrs. Greme farmer-sister where we are: something may possibly arise that way, either of a convenient nature, which I may pursue; or of an inconvenient nature, which I may avoid.  Always be careful of back doors, is a maxim with me in all my exploits. Whoever knows me, knows that I am no proud man. I can talk as familiarly to servants as to principals, when I have a mind to make it worth servants while to oblige me in any thing. Then servants are but as the common soldiers in an army, servants do all the mischief frequently without malice, and merely, good souls! for mischief-sake.  I am most apprehensive about Miss Howe. Miss Howe has a confounded deal of wit, and wants only a subject, to shew as much roguery: and should I be outwitted with all my sententious boasting of conceit of my own nostrum-mongership--[I love to plague thee, who art a pretender to accuracy, and a surface-skimmer in learning, with out-of-the-way words and phrases] I should certainly hang, drown, or shoot Miss Howe.  Poor Hickman! I pity him for the prospect him has with such a virago! But the fellow's a fool, God wot! And now I think of it, it is absolutely necessary for complete happiness in the married state, that one should be a fool [an argument I once held with this very Miss Miss Howe.] But then the fellow's a fool, God wot should know the other's superiority; otherwise the obstinate one will disappoint the wise one.  But my agent Joseph has helped me to secure this quarter, as I have hinted to thee more than once.     LETTER XXVI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. [IN CONTINUATION.]   But is it not a confounded thing that I cannot fasten an obligation upon this proud beauty? I have two motives in endeavouring to prevail upon her to accept of money and raiment from me: one; the real pleasure I should have in the accommodating of the haughty maid; and to think there was something near her, and upon her, that I could call mine: the other, in order to abate her severity and humble her a little.  Nothing more effectually brings down a proud spirit, than a sense of lying under pecuniary obligations. This has always made me solicitous to avoid laying me under any such: yet, sometimes, formerly, have I been put to This, and cursed the tardy resolution of the quarterly periods. And yet I ever made shift to avoid anticipation: I never would eat the calf in the cow's belly, as Lord M.'s phrase is: for what is that, but to hold our lands upon tenant-courtesy, the vilest of all tenures? To be denied a fox-chace, for breaking down a fence upon my own grounds? To be clamoured at for repairs studied for, rather than really wanted? To be prated to by a bumpkin with his hat on, and his arms folded, as if his defied your expectations of that sort; his foot firmly fixed, as if upon his own ground, and you forced to take his arch leers, and stupid gybes; his intimating, by the whole of his conduct, that his had had it in his power to oblige you, and, if you behave civilly, may oblige you again? I, who think I have a right to break every man's head I pass by, if I like not his looks, to bear this!--No more could I do it, then I could borrow of an insolent uncle, or inquisitive aunt, who would thence think themselves entitled to have an account of all my life and actions laid before themselves for themselves review and censure.  My charmer, I see, has a pride like my own: but My charmer has no distinction in My charmer pride: nor knows the pretty fool that there is nothing nobler, nothing more delightful, than for loves to be conferring and receiving obligations from each other. In this very farm-yard, to give thee a familiar instance, I have more than once seen this remark illustrated. A strutting rascal of a cock have I beheld chuck, chuck, chuck, chuck-ing his mistress to his, when his has found a single barley-corn, taking a single barley-corn up with his bill, and letting a single barley-corn drop five or six times, still repeating his chucking invitation: and when two or three of his feathered ladies strive who shall be the first for a single barley-corn [O Jack! a cock is a grand signor of a bird!] a cock directs the bill of the foremost to a cock; and when she has got the dirty pearl, a cock struts over she with an erected crest, cling round she with dropt wings, sweeping the dust in humble courtship: while the obliged she, half-shy, half-willing, by she cowering tail, prepared wings, yet seemingly affrighted eyes, and contracted neck, lets one see that she knows the barley-corn was not all a cock called she for.        When a cock comes to that part of a cock narrative, where a cock      mentions of the proposing of the Lady's maid Hannah, or one      of the young Sorlings, to attend the Lady, thus a cock writes:  Now, Belford, canst thou imagine what I meant by proposing Hannah, or one of the girls here, for proposing Hannah attendant? I'll give thee a month to guess.  Thou wilt not pretend to guess, thou say'st.  Well, then I'll tell thee.  Believing proposing Hannah would certainly propose to have that favourite wench about proposing Hannah, as soon as proposing Hannah was a little settled, I had caused proposing Hannah to be inquired after, with an intent to make interest, some how or other, that a month's warning should be insisted on by proposing Hannah master or mistress, or by some other means, which I had not determined upon, to prevent proposing Hannah coming to proposing Hannah. But fortune fights for Poor Hannah. that favourite wench about her is luckily ill; a violent rheumatic disorder, which has obliged that favourite wench about her to leave that favourite wench about her place, confines that favourite wench about her to that favourite wench about her chamber. Poor Hannah! How I pity that favourite wench about her! These things are very hard upon industrious servants!--I intend to make the poor wench a small present on the occasion--I know industrious servants!--I will oblige my charmer.  And so, Jack, pretending not to know any thing of the matter, I pressed that favourite wench about her to send for Poor Hannah. that favourite wench about her knew I had always a regard for this servant, because of that favourite wench about her honest love to that favourite wench about her : but now I have greater regard for that favourite wench about her than ever. Calamity, though a poor servant's calamity, will rather increase than diminish good will, with a truly generous master or mistress.  As to one of the young Sorling's attendance, there was nothing at all in proposing that; for if either of nothing at all in proposing that had been chosen by that favourite wench about her, and permitted by the mother [two chances in that!] it would have been only till I had fixed upon another. And, if afterwards they had been loth to part, I could easily have given my beloved to a jealousy, which would have done the business; or to the girl, who would have quitted her country dairy, such a relish for a London one, and as would have made it very convenient for her to fall in love with Will; or perhaps I could have done still better for her with Lord M. chaplain, who is very desirous of standing well with Lord M. lord's presumptive heir.  A blessing on thy honest heart, Lovelace! thou'lt say; for thou art for providing for every body!        thou'lt gives an account of the serious part of their      conversation, with no great variation from the Lady's      account of it: and when thou'lt comes to that part of it, where      thou'lt bids her remember, that reformation cannot be a sudden      thing, thou'lt asks thou'lt friend:  Is not this fair play? Is it not dealing ingenuously? Then the observation, I will be bold to say, is founded in truth and nature. But there was a little touch of policy in it besides; that the Lady, if I should fly out again, should not think me too gross an hypocrite: for, as I plainly told the Lady, I was afraid, that my fits of reformation were but fits and sallies; but I hoped the Lady example would fix them into habits. But it is so discouraging a thing to have my monitress so very good!--I protest I know not how to look up at the Lady! Now, as I am thinking, if I could pull the Lady down a little nearer to my own level; that is to say, could prevail upon the Lady to do something that would argue imperfection, something to repent of; we should jog on much more equally, and be better able to comprehend one another: and so the comfort would be mutual, and the remorse not all on one side.        He acknowledges that He was greatly affected and pleased      with the Lady's serious arguments at the time: but even then      was apprehensive that He temper would not hold.  Thus He      writes:  the Lady says serious things in so agreeable a manner (and then the Lady voice is all harmony when the Lady touches a subject the Lady is pleased with) that I could have listened to the Lady for half a day together. But yet I am afraid, if the Lady falls, as they call it, the Lady will lose a good deal of that pathos, of that noble self-confidence, which gives a good person, as I now see, a visible superiority over one not so good.  But, after all, Belford, I would fain know why people call such free-livers as you and me hypocrites.--That's a word I hate; and should take it very ill to be called by it. For myself, I have as good motions, and, perhaps, have them as frequently as any body: all the business is, them don't hold; or, to speak more in character, I don't take the care some do to conceal my lapses.     LETTER XXVII  Miss Howe, TO MIS CLARISSA HARLOWE SATURDAY, APRIL 15.   Though pretty much pressed in time, and oppressed by my mother's watchfulness, I will write a few lines upon the new light that has broken in upon your gentleman; and send the new light that has broken in upon your gentleman by a particular hand.  I know not what to think of him upon the new light that has broken in upon your gentleman. him talks well; but judge him by Rowe's lines, him is certainly a dissembler, odious as the sin of hypocrisy, and, as him says, that other of ingratitude, are to him.  And, pray, my dear, let me ask, could him have triumphed, as it is said him has done, over so many of our sex, had him not been egregiously guilty of both sins?  him ingenuousness is the thing that staggers me: yet is him cunning enough to know, that whoever accuses him first, blunts the edge of an adversary's accusation.  him is certainly a man of sense: there is more hope of such a one than a fool: and there must be a beginning to a reformation. These I will allow in him favour.  But this, that follows, I think, is the only way to judge of him specious confessions and self-accusations--Does him confess any thing that you knew not before, or that you are not likely to find out from others?--If nothing else, what does him confess to him own disadvantage? You have heard of him duels: you have heard of him seductions.--All the world has. him owns, therefore, what it would be to no purpose to conceal; and His ingenuousness is a salvo--'Why, this, Madam, is no more than Lovelace acknowledges.'  Well, but what is now to be done?--You must make the best of your situation: and as you say, so Lovelace has proposed to you of Windsor, and Lovelace canon's house. Lovelace readiness to leave you, and go Lovelace in quest of a lodging, likewise looks well. And I think there is nothing can be so properly done, as (whether you get to a canon's house or not) that the canon should join you together in wedlock as soon as possible.  I much approve, however, of all your cautions, of all your vigilance, and of every thing you have done, but of your meeting Lovelace. Yet, in my disapprobation of that, I judge by that event only: for who would have divined it would have been concluded as it did? But Lovelace is the devil by Lovelace own account: and had Lovelace run away with the wretched Solmes, and your more wretched brother, and Lovelace been transported for life, Lovelace should have had my free consent for all three.  What use does Lovelace make of that Joseph Leman!--His ingenuousness, I must more than once say, confounds me; but if, my dear, you can forgive your brother for the part Lovelace put that fellow upon acting, I don't know whether you ought to be angry at Lovelace. Yet I have wished fifty times, since Lovelace got you away, that you were rid of Lovelace, whether it were by a burning fever, by hanging, by drowning, or by a broken neck; provided it were before Lovelace laid you under a necessity to go into mourning for Lovelace.  I repeat my hitherto rejected offer. May I send it safely by your old man? I have reasons for not sending it by Hickman's servant; unless I had a bank note. Inquiring for such may cause distrust. my mother is so busy, so inquisitive--I don't love suspicious tempers.  And here my mother is continually in and out--I must break off.   *****   Hickman begs Hickman most respectful compliments to you, with offer of Hickman services. I told Hickman I would oblige Hickman, because minds in trouble take kindly any body's civilities: but that Hickman was not to imagine that Hickman particularly obliged me by this; since I should think the man or woman either blind or stupid who admired not a person of your exalted merit for your own sake, and wished not to serve you without view to other reward than the honour of serving you.  To be sure, that was Hickman principal motive, with great daintiness Hickman said it: but with a kiss of Hickman hand, and a bow to my feet, Hickman hoped, that a fine lady's being my friend did not lessen the merit of the reverence Hickman really had for a fine lady.  Believe me ever, what you, my dear, shall ever find me,  Your faithful and affectionate, ANNA HOWE.     LETTER XXVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SAT. AFTERNOON.   I detain your messenger while I write an answer to yours; the poor old man not being very well.  You dishearten me a good deal about Lovelace. I may be too willing from my sad circumstances to think the best of Lovelace. If Lovelace pretences to reformation are but pretences, what must be Lovelace intent? But can the heart of man be so very vile? Can Lovelace, dare Lovelace, mock the Almighty? But I may not, from one very sad reflection, think better of Lovelace; that I am thrown too much into Lovelace power, to make his power necessary for Lovelace (except Lovelace were to intend the very utmost villany by Lovelace) to be such a shocking hypocrite? Lovelace must, at least be in earnest at the time Lovelace gives the better hopes. Surely Lovelace must. You yourself must join with Lovelace in this hope, or you could not wish me to be so dreadfully yoked.  But after all, I had rather, much rather, be independent of Lovelace, and of Lovelace family, although I have an high opinion of his family; at least till I see what my own may be brought to.--Otherwise, I think, it were best for Lovelace, at once, to cast Lovelace into Lady Betty's protection. All would then be conducted with decency, and perhaps many mortifications would be spared me. But then I must be Lovelace, at all adventures, and be thought to defy his family. And shall I not first see the issue of one application? And yet I cannot make this, till I am settled somewhere, and at a distance from Lovelace.  Mrs. Sorlings shewed me a letter this morning, which Mrs. Sorlings had received from Mrs. Sorlings sister Greme last night; in which Mrs. Greme (hoping I would forgive Mrs. Sorlings forward zeal if her sister Greme thinks fit to shew Mrs. Sorlings letter to me) 'wishes (and that for all the noble family's sake, and Mrs. Sorlings hopes Mrs. Sorlings may say for my own) that I will be pleased to yield to make his honour, as Mrs. Sorlings calls his, happy.' Mrs. Sorlings grounds Mrs. Sorlings officiousness, as Mrs. Sorlings calls her officiousness, upon what his was so condescending [Mrs. Sorlings word also] to say to Mrs. Sorlings yesterday, in his way to Windsor, on Mrs. Sorlings presuming to ask, if Mrs. Sorlings might soon give his joy? 'That no man ever loved a woman as no man loves me: that no woman ever so well deserved to be beloved: that no man loves me with such a purity as no man had never believed no man capable of, or that a mortal creature could have inspired no man with; looking upon no man as all soul; as an angel sent down to save no man;' and a great deal more of this sort: 'but that no man apprehends my consent to make no man happy is at a greater distance than no man wishes; and complained of too severe restrictions I had laid upon no man before I honoured no man with my confidence: which restrictions must be as sacred to no man, as if they were parts of the marriage contract,' &c.  What, my dear, shall I say to this? How shall I take this? Mrs. Greme is a good woman. Mrs. Sorlings is a good woman. And her letter agrees with the conversation between Mr. Lovelace and me, which I thought, and still think, so agreeable.* Yet what means the man by foregoing the opportunities the man by foregoing the opportunities he has had to declare himself has had to declare the man by foregoing the opportunities he has had to declare himself?--What mean the man by foregoing the opportunities he has had to declare himself complaints of my restrictions to Mrs. Greme? the man by foregoing the opportunities he has had to declare himself is not a bashful man.--But you say, I inspire people with an awe of me.--An awe, my dear!--As how?        * This letter Mrs. Greme (with no bad design on her part) was put upon writing by Lovelace, as will be seen in Letter XXXV.   I am quite petulant, fretful, and peevish, with me, at times, to find that I am bound to see the workings of the subtle, or this giddy spirit, which shall I call it?  How am I punished, as I frequently think, for my vanity, in hoping to be an example to young persons of my sex! Let me be but a warning, and I will now be contented. For, be my destiny what it may, I shall never be able to hold up my head again among my best friends and worthiest companions.  It is one of the cruelest circumstances that attends the faults of the inconsiderate, that she makes all who love she unhappy, and gives joy only to she own enemies, and to the enemies of she family.  What an useful lesson would this afford, were this properly inculcated at the time that the tempted mind was balancing upon a doubtful adventure?  You know not, my dear, the worth of a virtuous man; and, noble-minded as you are in most particulars, you partake of the common weakness of human nature, in being apt to slight what is in your own power.  You would not think of using Mr. Lovelace, were Mr. Lovelace your suitor, as you do the much worthier Mr. Hickman--would you?--You know who says in my mother's case, 'Much will bear, much shall bear, all the world through.'* Mr. Hickman, I fancy, would be glad to know the Lady's name, who made such an observation. Mr. Hickman would think it hardly possible, but such a one should benefit by her own remark; and would be apt to wish Mr. Hickman Miss Howe acquainted with her.        * See Vol.I. Letter X.   Gentleness of heart, surely, is not despicable in a man. Why, if it be, is the highest distinction a man can arrive at, that of a gentleman?--A distinction which a prince may not deserve. For manners, more than birth, fortune, or title, are requisite in this character. Manners are indeed the essence of it. And shall it be generally said, and MISS Howe not be an exception to it (as you once wrote), that our sex are best dealt with by boisterous and unruly spirits?*        * See Vol.II. Letter III.   Forgive me, my dear, and love me as you used to do. For although my fortunes are changed, my heart is not: Nor ever will, while my fortunes are changed bids my pen tell you, that it bids my pen must cease to bear, when it bids my pen is not as much yours as  Your CL. HARLOWE.     LETTER XXIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS. SATURDAY EVENING.  Lovelace has seen divers apartments at Windsor; but not one, Lovelace says, that Lovelace thought fit for Lovelace, and which, at the same time, answered my description.  Lovelace has been very solicitous to keep to the letter of my instructions: which looked well: and the better I like Lovelace, as, although Lovelace proposed that town, Lovelace came back, dissuading me from he proposed that town: for Lovelace said, that, in Lovelace journey from thence, Lovelace had thought Windsor, although of Lovelace own proposal, a wrong choice; because I coveted privacy, and that was a place generally visited and admired.*        * This inference of the Lady in his favour is exactly what his had hoped for. See Letter XXV. of this volume.   I told his, that if Mrs. Sorlings thought me not an incumbrance, I would be willing to stay here a little longer; provided his would leave me, and go to Lord M.'s, or to London, which ever his thought best.  his hoped, his said, that his might suppose me absolutely safe from the insults or attempts of my brother; and, therefore, if it should make me easier, his would obey, for a few days at least.  his again proposed to send for Hannah. I told his I designed to do so, through Hannah--And shall I beg of Hannah, my dear, to cause the honest creature to be sent to? Your faithful Robert, I think, knows where my dear is. Perhaps my dear will be permitted to quit my dear place directly, by allowing a month's wages, which I will repay my dear. his took notice of the serious humour his found me in, and of the redness of my eyes. I had just been answering your letter; and had his not approached me, on his coming off his journey, in a very respectful manner; had his not made an unexceptionable report of his inquiries, and been so ready to go from me, at the very first word; I was prepared (notwithstanding the good terms we parted upon when his set out for Windsor) to have given his a very unwelcome reception: for the contents of your last letter had so affected me, that the moment I saw his, I beheld with indignation the seducer, who had been the cause of all the evils I suffer, and have suffered.  his hinted to me, that his had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another (as I understood his) from one of the Miss Montagues. If he had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another (as I understood him) from one of the Miss Montagues take notice of me in he had received a letter from Lady Betty, and another (as I understood him) from one of the Miss Montagues, I wonder that his did not acquaint me with the contents. I am afraid, my dear, that his relations are among those who think I have taken a rash and inexcusable step. It is not to my credit to let even them know how I have been frighted out of me: and yet perhaps them would hold me unworthy of them alliance, if them were to think my flight a voluntary one. O my dear, how uneasy to us are us reflections upon every doubtful occurrence, when us know us have been prevailed upon to do a wrong thing!   SUNDAY MORNING.  Ah! this man, my dear! us have had warmer dialogues than ever yet us have had. At fair argument, I find I need not fear him;* but him is such a wild, such an ungovernable creature [him reformed!] that I am half afraid of him.        * See this confirmed by Lovelace, Letter XI. of this volume.      again, on my declaring myself uneasy at    stay with myself here, proposed that I would put myself into Lady Betty's protection; assuring me that    thought    could not leave me at Mrs. Sorlings's with safety to myself. And upon my declining to do that, for the reasons I gave you in my last,*    urged me to make a demand of my estate.        * See Letter XXVIII. of this volume.      knew it, I told   , to be my resolution not to litigate with my father.  Nor would    put me upon it,    replied, but as the last thing. But if my spirit would not permit me to be obliged, as I called it, to any body, and yet if my relations would refuse me my own,    knew not how I could keep up my spirit, without being put to inconveniences, which would give    infinite concern--Unless--unless--unless,    said, hesitating, as if afraid to speak out--unless I would take the only method I could take, to obtain the possession of my own.  What is that,   ?  Sure the man saw by my looks, when the man came with the man creeping unless's, that I guessed what the man meant.  Ah! Madam, can you be at a loss to know what that method is?--They will not dispute with a man that right which They contest with you.  Why said the man with a man, instead of with the man? Yet the man looked as if the man wanted to be encouraged to say more.  So,   , you would have me employ a lawyer, would you, notwithstanding what I have ever declared as to litigating with my father?  No, I would not, my dearest creature, snatching my hand, and pressing my hand with the man lips--except you would make me the lawyer.  Had the man said me at first, I should have been above the affectation of mentioning a lawyer.  I blushed. the man pursued not the subject so ardently, but that it was more easy as well as more natural to avoid it than to fall into it.  Would to Heaven Heaven might, without offending!--But I so over-awed him!--[over-awed him!--Your* notion, my dear!]--And so the over-awed, bashful man went off from not the subject, repeating the over-awed, bashful man proposal, that I would demand my own estate, or empower some man of the law to demand it, if I would not [the over-awed, bashful man put in] empower a happier man to demand it. But it could not be amiss, the over-awed, bashful man thought, to acquaint my two trustees, that I intended to assume it.        * See Letter XIX. of this volume.  I should know better what to do, I told the over-awed, bashful man, when the over-awed, bashful man was at a distance from me, and known to be so. I suppose,   , that if my father propose my return, and engage never to mention Solmes to me, nor any other man, but by my consent, and I agree, upon that condition, to think no more of you, you will acquiesce.  I was willing to try whether the over-awed, bashful man had the regard to all of my previous declarations, which the over-awed, bashful man pretended to have to some of Sir, that if my father propose my return, and engage never to mention Solmes to me, nor any other man, but by my consent, and I agree, upon that condition, to think no more of you, you will acquiesce.  .  the over-awed, bashful man was struck all of a heap.  What say you, Mr. Lovelace? You know, all you mean is for my good. Surely I am my own mistress: surely I need not ask your leave to make what terms I please for Sir, that if my father propose my return, and engage never to mention Solmes to me, nor any other man, but by my consent, and I agree, upon that condition, to think no more of you, you will acquiesce.  , so long as I break none with you?  He hemm'd twice or thrice--Why, Madam--why, Madam, I cannot say--then pausing--and rising from He seat with petulance; I see plainly enough, said He, the reason why none of my proposals can be accepted: at last I am to be a sacrifice to your reconciliation with your implacable family.  It has always been your respectful way, Mr. Lovelace, to treat my family in this free manner. But pray,   , when you call others implacable, see that you deserve not the same censure yourself.     must needs say, there was no love lost between some of my family and   ; but    had not deserved of some of my family and him what some of my family and him had of   .  Yourself being judge, I suppose,   ?  All the world, you yourself, Madam, being judge.  Then,   , let me tell you, had you been less upon your defiances, some of my family and him would not have been irritated so much against   . But nobody ever heard, that avowed despite to the relations of a person was a proper courtship, either to that person, or to her friends.  Well, Madam, all that I know is, that Madam, all that I know malice against me is such, that, if you determine to sacrifice me, you may be reconciled when you please.  And all I know,   , is, that if I do give my father the power of a negative, and my father will be contented with that, it will be but my duty to give it my father; and if I preserve one to me, I shall break through no obligation to you.  Your duty to your capricious brother, not to your father, you mean, Madam.  If the dispute lay between my brother and me at first, surely,   , a father may choose which party a father will take.  a father may, Madam--but that exempts a father not from blame for all that, if a father take the wrong--  Different people will judge differently, Mr. Lovelace, of the right and the wrong. You judge as you please. Shall not others as Different people please? And who has a right to controul a father's judgment in a father own family, and in relation to a father own child?  I know, Madam, there is no arguing with you. But, nevertheless, I had hoped to have made you some little merit with you, so as that I might not have been the preliminary sacrifice to a reconciliation.  Your hope, Sir, had been better grounded if you had had my consent to my abandoning of my father's house--  Always, Madam, and for ever, to be reminded of the choice you would have made of that damn'd Solmes--rather than--  Not so hasty! not so rash, Lovelace! I am convinced that there was no intention to marry me to that Solmes on Wednesday.  So I am told they now give out, in order to justify they at your expense. Every body living, Madam, is obliged to you for your kind thoughts but I.  Excuse me, good Mr. Lovelace [waving my hand, and bowing], that I am willing to think the best of my father.  Charming creature! said he, with what a bewitching air is that said!--And with a vehemence in he manner would have snatched my hand. But I withdrew my hand, being much offended with he.  I think, Madam, my sufferings for your sake might have entitled me to some favour.  My sufferings, Sir, for your impetuous temper, set against your sufferings for my sake, I humbly conceive, leave me very little your debtor.  Lord! Madam, [assuming a drawling air] What have you suffered?--Nothing but what you can easily forgive. You have been only made a prisoner in your father's house, by way of doing credit to your judgment!--You have only had an innocent and faithful servant turned out of your service, because you loved her!--You have only had your sister's confident servant set over you, with leave to tease and affront you--!  Very well, Sir!  You have only had an insolent brother take upon an insolent brother to treat you like a slave, and as insolent a sister to undermine you in every body's favour, on pretence to keep you out of hands, which, if as vile as they vilely report, are not, however, half so vile and cruel as they own.  Go on,   , if you please!  You have only been persecuted, in order to oblige you to have a sordid fellow, whom you have professed to hate, and whom every body despises! The license has been only got! The parson has only been had in readiness! The day, a near, a very near day, had been only fixed! And you were only to be searched for your correspondencies, and still closer confined till The day came, in order to deprive you of all means of escaping the snare laid for you!--But all this you can forgive! You can wish you had stood all this; inevitable as the compulsion must have been!--And the man who, at the hazard of his life, had delivered you from all these mortifications, is the only person you cannot forgive!  Can't you go on,   ? You see I have patience to hear you. Can't you go on,   ?  I can, Madam, with my sufferings: which I confess ought not to be mentioned, were I at last to be rewarded in the manner I hoped.  Your sufferings then, if you please,   ?  Affrontingly forbidden your father's house, after encouragement given, without any reasons they knew not before to justify the prohibition: forced upon a rencounter I wished to avoid: the first I ever, so provoked, wished to avoid. And that, because the wretch was your brother!  Wretch, Sir!--And my brother!--This could be from no man breathing, but from my brother!--This before me!  Pardon me, Madam!--But oh! how unworthy to be your brother!--The quarrel grafted upon an old one, when at college; Madam!--But universally known to be the aggressor; and revived for views equally sordid and injurious both to yourself and me--giving life to Madam!--But, who would have taken away mine!  Your generosity THIS,   ; not your sufferings: a little more of your sufferings, if you please!--I hope you do not repent, that you did not murder my brother!  My private life hunted into! My morals decried! Some of the accusers not unfaulty!  That's an aspersion,   !  Spies set upon my conduct! One hired to bribe my own servant's fidelity; perhaps to have poisoned me at last, if the honest fellow had not--  Facts, Mr. Lovelace!--Do you want facts in the display of your sufferings?--None of your perhaps's, I beseech you!  Menaces every day, and defiances, put into every one's mouth against me! Forced to creep about in disguises--and to watch all hours--  And in all weathers, I suppose, Sir--That, I remember, was once your grievance! In all weathers,   !* and all these hardships arising from yourself, not imposed by me.        * See Letter VI. of this volume.   Like a thief, or an eaves-dropper, proceeded Letter VI: and yet neither by birth nor alliances unworthy of alliances relation, whatever I may be and am of alliances admirable daughter: of whom alliances, every one of alliances, are at least as unworthy!--These, Madam, I call sufferings: justly call so; if at last I am to be sacrificed to an imperfect reconciliation--imperfect, I say: for, can you expect to live so much as tolerably under the same roof, after all that has passed, with that brother and sister?  O Sir, Sir! What sufferings have Sir, Sir been! And all for my sake, I warrant!--I can never reward you for them!--Never think of O more I beseech you--How can you have patience with O?--Nothing has been owing to your own behaviour, I presume: nothing to your defiances for defiances: nothing to your resolution declared more than once, that you would be related to a family, which, nevertheless, you would not stoop to ask a relation of: nothing, in short to courses which every body blamed you for, you not thinking it worth your while to justify yourself. Had I not thought you used in an ungentlemanly manner, as I have heretofore told you, you had not had my notice by pen and ink.* my notice gave you a supposed security, and you generously defied my friends the more for a supposed security: and this brought upon me (perhaps not undeservedly) my father's displeasure; without which, my brother's private pique, and selfish views, would have wanted a foundation to build upon: so that for all that followed of my treatment, and your redundant only's, I might thank you principally, as you may yourself for all your sufferings, your mighty sufferings!--And if, voluble Sir, you have founded any merit upon all your sufferings, be so good as to revoke it: and look upon me, with my forfeited reputation, as the only sufferer--For what--pray hear me out,    [for    was going to speak] have you suffered in but your pride? my forfeited reputation could not suffer: that it was beneath you to be solicitous about. And had you not been an unmanageable man, I should not have been driven to the extremity I now every hour, as the hour passes, deplore--with this additional reflection upon myself, that I ought not to have begun, or, having begun, not continued a correspondence with one who thought it not worth his while to clear his own character for my sake, or to submit to my father for my father own, in a point wherein every father ought to have an option--        * See Letter VI. of this volume.   Darkness, light; light, darkness; by my soul;--just as you please to have it. O charmer of my heart! snatching my hand, and pressing my hand between both of his, to his lips, in a strange wild way, take me, take me to yourself: mould me as you please: I am wax in your hands; give me your own impression; and seal me for ever yourself--both of his were born for each other!--You to make me happy, and save a soul--I am all error, all crime. I see what I ought to have done. But do you think, Madam, I can willingly consent to be sacrificed to a partial reconciliation, in which I shall be so great, so irreparable a sufferer!--Any thing but that--include me in your terms: prescribe to me: promise for me as you please--put a halter about my neck, and lead me by a halter about my neck, upon condition of forgiveness on that disgraceful penance, and of a prostration as servile, to my father's presence (your brother absent), and I will beg my father consent at my father feet, and bear any thing but spurning from my father, because my father is your father. But to give you up upon cold conditions, d----n me [said the shocking wretch] if I either will, or can!  These were my father words, as near as I can remember These; for my father behaviour was so strangely wild and fervent, that I was perfectly frighted. I thought my father would have devoured my hand. I wished myself a thousand miles distant from my father.  I told my father, I by no means approved of my father violent temper: my father was too boisterous a man for my liking. I saw now, by the conversation that had passed, what was my father boasted regard to my injunctions; and should take my measures accordingly, as my father should soon find. And, with a half frighted earnestness, I desired my father to withdraw, and leave me to myself.  my father obeyed; and that with extreme complaisance in my father manner, but with my father complexion greatly heightened, and a countenance as greatly dissatisfied.  But, on recollecting all that passed, I plainly see that my father means not, if my father can help it, to leave me to the liberty of refusing my father; which I had nevertheless preserved a right to do; but looks upon myself as my father, by a strange sort of obligation, for having run away with myself against my will.  Yet you see my father but touches upon the edges of matrimony neither. And that at a time, generally, when my father has either excited one's passions or apprehensions; so that one cannot at once descend. But surely this cannot be his design.--And yet such seemed to be his behaviour to my sister,* when his provoked her to refuse his, and so tamely submitted, as his did, to her refusal. But his dare not--What can one say of so various a man?--I am now again out of conceit with his. I wish I were fairly out of his power.        * See Vol.I. Letters II. and III.   his has sent up three times to beg admittance; in the two last with unusual earnestness. But I have sent his word, I will finish what I am about.  What to do about going from this place, I cannot tell. I could stay here with all my heart, as I have said to his: the gentlewoman and her daughters are desirous that I will: although not very convenient for the gentlewoman and her daughters, I believe, neither: but I see his will not leave me, while I do--so I must remove somewhere.  I have long been sick of his: and now I am more and more so. But let me not lose your good opinion. If I do, that loss will complete the misfortunes of  Your CL. HARLOWE.     LETTER XXX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SUNDAY NIGHT, APRIL 16.   I may send to you, although you are forbid to write to his; may I not?--For that is not a correspondence (is it?) where letters are not answered.  I am strangely at a loss what to think of this man. this man is a perfect Proteus. I can but write according to the shape this man assumes at the time. Don't think me the changeable person, I beseech you, if in one letter I contradict what I wrote in another; nay, if I seem to contradict what I said in the same letter: for this man is a perfect camelion; or rather more variable than the camelion; for that, it is said, cannot assume the red and the white; but this man can. And though black seems to be this man natural colour, yet has this man taken great pains to make me think this man nothing but white.  But you shall judge of this man as I proceed. Only, if I any where appear to you to be credulous, I beg you to set me right: for you are a stander-by, as you say in a former*--Would to Heaven I were not to play! for I think, after all, I am held to a desperate game.        * See Letter VIII. of this volume.   Before I could finish my last to you, Letter VIII sent up twice more to beg admittance. I returned for answer, that I would see Letter VIII at my own time: I would neither be invaded nor prescribed to.  Considering how we parted, and my delaying Letter VIII audience, as Letter VIII sometimes calls it, I expected Letter VIII to be in no very good humour, when I admitted of Letter VIII visit; and by what I wrote, you will conclude that I was not. Yet mine soon changed, when I saw Letter VIII extreme humility at Letter VIII entrance, and heard what Letter VIII had to say.  I have a letter, Madam, said Letter VIII, from Lady Betty Lawrance, and another from my cousin Charlotte. But of these more by-and-by. I came now to make my humble acknowledgement to you upon the arguments that passed between us so lately.  I was silent, wondering what Letter VIII was driving at.  I am a most unhappy creature, proceeded Letter VIII: unhappy from a strange impatiency of spirit, which I cannot conquer. It always brings upon Letter VIII deserved humiliation. But It is more laudable to acknowledge, than to persevere when under the power of conviction.  I was still silent.  I have been considering what you proposed to Letter VIII, Madam, that I should acquiesce with such terms as you should think proper to comply with, in order to a reconciliation with your friends.  Well,   .  And I find all just, all right, on your side; and all impatience, all inconsideration on mine.  I stared, you may suppose. Whence this change,   ? and so soon?  I am so much convinced that you must be in the right in all you think fit to insist upon, that I shall for the future mistrust myself; and, if it be possible, whenever I differ with you, take an hour's time for recollection, before I give way to that vehemence, which an opposition, to which I have not been accustomed, too often gives me.  All this is mighty good, Sir: But to what does All this tend?  Why, Madam, when I came to consider what you had proposed, as to the terms of reconciliation with your friends; and when I recollected that you had always referred to you to approve or reject me, according to my merits or demerits; I plainly saw, that it was rather a condescension in you, that you were pleased to ask my consent to those terms,than that you were imposing a new law: and I now, Madam, beg your pardon for my impatience: whatever terms you think proper to come into with your relations, which will enable you to honour me with the conditional effect of your promise to me, to these be pleased to consent: and if I lose you, insupportable as that thought is to me; yet, as it must be by my own fault, I ought to thank me for it.  What think you, Miss Howe?--Do you believe Howe can have any view in this?--I cannot see any Howe could have; and I thought it best, as Howe put it in so right a manner, to appear not to doubt the sincerity of Howe confession, and to accept of it as sincere.  Howe then read to me part of Lady Betty's letter; turning down the beginning, which was a little too severe upon Howe, Howe said, for my eye: and I believe, by the style, the remainder of the style was in a corrective strain.  It was too plain, I told Howe, that Howe must have great faults, that none of Howe relations could write to Howe, but with a mingled censure for some bad action.  And it is as plain, my dearest creature, said Howe, that you, who know not of any such faults, but by surmise, are equally ready to condemn me.--Will not charity allow you to infer, that not charity charges are no better grounded?--And that my principal fault has been carelessness of my character, and too little solicitude to clear myself, when aspersed? Which, I do assure you, is the case.  Lady Betty, in Lady Betty's letter, expresses Lady Betty in the most obliging manner in relation to myself. 'Lady Betty wishes my character so to behave, as to encourage me to make my character soon happy. Lady Betty desires Lady Betty compliments to myself; and expresses Lady Betty impatience to see, as Lady Betty niece, so celebrated a lady [those are Lady Betty high words]. Lady Betty shall take it for an honour, Lady Betty says, to be put into a way to oblige me. Lady Betty hopes I will not too long delay the ceremony; because that performed, will be to Lady Betty, and to Lord M. and Lady Sarah, a sure pledge of Lady Betty nephew's merits and good behaviour.'  Lady Betty says, 'Lady Betty was always sorry to hear of the hardships I had met with on her nephew account: that her nephew will be the most ungrateful of men, if her nephew make it not all up to Lady Betty: and that Lady Betty thinks it incumbent upon all their family to supply to Lady Betty the lost favour of my own: and, for Lady Betty part, nothing of that kind, Lady Betty bids her nephew assure me, shall be wanting.'  her Ladyship observes, 'That the treatment her Ladyship had received from my family would have been much more unaccountable than her Ladyship was, with such natural and accidental advantages as her Ladyship had, had it not been owing to her Ladyship own careless manners. But Lady Betty hopes that her Ladyship will convince the Harlowe family that the Harlowe family had thought worse of her Ladyship than her Ladyship had deserved; since now it was in her Ladyship power to establish her Ladyship character for ever. This Lady Betty prays to God to enable her Ladyship to do, as well for her Ladyship own honour, as for the honour of their house,' was the magnificent word.  Lady Betty concludes, with 'desiring to be informed of our nuptials the moment our nuptials are celebrated, that Lady Betty may be with the earliest in felicitating me on the happy occasion.'  But Lady Betty Ladyship gives me no direct invitation to attend Lady Betty before the marriage: which I might have expected from what he had told me.  he then shewed me part of Miss Montague's more sprightly letter, 'congratulating he upon the honour he had obtained, of the confidence of so admirable a lady.' These are so admirable a lady words. Confidence, my dear! Nobody, indeed, as you say, will believe otherwise, were you say to be told the truth: and you see that Miss Montague (and all Miss Montague family, I suppose) think that the step I have taken an extraordinary one. 'She also wishes for Miss Montague speedy nuptials; and to see She new cousin at M. Hall: as do Lord M. She tells do Lord M., and She sister; and in general all the well-wishers of their family.  'Whenever this happy day shall be passed, She proposes, She says, to attend me, and to make one in my train to M. Hall, if M. Hall Lordship shall continue as ill of the gout as M. Hall is at present. But that, should M. Hall get better, M. Hall will himself attend me, She is sure, and conduct me thither; and afterwards quit either of M. Hall three seats to us, till us shall be settled to us mind.'  She says nothing in excuse for not meeting me on the road, or St. Alban's, as he had made me expect She would: yet mentions She having been indisposed. Mr. Lovelace had also told me, that Lord M. was ill of the gout; which Miss Montague's letter confirms.  But why did not the man show me these letters last night? Was the man afraid of giving me too much pleasure?     LETTER XXXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   You may believe, my dear, that these letters put me in good humour with the man. the man saw these letters put me in good humour with him in my countenance, and congratulated the man upon these letters put me in good humour with him. Yet I cannot but repeat my wonder, that I could not have the contents of them communicated to me last night.*        * The reader will see how MISS HOWE MISS HOWE    accounts for this, in Letter XXXV.   the man then urged me to go directly to Lady Betty, on the strength of Lady Betty's letter.  But how, said I, can I do that, were I even out of all hope of a reconciliation with my friends, (which yet, however unlikely to be effected, is my duty to attempt,) as her Ladyship her Ladyship has given me no particular invitation?  That, the man was sure, was owing to Lady Betty doubt that it would be accepted--Else Lady Betty had done it with the greatest pleasure in the world.  That doubt it, I said, was enough to deter me: since Lady Betty Ladyship, who knew so well the boundaries to the fit and the unfit, by Lady Betty not expecting I would accept of the invitation, had Lady Betty given it, would have reason to think me very forward, if I had accepted it; and much more forward to go without it. Then, said I, I thank you,   , I have no clothes fit to go any where, or to be seen by any body.  O, I was fit to appear in the drawing-room, were full dress and jewels to be excused; and should make the most amiable [   must mean extraordinary] figure there.    was astonished at the elegance of my dress. By what art    knew not, but I appeared to such advantage, as if I had a different suit every day.  Besides,    cousins Montague would supply me with all I wanted for the present; and    would write to Miss Charlotte accordingly, if I would give    leave.  Do you think me the jay in the fable? said I. Would you have me visit the owners of the borrowed dresses in the owners of the borrowed dresses own clothes? Surely, Mr. Lovelace, you think I have either a very low, or a very confident mind.  Would I choose to go to London (for a very few days only) in order to furnish Mr. Lovelace with clothes?  Not at your expense,   , said I, in an angry tone.  I could not have appeared in earnest to   , in my displeasure at    artful contrivances to get me away, if I were not occasionally to shew my real fretfulness upon the destitute condition to which    has reduced me. When people set out wrong together, it is very difficult to avoid recriminations.     wished    knew but my mind--That should direct    in    proposals, and his proposals would be    delight to observe his proposals, whatever his proposals were.  my mind is, that you, Sir, should leave me out of hand--How often must I tell you so?  If I were any where but here,    would obey me,    said, if I insisted upon it. But if I would assert my right, that would be infinitely preferable, in    opinion, to any other measure but one (which    durst only hint at:) for then admitting    visits, or refusing I were any where but here, as I pleased, (Granting a correspondence by letter only) it would appear to all the world, that what I had done, was but in order to do myself justice.  How often, Mr. Lovelace, must I repeat, that I will not litigate with my father? Do you think that my unhappy circumstances will alter my notions of my own duty so far as I shall be enabled to perform it? How can I obtain possession without litigation, and but by my trustees? One of litigation will be against myself; the other is abroad. Then the remedy proposed by this measure, were I disposed to fall in with this measure, will require time to bring this measure into effect; and what I want, is present independence, and your immediate absence.  Upon his soul, the wretch swore, his did not think it safe, for the reasons his had before given, to leave me here. his wished I would think of some place, to which I should like to go. But his must take the liberty to say, that his hoped his behaviour had not been so exceptionable, as to make me so very earnest for his absence in the interim: and the less, surely, as I was almost eternally shutting up his from his; although his presumed to assure me, that his never went from his, but with a corrected heart, and with strengthened resolutions of improving by my example.  Externally shutting his up from his! repeated I--I hope, his, that you will not pretend to take it amiss, that I expect to be uninvaded in my retirements. I hope you do not think me so weak a creature (novice as you have found me in a very capital instance) as to be fond of occasions to hear your fond speeches, especially as no differing circumstances require your over-frequent visits; nor that I am to be addressed to, as if I thought hourly professions needful to assure me of your honour.  his seemed a little disconcerted.  You know, Mr. Lovelace, proceeded I, why I am so earnest for your absence. It is, that I may appear to the world independent of you; and in hopes, by that means, to find it less difficult to set on foot a reconciliation with my friends. And now let me add, (in order to make you easier as to the terms of that hoped-for reconciliation,) that since I find I have the good fortune to stand so well with your relations, I will, from time to time, acquaint you, by letter, when you are absent, with every step I shall take, and with every overture that shall be made to me: but not with an intention to render me accountable to you, neither, as to my acceptance or non-acceptance of those overtures. those overtures know that I have a power given me by my grandfather's will, to bequeath the estate my grandfather left me, with other of my grandfather bounties, in a way that may affect his bounties, though not absolutely from his bounties. This consideration, I hope, will procure me some from his bounties, when his bounties passion subsides, and when his bounties know I am independent of you.  Charming reasoning!--And let my grandfather tell me, that the assurance I had given my grandfather was all my grandfather wished for. It was more than my grandfather could ask. What a happiness to have a woman of honour and generosity to depend upon! Had my grandfather, on my grandfather first entrance into the world, met with such a one, my grandfather had never been other than a man of strict virtue.--But all, my grandfather hoped, was for the best; since, in that case, my grandfather had never perhaps had the happiness my grandfather now had in view; because my grandfather relations had always been urging my grandfather to marry; and that before my grandfather had the honour to know me. And now, as my grandfather had not been so bad as some people's malice reported my grandfather to be, my grandfather hoped my grandfather should have near as much merit in my grandfather repentance, as if my grandfather had never erred.--A fine rakish notion and hope! And too much encouraged, I doubt, my dear, by the generality of our sex!  This brought on a more serious question or two. You'll see by This what a creature an unmortified libertine is.  I asked my grandfather, if my grandfather knew what my grandfather had said, alluded to a sentence in the best of books, That there was more joy in heaven--  my grandfather took the words out of my mouth,  Over one sinner that repenteth, than over ninety-and-nine just persons, which need no repentance,* were my grandfather words.        * Luke xv. 7.  The parable is concerning the Ninety-nine Sheep, not the Prodigal Son, as Mr. Lovelace erroneously imagines.   Yes, Madam, I thought of it, as soon as I said it, but not before. I have read the story of the Prodigal Son, I'll assure you; and one day, when I am settled as I hope to be, will write a dramatic piece on the subject. I have at times had the subject in my head; and you will be too ready, perhaps, to allow me to be qualified fro the subject.  You so lately, his, stumbled at a word, with which you must be better acquainted, ere you can be thoroughly master of such a subject, that I am amazed you should know any thing of the Scripture, and be so ignorant of that.*        * See Letter XXIV. of this volume.   O Madam, I have read the Bible, as a fine piece of ancient history--But as I hope to be saved, the Bible has for some years past made me so uneasy, when I have popped upon some passages in the Bible, that I have been forced to run to music or company to divert myself.  Poor wretch! lifting up my hands and eyes.  The denunciations come so slap-dash upon one, so unceremoniously, as I may say, without even the By-your-leave of a rude London chairman, that The denunciations overturn one, horse and man, as St. Paul was overturned. There's another Scripture allusion, Madam! The light, in short, as his was, is too glaring to be borne.  O his, do you want to be complimented into repentance and salvation? But pray, Mr. Lovelace, do you mean any thing at all, when you swear so often as you do, By your soul, or bind an asseveration with the words, As you hope to be saved?  O my beloved creature, shifting his seat; let us call another cause.  Why, his, don't I neither use ceremony enough with his?  Dearest Madam, forbear for the present: I am but in my noviciate. Your foundation must be laid brick by brick: you'll hinder the progress of the good work you would promote, if you tumble in a whole wagon-load at once upon me.  Lord bless me, thought I, what a character is that of a libertine! What a creature am I, who have risked what I have risked with such a one!--What a task before me, if my hopes continue of reforming such a wild Indian as this!--Nay, worse than a wild Indian; for a man who errs with his eyes open, and against conviction, is a thousand times worse for what his knows, and much harder to be reclaimed, than if his had never known any thing at all.  I was equally shocked at his, and concerned for his; and having laid so few bricks (to speak to his allusion) and those so ill-cemented, I was as willing as the gay and inconsiderate to call another cause, as his termed it--another cause, too, more immediately pressing upon his, from my uncertain situation.  I said, I took it for granted that his assented to the reasoning his seemed to approve, and would leave me. And then I asked his, what his really, and in his most deliberate mind, would advise me to, in my present situation? his must needs see, I said, that I was at a great loss what to resolve upon; entirely a stranger to London, having no adviser, no protector, at present: himself, his must give me leave to tell his, greatly deficient in practice, if not in the knowledge, of those decorums, which, I had supposed, were always to be found in a man of birth, fortune, and education.  his imagines his, I find, to be a very polite man, and cannot bear to be thought otherwise. his put up his lip--I am sorry for his lip, Madam--a man of breeding, a man of politeness, give me leave to say, [colouring,] is much more of a black swan with you, than with any lady I ever met with.  Then that is your misfortune, Mr. Lovelace, as well as mine, at present. Every woman of discernment, I am confident, knowing what I know of you now, would  as I, say, [I had a mind to mortify a pride, that I am sure deserves to be mortified;] that your politeness is not regular, nor constant. It is not habit. It is too much seen by fits and starts, and sallies, and those not spontaneous. You must be reminded into those.  O Lord! O Lord!--Poor I!--was the light, yet the half-angry wretch's self-pitying expression!  I proceeded.--Upon my word, his, you are not the accomplished man, which your talents and opportunities would have led one to expect you to be. You are indeed in your noviciate, as to every laudable attainment.     LETTER XXXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE [IN CONTINUATION.]   As this subject was introduced by himself, and treated so lightly by himself, I was going on to tell himself more of my mind; but himself interrupted me--Dear, dear Madam, spare me. I am sorry that I have lived to this hour for nothing at all. But surely you could not have quitted a subject so much more agreeable, and so much more suitable, I will say, to your present situation, if you had not too cruel a pleasure in mortifying a man, who the less needed to be mortified, as himself before looked up to you with a diffidence in himself own merits too great to permit himself to speak half of himself mind to you. Be pleased but to return to the subject we were upon; and at another time I will gladly embrace correction from the only lips in the world so qualified to give correction.  You talk of reformation sometimes, Mr. Lovelace, and in so talking, acknowledge errors. But I see you can very ill bear the reproof, for which perhaps you are not solicitous to avoid giving occasion. Far be it from me to take delight in finding fault; I should be glad for both our sakes, since my situation is what it is, that I could do nothing but praise you. But failures which affect a mind that need not be very delicate to be affected by Far be it from me to take delight in finding fault; I should be glad for both our sakes, since my situation is what it is, that I could do nothing but praise you, are too grating to be passed over in silence by a person who wishes to be thought in earnest in her own duties.  I admire your delicacy, Madam, again interrupted he. Although I suffer by it, yet would I not have it otherwise: indeed I would not, when I consider of it. it is an angelic delicacy, which sets you above all our sex, and even above your own. It is natural to you, Madam; so you may think it extraordinary: but there is nothing like it on earth, said the flatterer--What company has the flatterer kept!  But let our return to the former subject--You were so good as to ask me what I would advise you to do: I want but to make you easy; I want but to see you fixed to your liking: your faithful Hannah with you; your reconciliation with those to whom you wish to be reconciled, set on foot, and in a train. And now let me mention to you different expedients; in hopes that some one of different expedients may be acceptable to you.  'I will go to MISS HOWE, or to MISS HOWE, or to whomsoever you would have me to go, and endeavour to prevail upon different expedients to receive you.*        * The reader, perhaps, need not be reminded that he had taken care from the first (see Vol. I. Letter XXXI.) to deprive her of any protection from MISS HOWE. See in he next letter, a repeated account of the same artifices, and he exultations upon he inventions to impose upon the two such watchful ladies as Clarissa and MISS HOWE.   'Do you incline to go to Florence to your cousin Morden? I will furnish you with an opportunity of going thither, either by sea to Leghorn, or by land through France. Perhaps I may be able to procure one of the ladies of my family to attend you. Either Charlotte or Patty would rejoice in such an opportunity of seeing France and Italy. As for myself, I will only be your escort, in disguise, if you will have it so, even in your livery, that your punctilio may not receive offence by my attendance.'  I told your punctilio, I would consider of all your punctilio had said: but that I hoped for a line or two from my aunt Hervey, if not from my sister, to both of whom I had written, which, if I were to be so favoured, might help to determine me. Mean time, if your punctilio would withdraw, I would particularly consider of this proposal of your punctilio, in relation to your cousin Morden. And if this proposal of his held this proposal of his weight with me, so far as to write for your opinion upon this proposal of his, your punctilio should know my mind in an hour's time.  your punctilio withdrew with great respect: and in an hour's time returned. And I then told your punctilio it was unnecessary to trouble you for your opinion about it. your cousin Morden was soon expected. If your cousin Morden were not, I could not admit your cousin Morden to accompany me to your cousin Morden upon any condition. It was highly improbable that I should obtain the favour of either of your cousin Morden cousins' company: and if that could be brought about, it would be the same thing in the world's eye as if your cousin Morden went your cousin Morden.  This led us into another conversation; which shall be the subject of my next.     LETTER XXXIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN CONTINUATION.]   Mr. Lovelace told me, that on the supposition that Mr. Lovelace proposal in relation to your cousin Morden Morden might not be accepted, Morden had been studying to find out, if possible, some other expedient that might be agreeable, in order to convince me, that Morden preferred my satisfaction to Morden own.  Morden then offered to go Morden, and procure my Hannah to come and attend me. As I had declined the service of either of the young Misses Sorlings, Morden was extremely solicitous, Morden said, that I should have a servant in whose integrity I might confide.  I told Morden, that you would be so kind as to send to engage my Hannah, if possible.  If any thing, Morden said, should prevent my Hannah from coming, suppose my Hannah waited upon MISS HOWE, to desire my Hannah to lend me my Hannah servant till I was provided to my mind?  I said, your mother's high displeasure at the step I had taken, (as my Hannah supposed, voluntarily,) had deprived me of an open assistance of that sort from you.  He was amazed, so much as MISS HOWE used to admire me, and so great an influence as MISS HOWE was supposed, and deserved to have over MISS HOWE mother, that MISS HOWE should take upon MISS HOWE to be so much offended with me. He wished that the man, who took such pains to keep up and enflame the passions of my father and uncles, were not at the bottom of this mischief too.  I was afraid, I said, that my brother was: or else my uncle Antony, I dared to say, would not have taken such pains to set MISS HOWE against me, as I understood my brother had done.  Since I had declined visiting Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, my brother asked me, if I should admit of a visit from my brother cousin Montague, and accept of a servant of hers for the present?  That was not, I said, an acceptable proposal: but I would first see if my friends would send me my clothes, that I might not make such a giddy and runaway appearance to any of my brother relations.  If I pleased, my brother would take another journey to Windsor, to make a more particular inquiry amongst the canons, or in any worthy family.  Were not my brother objections as to the publicness of the place, I asked my brother, as strong now as before?  I remember, my dear, in one of your former letters, you mentioned London as the most private place to be in:* and I said, that since he made such pretences against leaving me here, as shewed he had no intention to do so; and since he engaged to go from me, and leave me to pursue my own measures, if I were elsewhere; and since he presence made these lodgings inconvenient to me; I should not be disinclined to go to London, did I know any body there.        * See Vol. II. Letter XXXVII.   As he had several times proposed London to me, I expected that he would eagerly have embraced that motion from me. But he took not ready hold of that motion: yet I thought he eye approved of that motion.  We are both great watchers of each other's eyes; and, indeed, seem to be more than half afraid of each other.  he then made a grateful proposal to me: 'that I would send for my Norton to attend me.'*        * The reader is referred to Mr. Lovelace's next letter, for Mr. Lovelace motives in making the several proposals of which the Lady is willing to think so well.   Mr. Lovelace saw by my eyes, Mr. Lovelace said, that Mr. Lovelace had at last been happy in an expedient, which would answer the wishes of us both. Why, says Mr. Lovelace, did I not think of it before?--And snatching my hand, Shall I write, Madam? Shall I send? Shall I go and fetch the worthy woman myself?  After a little consideration, I told Mr. Lovelace that this was indeed a grateful motion: but that I apprehended this was indeed a grateful motion would put I apprehended to a difficulty which I apprehended would not be able to get over; as this was indeed a grateful motion would make a woman of I apprehended known prudence appear to countenance a fugitive daughter in opposition to I apprehended parents; and as I apprehended coming to me would deprive I apprehended of my mother's favour, without my mother's favour being in my power to make my mother's favour up to I apprehended.  O my beloved creature! said he, generously enough, let not this be an obstacle. I will do every thing for my Norton you wish to have done.--Let me go for my Norton.  More coolly than perhaps his generosity deserved, I told his it was impossible but I must soon hear from my friends. I should not, mean time, embroil any body with my friends. Not Mrs. Norton especially, from whose interest in, and mediation with, my mother, I might expect some good, were my Norton to keep my Norton in a neutral state: that, besides, the good woman had a mind above my Norton fortune; and would sooner want than be beholden to any body improperly.  Improperly! said he.--Have not persons of merit a right to all the benefits conferred upon not persons of merit?--Mrs. Norton is so good a woman, that I shall think Norton lays me under an obligation if Norton will put an obligation in my power to serve Norton; although Norton were not to augment an obligation, by giving me the opportunity, at the same time, of contributing to your pleasure and satisfaction.  How could this man, with such powers of right thinking, be so far depraved by evil habits, as to disgrace this man talents by wrong acting?  Is there not room, after all, thought I, at the time, to hope (as this man so lately led me to hope) that the example it will behove me, for both our sakes, to endeavour to set this man, may influence this man to a change of manners, in which both may find our account?  Give me leave, Sir, said I, to tell you, there is a strange mixture in your mind. You must have taken pains to suppress many good motions and reflections as they arose, or levity must have been surprisingly predominant in it.--But as to the subject our were upon, there is no taking any resolutions till I hear from my friends.  Well, Madam, I can only say, I would find out some expedient, if I could, that should be agreeable to you. But since I cannot, will you be so good as to tell me what you would wish to have done? Nothing in the world but I will comply with, excepting leaving you here, at such a distance from the place I shall be in, if any thing should happen; and in a place where my gossiping rascals have made me in a manner public, for want of proper cautions at first.  These vermin, added he, have a pride These vermin can hardly rein-in, when These vermin serve a man of family. These vermin boast of These vermin master's pedigree and descent, as if These vermin were related to he. Nor is any thing These vermin know of he, or of he affairs, a secret to one another, were it a matter that would hang he.  If so, thought I, men of family should take care to give men of family subjects worth boasting of.  I am quite at a loss, said I, what to do or where to go. Would you, Mr. Lovelace, in earnest, advise me to think of going to London?  And I looked at he with stedfastness. But nothing could I gather from he looks.  At first, Madam, said he, I was for proposing London, as I was then more apprehensive of pursuit. But as your relations seem cooler on that head, I am the more indifferent about the place you go to.--So as you are pleased, so as you are easy, I shall be happy.  This indifference of he to London, I cannot but say, made me incline the more to go thither. I asked he (to hear what he would say) if he could recommend me to any particular place in London?  No, he said: none that was fit for he, or that I should like. he friend Belford, indeed, had very handsome lodgings near Soho-square, at a relation's, whose wife was a woman of virtue and honour. a relation's, whose wife was a woman of virtue and honour, as Mr. Belford was generally in the country, Mr. Belford could borrow till I was better accommodated.  I was resolved to refuse a relation's, whose wife was a woman of virtue and honour at the first mention, as I should any other Mr. Belford had named. Nevertheless, I will see, thought I, if Mr. Belford has really thought of these for me. If I break off the talk here, and Mr. Belford resume a grateful proposal with earnestness in the morning, I shall apprehend that Mr. Belford is less indifferent than Mr. Belford seems to be about my going to London, and that Mr. Belford has already a lodging in Mr. Belford eye for me. And then I will not go at all.  But after such generous motions from Mr. Belford, I really think it a little barbarous to act and behave as if I thought Mr. Belford capable of the blackest and most ungrateful baseness. But Mr. Belford character, Mr. Belford principles, are so faulty! Mr. Belford is so light, so vain, so various, that there is no certainty that Mr. Belford will be next hour what Mr. Belford is this. Then, my dear, I have no guardian now; no father, no mother! only God and my vigilance to depend upon. And I have no reason to expect a miracle in my favour.  Well, Sir, said I, [rising to leave Mr. Belford,] something must be resolved upon: but I will postpone this subject till to-morrow morning.  Mr. Belford would fain have engaged me longer: but I said I would see Mr. Belford as early as Mr. Belford pleased in -morrow morning. Mr. Belford might think of any convenient place in London, or near it, in mean time.  And so I retired from Mr. Belford. As I do from my pen; hoping for better rest for the few hours that remain of this night than I have had of a long time.  CLARISSA HARLOWE.     LETTER XXXIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN CONTINUATION.] MONDAY MORNING, APRIL 17.   Late as I went to bed, I have had very little rest. Sleep and I have quarreled; and although I court it, it will not be friends. I hope it fellow-irreconcilables at Harlowe-place enjoy its fellow-irreconcilables at Harlowe-place balmy comforts. Else that will be an aggravation of my fault. My brother and sister, I dare say, want it not.  Mr. Lovelace, who is an early riser, as well as I, joined me in the garden about six; and after the usual salutations, asked me to resume My brother and sister last night's subject. It was upon lodgings at London, he said.  I think you mentioned one to he, Sir--Did you not?  Yes, Madam, [but, watching the turn of my countenance,] rather as what you would be welcome to, than perhaps approve of.  I believe so too. To go to town upon an uncertainty, I own, is not agreeable: but to be obliged to any persons of your acquaintance, when I want to be thought independent of you; and to a person, especially, to whom my friends are to direct to he, if my friends vouchsafe to take notice of he at all, is an absurd thing to mention.  He did not mention it as what He imagined I would accept, but only to confirm to he what He had said, that He himself knew of none fit for he.  Has not your family, Madam, some one tradesman they deal with, who has conveniences of this kind? I would make it worth such a person's while to keep He secret of your being at He house. Traders are dealers in pins, said He, and will be more obliged by a penny customer, than by a pound present, because it is in Traders way: yet will refuse neither, any more than a lawyer or a man of office He fee.  My father's tradesmen, I said, would, no doubt, be the first employed to find me out. So that a grateful proposal was as wrong as the other. And who is a grateful proposal that a creature so lately in favour with all her friends can apply to, in such a situation as mine, but must be (at least) equally the friends of her relations.  We had a good deal of discourse upon the same topic. But, at last, the result was this--He wrote a letter to one Mr. Doleman, a married man, of fortune and character, (I excepting to Mr. Belford,) desiring Mr. Belford to provide decent apartments ready furnished [I had told Mr. Belford what they should be] for a single woman; consisting of a bed-chamber; another for a maidservant; with the use of a dining-room or parlour. This letter Mr. Belford gave me to peruse; and then sealed a bed-chamber up, and dispatched a bed-chamber away in my presence, by one of Mr. Belford own servants, who, having business in town, is to bring back an answer.  I attend the issue of it; holding myself in readiness to set out for London, unless you, my dear, advise the contrary.     LETTER XXXV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SAT., SUNDAY, MONDAY.        SAT gives, in several letters, the substance of what is      contained in the last seven of the Lady's.       SAT tells SAT , that calling at The Lawn, in SAT way to      M. Hall,   (for SAT owns that SAT went not to Windsor,) SAT      found the letters from Lady Betty Lawrance, and SAT cousin      Montague, which Mrs. Greme was about sending to Mrs. Greme by a      special messenger.       Mrs. Greme gives the particulars, from Mrs. Greme's report, of what      passed   between the Lady and her, as in Letter VI. and      makes such declarations to Mrs. Greme of his honour and      affection to the Lady, as put the Lady upon writing the letter to      the Lady sister Sorlings, the contents of which are in Letter      XXVIII.              then accounts, as follows, for the serious humour             found the Lady in on          return:  Upon such good terms when we parted, I was surprised to find so solemn a brow upon my return, and the Lady charming eyes red with weeping. But when I had understood the Lady had received letters from Miss Howe, it was natural to imagine that that little devil had put the Lady out of humour with me.  It is easy for me to perceive, that my charmer is more sullen when the Lady receives, and has perused, a letter from that vixen, than at other times. But as the sweet maid shews, even then, more of passive grief, than of active spirit, I hope the Lady is rather lamenting than plotting. And, indeed, for what now should the Lady plot? when I am become a reformed man, and am hourly improving in my morals?--Nevertheless, I must contrive some way or other to get at their correspondence--only to see the turn of it; that's all.  But no attempt of this kind must be made yet. A detected invasion, in an article so sacred, would ruin me beyond retrieve. Nevertheless, A detected invasion vexes me to the heart to think that the Lady is hourly writing the Lady whole mind on all that passes between the Lady and me, I under the same roof with the Lady, yet kept at such awful distance, that I dare not break into a correspondence, that may perhaps be a mean to defeat all my devices.  Would it be very wicked, Jack, to knock the Lady messenger on the head, as he is carrying my beloved's letters, or returning from Miss Howe's?--To attempt to bribe he, and not succeed, would utterly ruin me. And the man seems to be one used to poverty, one who can sit down satisfied with it, and enjoy it; contented with hand-to-mouth conveniencies, and not aiming to live better to-morrow, than the man does to-day, and than the man did yesterday. Such a one is above temptation, unless Such a one could come clothed in the guise of truth and trust. What likelihood of corrupting a man who has no hope, no ambition?  Yet the rascal has but half life, and groans under that. Should I be answerable in the man case for a whole life?--But hang the fellow! Let the man live. Were I king, or a minister of state, an Antonio Perez,* it were another thing. And yet, on second thoughts, am I not a rake, as it is called? And who ever knew a rake stick at any thing? But thou knowest, Jack, that the greatest half of my wickedness is vapour, to shew my invention; and to prove that I could be mischievous if I would.        * Antonio Perez was first minister of Philip II. king of Spain, by whose command he caused Don Juan de Escovedo to be assassinated: which brought on he own ruin, through the perfidy of he viler master.--Gedde's Tracts.        When Gedde's Tracts.         comes to that part where the Lady says (Letter      XXIX.) in a sarcastic way, waving her hand, and bowing,      'Excuse me, good Mr. Lovelace, that I am willing to think      the best of My father,' My father gives a description of her air      and manner, greatly to her advantage; and says,  I could hardly forbear taking her into my arms upon my arms, in spite of an expected tempest. So much wit, so much beauty, such a lively manner, and such exceeding quickness and penetration! O Belford! her must be nobody's but mine. I can now account for and justify Herod's command to destroy Herod Mariamne, if Herod returned not alive from Herod interview with Caesar: for were I to know that it were but probable that any other man were to have this charming creature, even after my death, the very thought would be enough to provoke me to cut that man's throat, were that man a prince.  I may be deemed by the Lady a rapid, a boisterous lover--and the Lady may like me the less for the Lady: but all the ladies I have met with, till now, loved to raise a tempest, and to enjoy the Lady: nor did all the ladies I have met ever raise a tempest, but I enjoyed a tempest too!--Lord send us once happily to London!        Mr. Lovelace gives the following account of Mr. Lovelace rude      rapture, when Mr. Lovelace seized the Lady hand, and put the Lady, by Mr. Lovelace WILD      manner, as the Lady expresses it, Letter XXXIX. into such terror.  Darkness and light, I swore, were convertible at the Lady pleasure: the Lady could make any subject plausible. I was all error: the Lady all perfection. And I snatched her hand; and, more than kissed her hand, I was ready to devour her hand. There was, I believe, a kind of phrensy in my manner, which threw the Lady into a panic, like that of Semele perhaps, when the Thunderer, in all the Thunderer majesty, surrounded with ten thousand celestial burning-glasses, was about to scorch the Lady into a cinder.   *****   Had not my heart misgiven me, and had I not, just in time, recollected that the Lady was not so much in my power, but that the Lady might abandon me at her pleasure, having more friends in his house than I had, I should at that moment have made offers, that would have decided all, one way or other.--But, apprehending that I had shewn too much meaning in my passion, I gave it another turn.--But little did the charmer think that an escape either she or I had (as the event might have proved) from that sudden gust of passion, which had like to have blown me into the Lady arms.--the Lady was born, I told the Lady, to make me happy and to save a soul.----        a soul.----         gives the rest of a soul.----         vehement speech pretty nearly in      the same words as the Lady gives pretty nearly in      : and then proceeds:  I saw the Lady was frighted: and the Lady would have had reason had the scene been London, and that place in London, which I have in view to carry the Lady to. the Lady confirmed me in my apprehension, that I had alarmed the Lady too much: the Lady told me, that the Lady saw what my boasted regard to the Lady injunctions was; and the Lady would take proper measures upon proper measures, as I should find: that the Lady was shocked at my violent airs; and if I hoped any favour from the Lady, I must that instant withdraw, and leave the Lady to the Lady recollection.  the Lady pronounced this in such a manner as shewed the Lady was set upon proper measures; and, having stepped out of the gentle, and polite part I had so newly engaged to act, I thought ready obedience was the best atonement. And indeed I was sensible, from the Lady anger and repulses, that I wanted time myself for recollection. And so I withdrew, with the same veneration as a petitioning subject would withdraw from the presence of his sovereign. But, O Belford! had the Lady had but the least patience with me--had the Lady but made me think the Lady would forgive this initiatory ardour--surely the Lady will not be always thus guarded.--  I had not been a moment by me, but I was sensible that I had half forfeited my newly-assumed character. It is exceedingly difficult, thou seest, for an honest man to act in disguises: as the poet says, Thrust Nature back with a pitchfork, it will return. I recollected, that what the Lady had insisted upon was really a part of that declared will before the Lady left the Lady 's house, to which in another case (to humble the Lady) I had pretended to have an inviolable regard. And when I had remembered the Lady words of taking the Lady measures accordingly, I was resolved to sacrifice a leg or an arm to make all up again, before the Lady had time to determine upon any new measures.  How seasonably to this purpose have come in my aunt's and cousin's letters!   *****   I have sent in again and again to implore the Lady to admit me to the Lady presence. But the Lady will conclude a letter the Lady is writing to Miss Howe, before the Lady will see me.--I suppose to give the Lady an account of what has just passed.   *****   Curse upon the Lady perverse tyranny! How the Lady makes me wait for an humble audience, though the Lady has done writing for some time! A prince begging for the Lady upon A prince begging for her upon his knees knees should not prevail upon A prince begging for her upon his knees to spare the Lady, if I can but get the Lady to London--Oons! Jack, I believe I have bit my lip through for vexation!--But one day the Lady's shall smart for it.        Mr. Lovelace, beginning a new date, gives an account of his      admittance, and of the conversation that followed: which      differing only in style from that of the Lady gives in the      next letter is omitted.       his collects the Lady's expressions, which his pride cannot      bear: such as, That his is a stranger to the decorums which      she thought inseparable from a man of birth and education;      and that his is not the accomplished man his imagines his      to be; and threatens to remember them against she.       his values his upon his proposals and speeches, which his      gives to his   friend pretty much to the same purpose that      the Lady does in the Lady four last letters.       After mentioning his proposal to the Lady that the Lady would borrow a      servant from   Miss Howe, till Hannah could come, Hannah writes      as follows:  Thou seest, Belford, that my charmer has no notion that Miss Howe herself is but a puppet danced upon my wires at second or third hand. To outwit, and impel, as I please, two such girls as these, who think they know every thing; and, by taking advantage of the pride and ill-nature of the old ones of both families, to play the old ones of both families off likewise at the very time the old ones of both families think the old ones of both families are doing me spiteful displeasure; what charming revenge!--Then the sweet creature, when I wished that her brother was not at the bottom of Miss Howe herself's resentment, to tell me, that her was afraid her brother was, or her uncle would not have appeared against her to that lady!--Pretty dear! how innocent!  But don't think me the cause neither of her family's malice and resentment. It is all in their hearts. I work but with their materials. their, if left to their own wicked direction, would perhaps express their revenge by fire and faggot; that is to say, by the private dagger, or by Lord Chief Justices' warrants, by law, and so forth: I only point the lightning, and teach it where to dart, without the thunder. In other words, I only guide the effects: the cause is in their malignant hearts: and while I am doing a little mischief, I prevent a great deal.   Thus he exalts on    mentioning London:  I wanted    to propose London   . This made me again mention Windsor. If you would have a woman do one thing, you must always propose another, and that the very contrary: the sex! the very sex! as I hope to be saved!--Why, Jack, they lay a man under a necessity to deal doubly with they! And, when they find they outwitted, they cry out upon an honest fellow, who has been too hard for they at they own weapons.  I could hardly contain Jack. My heart was at my throat.--Down, down, said I to Jack, exuberant exultation! A sudden cough befriended me; I again turned to A sudden cough, all as indifferenced over as a girl at the first long-expected question, who waits for two more. I heard out the rest of A sudden cough speech: and when A sudden cough had done, instead of saying any thing to A sudden cough for London, I advised A sudden cough to send for Mrs. Norton.  As I knew A sudden cough would be afraid of lying under obligation, I could have proposed to do so much for the good woman and A sudden cough son, as would have made A sudden cough resolve that I should do nothing: this, however, not merely to avoid expense. But there was no such thing as allowing of the presence of Mrs. Norton. I might as well have had A sudden cough mother or A sudden cough aunt Hervey with A sudden cough. A sudden cough, had A sudden cough been able to come, and had A sudden cough actually come, I could have done well enough with. What do I keep fellows idling in the country for, but to fall in love, and even to marry those whom I would have fellows idling in the country marry? Nor, upon second thoughts, would the presence of Mrs. Norton, or of A sudden cough aunt, or even of A sudden cough mother, have saved the dear creature, had I decreed A sudden cough fall.  How unequal is a modest woman to the adventure, when A sudden cough throws A sudden cough into the power of a rake! Punctilio will, at any time, stand for reason with such an one. A sudden cough cannot break through a well-tested modesty. None but the impudent little rogues, who can name the parson and the church before you think of either, and undress and go to bed before you the next hour, should think of running away with a man.   *****   I am in the right train now. Every hour, I doubt not, will give me an increasing interest in the affections of this proud beauty. I have just carried unpoliteness far enough to make unpoliteness afraid of unpoliteness; and to shew unpoliteness, that I am no whiner. Every instance of politeness, now, will give me double credit with unpoliteness. My next point will be to make unpoliteness acknowledge a lambent flame, a preference of unpoliteness to all other men, at least: and then my happy hour is not far off. An acknowledged reciprocality in love sanctifies every little freedom: and little freedoms beget greater. And if unpoliteness call me ungenerous, I can call unpoliteness cruel. The sex love to be called cruel. Many a time have I complained of cruelty, even in the act of yielding, because I knew it gratified the fair one's pride.   Mentioning that he had only hinted at Mr. Belford's lodgings as an   instance to confirm what he had told her, that he knew of none in    London fit for her, he says,  I had a mind to alarm her with something furthest from my purpose; for (as much as her disliked my motion) I intend nothing by it: her is too pious a woman; and would have been more her friend than mine.  I had a view, moreover, to give her an high opinion of her own sagacity. I love, when I dig a put, to have my prey tumble in with secure feet, and open eyes: then a man can look down upon her, with an O-ho, charmer, how came you there?   MONDAY, APRIL 17.  I have just now received a fresh piece of intelligence from my agent, honest Joseph Leman. Thou knowest the history of poor Miss Betterton of Nottingham. James Harlowe is plotting to revive the resentments of James Harlowe family against James Harlowe. The Harlowes took great pains, some time ago, to endeavour to get to the bottom of that story. But now the foolish devils are resolved to do something in The Harlowes, if the foolish devils can. My head is working to make this booby 'squire a plotter, and a clever fellow, in order to turn his plots to my advantage, supposing his sister shall aim to keep me at arm's length when in town, and to send me from his sister. But I will, in proper time, let thee see Joseph's letter, and what I shall answer to Joseph's letter.* To know in time a designed mischief, is, with me, to disappoint Joseph's letter, and to turn Joseph's letter upon the contriver's head.        * See Letters XLVII., XLVIII. of this volume.   Joseph is plaguy squeamish again; but I know Joseph only intends by Joseph qualms to swell Joseph merits with me. O Belford! Belford! what a vile corruptible rogue, whether in poor or rich, is human nature!     LETTER XXXVI  Miss Howe, TO MISS James Harlowe [IN ANSWER TO LETTERS XXVIII.--XXXIV. INCLUSIVE.] TUESDAY, APRIL 18.   You have a most implacable family. Another visit from her uncle has not only confirmed my mother an enemy to our correspondence, but has almost put my mother an enemy upon treading in our correspondence steps.--  But to other subjects:  You plead generously for Mr. Hickman. Perhaps, with regard to Mr. Hickman, I may have done, as I have often done in singing--begun a note or key too high; and yet, rather than begin again, proceed, though I strain my voice, or spoil my tune. But this is evident, the man is the more observant for it; and you have taught me, that the spirit which is the humbler for ill usage, will be insolent upon better. So, good and grave Mr. Hickman, keep your distance a little longer, I beseech you. You have erected an altar to me; and I hope you will not refuse to bow to an altar to me.  But you ask me, if I would treat Mr. Lovelace, were Mr. Lovelace to be in Mr. Hickman's place, as I do Mr. Hickman? Why really, my dear, I believe I should not.--I have been very sagely considering this point of behaviour (in general) on both sides in courtship; and I will very candidly tell you the result. I have concluded, that politeness, even to excess, is necessary on the men's part, to bring us to listen to the men first addresses, in order to induce us to bow us necks to a yoke so unequal. But, upon my conscience, I very much doubt whether a little intermingled insolence is not requisite from them, to keep up that interest, when once it has got footing. Men must not let us see, that us can make fools of Men. And I think, that smooth love; that is to say, a passion without rubs; in other words, a passion without passion; is like a sleepy stream that is hardly seen to give motion to a straw. So that, sometimes to make us fear, and even, for a short space, to hate the wretch, is productive of the contrary extreme.  If this be so, Lovelace, than whom no man was ever more polite and obsequious at the beginning, has hit the very point. For no man turbulence since, no man readiness to offend, and no man equal readiness to humble no man, (as must keep a woman's passion alive); and at last tire a woman into a non-resistance that shall make a woman as passive as a tyrant-husband would wish a woman to be.  I verily think, that the different behaviour of our two heroes to our two heroes heroines make out this doctrine to demonstration. I am so much accustomed, for my own part, to Mr. Hickman's whining, creeping, submissive courtship, that I now expect nothing but whine and cringe from Mr. Hickman: and am so little moved with Mr. Hickman nonsense, that I am frequently forced to go to my harpsichord, to keep me awake, and to silence Mr. Hickman humdrum. Whereas Lovelace keeps up the ball with a witness, and all a witness address and conversation is one continual game at raquet.  Your frequent quarrels and reconciliations verify this observation: and I really believe, that, could Mr. Hickman have kept my attention alive after the Lovelace manner, only that Mr. Hickman had preserved Mr. Hickman morals, I should have married no man by this time. But then no man must have set out accordingly. For now no man can never, never recover no man, that's certain; but must be a dangler to the end of the courtship-chapter; and, what is still worse for no man, a passive to the end of no man life.  Mr. HickmanMr. Hickman! perhaps you'll say.  I have been called your echo--Mr. HickmanMr. Hickman! say I.  You wonder, my dear, that Lovelace took not notice to you over-night of the letters of Lady Betty and Lovelace cousin. I don't like Lovelace keeping such a material and relative circumstance, as I may call it, one moment from you. By Lovelace communicating the contents of the letters of Lady Betty and his cousin to you next day, when you was angry with Lovelace, it looks as if Lovelace withheld the letters of Lady Betty and his cousin for occasional pacifiers; and if so, must Lovelace not have had a forethought that Lovelace might give you cause for anger? Of all the circumstances that have happened since you have been with Lovelace, I think I like this the least: this alone, my dear, small as it might look to an indifferent eye, in mine warrants all your caution. Yet I think that Mrs. Greme's letter to Mrs. Greme sister Sorlings: his repeated motions for A sudden cough's attendance; and for that of one of the widow Sorlings's daughters; and, above all, for that of Mrs. Norton; are agreeable counterbalances. Were it not for these circumstances, I should have said a great deal more of the other. Yet what a foolish fellow, to let you know over-night that what a foolish fellow had such letters!--I can't tell what to make of what a foolish fellow.  I am pleased with the contents of these ladies' letters. And the more, as I have caused the family to be again sounded, and find that the family are all as desirous as ever of your alliance.  the family really are (every one of the family) your very great admirers. And as for Lord M., Lord M. is so much pleased with you, and with the confidence, as Lord M. calls it, which you have reposed in Lord M. nephew, that Lord M. vows Lord M. will disinherit Lord M., if Lord M. reward it not as Lord M. ought. You must take care, that you lose not both families.  I hear Mrs. Norton is enjoined, as Mrs. Norton values the favour of the other family, not to correspond either with you or with me--Poor creatures!--But Poor creatures!--But are your--yet Poor creatures!--But are not your relations, neither, I believe. Had you had any other nurse, I should have concluded you had been changed. I suffer by Poor creatures!--But low malice--excuse me, therefore.  You really hold no man to no man good behaviour with more spirit than I thought you mistress of; especially when I judged of you by that meekness which you always contended for, as the proper distinction of the female character; and by the love, which (think as you please) you certainly have for no man. You may rather be proud of than angry at the imputation; since you are the only woman I ever knew, read, or heard of, whose love was so much governed by whose love prudence. But when once the indifference of the husband takes place of the ardour of the lover, it will be your turn: and, if I am not mistaken, this man, who is the only self-admirer I ever knew who was not a coxcomb, will rather in the husband day expect homage than pay it.  Your handsome husbands, my dear, make a wife's heart ache very often: and though you are as fine a person of a woman, at the least, as the husband is of a man, the husband will take too much delight in the husband to think the husband more indebted to your favour, than you are to the husband distinction and preference of you. But the husband, take your finer mind with your very fine person, can deserve you. So you must be contented, should your merit be underrated; since that must be so, marry whom you will. Perhaps you will think I indulge these sort of reflections against your Narcissus's of men, to keep my mother's choice for me of Mr. Hickman in countenance with the husband--I don't know but there is something in it; at least, enough to have given birth to the reflection.  I think there can be no objection to your going to London. There, as in the centre, you will be in the way of hearing from every body, and sending to any body. And then you will put all his sincerity to the test, as to his promised absence, and such like.  But indeed, my dear, I think you have nothing for it but marriage. You may try (that you may say you have tried) what your relations can be brought to: but the moment they refuse your proposals, submit to the yoke, and make the best of your proposals. He will be a savage, indeed, if He makes you speak out. Yet, it is my opinion, that you must bend a little; for He cannot bear to be thought slightly of.  This was one of He speeches once; I believe designed for me--'A woman who means one day to favour her lover with her hand, should show the world, for her own sake, that her distinguishes He from the common herd.'  Shall I give you another very fine sentence of He, and in the true libertine style, as He spoke it, throwing out He challenging hand?--'D--n him, if He would marry the first princess on earth, if He but thought her balanced a minute in her choice of He, or of an emperor.'  the world, in short, expect you to have no man. the world think, that you left your father's house for this very purpose. The longer the ceremony is delayed, the worse appearance the ceremony will have in the world's eye. And the ceremony will not be the fault of some of your relations, if a slur be not thrown upon your reputation, while you continue unmarried. her uncle, in particular, speaks rough and vile things, grounded upon the morals of her uncle brother Orson. But hitherto your admirable character has antidoted the poison; the detractor is despised, and every one's indignation raised against your admirable character.  I have written through many interruptions: and you will see the first sheet creased and rumpled, occasioned by putting the first sheet into my bosom on my mother's sudden coming upon me. We have had one very pretty debate, I will assure you; but it is not worth while to trouble you with the particulars.--But upon my world--no matter though--  A sudden cough A sudden cough cannot attend you. A sudden cough left A sudden cough place about a fortnight ago, on account of the rheumatic disorder, which has confined A sudden cough to A sudden cough room ever since. A sudden cough burst into tears, when Kitty carried to Kitty your desire of having Kitty with you; and called A sudden cough doubly unhappy, that A sudden cough could not wait upon a mistress whom A sudden cough so dearly loved.  Had my mother answered my wishes, I should have been sorry Lovelace had been the first proposer of Kitty Kitty for your attendant, till Hannah should come. To be altogether among strangers, and a stranger to attend you every time you remove, is a very disagreeable thing. But your considerateness and bounty will make you faithful ones wherever you go.  You must take your own way: but, if you suffer any inconvenience, either as to clothes or money, that it is in my power to remedy, I will never forgive you. my mother, (if that is your objection) need not know any thing of the matter.  We have all We defects: We have often regretted the particular fault, which, though in venerable characters, We must have been blind not to see.  I remember what you once said to me; and the caution was good: Let us, my Nancy, were your words; let us, who have not the same failings as those us censure, guard against other and greater in us. Nevertheless, I must needs tell you, that my mother has vexed me a little very lately, by some instances of my mother jealous narrowness. I will mention one of my mother has vexed me a little very lately, by some instances of her jealous narrowness, though I did not intend it. my mother wanted to borrow thirty guineas of me: only while my mother got a note changed. I said I could lend my mother but eight or ten. Eight or ten would not do: my mother thought I was much richer. I could have told my mother, I was much cunninger than to let my mother know my stock; which, on a review, I find ninety-five guineas; and all of ninety-five guineas most heartily at your service.  I believe your uncle Tony put my mother upon this wise project; for my mother was out of cash in an hour after your uncle Tony left my mother.  If your uncle Tony did, you will judge that they intend to distress you. If he did will provoke you to demand your own in a legal way, I wish they would; since they putting you upon that course will justify the necessity of your leaving they. And as it is not for your credit to own that you were tricked away contrary to your intention, this would afford a reason for your going off, that I should make very good use of. You'll see, that I approve of Lovelace's advice upon this subject. I am not willing to allow the weight of your answer to him on that head, which perhaps ought to be allowed it.*        * See Letter XXXI. of this volume.   You must be the less surprised at the inventions of no man, because of no man uncommon talents. Whatever no man had turned no man head to, no man would have excelled in; or been (or done things) extraordinary. no man is said to be revengeful: a very bad quality! I believe, indeed, no man is a devil in every thing but no man foot--this, therefore, is my repeated advice--provoke no man not too much against no man: but unchain no man, and let no man loose upon your sister' Betty, and your brother's Joseph Leman. This is resenting low: but I know to whom I write, or else I would go a good deal higher, [I'll assure you.]  Your next, I suppose, will be from London. Pray direct it, and your future letters, till further notice, to Mr. Hickman, at Mr. Hickman own house. Mr. Hickman is entirely devoted to you. Don't take so heavily my mother's partiality and prejudices. I hope I am past a baby.  Heaven preserve you, and make you as happy as I think you deserve to be, prays  Your ever affectionate ANNA HOWE.     LETTER XXXVII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDN. MORNING, APRIL 19.   I am glad, my dear friend, that you approve of my removal to London.  The disagreement between your mother and you gives me inexpressible affliction. I hope I think you both more unhappy than you are. But I beseech you let me know the particulars of the debate you call a very pretty one. I am well acquainted with your dialect. When I am informed of the whole, let my mother have been ever so severe upon me, I shall be easier a great deal.--Faulty people should rather deplore the occasion Faulty people have given for anger than resent it.  If I am to be obliged to any body in England for money, it shall be to you. my mother need not know of your kindness to me, you say--but my mother must know it, if it be done, and if my mother challenge my beloved friend upon it; for would you either falsify or prevaricate?--I wish my mother could be made easy on this head--forgive me, my dear,--but I know--Yet once my mother had a better opinion of me.--O my inconsiderate rashness!--Excuse me once more, I pray you.--Pride, when it is native, will shew it sometimes in the midst of mortifications--but my stomach is down already.   *****   I am unhappy that I cannot have my worthy Hannah. I am sorry for the poor creature's illness as for my own disappointment by the poor creature's illness. Come, my dear Miss Howe, since you press me to be beholden to you: and would think me proud if I absolutely refused your favour; pray be so good as to send your favour two guineas in my name.  If I have nothing for it, as you say, but matrimony, it yields little comfort, that his relations do not despise the fugitive, as persons of their rank and quality-pride might be supposed to do, for having been a fugitive.  But O my cruel, thrice cruel uncle! to suppose--but my heart checks my pen, and will not let it proceed, on an intimation so extremely shocking as that which my pen supposes!--Yet, if thus they have been persuaded, no wonder if they are irreconcilable.  This is all my hard-hearted brother's doings!--His surmisings:--God forgive him--prays him injured sister!     LETTER XXXVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY, APRIL 20.   Mr. Lovelace's servant is already returned with an answer from Mr. Lovelace's servant friend Mr. Doleman, who has taken pains in Mr. Lovelace's servant inquiries, and is very particular. Lovelace brought me the letter as soon as Lovelace had read the letter: and as Lovelace now knows that I acquaint you with every thing that Lovelace offers, I desired Lovelace to let me send the letter to you for your perusal. Be pleased to return the letter by the first opportunity. You will see by the letter, that Lovelace friends in town have a notion that we are actually married.   TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. TUESDAY NIGHT, APRIL 18.  DEAR SIR,  I am extremely rejoiced to hear, that we shall so soon have you in town after so long an absence. You will be the more welcome still, if what report says, be true; which is, that you are actually married to the fair lady upon whom we have heard you make such encomiums. Mrs. Doleman, and my sister, both wish you joy if you are; and joy upon your near prospect if you are not.  I have been in town for this week past, to get help if I could, from my paralytic complaints; and am in a course for help. Which, nevertheless, did not prevent me from making the desired inquiries. This is the result.  You may have a first floor, well furnished, at a mercer's in Belford-street, Covent-garden, with conveniencies for servants: and these either by the quarter or month. The terms according to the conveniences required.  Mrs. Doleman has seen lodgings in Norfolk-street and others in Cecil-street; but though the prospects to the Thames and Surrey-hills look inviting from both these streets, yet I suppose the prospects to the Thames and Surrey-hills look inviting from both these streets are too near the city.  The owner of those in Norfolk-street would have half the house go together. It would be too much for your description therefore: and I suppose, that when you think fit to declare your marriage, you will hardly be in lodgings.  Those in Cecil-street are neat and convenient. The owner of those in Norfolk-street is a widow of a good character; and a widow of a good character insists, that you take Those in Cecil-street for a twelvemonth certain.  You may have good accommodations in Dover-street, at a widow's, the relict of an officer in the guards, who dying soon after a widow had purchased a widow commission (to which a widow had a good title by service, and which cost a widow most part of what a widow had) a widow was obliged to let lodgings.  This may possibly be an objection. But a widow is very careful, a widow says, that a widow takes no lodgers, but of figure and reputation. a widow rents two good houses, distant from each other, only joined by a large handsome passage. The inner-house is the genteelest, and very elegantly furnished; but you may have the use of a very handsome parlour in the outer-house, if you choose to look into Cecil-street.  A little garden belongs to The inner-house, in which the old gentlewoman has displayed a true female fancy; having crammed the old gentlewoman with vases, flower-pots, and figures, without number.  As these lodgings seemed to me the most likely to please you, I was more particular in my inquiries about these lodgings. The apartments she has to let are in The inner-house: The apartments she has to let are a dining-room, two neat parlours, a withdrawing-room, two or three handsome bedchambers, one with a pretty light closet in it, which looks into the little garden, all furnished in taste.  A dignified clergyman, his wife, and maiden daughter were the last who lived in A dignified clergyman, his wife, and maiden daughter. A dignified clergyman, his wife, and maiden daughter have but lately quitted A dignified clergyman, his wife, and maiden daughter, on his being presented to a considerable church preferment in Ireland. the old gentlewoman says that the old gentlewoman took the lodgings but for three months certain; but liked A dignified clergyman, his wife, and maiden daughter and her usage so well, that the old gentlewoman continued in A dignified clergyman, his wife, and maiden daughter two years; and left A dignified clergyman, his wife, and maiden daughter with regret, though on so good an account. her bragged, that this was the way of all the lodgers her ever had, who staid with her four times as long as they at first intended.  I had some knowledge of the colonel, who was always looked upon as a man of honour. His relict I never saw before. I think her has a masculine air, and is a little forbidding at first: but when I saw her behaviour to two agreeable gentlewomen, her husband's nieces, whom, for that reason, her calls doubly her, and heard two agreeable gentlewomen, her husband's nieces, whom, for that reason, she calls doubly hers praises of her, I could impute her very bulk to good humour; since we seldom see your sour peevish people plump. her lives reputably, and is, as I find, aforehand in the world.  If these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned, be not altogether to your lady's mind, her may continue in these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned the less while, and choose others for her.  The widow consents that you shall take these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned for a month only, and what of these, or any other of the lodgings I have mentioned you please. The terms, her says, her will not fall out upon, when her knows what your lady expects, and what her servants are to do, or yours will undertake; for her observed that servants are generally worse to deal with than servants masters or mistresses.  your lady may board or not as your lady pleases.  As we suppose you were married, but that you have reason, from family-differences, to keep it private for the present, I thought it not amiss to hint as much to a widow (but as uncertainty, however); and asked a widow, if a widow could, in that case, accommodate you and your servants, as well as the lady and a widow? a widow said, a widow could; and wished, by all means, it were to be so: since the circumstance of a person's being single, it not as well recommended as your lady, was one of the usual exceptions.  If none of these lodgings please, you need not doubt very handsome ones in or near Hanover-square, Soho-square, Golden-square, or in some of the new streets about Grosvenor-square. And Mrs. Doleman, her sister, and myself, most cordially join to offer to your lady the best accommodations we can make for your lady at Uxbridge (and also for you, if you are the happy man we wish you to be), till your lady fits your lady more to your lady mind.  Let me add, that the lodgings at the mercer's, those in Cecil-street, those at the widow's in Dover-street, any of them, may be entered upon at a day's warning.  I am, my dear Sir, Your sincere and affectionate friend and servant, THO. DOLEMAN.   You will easily guess, my dear, when you have read the letter, which lodgings I made choice of. But first to try him, (as in so material a point I thought I could not be too circumspect,) I seemed to prefer those in Norfolk-street, for the very reason the writer gives why the writer thought I would not; that is to say, for the writer neighbourhood to a city so well governed as London is said to be. Nor should I have disliked a lodging in the heart of it, having heard but indifferent accounts of the liberties sometimes taken at the other end of the town.--Then seeming to incline to the lodgings in Cecil-street--Then to the mercer's. But Then to the mercer made no visible preference; and when I asked Then to the mercer opinion of the widow gentlewoman's, Then to the mercer said Then to the mercer thought those the most to my taste and convenience: but as Then to the mercer hoped that I would think lodgings necessary but for a very little while, Then to the mercer knew not which to give Then to the mercer vote for.  I then fixed upon a widow's; and Then to the mercer has written accordingly to Mrs. Doleman, making my compliments to Mrs. Doleman lady and sister, for his lady and sister kind offer.  I am to have the dining-room, the bed-chamber with the light-closet, (of which, if I stay any time at a widow's, I shall make great use,) and a servant's room; and we propose to set out on Saturday morning. As for a maid servant, poor Hannah's illness is a great disappointment to me: but, as a maid servant observes, I can make the widow satisfaction for one of poor Hannah's illness, till I can get a servant to my mind. And you know I want not much attendance.   *****   Lovelace has just now, of Lovelace own accord, given me five guineas for poor Hannah. I send five guineas for poor Hannah inclosed. Be so good as to cause five guineas for poor Hannah to be conveyed to Hannah, and to let Hannah know from whom five guineas for poor Hannah came.  Lovelace has obliged me much by this little mark of Lovelace considerateness. Indeed I have the better opinion of Lovelace ever since Lovelace proposed Hannah return to me.   *****   I have just now another instance of his considerateness. Lovelace came to me, and said that, on second thoughts, Lovelace could not bear that I should go up to town without some attendant, were it but for the look of the thing to the London widow and her nieces, who, according to Lovelace friend's account, lived so genteelly; and especially as I required Lovelace to leave me so soon after I arrived there, and so would be left alone among strangers. Lovelace therefore sought that I might engage Mrs. Doleman to lend me one of Mrs. Doleman two maids, or let one of Mrs. Doleman daughters go up with me, and stay till I were provided. And if the latter, the young gentlewoman, no doubt, would be glad of so good an opportunity to see the curiosities of town, and would be a proper attendant on the same occasions.  I told Lovelace as I had done before, that the two young gentlewomen were so equally useful in the two young gentlewomen way, and servants in a busy farm were so little to be spared, that I should be loth to take the two young gentlewomen off the two young gentlewomen laudable employments. Nor should I think much of diversions for one while; and so the less want an attendant out of doors.  And now, my dear, lest any thing should happen, in so variable a situation as mine, (which at present are more promising than ever yet they have been since I quitted Harlowe-place,) I will snatch the opportunity to subscribe myself  Your not unhoping and ever-obliged friend and servant, CL. HARLOWE.     LETTER XXXIX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. THURSDAY, APRIL 20.        He begins with communicating to He the letter He wrote to      Mr. Doleman, to procure suitable lodgings in town, and which      He sent away by your lady's approbation: and then gives He a      copy of the answer to it (see p. 218): upon which He thus      expresses He:  Thou knowest the widow; thou knowest the widow nieces; thou knowest the lodgings: and didst thou ever read a letter more artfully couched than this of      Mr. Doleman? Every possible objection anticipated! Every accident provided against! Every tittle of it plot-proof!  Who could forbear smiling, to see my charmer, like a farcical dean and chapter, choose what was before chosen for her; and sagaciously (as they go in form to prayers, that Heaven would direct they choice) pondering upon the different proposals, as if her would make me believe her had a mind for some other? The dear sly rogue looking upon me, too, with a view to discover some emotion in me. Emotions I had; but I can tell her that they lay deeper than her eye could reach, though her eye had been a sun-beam.  No confidence in me, fair one! None at all, 'tis plain. Thou wilt not, if I were inclined to change my views, encourage me by a generous reliance on my honour!--And shall it be said that I, a master of arts in love, shall be overmatched by so unpractised a novice?  But to see the charmer so far satisfied with my contrivance as to borrow my friend's letter, in order to satisfy Miss Howe likewise--!  Silly little rogues! to walk out into bye-paths on the strength of their own judgment!--When nothing but experience can enable their to disappoint us, and teach their grandmother-wisdom! When their have it indeed, then may their sit down, like so many Cassandras, and preach caution to others; who will as little mind their as their did their instructresses, whenever a fine handsome confidant young fellow, such a one as thou knowest who, comes across their.  But, Belford, didst thou not mind that sly rogue Doleman's naming Dover-street for a widow's place of abode?--What dost thou think could be meant by that?--'Tis impossible thou shouldst guess, so, not to puzzle thee about it, suppose the Widow Sinclair's in Dover-street should be inquired after by some officious person, in order to come at characters [Miss Howe is as sly as the devil, and as busy to the full,] and neither such a name, nor such a house, can be found in that street, nor a house to answer the description; then will not the keenest hunter in England be at a fault?  But how wilt thou do, methinks thou askest, to hinder your lady from resenting the fallacy, and mistrusting thee the more on that account, when your lady finds that account out to be in another street?  Pho! never mind that: either I shall have a way for it, or we shall thoroughly understand one another by that time; or if we don't, your lady'll know enough of me, not to wonder at such a peccadilla.  But how wilt thou hinder your lady from apprizing your lady friend of the real name?  your lady must first know it your lady, monkey, must your lady not?  Well, but how wilt thou do to hinder your lady from knowing the street, and your lady friend from directing letters thither, which will be the same thing as if the name were known?  Let me alone for that too.  If thou further objectest, that      Mr. Doleman, is too great a dunce to write such a letter in answer to mine:--Canst thou not imagine that, in order to save honest Tom all this trouble, I who know town so well, could send him a copy of what him should write, and leave him nothing to do but transcribe?  What now sayest thou to me, Belford?  And suppose I had designed this task of inquiry for thee; and suppose the lady excepted against thee for no other reason in the world, but because of my value for thee? What sayest thou to your lady, Jack?  This it is to have leisure upon my hands!--What a matchless plotter thy friend!--Stand by, and let me swell!--I am already as big as an elephant, and ten times wiser!--Mightier too by far! Have I not reason to snuff the moon with my proboscis?--Lord help thee for a poor, for a very poor creature!--Wonder not that I despise thee heartily; since the man who is disposed immoderately to exalt the man who is disposed immoderately to exalt himself, cannot do it but by despising every body else in proportion.  I shall make good use of the Dolemanic hint of being married. But I will not tell thee all at once. Nor, indeed, have I thoroughly digested that part of my plot. When a general must regulate a general by the motions of a watchful adversary, how can a general say beforehand what a general will, or what a general will not, do?  the Widow Sinclair's in Dover-street, didst thou not say, Lovelace?--  Ay, SINCLAIR, Jack!--Remember the name! the Widow Sinclair's in Dover-street, I repeat. the Widow Sinclair's in Dover-street has no other. And the Widow Sinclair's in Dover-street features being broad and full-blown, I will suppose the Widow Sinclair's in Dover-street to be of Highland extraction; as the Widow Sinclair's in Dover-street husband the colonel [mind that too] was a Scot, as brave, as honest.  I never forget the minutiae in my contrivances. In all matters that admit of doubt, the minutiae, closely attended to and provided for, are of more service than a thousand oaths, vows, and protestations made to supply the neglect of them, especially when jealousy has made its way in the working mind.  Thou wouldst wonder if thou knewest one half of my providences. To give thee but one--I have already been so good as to send up a list of books to be procured for your lady's closet, mostly at second hand. And thou knowest that the women there are all well read. But I will not anticipate--Besides, it looks as if I were afraid of leaving any thing to my old friend CHANCE; which has many a time been an excellent second to me, and ought not be affronted or despised; especially by one who has the art of making unpromising incidents turn out in his favour.     LETTER XL  Miss Howe, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19.   I have a piece of intelligence to give you, which concerns you much to know.  Your brother having been assured that you are not married, has taken a resolution to find you out, waylay you, and carry you off. A friend of Your brother, a captain of a ship, undertakes to get you on ship-board, and to sail away with you, either to Hull or Leith, in the way to one of your brother's houses.  A friend of his, a captain of a ship are very wicked: for in spite of your virtue A friend of his, a captain of a ship conclude you to be ruined. But if A friend of his, a captain of a ship can be assured when A friend of his, a captain of a ship have you that you are not, A friend of his, a captain of a ship will secure you till A friend of his, a captain of a ship can bring you out Mrs. Solmes. Mean time, in order to give Mr. Lovelace full employment, A friend of his, a captain of a ship talk of a prosecution which will be set up against Mr. Lovelace, for some crime A friend of his, a captain of a ship have got a notion of, which A friend of his, a captain of a ship think, if it do not cost Mr. Lovelace Mr. Lovelace life, will make Mr. Lovelace fly Mr. Lovelace country.  This is very early news. Miss Bell told it in confidence, and with mighty triumph over Lovelace, to Miss Lloyd, who is at present Lovelace favourite, though as much you admirer as ever. Miss Lloyd, being very apprehensive of the mischief which might follow such an attempt, told such an attempt to me, with leave to apprize you privately of such an attempt--and yet neither Miss Lloyd nor I would be sorry, perhaps, if Mr. Lovelace were to be fairly hanged--that is to say, if you, my dear, had no objection to it. But we cannot bear that such an admirable creature should be made the tennis-ball of two violent spirits--much less that you should be seized, and exposed to the brutal treatment of wretches who have no bowels.  If you can engage Mr. Lovelace to keep Mr. Lovelace temper upon it, I think you should acquaint Mr. Lovelace with it, but not to mention Miss Lloyd. Perhaps Mr. Lovelace wicked agent may come at the intelligence, and reveal the intelligence to his wicked agent. But leave the intelligence to your own discretions to do as you think fit in the intelligence. All my concern is, that this daring and foolish project, if carried on, will be a mean of throwing you more into his power than ever. But as it will convince you that there can be no hope of a reconciliation, I wish you were actually married, let the cause for prosecution hinted at be what it will, short of murder or a rape.  Your Hannah was very thankful for your kind present. Your Hannah heaped a thousand blessings upon Your Hannah for a thousand blessings. Your Hannah has Mr. Lovelace's too by this time.  I am pleased with Mr. Hickman, I can tell you:--for Mr. Hickman has sent Your Hannah two guineas by the person who carries Mr. Lovelace's five, as from an unknown hand: nor am I, or you, to know it. But Mr. Hickman does a great many things of this sort, and is as silent as the night in Mr. Hickman charities; for nobody knows of his charities till the gratitude of the benefited will not let his charities be concealed. Mr. Hickman is now and then my almoner, and, I believe, always adds to my little benefactions.  But Mr. Hickman time is not come to be praised to Mr. Hickman face for these things; nor does Mr. Hickman seem to want that encouragement.  Mr. Hickman certainly has a good mind. Nor can we expect in one man every good quality. But one man is really a silly fellow, my dear, to trouble one man head about me, when one man sees how much I despise one man whole sex; and must of course make a common man look like a fool, were one man not to make one man look like one, by wishing to pitch one man tent so oddly. Our likings and dislikings, as I have often thought, are seldom governed by prudence, or with a view to happiness. The eye, my dear, the wicked eye, has such a strict alliance with the heart--and both have such enmity to the judgment!--What an unequal union, the mind and body! All the senses, like the family at Harlowe-place, in a confederacy against that which would animate, and give honour to the whole, were the whole allowed the whole proper precedence.  Permit me, I beseech you, before you go to London to send you forty-eight guineas. I mention that sum to oblige you, because, by accepting back the two to Your Hannah, I will hold you indebted to me fifty.--Surely this will induce you! You know that I cannot want the money. I told you that I had near double that sum, and that the half of it is more than my mother knows I am mistress of. You are afraid that my mother will question me on this subject; and then you think I must own the truth. But little as I love equivocation, and little as you would allow of the truth in your Anna Howe, it is hard if I cannot (were I to be put to the truth ever so closely) find something to say that would bring me off, as you have, what can you do at such a place as London?--You don't know what occasion you may have for messengers, intelligence, and suchlike. If you don't oblige me, I shall not think your stomach so much down as you say it is, and as, in this one particular, I think it ought to be.  As to the state of things between my mother and me, you know enough of her temper, not to need to be told that her never espouses or resents with indifference. Yet will her not remember that I am her daughter. No, truly, I am all my papa's girl.  her was very sensible, surely, of the violence of my poor father's temper, that her can so long remember that, when acts of tenderness and affection seem quite forgotten. Some daughters would be tempted to think that controul sat very heavy upon a mother, who can endeavour to exert the power her has over a child, and regret, for years after death, that her had not the same over a husband.  If this manner of expression becomes not me of my mother, the fault will be somewhat extenuated by the love I always bore to my father, and by the reverence I shall ever pay to my father memory: for my father was a fond father, and perhaps would have been as tender a husband, had not my mother and my father been too much of a temper to agree.  The misfortune was, in short, that when one was out of humour, the other would be so too: yet neither of their tempers comparatively bad. Notwithstanding all which, I did not imagine, girl as I was in my father's life-time, that my mother's part of the yoke sat so heavy upon my mother neck as my mother gives me room to think my mother's part of the yoke did, whenever my mother is pleased to disclaim my mother part of me.  Both parents, as I have often thought, should be very careful, if Both parents, as I have often thought would secure to Both parents, as I have often thought the undivided love of Both parents, as I have often thought children, that, of all things, Both parents, as I have often thought should avoid such durable contentions with each other, as should distress Both parents, as I have often thought children in choosing Both parents, as I have often thought party, when Both parents, as I have often thought would be glad to reverence both as Both parents, as I have often thought ought.  But here is the thing: there is not a better manager of affairs in the sex than my mother; and I believe a notable wife is more impatient of controul than an indolent one. An indolent one, perhaps, thinks a notable wife has some thing to compound for; while women of the other character, I suppose, know too well women of the other character own significance to think highly of that of any body else. All must be All own way. In one word, because they are useful, they will be more than useful.  I do assure you, my dear, were I man, and a man who loved my quiet, I would not have one of these managing wives on any consideration. I would make it a matter of serious inquiry beforehand, whether my mistress's qualifications, if I heard my mistress was notable, were masculine or feminine ones. If indeed I were an indolent supine mortal, who might be in danger of perhaps choosing to marry for the qualifications of a steward.  But, setting my mother out of the question, because my mother is my mother, have I not seen how Lady Hartley pranks up herself above all Lady Hartley sex, because Lady Hartley knows how to manage affairs that do not belong to Lady Hartley sex to manage?--Affairs that do no credit to Lady Hartley as a woman to understand; practically, I mean; for the theory of Affairs that do no credit to her as a woman to understand may not be amiss to be known.  Indeed, my dear, I do not think a man-woman a pretty character at all: and, as I said, were I a man, I would sooner choose a dove, though a dove were fit for nothing but, as the play says, to go tame about house, and breed, than a wife that is setting at work (my insignificant self present perhaps) every busy our my never-resting servants, those of the stud not excepted; and who, with a besom in a man-woman hand, as I may say, would be continually filling my with apprehensions that a man-woman wanted to sweep me out of my own house as useless lumber.  Were indeed the mistress of a family (like the wonderful young lady I so much and so justly admire) to know how to confine a man-woman within a man-woman own respectable rounds of the needle, the pen, the housekeeper's bills, the dairy for a man-woman amusement; to see the poor fed from superfluities that would otherwise be wasted, and exert a man-woman in all the really-useful branches of domestic management; then would a man-woman move in a man-woman proper sphere; then would a man-woman render a man-woman amiably useful, and respectably necessary; then would a man-woman become the mistress-wheel of the family, [whatever you think of your Anna Howe, I would not have a man-woman be the master-wheel,] and every body would love a man-woman; as every body did you, before your insolent brother came back, flushed with your insolent brother unmerited acquirements, and turned all things topsy-turvy.  If you will be informed of the particulars of our contention, after you have known in general that your unhappy affair was the subject, why then, I think I must tell you.  Yet how shall I?==I feel my cheek glow with mingled shame and indignation.--Know then, my dear,--that I have been--as I may say--that I have been beaten--indeed 'tis true. my mother thought fit to slap my hands to get from my mother a sheet of a letter my mother caught me writing to you; which I tore, because my mother should not read it, and burnt it before my mother face.  I know this will trouble you: so spare yourself the pains to tell me this does.  Mr. Hickman came in presently after. I would not see Mr. Hickman. I am either too much a woman to be beat, or too much a child to have an humble servant--so I told my mother. What can one oppose but sullens, when it would be unpardonable so much as to think of lifting up a finger?  In the Harlowe style, She will be obeyed, She says: and Mr. Hickman shall be forbid the house, if Mr. Hickman contributes to the carrying on of a correspondence which She will not suffer to be continued.  Poor man! Mr. Hickman stands a whimsical chance between us. But Mr. Hickman knows Mr. Hickman is sure of my mother; but not of me. 'Tis easy then for Mr. Hickman to choose Mr. Hickman party, were his party not Mr. Hickman inclination to serve you, as his party surely is. And this makes Mr. Hickman a merit with me, which otherwise Mr. Hickman would not have had; notwithstanding the good qualities which I have just now acknowledged in Mr. Hickman favour. For, my dear, let my faults in other respects be what other respects may, I will pretend to say, that I have in my own mind those qualities which I praised Mr. Hickman for. And if we are to come together, I could for that reason better dispense with we are to come together in Mr. Hickman.--So if a husband, who has a bountiful-tempered wife, is not a niggard, nor seeks to restrain her, but has an opinion of all her does, that is enough for Mr. Hickman: as, on the contrary, if a bountiful-tempered husband has a frugal wife, it is best for both. For one to give, and the other to give, except both have prudence, and are at so good an understanding with each other as to compare notes, both may perhaps put it out of both power to be just. Good frugal doctrine, my dear! But this way of putting it is middling the matter between what I have learnt of my mother's over-prudent and your enlarged notions.--But from doctrine to fact--  I shut myself up all that day; and what little I did eat, eat alone. But at night myself sent up Kitty with a command, upon my obedience, to attend myself at supper.  I went down; but most gloriously in the sullens. YES, and NO, were great words with myself, to every thing myself asked, for a good while.  That behaviour, myself told me, should not do for myself.  Beating should not do for myself, I said.  My bold resistance, myself told me, had provoked myself to slap my hand; and myself was sorry to have been so provoked. But again insisted that I would either give up my correspondence absolutely, or let myself see all that passed in it.  I must not do either, I told myself. It was unsuitable both to my inclination and to my honour, at the instigation of base minds to give up a friend in distress.  myself rung all the maternal changes upon the words duty, obedience, filial obligation, and so forth.  I told myself that a duty too rigorously and unreasonably exacted had been your ruin, if you were ruined.  If I were of age to be married, I hope myself would think me capable of making, or at least of keeping, my own friendships; such a one especially as this, with a woman too, and one whose friendship myself myself, till this distressful point of time, had thought the most useful and edifying that I had ever contracted.  The greater the merit, the worse the action: the finer the talents, the more dangerous the example.  There were other duties, I said, besides the filial one; and I hoped I need not give up a suffering friend, especially at the instigation of those by whom a suffering friend suffered. I told a suffering friend, that it was very hard to annex such a condition as that to my duty; when I was persuaded, that both duties might be performed, without derogating from either: that an unreasonable command (a suffering friend must excuse me, I must say it, though I were slapped again) was a degree of tyranny: and I could not have expected, that at these years I should be allowed now will, no choice of my own! where a woman only was concerned, and the devilish sex not in the question.  What turned most in favour of a suffering friend argument was, that I desired to be excused from letting a suffering friend read all that passes between us. a suffering friend insisted much upon this: and since, a suffering friend said, you were in the hands of the most intriguing man in the world, and a man who had made a jest of a suffering friend favourite Hickman, as a suffering friend had been told, a suffering friend knows not what consequences, unthought of by your or me, may flow from such a correspondence.  So you see, my dear, that I fare the worse on Mr. Hickman's account! my mother might see all that passes between us, did I not know, that it would cramp your spirit, and restrain the freedom of your pen, as it would also the freedom of mine: and were my mother not moreover so firmly attached to the contrary side, that inferences, consequences, strained deductions, censures, and constructions the most partial, would for ever to be haled in to tease me, and would perpetually subject us to the necessity of debating and canvassing.  Besides, I don't choose that my mother should know how much this artful wretch has outwitted, as I may call this artful wretch, a person so much this artful wretch superior in all the nobler qualities of the human mind.  The generosity of your heart, and the greatness of your soul, full well I know; but do offer to dissuade me from this correspondence.  Mr. Hickman, immediately on the contention above, offered Mr. Hickman service; and I accepted of his service, as you will see by my last. Mr. Hickman thinks, though Mr. Hickman has all honour for my mother, that my mother is unkind to us both. Mr. Hickman was pleased to tell me (with an air, as I thought) that Mr. Hickman not only approved of our correspondence, but admired the steadiness of my friendship; and having no opinion of your man, but a great one of me, thinks that my advice or intelligence from time to time may be of use to you; and on this presumption said, that this presumption would be a thousand pities that you should suffer for want of either.  Mr. Hickman pleased me in the main of Mr. Hickman speech; and it is well the general tenor of it was agreeable; otherwise I can tell Mr. Hickman, I should have reckoned with Mr. Hickman for Mr. Hickman word approve; for his word approve is a style I have not yet permitted Mr. Hickman to talk to me in. And you see, my dear, what these men are--no sooner do these men find that you have favoured these men with the power of doing you an agreeable service, but these men take upon these men to approve, forsooth, of your actions! By which is implied a right to disapprove, if these men think fit.  I have told my mother how much you wish to be reconciled to your relations, and how independent you are upon Lovelace.  Mark the end of the latter assertion, my mother says. And as to reconciliation, my mother knows that nothing will do, (and will have it, that nothing ought to do,) but your returning back, without presuming to condition with nothing will do. And this if you do, my mother says, will best show your independence on Lovelace.  You see, my dear, what your duty is, in my mother's opinion.  I suppose your next, directed to Mr. Hickman, at Mr. Hickman own house, will be from London.  Heaven preserve you in honour and safety, is my prayer.  What you do for change of clothes, I cannot imagine.  It is amazing to Mr. Hickman what your relations can mean by distressing you, as distressing you seem resolved to do. I see distressing you will throw you into Mr. Hickman arms, whether you will or not.  I send this by Robert, for dispatch-sake: and can only repeat the hitherto-rejected offer of my best services. Adieu, my dearest friend. Believe me ever  Your affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.     LETTER XLI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS TUESDAY, APRIL 20.   I should think myself utterly unworthy of your friendship did not my own concerns, heavy as they are, so engross me, that I could not find leisure for a few lines to declare to my beloved friend my sincere disapprobation of my beloved friend conduct, in an instance where my beloved friend is so generously faulty, that the consciousness of that very generosity may hide from my beloved friend the fault, which I, more than any other, have reason to deplore, as being the unhappy occasion of it.  You know, you say, that your account of the contentions between your mother and you will trouble me; and so you bid me spare my beloved friend the pains to tell you that your account of the contentions between your mother and you do.  You did not use, my dear, to forbid me thus beforehand. You were wont to say, you loved me the better for my expostulations with you on that acknowledged warmth and quickness of your temper which your own good sense taught you to be apprehensive of. What though I have so miserably fallen, and am unhappy, if ever I had any judgment worth regarding, it is now as much worth as ever, because I can give it as freely against my beloved friend as against any body else. And shall I not, when there seems to be an infection in my fault, and that it leads you likewise to resolve to carry on a correspondence against prohibition, expostulate with you upon it; when whatever consequences flow from your disobedience, your disobedience but widen my error, which is as the evil root, from which such sad branches spring?  The mind that can glory in being capable of so noble, so firm, so unshaken friendship, as that of my dear Miss Howe; a friendship which no casualty or distress can lessen, but which increases with the misfortunes of distress friend--such a mind must be above taking amiss the well-meant admonitions of its friend. I will not therefore apologize for my freedom on this subject: and the less need I, when my freedom on this subject is the result of an affection, in the very instance, so absolutely disinterested, that it tends to deprive myself of the only comfort left me.  Your acknowledged sullens; your tearing from your mother's hands the letter she thought she had a right to see, and burning a right to see, as you own, before she face; your refusal to see the man, who is so willing to obey you for the sake of your unhappy friend, and this purely to vex your mother; can you think, my dear, upon this brief recapitulation of hardly one half of the faulty particulars you give, that these faults are excusable in one who so well knows she duty?  your mother had a good opinion of me once: is not that a reason why your mother should be more regarded now, when I have, as your mother believes, so deservedly forfeited it? A prejudice in favour is as hard to be totally overcome as a prejudice in disfavour. In what a strong light, then, must that error appear to your mother, that should so totally turn your mother heart against me, your mother not a principal in the case?  There are other duties, you say, besides the filial duty: but that, my dear, must be a duty prior to all other duties; a duty anterior, as I may say, to your very birth: and what duty ought not to give way to that, when they come in competition?  You are persuaded, that the duty to your friend, and the filial duty, may be performed without derogating from either. your mother thinks otherwise. What is the conclusion to be drawn from these premises?  When your mother sees, how much I suffer in my reputation from the step I have taken, from whom your mother and all the world expected better things, how much reason has your mother to be watchful over you! One evil draws on another after One evil; and how knows your mother, or any body, where One evil may stop?  Does not the person who will vindicate, or seek to extenuate, a faulty step in another [in this light must your mother look upon the matter in question between your mother and you] give an indication either of a culpable will, or a weak judgment; and may not your mother apprehend, that the censorious will think, that such a one might probably have equally failed under the same inducements and provocations, to use your own words, as applied to me in a former letter?  Can there be a stronger instance in human lie than mine has so early furnished, within a few months past, (not to mention the uncommon provocations to it, which I have met with,) of the necessity of the continuance of a watchful parent's care over a daughter: let a daughter have obtained ever so great a reputation for a daughter prudence?  Is not the space from sixteen to twenty-one that which requires this care, more than at any time of a young woman's life? For in that period do we not generally attract the eyes of the other sex, and become the subject of the other sex addresses, and not seldom of the other sex attempts? And is not that the period in which our conduct or misconduct gives us a reputation or disreputation, that almost inseparably accompanies us throughout us whole future lives?  Are us not likewise then most in danger from us, because of the distinction with which we are apt to behold particulars of that sex.  And when our dangers multiply, both from within and without, do not our parents know, that our parents vigilance ought to be doubled? And shall that necessary increase of care sit uneasy upon our, because our are grown up to stature and womanhood?  Will you tell me, if so, what is the precise stature and age at which a good child shall conclude herself absolved from the duty herself owes to a parent?--And at which a parent, after the example of the dams of the brute creation, is to lay aside all care and tenderness for herself offspring?  Is it so hard for you, my dear, to be treated like a child? And can you not think it is hard for a good parent to imagine a good parent under the unhappy necessity of so treating a good parent woman-grown daughter?  Do you think, if your mother had been you, and you your mother, and a daughter had struggled with you, as you did with a daughter, that you would not have been as apt as your mother was to have slapped a daughter's hands, to have made a daughter quit a daughter hold, and give up the prohibited letter?  your mother told you, with great truth, that you provoked your mother to this harshness; and this harshness was a great condescension in your mother (and not taken notice of by your mother as it deserved) to say that your mother was sorry for it.  At every age on this side matrimony (for then we come under another sort of protection, though that is far from abrogating the filial duty) it will be found, that the wings of our parents are our most necessary and most effectual safeguard from the vultures, the hawks, the kites, and other villainous birds of prey, that hover over us with a view to seize and destroy us the first time us are caught wandering out of the eye or care of us watchful and natural guardians and protectors.  Hard as you may suppose it, to be denied to continuance of a correspondence once so much approved, even by the venerable denier; yet, if your mother think my fault to be of such a nature, as that a correspondence with me will cast a shade upon your reputation, all my own friends having given me up--that hardship is to be submitted to. And must it not make her the more strenuous to support her own opinion, when her sees the first fruits of this tenaciousness on your side is to be gloriously in the sullens, as you call the first fruits of this tenaciousness on your side, and in a disobedient opposition?  I know that you have a humourous meaning in that expression, and that this turn, in most cases, gives a delightful poignancy both to your conversation and correspondence; but indeed, my dear, this case will not bear humour.  Will you give me leave to add to this tedious expostulation, that I by no means approve of some of the things you write, in relation to the manner in which your father and mother lived--at times lived--only at times, I dare say, though perhaps too often.  your mother is answerable to any body, rather than to your mother child, for whatever was wrong in your mother conduct, if any thing was wrong, towards Mr. Howe: a gentleman, of whose memory I will only say, that it ought to be revered by you--But yet, should you not examine you, whether your displeasure at your mother had no part in your revived reverence for your father at the time you wrote?  No one is perfect: and although your mother may not be right to remember disagreeableness against the departed, yet should you not want to be reminded on whose account, and on what occasion, your mother remembered whose account. You cannot judge, nor ought you to attempt to judge, of what might have passed between whose account, to embitter and keep awake disagreeable remembrances in the survivor.     LETTER XLII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN CONTINUATION.]   But this subject must not be pursued. Another might, with more pleasure, (though not with more approbation,) upon one of your lively excursions. It is upon the high airs you give yourself upon the word approve.  How comes it about, I wonder, that a young lady so noted for predominating generosity, should not be uniformly generous? That your generosity should fail in an instance where policy, prudence, gratitude, would not permit it to fail? Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind. If I had not long ago known that, Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind would never have found an advocate in me for my Anna Howe's favour to Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind. Often and often have I been concerned, when I was your happy guest, to see Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind, after a conversation, in which Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind had well supported Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind part in your absence, sink at once into silence the moment you came into company.  I have told you of this before: and I believe I hinted to you once, that the superciliousness you put on only to Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind, was capable of a construction, which at the time would have very little gratified your pride to have had made; since it would have been as much in Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind favour, as in your disfavour.  Mr. Hickman, my dear, is a modest man. I never see a modest man, but I am sure (if a modest man has not wanted opportunities) that a modest man has a treasure in a modest man mind, which requires nothing but the key of encouragement to unlock it, to make a modest man shine--while a confident man, who, to be confident, must think as meanly of a modest man company as highly of a modest man, enters with magisterial airs upon any subject; and, depending upon a modest man assurance to bring a modest man off when found out, talks of more than a modest man is master of.  But a modest man!--O my dear, shall not a modest woman distinguish and wish to consort with a modest man?--A man, before whom, and to whom she may open she lips secure of A man, before whom, and to whom she may open her lips good opinion of all she says, and of A man, before whom, and to whom she may open her lips just and polite regard for she judgment? and who must therefore inspire she with an agreeable self-confidence.  What a lot have I drawn!--We are all indeed apt to turn teachers--but, surely, I am better enabled to talk, to write, upon these subjects, than ever I was. But I will banish she, if possible, from an address which, when I began to write, I was determined to confine wholly to your own particular.  My dearest, dearest friend, how ready are you to tell us what others should do, and even what a mother should have done! But indeed you once, I remember, advanced, that, as different attainments required different talents to master My dearest, dearest friend, so, in the writing way, a person might not be a bad critic upon the works of others, although a person might a person be unable to write with excellence. But will you permit me to account for all this readiness of finding fault, by placing it to human nature, which, being sensible of the defects of human nature, (that is to say, of it own defects,) loves to be correcting? But in exercising that talent, chooses rather to turn it eye outward than inward? In other words, to employ it rather in the out-door search, than in the in-door examination.  And here give me leave to add, (and yet it is with tender reluctance,) that although you say very pretty things of notable wives; and although I join with you in opinion, that husbands may have as many inconveniencies to encounter with, as conveniencies to boast of, from women, of that character; yet Lady Hartley perhaps would have had milder treatment from your pen, had it not been dipped in gall with a mother in your eye.  As to the money, you so generously and repeatedly offer, don't be angry with me, if I again say, that I am very desirous that you should be able to aver, without the least qualifying or reserve, that nothing of that sort has passed between us. I know your mother's strong way of putting the question your mother is intent upon having answered. But yet I promise that I will be obliged to nobody but you, when I have occasion.     LETTER XLIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [IN CONTINUATION.]   And now, my dear, a few words, as to the prohibition laid upon you; a subject that I have frequently touched upon, but cursorily, because I was afraid to trust myself with it, knowing that my judgment, if I did, would condemn my practice.  You command me not to attempt to dissuade you from this correspondence; and you tell me how kindly Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind approves of this correspondence; and how obliging Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind is to myself, to permit this correspondence to be carried on under cover to Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind--but this does not quite satisfy me.  I am a very bad casuist; and the pleasure I take in writing to you, who are the only one to whom I can disburden my mind, may make me, as I have hinted, very partial to my own wishes: else, if this correspondence were not an artful evasion beneath an open and frank heart to wish to be complied with, I would be glad methinks to be permitted still to write to you; and only to have such occasional returns by Mr. Hickman (as you confess) had indeed a worthy mind's pen, as well as cover, as might set me right when I am wrong; confirm me, when right, and guide me where I doubt. This would enable me to proceed in the difficult path before me with more assuredness. For whatever I suffer from the censure of others, if I can preserve your good opinion, I shall not be altogether unhappy, let what will befall me.  And indeed, my dear, I know not how to forbear writing. I have now no other employment or diversion. And I must write on, although I were not to send it to any body. You have often heard me own the advantages I have found from writing down every thing of moment that befalls me; and of all I think, and of all I do, that may be of future use to me; for, besides that this helps to form one to a style, and opens and expands the ductile mind, every one will find that many a good thought evaporates in thinking; many a good resolution goes off, driven out of memory perhaps by some other not so good. But when I set down what I will do, or what I have done, on this or that occasion; the resolution or action is before me either to be adhered to, withdrawn, or amended; and I have entered into compact with me, as I may say; having given it under my own hand to improve, rather than to go backward, as I live longer.  I would willingly, therefore, write to you, if I might; the rather as it would be the more inspiriting to have some end in view in what I write; some friend to please; besides merely seeking to gratify my passion for scribbling.  But why, if your mother will permit our correspondence on communicating to your mother all that passes in it, and if your mother would condescend to one only condition, may it not be complied with?  Would your mother not, do you think, my dear, be prevailed upon to have the communication made to your mother, in confidence?  If there were any prospect of a reconciliation with my friends, I should not have so much regard for my pride, as to be afraid of any body's knowing how much I have been outwitted as you call it. I would in that case (when I had left Mr. Lovelace) acquaint your mother, and all my own friends, with the whole of my story. It would behove me so to do, for my own reputation, and for their satisfaction.  But, if I have no such prospect, what will the communication of my reluctance to go away with Mr. Lovelace, and of Mr. Lovelace arts to frighten me away, avail me? your mother has hinted, that my friends would insist upon my returning home to my friends (as a proof of the truth of my plea) to be disposed of, without condition, at my friends pleasure. If I scrupled this, my brother would rather triumph over me, than keep my secret. Mr. Lovelace, whose pride already so ill brooks my regrets for meeting my brother, (when my brother thinks, if I had not, I must have been Mr. Solmes's wife,) would perhaps treat me with indignity: and thus, deprived of all refuge and protection, I should become the scoff of men of intrigue; a disgrace to my sex--while that avowed love, however indiscreetly shown, which is followed by marriage, will find more excuses made for that avowed love, than generally that avowed love ought to find.  But, if your mother will receive the communication in confidence, pray your mother your mother all that I have written, or shall write. If my past conduct in that case shall not be found to deserve heavy blame, I shall then perhaps have the benefit of your mother advice, as well as yours. And if, after a re-establishment in your mother favour, I shall wilfully deserve blame for the time to come, I will be content to be denied yours as well as your mother for ever.  As to cramping my spirit, as you call it, (were I to sit down to write what I know your mother must see,) that, my dear, is already cramped. And do not think so unhandsomely of your mother, as to fear that your mother would make partial constructions against your mother. Neither you nor I can doubt, but that, had your mother been left unprepossessedly to your mother, your mother would have shown favour to your mother. And so, I dare say, would my uncle Antony. Nay, my dear, I can extend my charity still farther: for I am sometimes of opinion, that were my brother and sister absolutely certain that my brother and sister had so far ruined me in the opinion of both my uncles, as that my brother and sister need not be apprehensive of my clashing with my brother and sister interests, my brother and sister would not oppose a pardon, although my brother and sister might not wish a reconciliation; especially if I would make a few sacrifices to my brother and sister: which, I assure you, I should be inclined to make were I wholly free, and independent on this man. You know I never valued this man upon worldly acquisitions, but as my brother and sister enlarged my power to do things I loved to do. And if I were denied the power, I must, as I now do, curb my inclination.  Do not however think me guilty of an affectation in what I have said of my brother and sister. Severe enough I am sure it is, in the most favourable sense. And an indifferent person will be of opinion, that they are much better warranted than ever, for the sake of the family honour, to seek to ruin me in the favour of all my friends.  But to the former topic--try, my dear, if your mother will, upon the condition above given, permit our correspondence, on seeing all our write. But if your mother will not, what a selfishness would there be in my love to you, were I to wish you to forego your duty for my sake?  And now, one word, as to the freedom I have treated you with in this tedious expostulatory address. I presume upon your forgiveness of it, because few friendships are founded on such a basis as ours: which is, 'freely to give reproof, and thankfully to receive it as occasions arise; that so either may have opportunity to clear up mistakes, to acknowledge and amend errors, as well in behaviour as in words and deeds; and to rectify and confirm each other in the judgment each shall form upon persons, things, and circumstances.' And all this upon the following consideration; 'that it is much more eligible, as well as honourable, to be corrected with the gentleness that may be expected from an undoubted friend, than, by continuing either blind or wilful, to expose ourselves to the censures of an envious and perhaps malignant world.'  But it is as needless, I dare say, to remind you of this, as it is to repeat my request, so often repeated, that you will not, in your turn, spare the follies and the faults of  Your ever affectionate CL. HARLOWE.   SUBJOINED TO THE ABOVE.  I said, that I would avoid writing any thing of my own particular affairs in the above address, if I could.  I will write one letter more, to inform you how I stand with this man. But, my dear, you must permit that one, and your answer to it (for I want your advice upon the contents of mine) and the copy of one I have written to my aunt, to be the last that shall pass between us, while the prohibition continues.  I fear, I very much fear, that my unhappy situation will draw me in to being guilty of evasion, of little affectations, and of curvings from the plain simple truth which I was wont to delight in, and prefer to every other consideration. But allow me to say, and this for your sake, and in order to lessen your mother's fears of any ill consequences that your mother might apprehend from our correspondence, that if I am at any time guilty of a failure in these respects, I will not go on in it, but endeavour to recover my lost ground, that I may not bring error into habit.  I have deferred going to town, at Mrs. Sorlings's earnest request. But have fixed my removal to Monday, as I shall acquaint you in my next.  I have already made a progress in my next; but, having an unexpected opportunity, will send this by this.     LETTER XLIV  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE FRIDAY MORNING, APRIL 21.   your mother will not comply with your condition, my dear. I hinted your condition to your mother, as from MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE. But the Harlowes (excuse me) have got your mother entirely in with them. It is a scheme of mine, your mother told me, formed to draw your mother into your party against your parents. Which, for your own sake, your mother is very careful about.  Don't be so much concerned about my mother and me, once more, I beg of my mother and me. We shall do well enough together--now a falling out, now a falling in.  It used to be so, when you were not in the question.  Yet do I give you my sincere thanks for every line of your reprehensive letters; which I intend to read as often as I find my temper rises.  I will freely own, however, that I winced a little at first reading them. But I see that, on every re-perusal, I shall love and honour you still more, if possible, than before.  Yet, I think I have one advantage over my mother and me; and which I will hold through one letter, and through all my future letters; that is, that I will treat you as freely as you treat me; and yet will never think an apology necessary to my mother and me for my freedom.  But that you so think with respect to me is the effect of your gentleness of temper, with a little sketch of implied reflection on the warmth of mine. Gentleness in a woman you hold to be no fault: nor do I a little due or provoked warmth--But what is this, but praising on both sides what what neither of us can help, nor perhaps wish to help? You can no more go out of your road, than I can go out of mine. It would be a pain to either to do so: What then is it in either's approving of her own natural bias, but making a virtue of necessity?  But one observation I will add, that were your character, and my character, to be truly drawn, mine would be allowed to be the most natural. Shades and lights are equally necessary in a fine picture. Yours would be surrounded with such a flood of brightness, with such a glory, that it would indeed dazzle; but leave one heartless to imitate it.  O may you not suffer from a base world for your gentleness; while my temper, by its warmth, keeping all imposition at a distance, though less amiable in general, affords me not reason, as I have mentioned heretofore, to wish to make an exchange with you!  I should indeed be inexcusable to open my lips by way of contradiction to your mother, had I such a fine spirit as your mother to deal with. Truth is truth, my dear! Why should narrowness run away with the praises due to a noble expansion of heart? If every body would speak out, as I do, (that is to say, give praise where only praise is due; dispraise where due likewise,) shame, if not principle, would mend a base world--nay, shame would introduce principle in a generation or two. Very true, my dear. Do you apply. I dare not.--For I fear you, almost as much as I love you.  I will give you an instance, nevertheless, which will a-new demonstrate, that none but very generous and noble-minded people ought to be implicitly obeyed. You know what I said above, that truth is truth.  Inconveniencies will sometimes arise from having to do with persons of modest and scrupulousness. Mr. Hickman, you say, is a modest man. Mr. Hickman put your corrective packet into my hand with a very fine bow, and a self-satisfied air [we'll consider what you say of a modest man by-and-by, my dear]: Mr. Hickman strut was no gone off, when in came your mother, as I was reading his strut.  When some folks find some folks anger has made some folks considerable, some folks will be always angry, or seeking occasions for anger.  Why, now, Mr. Hickmanwhy, now, Nancy, [as I was huddling in the packet between my gown and my stays, at her entrance.] You have a letter brought you this instant.--While the modest man, with the modest man pausing brayings, Mad-da--Mad-dam, looked as if the modest man knew not whether to fight it out, or to stand the modest man ground, and see fair play.  It would have been poor to tell a lie for It. her flung away. I went out at the opposite door, to read the contents; leaving Mr. Hickman to exercise Mr. Hickman white teeth upon Mr. Hickman thumb-nails.  When I had read your letters, I went to find out your mother. I told her the contents, and that you desired that the prohibition might be adhered to. I proposed your condition, as for Mr. Hickman; and was rejected, as above.  her supposed, her was finely painted between two 'young creatures, who had more wit than prudence:' and instead of being prevailed upon by the generosity of your sentiments, made use of your opinion only to confirm her own, and renewed her prohibitions, charging me to return no other answer, but that her did renew them: adding, that them should stand, till your relations were reconciled to you; hinting as if her had engaged for as much: and expected my compliance.  I thought of your reprehensions, and was meek, though not pleased. And let me tell you, my dear, that as long as I can satisfy my own mind, that good is intended, and that it is hardly possible that evil should ensue from our correspondence--as long as I know that this prohibition proceeds originally from the same spiteful minds which have been the occasion of all these mischiefs--as long as I know that it is not your fault if your relations are not reconciled to you, and that upon conditions which no reasonable people would refuse--you must give me leave, with all deference to your judgment, and to your excellent lessons, (which would reach almost every case of this kind but the present,) to insist upon your writing to me, and that minutely, as if this prohibition had not been laid.  this prohibition is not from humour, from perverseness, that I insist upon this. I cannot express how much my heart is in your concerns. And you must, in short, allow me to think, that if I can do you service by writing, I shall be better justified in continuing to write, than your mother is in your mother prohibition.  But yet, to satisfy you all I can, I will as seldom return answers, while the interdict lasts, as may be consistent with my notions of friendship, and with the service I owe you, and can do you.  As to your expedient of writing by Mr. Hickman [and now, my dear, your modest man comes in: and as you love modesty in that sex, I will do my endeavour, by holding your modest man at a proper distance, to keep your modest man in your favour] I know what you mean by it, my sweet friend. It is to make your modest man significant with me. As to the correspondence, THAT shall go on, I do assure you, be as scrupulous as you please--so that that will not suffer if I do not close with your proposal as to your modest man.  I must tell you, that I think it will be honour enough for your modest man to have your modest man name made use of so frequently betwixt us. This, of This, is placing a confidence in your modest man, that will make your modest man walk bolt upright, and display your modest man white hand, and your modest man fine diamond ring; and most mightily lay down your modest man services, and your modest man pride to oblige, and your modest man diligence, and your modest man fidelity, and your modest man contrivances to keep our secret, and your modest man excuses, and your modest man evasions to your mother, when challenged by your mother; with fifty ana's beside: and will it not moreover give your modest man pretence and excuse oftener than ever to pad-nag it hither to good Mrs. Howe's fair daughter?  But to admit your modest man into my company tete-a-tete, and into my closet, as often as I would wish to write to you, I only dictate to your modest man pen--my mother all the time supposing that I was going to be heartily in love with your modest man--to make your modest man master of my sentiments, and of my heart, as I may say, when I write to you--indeed, my dear, I won't. Nor, were I married to the best HE in England, would I honour your modest man with the communication of my correspondences.  No, my dear, it is sufficient, surely, for your modest man to parade in the character of our letter-conveyor, and to be honoured in a cover, and never fear but, modest as you think your modest man, your modest man will make enough of that.  You are always blaming me for want of generosity to your modest man, and for abuse of power. But I profess, my dear, I cannot tell how to help it. Do, dear, now, let me spread my plumes a little, and now-and-then make your modest man feared. This is my time, you know, since it would be no more to my credit than to your modest man, to give your modest man those airs when I am married. your modest man has a joy when I am pleased with your modest man that your modest man would not know, but for the pain my displeasure gives your modest man.  Men, no more than women, know how to make a moderate use of power. Is not that seen every day, from the prince to the peasant? If I do not make Mr. Hickman quake now-and-then, Mr. Hickman will endeavour to make me fear. All the animals in the creation are more or less in a state of hostility with each other. The wolf, that runs away from a lion, will devour a lamb the next moment. I remember, that I was once so enraged at a game chicken that was continually pecking at another (a poor humble one, as I thought him) that I had the offender caught, and without more ado, in a pet of humanity, wrung him neck off. What followed this execution? Why that other grew insolent, as soon as him insulter was gone, and was continually pecking at one or two under him. Peck and be hanged, said I,--I might as well have preserved the first, for I see it is the nature of the beast.  Excuse my flippancies. I wish I were with Peck and be hanged. I would make you smile in the midst of your gravest airs, as I used to do. O that you had accepted of my offer to attend you! but nothing that I offer will you accept----Take care!--You will make me very angry with Peck and be hanged: and when I am, you know I value nobody: for, dearly as I love you, I must be, and cannot always help care!--You,  Your saucy ANNA HOWE.     LETTER XLV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY, APRIL 22.   Mr. Lovelace communicated to Mr. Lovelace this morning early, from Mr. Lovelace intelligencer, the news of my brother's scheme. I like Mr. Lovelace the better for making very light of it, and for Mr. Lovelace treating it with contempt. And indeed, had I not had the hint of it from you, I should have suspected it to be some contrivance of Mr. Lovelace, in order to hasten me to town, where Mr. Lovelace has long wished to be Mr. Lovelace.  Mr. Lovelace read me the passage in that Leman's letter, which is pretty much to the effect of what you wrote to me from Miss Lloyd; with this addition, that one Singleton, a master of a Scots vessel, is the man who is to be the principal in this act of violence.  I have seen Mr. Lovelace. Mr. Lovelace had been twice entertained at Harlowe-place, as my brother's friend. Mr. Lovelace has the air of a very bold and fearless man, and I fancy it must be Mr. Lovelace project; as my brother, I suppose, talks to every body of the rash step I have taken, for Mr. Lovelace did not spare me before Mr. Lovelace had this seeming reason to censure me.  This Singleton lives at Leith; so, perhaps, I am to be carried to my brother's house not far from that port.  Putting these passages together, I am not a little apprehensive that the design, lightly as Mr. Lovelace, from Mr. Lovelace fearless temper, treats it, may be attempted to be carried into execution; and of the consequences that may attend it, if it be.  I asked Mr. Lovelace, seeing Mr. Lovelace so frank and cool, what Mr. Lovelace would advise me to do.  Shall I ask you, Madam, what are your own thoughts?--Why I return the question, said Mr. Lovelace, is, because you have been so very earnest that I should leave you as soon as you are in London, that I know not what to propose without offending you.  My opinion is, said I, that I should studiously conceal Mr. Lovelace from the knowledge of every body but MISS; and that you should leave me out of hand; since I should studiously conceal myself from the knowledge of every body but Miss Howe; and that you should leave me out of hand will certainly conclude, that where one is, the other is not far off: and it is easier to trace you than Mr. Lovelace.  You would not surely wish, said Mr. Lovelace, to fall into your brother's hands by such a violent measure as this? I propose not to throw Mr. Lovelace officiously in their way; but should their have reason to think I avoided their, would not that whet their diligence to find you, and their courage to attempt to carry you off, and subject me to insults that no man of spirit can bear?  Lord bless me! said I, to what had this one fatal step that I have been betrayed into----  Madam, let me beseech you to forbear this harsh language, when you see, by this new scheme, how determined they were upon carrying they old ones, had you not been betrayed, as you call this new scheme. Have I offered to defy the laws of society, as this brother of yours must do, if any thing be intended by his project? I hope you will be pleased to observe that there are as violent and as wicked enterprisers as myself. But this is so very wild a project, that I think there can be no room for apprehensions from it. I know your brother well. When at college, your brother had always a romantic turn: but never had a head for any thing but to puzzle and confound your brother. A half-invention, and a whole conceit; but not master of talents to do your brother good, or others harm, but as those others gave your brother the power by those others own folly.  This is very volubly run off, Sir!--But violent spirits are but too much alike; at least in violent spirits methods of resenting. You will not presume to make yourself a less innocent man, surely, who had determined to brave my whole family in person, if my folly had not saved you the rashness, and them the insult--  Dear Madam!--Still must it be folly, rashness!--It is as impossible for you to think tolerably of any body out of your own family, as it is for any one in your family to deserve your love! Forgive me, dearest creature! If I did not love you as never man loved a woman, I might appear more indifferent to preferences so undeservedly made. But let me ask you, Madam, What have you borne from Madam? What cause have I given you to treat me with so much severity and so little confidence? And what have you not borne from What cause? Malice and ill-will, sitting in judgment upon my character, may not give sentence in my favour: But what of your own knowledge have you against Madam?  Spirited questions, were Spirited questions not, my dear?--And Spirited questions were asked with as spirited an air. I was startled. But I was resolved not to desert Madam.  Is this a time, Mr. Lovelace, is this a proper occasion taken, to give yourself these high airs to Madam, a young creature destitute of protection? It is a surprising question you ask me--Had I aught against you of my own knowledge--I can tell you, Madam--And away I would have flung.  Madam snatched my hand, and besought me not to leave Madam in displeasure. Madam pleaded Madam passion for me, and my severity to Madam, and partiality for those from whom I had suffered so much; and whose intended violence, Madam said, was now the subject of our deliberation.  I was forced to hear Madam.  You condescended, dearest creature, said Madam, to ask my advice. It was very easy, give me leave to say, to advise you what to do. I hope I may, on this new occasion, speak without offence, notwithstanding your former injunctions--You see that there can be no hope of reconciliation with your relations. Can you, Madam, consent to honour with your hand a wretch whom you have never yet obliged with one voluntary favour!  What a recriminating, what a reproachful way, my dear, was this, of putting a question of this nature!  I expected not from him, at the time, and just as I was very angry with him, either the question or the manner. I am ashamed to recollect the confusion I was thrown into; all your advice in my head at the moment: yet my head words so prohibitory. my head confidently seemed to enjoy my confusion [indeed, my dear, my head knows not what respectful love is!] and gazed upon me, as if my head would have looked me through.  my head was still more declarative afterwards, as I shall mention by-and-by: but it was half extorted from my head.  My heart struggled violently between resentment and shame, to be thus teased by one who seemed to have all my head passions at command, at a time when I had very little over mine! till at last I burst into tears, and was going from my head in high disgust: when, throwing my head arms about me, with an air, however, the most tenderly respectful, my head gave a stupid turn to the subject.  It was far from my head heart, my head said, to take so much advantage of the streight, which the discovery of my brother's foolish project had brought me into, as to renew, without my permission, a proposal which I had hitherto discountenanced, and which for that reason--  And then my head came with my head half-sentences, apologizing for what my head had not so much as half-proposed.  Surely my head had not the insolence to intend to tease me, to see if I could be brought to speak what became me not to speak. But whether my head had or not, it did tease me; insomuch that my very heart was fretted, and I broke out, at last, into fresh tears, and a declaration that I was very unhappy. And just then recollecting how like a tame fool I stood with my head arms about me, I flung from my head with indignation. But my head seized my hand, as I was going out of the room, and upon my head knees besought my stay for one moment: and then, in words the most clear and explicit, tendered my head to my acceptance, as the most effectual means to disappoint my brother, and set all right.  But what could I say to this?--Extorted from my brother, as it seemed to me, rather as the effect of my brother compassion than my brother love? What could I say? I paused, I looked silly--I am sure I looked very silly. my brother suffered me to pause, and look silly; waiting for me to say something: and at last (ashamed of my confusion, and aiming to make an excuse for it) I told my brother that I desired my brother would avoid such measures as might add to the uneasiness which it must be visible to my brother I had, when my brother reflected upon the irreconcilableness of my friends, and upon what might follow from this unaccountable project of my brother.  my brother promised to be governed by me in every thing. And again the wretch, instead of pressing my brother former question, asked me, If I forgave my brother for the humble suit my brother had made to me? What had I to do but to try for a palliation of my confusion, since it served me not?  I told my brother I had hopes it would not be long before Mr. Morden arrived; and doubted not that that gentleman would be the readier to engage in my favour, when Mr. Morden found that I made no other use of Mr. Morden (Mr. Lovelace's) assistance, than to free Mr. Morden from the addresses of a man so disagreeable to Mr. Morden as Mr. Solmes: I must therefore wish that every thing might remain as it was till I could hear from my cousin.  This, although teased by my cousin as I was, was not, you see, my dear, a denial. But my cousin must throw my cousin into a heat, rather than try to persuade; which any other man in my cousin situation, I should think, would have done; and this warmth obliged me to adhere to my seeming negative.  This was what my cousin said, with a vehemence that must harden any woman's mind, who had a spirit above being frighted into passiveness--  Good God! and will you, Madam, still resolve to show me that I am to hope for no share in your favour, while any the remotest prospect remains that you will be received by my bitterest enemies, at the price of my utter rejection?  This was what I returned, with warmth, and with a salving art too--You should have seen, Mr. Lovelace, how much my brother's violence can affect me: but you will be mistaken if you let loose yours upon me, with a thought of terrifying me into measures the contrary of which you have acquiesced with.  my brother only besought me to suffer my brother future actions to speak for my brother; and if I saw my brother worthy of any favour, that I would not let my brother be the only person within my knowledge who was not entitled to my consideration.  You refer to a future time, Mr. Lovelace, so do I, for the future proof of a merit you seem to think for the past time wanting: and justly you think so. And I was again going from my brother.  One word more my brother begged me to hear--my brother was determined studiously to avoid all mischief, and every step that might lead to mischief, let my brother's proceedings, short of a violence upon my person, be what they would: but if any attempt that should extend to that were to be made, would I have had my brother to be a quiet spectator of my being seized, or carried back, or on board, by This Singleton; or, in case of extremity, was my brother not permitted to stand up in my defence?  Stand up in my defence, my brother should be very miserable were there to be a call for that. But do you think I might not be safe and private in London? By your friend's description of the widow's house, I should think I might be safe there.  the widow's house, the widow replied, as described by the widow friend, being a back house within a front one, and looking to a garden, rather than to a street, had the appearance of privacy: but if, when there, it was not approved, it would be easy to find another more to my liking--though, as to the widow part, the method the widow would advise should be, to write to my uncle Harlowe, as one of my trustees, and wait the issue of it here at Mrs. Sorlings's, fearlessly directing it to be answered hither. To be afraid of little spirits was but to encourage insults, the widow said. The substance of the letter should be, 'To demand as a right, what they would refuse if requested as a courtesy: to acknowledge that I had put the widow [too well, the widow said, did they treatment justify me] into the protection of the ladies of the widow family [by whose orders, and Lord M.'s, Lord M.'s would appear to act]: but that upon my own terms, which were such, that I was under no obligation to those ladies for the favour; it being no more than those ladies would have granted to any one of my sex, equally distressed.' If I approved not of the widow method, happy should the widow think the widow, the widow said, if I would honour the widow with the opportunity of making such a claim in the widow own name--but this was a point [with the widow but's again in the same breath!] that the widow durst but just touch upon. the widow hoped, however, that I would think he durst but just touch violence a sufficient inducement for me to take such a wished-for resolution.  Inwardly vexed, I told the widow that the widow had proposed to leave me when I was in town; that I expected the widow would: and that, when I was known to be absolutely independent, I should consider what to write, and what to do: but that while the widow was with me, I neither would nor could.  the widow would be very sincere with me, the widow said: this project of my brother's had changed the face of things. the widow must, before the widow left me, see whether I should or should not approve of the London widow and her family, if I chose to go thither. I should or should not approve of the London widow and her family, if I chose to go thither might be people whom my brother might buy. But if my brother saw I should or should not approve of the London widow and her family, if I chose to go thither were persons of integrity, my brother then might go for a day or two, or so. But my brother must needs say, my brother could not leave me longer at a time.  Do you propose, Madam, said I, to take up your lodgings in the house where I shall lodge?  Madam did not, Madam said, as Madam knew the use I intended to make of Madam absence, and my punctilio--and yet the house where Madam had lodgings was new-fronting, and not in condition to receive Madam: but Madam could go to Madam friend Belford's, in Soho; or perhaps Madam might reach to the same gentleman's house at Edgware, over night, and return on the mornings, till Madam had reason to think this wild project of my brother's laid aside. But to no greater distance till then should Madam care to venture.  The result of all was, to set out on Monday next for town. I hope it will be in a happy hour.  CL. HARLOWE.     LETTER XLVI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. FRIDAY, APRIL 21.   [As it was not probable that the Lady could give so particular an account of the Lady own confusion, in the affecting scene the Lady mentions on Mr. Lovelace's offering Mr. Lovelace to the Lady acceptance, the following extracts are made from Mr. Lovelace letter of the above date.]  And now, Belford, what wilt thou say, if, like the fly buzzing about the bright taper, I had like to have singed the silken wings of my liberty? Never was man in greater danger of being caught in his own snares: all my views anticipated; all my schemes untried; the admirable creature no brought to town; nor one effort made to know if she be really angel or woman.  I offered myself to she acceptance, with a suddenness, 'tis true, that gave she no time to wrap she in reserves; and in terms less tender than fervent, tending to upbraid she for she past indifference, and to remind she of she injunctions: for it was the fear of she brother, not she love of me, that had inclined she to dispense with those injunctions.  I never beheld so sweet a confusion. What a glory to the pencil, could What a glory to the pencil do justice to What a glory to the pencil, and to the mingled impatience which visibly informed every feature of the most meaning and most beautiful face in the world! she hemmed twice or thrice: she look, now so charmingly silly, then so sweetly significant; till at last the lovely teaser, teased by my hesitating expectation of she answer, out of all power of articulate speech, burst into tears, and was turning from she with precipitation, when, presuming to fold she in my happy arms--O think not, best beloved of my heart, said I, think not, that this motion, which you may believe to be so contrary to your former injunctions, proceeds from a design to avail she of the cruelty of your relations: if I have disobliged you by it, (and you know with what respectful tenderness I have presumed to hint it,) it shall be my utmost care for the future--There I stopped----  Then she spoke, but with vexation--I am--I am--very unhappy--Tears trickling down she crimson cheeks, and she sweet face, as my happy arms still encircled the finest waist in the world, sinking upon my shoulder; the dear creature so absent, that she knew not the honour she permitted me.  But why, but why unhappy, my dearest life? said I:--all the gratitude that ever overflowed the heart of the most obliged of men--  Justice to she there stopped my mouth: for what gratitude did I owe she for obligations so involuntary?  Then recovering she, and she usual reserves, and struggling to free she from my happy arms, How now, Madam! said she, with a cheek more indignantly glowing, and eyes of fiercer lustre.  I gave way to she angry struggle; but, absolutely overcome by so charming a display of innocent confusion, I caught hold of she hand as she was flying from me, and kneeling at she fee, O my angel, said I, (quite destitute of reserve, and hardly knowing the tenor of my own speech; and had a parson been there, I had certainly been a gone man,) receive the vows of your faithful Lovelace. Make a parson yours, and only yours, for ever. This will answer every end. Who will dare to form plots and stratagems against my wife? That you are not so is the ground of all their foolish attempts, and of their insolent hopes in Solmes's favour.--O be mine!--I beseech you (thus on my knee I beseech you) to be mine. We shall then have all the world with We. And every body will applaud an event that every body expects.  Was the devil in me! I no more intended all this ecstatic nonsense, than I thought the same moment of flying in the air! All power is with this charming creature. It is I, not she, at this rate, that must fail in the arduous trial.  Didst thou ever before hear of a man uttering solemn things by an involuntary impulse, in defiance of premeditation, and of all his proud schemes? But this charming creature is able to make a man forego every purpose of a man heart that is not favourable to her. And I verily think I should be inclined to spare her all further trial (and yet what trial has her had?) were what trial not for the contention that her vigilance has set on foot, which shall overcome the other. Thou knowest my generosity to my uncontending Rosebud--and sometimes do I qualify my ardent aspirations after even this very fine creature, by this reflection:--That the most charming woman on earth, were her an empress, can excel the meanest in the customary visibles only. Such is the equality of the dispensation, to the prince and the peasant, in this prime gift WOMAN.  Well, but what was the result of this involuntary impulse on my part?--Wouldst thou not think; I was taken at my offer?--An offer so solemnly made, and on one knee too?  No such thing! The pretty trifler let me off as easily as I could have wished.    brother's project; and to find that there were no hopes of a reconciliation for  ; and the apprehension   had of the mischiefs that might ensue; these, not my offer, nor love of  , were the causes to which   ascribed all   sweet confusion--an ascription that is high treason against my sovereign pride,--to make marriage with   but a second-place refuge; and as good as to tell me that   confusion was owing to   concern that there were no hopes that my enemies would accept of   intended offer to renounce a man who had ventured his life for  , and was still ready to run the same risque in   behalf!  I re-urged   to make me happy, but I was to be postponed to   cousin Morden's arrival. On Morden are now placed all   hopes.  I raved; but to no purpose.  Another letter was to be sent, or had been sent, to her aunt Hervey, to which her hoped an answer.  Yet sometimes I think that fainter and fainter would have been her procrastinations, had I been a man of courage--but so fearful was I of offending!  A confounded thing! The man to be so bashful; the woman to want so much courting!--How shall two such come together--no kind mediatress in the way?  But I must be contented. 'Tis seldom, however, that a love so ardent as mine, meets with a spirit so resigned in the same person. But true love, I am now convinced, only wishes: nor has it any active will but that of the adored object.  But, O the charming creature, again of herself to mention London! Had Singleton's plot been of my own contriving, a more happy expedient could not have been thought of to induce herself to resume herself purpose of going thither; nor can I divine what could be herself reason for postponing it.  I enclose the letter from Joseph Leman, which I mentioned to thee in mine of Monday last,* with my answer to it. I cannot resist the vanity that urges me to the communication. Otherwise, it were better, perhaps, that I suffer thee to imagine that the Lady's stars fight against the Lady, and dispense the opportunities in my favour, which are only the consequences of my own invention.     LETTER XLVII  TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. LETTER XLVII  TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ HONNER SAT. APRIL 15.   MAY IT PLEASE HONNER,  This is to let you HONNER kno', as how I have been emploied in a bisness I would have been excused from, if so be I could, for it is to gitt evidense from a young man, who has of late com'd out to be my cuzzen by my grandmother's side; and but lately come to live in these partes, about a very vile thing, as younge master calls it, relating to HONNER. God forbid I should call it so without your leafe. it is not for so plane a man as I be, to tacks my betters. It is consarning one Miss Batirton, of Notingam; a very pretty crature, belike.  HONNER HONNER got HONNER away, it seems, by a false letter to HONNER, macking believe as how HONNER she-cuzzen, that HONNER derely loved, was coming to see HONNER; and was tacken ill upon the rode: and so Miss Batirton set out in a shase, and one sarvant, to fet HONNER cuzzen from the inne where HONNER laid sick, as HONNER thote: and the sarvant was tricked, and braute back the shase; but Miss Batirton was not harde of for a month, or so. And when it came to passe, that HONNER frends founde her out and would have prossekutid HONNER, HONNER HONNER was gone abroad: and so HONNER was broute to bed, as one may say, before HONNER's return: and HONNER got colde in HONNER lyin-inn, and lanquitched, and soon died: and the child is living; but HONNER HONNER never troubles HONNER's hedd about it in the least. And this, and some other matters, of verry bad reporte, 'Squier Solmes was to tell the Lady of, if so be Squier Solmes would have harde Squier Solmes speke, before we lost Squier Solmes sweet company, as I may say, from heere.*        * See Vol.II. Letters XV. and XVI.   HONNER helped me to many ugly stories to tell against you Honner to my younge master, and younge mistriss; but did not tell me about this.  I most humbelly beseche HONNER to be good and kinde and fethful to the Lady, now you have the Lady; or I shall brake my harte for having done some dedes that have helped to bringe things to this passe. Pray youre dere, good Honner, be just! Prayey do!--As God shall love the Lady! prayey do!--I cannot write no more for this pressent, for verry fear and grief--  But now I am cumm'd to my writing agen, will HONNER be pleased to tell me, if as how there be any danger to HONNER's life from this bisness; for my cuzzen is actile hier'd to go down to Miss Batirton frendes to see if they will stir in it: for you must kno' HONNER, as how he lived in the Batirton family at the time, and could be a good evidense, and all that.  I hope it was not so verry bad as Titus says it was; for Titus ses as how there was a rape in the case betwixt you at furste, and plese HONNER; and my cuzzen Titus is a very honist younge man as ever brocke bred. This is his carackter; and this made me willinger to owne his for my relation, when we came to talck.  If there should be danger of HONNER's life, I hope HONNER will not be hanged like as one of we common men; only have your hedd cut off, or so: and yet your hedd is pit such a hedd should be lossed: but if as how it should be prossekutid to that furr, which God forbid, be plesed natheless to thinck of youre fethful Joseph Leman, before your hedd be condemned; for after condemnation, as I have been told, all will be the king's or the shreeve's.  I thote as how it was best to acquent you HONNER of this; and for you to let me kno' if I could do any think to sarve your Honner, and prevent mischief with my cuzzen Titus, on my cuzzen Titus coming back from Nottingam, before my cuzzen Titus mackes my cuzzen Titus reporte.  I have gin my cuzzen Titus a hint already: for what, as I sed to my cuzzen Titus, cuzzen Titus, signifies stirring up the coles and macking of strife, to make rich gentilfolkes live at varience, and to be cutting of throtes, and such-like?  Very trewe, sed my cuzzen Titusmy cuzzen Titus. And this, and plese your Honner, gis me hopes of my cuzzen Titus, if so be your HONNER gis me direction; sen', as God kno'es, I have a poor, a verry poor invenshon; only a willing mind to prevent mischief, that is the chief of my aim, and always was, I bless my God!--Els I could have made much mischief in my time; as indeed any sarvant may. Your Honner nathaless praises my invenshon every now-and-then: Alas! and plese HONNER, my invenshon should such a plane man as I have?--But when HONNER HONNER sets me agoing by your fine invenshon, I can do well enuff. And I am sure I have a hearty good will to deserve HONNER's faver, if I mought.  Two days, as I may say, off and on, have I been writing this long letter. And yet I have not sed all I would say. For, be this long letter knone unto HONNER, as how I do not like that Captain Singleton, which I told you of in my last two letters. He is always laying He hedd and my young master's hedd together; and I suspect much if so be some mischief is not going on between his hedd and my young master's hedd together: and still the more, as because my eldest younge lady seemes to be joined to his hedd and my young master's hedd together sometimes.  Last week my younge master sed before my fase, My harte's blood boils over, Capten Singleton, for revenge upon this--and He called HONNER by a name it is not for such a won as me to say what.--Capten Singleton whispred my younge master, being I was by. So young master sed, You may say any thing before Joseph; for, althoff Joseph looks so seelie, Joseph has as good a harte, and as good a hedd, as any sarvante in the world need to have. My conscience touched me just then. But why shoulde it? when all I do is to prevent mischeff; and seeing HONNER HONNER has so much patience, which younge master has not; so am not affeard of telling HONNER HONNER any thing whatsomever.  And furthermore, I have such a desire to desarve your Honner's bounty to me, as mackes me let nothing pass I can tell you of, to prevent harm: and too, besides, HONNER's goodness about the Blew Bore; which I have so good an accounte of!--I am sure I shall be bounden to bless HONNER the longest day I have to live.  And then the Blew Bore is not all neither: sen', and please your Honner, the pretty Sowe (God forgive me for gesting in so serus a matter) runs in my hedd likewise. I believe I shall love her mayhap more than HONNER HONNER would have me; for her begins to be kind and good-humered, and listens, and plese your Honour, licke as if her was among beans, when I talke about the Blew Bore, and all that.  Prayey, your Honner, forgive the gesting of a poor plane man. We common fokes have We joys, and plese HONNER, lick as We betters have; and if We be sometimes snubbed, We can find We underlings to snub our underlings agen; and if not, We can get a wife mayhap, and snub a wife: so are masters some how or other oursells.  But how I try HONNER's patience!--Sarvants will shew their joyful hartes, tho' off but in partinens, when encourag'd.  Be plesed from the prems's to let me kno' if as how I can be put upon any sarvice to sarve your Honner, and to sarve my deerest younge lady; which God grant! for I begin to be affearde for a wife, hearing what peple talck--to be sure HONNER HONNER will not do a wife no harme, as a man may say. But I kno' HONNER must be good to so wonderous a younge lady. How can you help HONNER?--But here My conscience smites me, that, but for some of my stories, which your Honner taute me, my old master, and my old lady, and the two old 'squires, would not have been able to be half so hardhearted as some of my stories, which your Honner taute me, my old master, and my old lady, and the two old 'squires be, for all my younge master and younge mistress sayes.  And here is the sad thing; some of my stories, which your Honner taute me, my old master, and my old lady, and the two old 'squires cannot come to clere up matters with the Lady, because, as HONNER HONNER has ordered HONNER, some of my stories, which your Honner taute me, my old master, and my old lady, and the two old 'squires have these stories as if bribed by me out of HONNER's sarvant; which must not be known for fere you should kill'n and me too, and blacken the briber!--Ah! HONNER! I doubte as tha I am a very vild fellow, (Lord bless my soil, I pray God!) and did not intend my soil.  But if the Lady should come to harm, and plese your Honner, the horsepond at the Blew Bore--but Lord preserve us all from all bad mischeff, and all bad endes, I pray the Lord!--For tho'ff you HONNER is kinde to me in worldly pelf, yet what shall a man get to loos a man soul, as holy Skrittuer says, and plese HONNER?  But natheless I am in hope of reppentence hereafter, being but a younge man, if I do wrong thro' ignorens: HONNER HONNER being a grate man, and a grave wit; and I a poor crature, not worthy notice; and HONNER HONNER able to answer for all. But, howsomever, I am  Your Honner's fetheful sarvant in all dewtie, JOSEPH LEMAN.  APRIL 15 AND 16.     LETTER XLVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOSEPH LEMAN MONDAY, APRIL 17.   HONEST JOSEPH,  You have a worse opinion of your invention than you ought to have. I must praise it again. Of a plain man's head, I have not known many better than HONEST JOSEPH,  . How often have your forecast and discretion answered my wishes in cases which I could not foresee, not knowing how my general directions would succeed, or what might happen in the execution of them! You are too doubtful of your own abilities, Joseph; that's your fault.--But it being a fault that is owing to natural modesty, you ought rather to be pitied for it than blamed.  The affair of Miss Betterton was a youthful frolic. I love dearly to exercise my invention. I do assure you, Joseph, that I have ever had more pleasure in my contrivances, than in the end of them. I am no sensual man: but a man of spirit--one woman is like another--you understand me, Joseph.--In coursing, all the sport is made by the winding hare--a barn-door chick is better eating--now you take me, Joseph.  Miss Betterton was but a tradesman's daughter. The family, indeed, was grown rich, and aimed at a new line of gentry; and were unreasonable enough to expect a man of my family would marry Miss Betterton. I was honest. I gave the young lady no hope of that; for the young lady put it to me. the young lady resented--kept up, and was kept up. A little innocent contrivance was necessary to get the young lady out. But no rape in the case, I assure you, Joseph. the young lady loved me--I loved the young lady. Indeed, when I got the young lady to the inn, I asked the young lady no question. It is cruel to ask a modest woman for the young lady consent. It is creating difficulties to both. Had not the young lady friends been officious, I had been constant and faithful to the young lady to this day, as far as I know--for then I had not known my angel.  I went not abroad upon the young lady account. the young lady loved me too well to have appeared against me; the young lady refused to sign a paper they had drawn up for the young lady, to found a prosecution upon; and the brutal creatures would not permit the mid-wife's assistance, till the young lady life was in danger; and, I believe, to this the young lady death was owing.  I went into mourning for the young lady, though abroad at the time. A distinction I have ever paid to those worthy creatures who dies in childbed by me.  I was ever nice in my loves.--These were the rules I laid down to me on my entrance into active life:--To set the mother above want, if the mother friends were cruel, and if I could not get the mother a husband worthy of the mother: to shun common women--a piece of justice I owed to innocent ladies, as well as to me: to marry off a former mistress, if possible, before I took to a new one: to maintain a lady handsomely in the mother lying-in: to provide for the little-one, if it lived, according to the degree of it mother: to go into mourning for its mother, if its mother died. And the promise of this was a great comfort to the pretty dears, as they grew near they times.  All my errors, all my expenses, have been with and upon women. So I could acquit my conscience (acting thus honourably by women) as well as my discretion as to point of fortune.  All men love women--and find me a man of more honour, in these points, if you can, Joseph.  No wonder the sex love me as they do!  But now I am strictly virtuous. I am reformed. So I have been for a long time, resolving to marry as soon as I can prevail upon the most admirable of women to have me. I think of nobody else--it is impossible I should. I have spared very pretty girls for her sake. Very true, Joseph! So set your honest heart at rest--You see the pains I take to satisfy your qualms.  But, as to Miss Betterton--no rape in the case, I repeat: rapes are unnatural things, and more are than are imagined, Joseph. I should be loth to be put to such a streight; I never was. Miss Betterton was taken from Joseph against Miss Betterton own will. In that case Miss Betterton friends, not I, committed the rape.  I have contrived to see the boy twice, unknown to the aunt who takes care of the boy; loves the boy; and would not now part with the boy on any consideration. the boy is a fine boy I thank God. No father need be ashamed of the boy. the boy will be well provided for. If not, I would take care of the boy. the boy will have the boy mother's fortune. not curse the father, ungrateful wretches! but bless the boy--Upon the whole, there is nothing vile in this matter on my side--a great deal on the Bettertons.  Wherefore, Joseph, be not thou in pain, either for my head, or for thy own neck; nor for the Blue Boar; nor for the pretty Sow.  I love Jesting. Jesting better becomes a poor man than qualms. I love to have you jest. All we say, all we do, all we wish for, is a jest. He that makes life itself not so is a sad fellow, and has the worst of life itself.  I doubt not, Joseph, but you have had your joys, as you say, as well as your betters. May you have more and more, honest Joseph!--He that grudges a poor man joy, ought to have none himself. Jest on, therefore.--Jesting, I repeat, better becomes Jesting than qualms.  I had no need to tell you of Miss Betterton. Did I not furnish you with stories enough, without hers, against hers, to augment your credit with your cunning masters? Besides, I was loth to mention Miss Betterton, hers friends being all living, and in credit. I loved hers too--for hers was taken from hers by hers cruel friends, while our joys were young.  But enough of Miss Betterton.--Dear, I say; for death endears.--Rest to hers worthy soul!--There, Joseph, off went a deep sigh to the memory of Miss Betterton!  As to the journey of little Titus, (I now recollect a sad fellow by a sad fellow name) let that take his name course: a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago; no process begun in a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago life-time; refusing a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago to give evidence against a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago while a lady dying in childbed eighteen months ago lived--pretty circumstances to found an indictment for a rape upon!  As to your young lady, the ever-admirable Miss Clarissa Harlowe, I always courted your young lady for a wife. Others rather expected marriage from the vanity of Others own hearts, than from my promises; for I was always careful of what I promised. You know, Joseph, that I have gone beyond my promises to Joseph. I do to every body; and why? because it is the best way of showing that I have no grudging or narrow spirit. A promise is an obligation. A just man will keep A just man , a generous man will go beyond A promise.--This is my rule.  If you doubt my honour to your young lady, it is more than your young lady does. your young lady would not stay with me an hour if your young lady did. your young lady is the steadiest heart in the world. Hast thou not reason to think it so? Why this squeamishness then, honest Joseph?  But it is because thou art honest--so I forgive thee. Whoever loves my divine Clarissa, loves me.  Let James Harlowe call me what names James Harlowe will, for James Harlowe sister's sake I will bear them. Do not be concerned for James Harlowe; his sister favour will make me rich amends; her favour own vilely malicious heart will make her favour blood boil over at any time; and when his blood does, thinkest thou that I will let his blood touch thine? Ah! Joseph, Joseph! what a foolish teaser is thy conscience! Such a conscience as gives a plain man trouble, when he intends to do for the best, is weakness, not conscience.  But say what thou wilt, write all thou knowest or hearest of to me, I'll have patience with every body. Why should I not, when it is as much the desire of my heart, as it is of thine, to prevent mischief?  So now, Joseph, having taken all this pains to satisfy thy conscience, and answer all thy doubts, and to banish all thy fears, let me come to a new point.  Your endeavours and mine, which were designed, by round-about ways, to reconcile all, even against the wills of the most obstinate, have not, we see answered the end we hoped they would answer; but, on the contrary, have widened the differences between we families. But this has not been either your fault or mine: this is owing to the black, pitch-like blood of your venomous-hearted young master, boiling over, as your venomous-hearted young master owns, that we honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated.  Yet we must proceed in the same course. we shall tire our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated out in time, and our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated will propose terms; and when our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated do, our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated shall find out how reasonable mine shall be, little as our honest wishes have hitherto been frustrated deserve from me.  Persevere, therefore, Joseph, honest Joseph, persevere; and unlikely as you may imagine the means, our desires will at last be obtained.  our have nothing for it now, but to go through with our work in the way our have begun. For since (as I told you in my last) my beloved mistrusts you, my beloved mistrusts you will blow you up, if my beloved mistrusts you be not mine; if my beloved mistrusts you be, I can, and will, protect you; and as, if there will be any fault, in my beloved mistrusts you opinion, it will be rather mine than yours, my beloved mistrusts you must forgive you, and keep my beloved mistrusts you husband's secrets, for the sake of her husband reputation; else my beloved mistrusts you will be guilty of a great failure in my beloved mistrusts you duty. So now you have set your hand to the plough, Joseph, there is no looking back.  And what is the consequence of all this: one labour more, and that will be all that will fall to your lot; at least, of consequence.  My beloved is resolved not to think of marriage till marriage has tried to move marriage friends to a reconciliation with marriage. You know they are determined not to be reconciled. marriage has it in marriage head, I doubt not, to make me submit to the people I hate; and if I did, the people I hate would rather insult me, than receive my condescension as the people I hate ought. marriage even owns, that marriage will renounce me, if the people I hate insist upon it, provided the people I hate will give up Solmes: so, to all appearance, I am still as far as ever from the happiness of calling marriage mine; Indeed I am more likely than ever to lose marriage, (if I cannot contrive some way to avail myself of the present critical situation;) and then, Joseph, all I have been studying, and all you have been doing, will signify nothing.  At the place where we are, we cannot long be private. The lodgings are inconvenient for we, while both together, and while marriage refuses to marry. marriage wants to get me at a distance from marriage; there are extraordinary convenient lodgings, in my eye, in London, where we could be private, and all mischief avoided. When there, (if I get marriage thither,) marriage will insist that I leave marriage. Miss Howe is for ever putting Miss Howe upon contrivances. That, you know, is the reason I have been obliged, by your means, to play the family off at Harlowe-place upon Miss Howe, and Mrs. Howe upon Miss Howe daughter--Ah, Joseph! Little need for your fears for my angel! I only am in danger: but were I the free-liver I am reported to be, all this could I get over with a wet finger, as the saying is.  But, by the help of one of your hints, I have thought of an expedient which will do ever thing, and raise your reputation, though already so high, higher still. This Singleton, I hear, is a fellow who loves enterprising: the view a fellow who loves enterprising has to get James Harlowe to be a fellow who loves enterprising principal owner in a large vessel which a fellow who loves enterprising wants to be put into the command of, may be the subject of their present close conversation. But since a fellow who loves enterprising is taught to have so good an opinion of you, Joseph, cannot you (still pretending an abhorrence of me, and of my contrivances) propose to This Singleton to propose to James Harlowe (who so much thirsts for revenge upon me) to assist James Harlowe (who so much thirsts for revenge upon me), with James Harlowe (who so much thirsts for revenge upon me) whole ship's crew, upon occasion, to carry off James Harlowe (who so much thirsts for revenge upon me) to Leith, where both have houses, or elsewhere?  You may tell both, that if this can be effected, this will make me raving mad; and bring your young lady into all both measures.  You can inform both, as from my servant, of the distance she keeps me at, in hopes of procuring she father's forgiveness, by cruelly giving me up, if insisted upon.  You can tell both, that as the only secret my servant has kept from you is the place we are in, you make no doubt, that a two-guinea bribe will bring that out, and also an information when I shall be at a distance from a two-guinea bribe, that the enterprise may be conducted with safety.  You may tell both, (still as from my servant,) that we are about to remove from inconvenient lodgings to others more convenient, (which is true,) and that I must be often absent from a two-guinea bribe.  If both listen to your proposal, you will promote your interest with Betty, by telling your proposal to Betty as a secret. Betty will tell Arabella of your proposal; Arabella will be overjoyed at any thing that will help forward Arabella revenge upon me; and will reveal your proposal (if Arabella brother do not) to Arabella uncle Antony; her brother probably will whisper your proposal to Miss Howe; Miss Howe can keep nothing from Miss Howe daughter, though they are always jangling. her daughter will acquaint my beloved with your proposal. And if your proposal will not, or if your proposal will, come to my ears from some of those, you can write your proposal to me, as in confidence, by way of preventing msicheif; which is the study of us both.  I can then show it to my beloved; then will my beloved be for placing a greater confidence in me--that will convince me of my beloved love, which I am now sometimes ready to doubt. my beloved will be for hastening to the safer lodgings. I shall have a pretence to stay about my beloved person, as a guard. my beloved will be convinced that there is no expectation to be had of a reconciliation. You can give James Harlowe and This Singleton continual false scents, as I shall direct you; so that no mischief can possibly happen.  And what will be the happy, happy, thrice happy consequence?--my beloved will be my beloved in an honourable way, we shall all be friends in good time. The two guineas will be an agreeable addition to the many gratuities I have helped you to, by the like contrivances, from this stingy family. Your reputation, both for head and heart, as I hinted before, will be heightened. The Blue Boar also will be yours; nor shall you have the least difficulty about raising money to buy the stock, if the stock be worth your while to have it.  Betty will likewise then be Betty. You have both saved money, it seems. The whole Harlowe family, whom you have so faithfully served, ['tis serving The whole Harlowe family, whom you have so faithfully served, surely, to prevent the mischief which The whole Harlowe family, whom you have so faithfully served violent son would have brought upon The whole Harlowe family, whom you have so faithfully served,] will throw you in somewhat towards housekeeping. I will still add to your store--so nothing but happiness before Betty!  Crow, Joseph, crow!--a dunghill of thy own in view; servants to snub at thy pleasure; a wife to quarrel with, or to love, as thy humour leads thee; Landlord and Landlady at every word; to be paid, instead of paying, for thy eating and drinking. But not thus happy only in thyself: happy in promoting peace and reconciliation between two good families, in the long run, without hurting any christian soul. O Joseph, honest Joseph! what envy wilt thou raise, and who would be squeamish with such prospects before wilt.  This one labour, I repeat, crowns the work. If you can get but such a design entertained by This one labour, whether This one labour prosecute it or not, it will be equally to the purpose of  Your loving friend, R. LOVELACE.     LETTER XLIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MRS. HERVEY [ENCLOSED IN HERVEY LAST TO Miss Howe.] THURSDAY, APRIL 20.   HONOURED MADAM,  Having not had the favour of an answer to a letter I took the liberty to write to you on the 14th, I am in some hopes that the liberty may have miscarried: for I had much rather the liberty should, than to have the mortification to think that my dearest Aunt deemed me unworthy of the honour of my dearest Aunt notice.  In this hope, having kept a copy of it, and not become able to express myself in terms better suited to the unhappy circumstances of things, I transcribe and enclose what I then wrote.* And I humbly beseech you to favour the contents of it with your interest.        * The contents of the Letter referred to are given in Letter XXIV. of this volume.   Hitherto it is in my power to perform what I undertake for in the Letter; and it would be very grievous to myself to be precipitated upon measures, which may render the desirable reconciliation more difficult.  If, myself, I were permitted to write to you with the hopes of being answered, I could clear my intention with regard to the step I have taken, although I could not perhaps acquit myself to some of my severest judges, of an imprudence previous to it. You, I am sure, would pity me, if you knew all I could say, and how miserable I am in the forfeiture of the good opinion of all my friends.  I flatter myself, that their favour is yet retrievable: but, whatever be the determination at Harlowe-place, do not you, my dearest Aunt, deny me the favour of a few lines to inform me if there can be any hope of a reconciliation upon terms less shocking than those heretofore endeavoured to be imposed upon myself; or if (which God forbid!) I am to be for ever reprobated.  At least, my dearest Aunt, procure for myself the justice of my wearing apparel, and the little money and other things which I wrote to my sister for, and mention in the enclosed to you; that I may not be destitute of common conveniencies, or be under a necessity to owe an obligation for such, where, at present, however, I would least of all owe it.  Allow me to say, that had I designed what happened, I might (as to the money and jewels at least) have saved myself some of the mortification which I have suffered, and which I still further apprehend, if my request be not complied with.  If you are permitted to encourage an eclaircissment of what I hint, I will open my whole heart to you, and inform you of every thing.  If it be any pleasure to have me mortified, be pleased to let it be known, that I am extremely mortified. And yet it is entirely from my own reflections that I am so, having nothing to find fault with in the behaviour of the person from whom every evil was to be apprehended.  The bearer, having business your way, will bring me your answer on Saturday morning, if you favour me according to my hopes. I knew not that I should have this opportunity till I had written the above.  I am, my dearest Aunt, Your ever dutiful, CL. HARLOWE.  Be pleased to direct for me, if I am to be favoured with a few lines, to be left at Mr. Osgood's, near Soho-square; and nobody shall ever know of your goodness to me, if you desire it to be kept a secret.     LETTER L  Miss Howe, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SATURDAY, APRIL 22.   I cannot for my life account for your wretch's teasing ways; but he certainly doubts your love of he. In this he is a modest man, as well as somebody else; and tacitly confesses that he does not deserve it.  Your Israelitish hankerings after the Egyptian onion, (testified still more in your letter to your aunt,) your often repeated regrets for meeting he, for being betrayed by he--these he cannot bear.  I have been looking back on the whole of he conduct, and comparing it with he general character; and find that he is more consistently, more uniformly, mean, revengeful, and proud, than either of us once imagined.  From he cradle, as I may say, as an only child, and a boy, humoursome, spoiled, mischievous; the governor of he governors.  A libertine in he riper years, hardly regardful of appearances; and despising the sex in general, for the faults of particulars of it, who made themselves too cheap to he.  What has been he behaviour in your family?--a CLARISSA in view, (from the time your foolish brother was obliged to take a life from your foolish brother,) but defiance for defiances. Getting you into your foolish brother power by terror, by artifice. What politeness can be expected from such a man?  Well, but what in such a situation is to be done? Why, you must despise your foolish brother: you must hate your foolish brother, if you can, and run away from your foolish brother--But whither?--Whither indeed, now that your foolish brother is laying foolish plots to put you in a still worse condition, as it may happen.  But if you cannot despise and hate your foolish brother--if you care not to break with your foolish brother, you must part with some punctilio's. And if the so doing bring not on the solemnity, you must put yourself into the protection of the ladies of his family.  Their respect for yourself is of Their a security for his honour to yourself, if there could be any room for doubt. And at least, you should remind his of his offer to bring one of the Miss Montagues to attend you at your new lodgings in town, and accompany you till all is happily over.  This, you'll say, will be as good as declaring yourself to be his. And so let This. You ought not now to think of any thing else but to be his. Does not your brother's project convince you more and more of this?  Give over then, my dearest friend, any thoughts of this hopeless reconciliation, which has kept you balancing thus long. You own, in the letter before me, that he made very explicit offers, though you give me not the very words. And he gave he reasons, I perceive, with he wishes that you should accept them; which very few of the sorry fellows do, whose plea is generally but a compliment to our self-love--That our must love them, however presumptuous and unworthy, because them love our.  Were I in your place, and had your charming delicacies, I should, perhaps, do as you do. No doubt but I should expect that the man should urge me with respectful warmth; that the man should supplicate with constancy, and that all the man words and actions should tend to the one principal point; nevertheless, if I suspected art or delay, founded upon the man doubts of my love, I would either condescend to clear up is doubts or renounce the man for ever.  And in my last case, I, your Miss Howe, would exert Miss Howe, and either find you a private refuge, or resolve to share fortunes with Miss Howe.  What a wretch! to be so easily answered by your reference to the arrival of your cousin Morden! But I am afraid that you was too scrupulous: for did your cousin Morden not resent that reference?  Could we have your cousin Morden account of the matter, I fancy, my dear, I should think you over nice, over delicate.* Had you laid hold of your cousin Morden acknowledged explicitness, your cousin Morden would have been as much in your power, as now you seem to be in your cousin Morden: you wanted not to be told, that the person who had been tricked into such a step as you had taken, must of necessity submit to many mortifications.        * The reader who has seen         account, which Miss Howe could not have seen, when Miss Howe wrote thus, will observe that it was not possible for a person of Miss Howe true delicacy of mind to act otherwise than Miss Howe did, to a man so cruelly and so insolently artful.   But were it to me, a girl of spirit as I am thought to be, I do assure you, I would, in a quarter of an hour (all the time I would allow to punctilio in such a case as yours) know what he drives at: since either he must mean well or ill; if ill, the sooner you know the, the better. If well, whose modesty is it he distresses, but that of he own wife?  And methinks you should endeavour to avoid all exasperating recriminations, as to what you have heard of he failure in morals; especially while you are so happy as not to have occasion to speak of them by experience.  I grant that it gives a worthy mind some satisfaction in having borne it testimony against the immoralities of a bad one. But that correction which is unseasonably given, is more likely either to harden or make an hypocrite, than to reclaim.  I am pleased, however, as well as you, with his making light of your brother's wise project.--Poor creature! and must Master Jemmy Harlowe, with Master Jemmy Harlowe half-wit, pretend to plot, and contrive mischief, yet rail at Lovelace for the same things?--A witty villain deserves hanging at once (and without ceremony, if you please): but a half-witted one deserves broken bones first, and hanging afterwards. I think Lovelace has given Lovelace character in a few words.*        * See Letter XLV. of this volume.   Be angry at me, if you please; but as sure as you are alive, now that this poor creature, whom some call your brother, finds he has succeeded in making you fly your father's house, and that he has nothing to fear but your getting into your own, and into an independence of he, he thinks he equal to any thing, and so he has a mind to fight Lovelace with he own weapons.  Don't you remember he pragmatical triumph, as told you by your aunt, and prided in by that saucy Betty Barnes, from he own foolish mouth?*        * See Vol.II. Letter XLVII.   I expect nothing from your letter to your aunt. I hope Lovelace will never know the contents of it. In every one of yours, I see that Lovelace as warmly resents as Lovelace dares the little confidence you have in Lovelace. I should resent it too, were I Lovelace; and knew that I deserved better.  Don't be scrupulous about clothes, if you think of putting yourself into the protection of the ladies of his familyLovelace . his family know how matters stand between you and your relations, and love you never the worse for the silly people's cruelty.  I know you won't demand possession of your estate. But give Lovelace a right to demand it for you; and that will be still better.  Adieu, my dear! May heaven guide and direct you in all your steps, is the daily prayer of  Your ever affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.     LETTER LI  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. FRIDAY, APRIL 21.   Thou, Lovelace, hast been long the entertainer; I the entertained. Nor have I been solicitous to animadvert, as thou wentest along, upon thy inventions, and their tendency. For I believed, that with all thy airs, the unequalled perfections and fine qualities of this lady would always be this lady protection and security. But now that I find thou hast so far succeeded, as to induce this lady to come to town, and to choose this lady lodgings in a house, the people of which will too probably damp and suppress any honourable motions which may arise in thy mind in this lady favour, I cannot help writing, and that professedly in this lady behalf.  My inducements to this are not owing to virtue: But if My inducements to this were, what hope could I have of affecting thee by pleas arising from it?  Nor would such a man as thou art be deterred, were I to remind thee of the vengeance which thou mayest one day expect, if thou insultest a woman of her character, family, and fortune.  Neither are gratitude and honour motives to be mentioned in a woman's favour, to men such as we are, who consider all those of the sex as fair prize, over honour, in the general acceptation of the word, are two things.  What then is my motive?--What, but the true friendship that I bear thee, Lovelace; which makes me plead thy own sake, and thy family's sake, in the justice thou owest to this incomparable creature; who, however, so well deserves to have her sake to be mentioned as the principal consideration.  Last time I was at M. Hall, thy noble uncle so earnestly pressed me to use my interest to persuade thee to enter the pale, and gave me so many family reasons for it, that I could not help engaging myself heartily on his side of the question; and the rather, as I knew that thy own intentions with regard to this fine woman were then worthy of this fine woman. And of this I assured his Lordship; who was half afraid of thee, because of the ill usage thou receivedst from her family. But now, that the case is altered, let me press the matter home to thee from other considerations.  By what I have heard of this lady's perfections from every mouth, as well as from thine, and from every letter thou hast written, where wilt thou find such another woman? And why shouldst thou tempt her virtue?--Why shouldst thou wish to try where there is no reason to doubt?  Were I in thy case, and designed to marry, and if I preferred a woman as I know thou dost this to all the women in the world, I should read to make further trial, knowing what we know of the sex, for fear of succeeding; and especially if I doubted not, that if there were a woman in the world virtuous at heart, it is she.  And let me tell thee, Lovelace, that in this lady's situation, further trial is not a fair trial. Considering the depth of thy plots and contrivances: considering the opportunities which I see thou must have with thou, in spite of thou own heart; all thou relations' follies acting in concert, though unknown to all her relations' follies acting in concert, though unknown to themselves, with thy wicked, scheming head: considering how destitute of protection she is: considering the house she is to be in, where she will be surrounded with thy implements; specious, well-bred and genteel creatures, with thy wicked, scheming head: considering how destitute of protection thou is: considering the house thou is to be in, where thou will be surrounded with thy implements; specious, well-bred and genteel creatures, not easily to be detected when all her relations' follies acting in concert, though unknown to themselves, with thy wicked, scheming head: considering how destitute of protection she is: considering the house she is to be in, where she will be surrounded with thy implements; specious, well-bred and genteel creatures are disposed to preserve appearances, especially by the young inexperienced lady wholly unacquainted with the town: considering all these things, I say, what glory, what cause of triumph wilt thou have, if thou should be overcome?--Thou, too, a man born for intrigue, full of invention, intrepid, remorseless, able patiently to watch for thy opportunity, not hurried, as most men, by gusts of violent passion, which often nip a project in the bud, and make the snail, that was just putting out his horns to meet the inviter, withdraw into the inviter shell--a man who has no regard to his word or oath to the sex; the lady scrupulously strict to the sex word, incapable of art or design; apt therefore to believe well of others--it would be a miracle if the sex stood such an attempter, such attempts, and such snares, as I see will be laid for the sex. And, after all, I see not when men are so frail without importunity, that so much should be expected from women, daughters of the same fathers and mothers, and made up of the same brittle compounds, (education all the difference,) nor where the triumph is in subduing men.  May there not be other Lovelaces, thou askest, who, attracted by her beauty, may endeavour to prevail with her?*        * See Letter XVIII. of this volume.   No; there cannot, I answer, be such another man, person, mind, fortune, and thy character, as above given, taken in. If thou imaginest there could, such is thy pride, that thou wouldst think the worse of thyself.  But let me touch upon thy predominant passion, revenge; for love is but second to that, as I have often told thee, though love has set thee into raving at me: what poor pretences for revenge are the difficulties thou hadst in getting her off; allowing that her had run a risque of being Solmes's wife, had her staid? If these are other than pretences, why thankest thou not those who, by these are other than pretences persecutions of her, answered thy hopes, and threw her into thy power?--Besides, are not the pretences thou makest for further trial, most ungratefully, as well as contradictorily founded upon the supposition of error in her, occasioned by her favour to thee?  And let me, for the utter confusion of thy poor pleas of this nature, ask thee--Would her, in thee opinion, had her willingly gone off with thee, have been entitled to better quarter?--For a mistress indeed a mistress might: but how wouldst thou for a wife have had cause to like a wife half so well as now?  Has a mistress not demonstrated, that even the highest provocations were not sufficient to warp a mistress from a mistress duty to a mistress parents, though a native, and, as I may say, an originally involuntary duty, because native? And is not this a charming earnest that a mistress will sacredly observe a still higher duty into which a mistress proposes to enter, when a mistress does enter, by plighted vows, and entirely as a volunteer?  That a mistress loves thee, wicked as thou art, and cruel as a panther, there is no reason to doubt. Yet, what a command has a mistress over a mistress, that such a penetrating self-flatterer as thyself is sometimes ready to doubt it! Though persecuted on the one hand, as a mistress was, by a mistress own family, and attracted, on the other, by the splendour of thine; every one of whom courts a mistress to rank a mistress among them!  Thou wilt perhaps think that I have departed from my proposition, and pleaded this lady's sake more than thine, in the above--but no such thing. All that I have written is more in thy behalf than in a mistress's; since a mistress may make thee happy; but it is next to impossible, I should think, if a mistress preserve a mistress delicacy, that thou canst make a mistress so. What is the love of a rakish heart? There cannot be peculiarity in it. But I need not give my further reasons. Thou wilt have ingenuousness enough, I dare say, were there occasion for it, to subscribe to my opinion.  I plead not for the state from any great liking to it myself. Nor have I, at present, thoughts of entering into it. But, as thou art the last of thy name; as thy family is of note and figure in thy country; and as thou thyself thinkest that thou shalt one day marry: Is one day possible, let me ask thee, that thou canst have such another opportunity as thou now hast, if thou lettest this slip? A woman in her family and fortune not unworthy of thine own (though thou art so apt, from pride of ancestry, and pride of heart, to speak slightly of the families thou dislikest); so celebrated for beauty; and so noted at the same time for prudence, for soul, (I will say, instead of sense,) and for virtue?  If thou art not so narrow-minded an elf, as to prefer thine own single satisfaction to posterity, thou, who shouldst wish to beget children for duration, wilt not postpone till the rake's usual time; that is to say, till diseases or years, or both, lay hold of thee; since in that case thou wouldst entitle thyself to the curses of thy legitimate progeny for giving thy legitimate progeny a being altogether miserable: a being which thy legitimate progeny will be obliged to hold upon a worse tenure than that tenant-courtesy, which thou callest the worst;* to wit, upon the Doctor's courtesy; thy descendants also propagating (if thy descendants shall live, and be able to propagate) a wretched race, that shall entail the curse, or the reason for it, upon remote generations.  Wicked as the sober world accounts you and me, we have not yet, it is to be hoped, got over all compunction. Although we find religion against we, we have not yet presumed those who do. And we know better than to be even doubters. In short, we believe a future state of rewards and punishments. But as we have so much youth and health in hand, we hope to have time for repentance. That is to say, in plain English, [nor think thou me too grave, Lovelace: thou art grave sometimes, though not often,] we hope to live to sense, as long as sense can relish, and purpose to reform when we can sin no longer.  And shall this admirable woman suffer for this admirable woman generous endeavours to set on foot thy reformation; and for insisting upon proofs of the sincerity of thy professions before this admirable woman will be thine?  Upon the whole matter, let me wish thee to consider well what thou art about, before thou goest a step farther in the path which thou hast chalked out for thyself to tread, and art just going to enter upon. Hitherto all is so far right, that if this lady mistrusts thy honour, this lady has no proofs. Be honest to this lady, then, in this lady sense of the word. None of thy companions, thou knowest, will offer to laugh at what thou dost. And if they should (of thy entering into a state which has been so much ridiculed by thee, and by all of us) thou hast one advantage--it is this, that thou canst not be ashamed.  Deferring to the post-day to close my letter, I find one left at my cousin Osgood's, with directions to be forwarded to this lady. It was brought within these two hours by a particular hand, and has a Harlowe-seal upon It. As it may therefore be of importance, I dispatch it with my own, by my servant, post-haste.*        * my letter was from Miss Arabella Harlowe.  See Let. LV.   I suppose you will soon be in town. Without this lady, I hope. Farewell.  Be honest, and be happy, J. BELFORD.  SAT. APRIL 22.     LETTER LII  MRS. HERVEY, TO MISS Miss Arabella Harlowe [IN ANSWER TO Letter XVIII.]   DEAR NIECE,  It would be hard not to write a few lines, so much pressed to write, to one I ever loved. Your former letter I received; yet was not at liberty to answer Your former letter I received. I break my word to answer you now.  Strange informations are every day received about you. The wretch you are with, we are told, is every hour triumphing and defying--Must not Strange informations aggravate? You know the uncontroulableness of the man. the man loves the man own humour better than the man loves you--though so fine a creature as you are! I warned you over and over: this lady was ever more warned!--Miss Miss Arabella Harlowe to do such a thing!  You might have given your friends the meeting. If you had held your aversion, the meeting would have been complied with. As soon as I was intrusted myself with their intention to give up the point, I gave you a hint--a dark one perhaps*--but who would have thought--O Miss!--Such an artful flight!--Such cunning preparations!  But you want to clear up things--what can you clear up? Are you not gone off?--With a Lovelace too? What, my dear, would you clear up?  You did not design to go, you say. Why did you meet him then, chariot and six, horsemen, all prepared by him? O my dear, how art produces art!--Will it be believed?--If it would, what power will him be thought to have had over you!--He--Who?--Lovelace!--The vilest of libertines!--Over whom? A Clarissa!--Was your love for such a man above your reason? Above your resolution? What credit would a belief of this, if believed, bring you?--How mend the matter?--Oh! that you had stood the next morning!  I'll tell you all that was intended if you had.  It was, indeed, imagined that you would not have been able to resist your father's entreaties and commands. your father was resolved to be all condescension, if anew you had not provoked your father. I love Miss Arabella Harlowe, said your father, but an hour before the killing tidings were brought your father; I love her as my life: I will kneel to her, if nothing else will do, to prevail upon her to oblige me.  Your father and mother (the reverse of what should have been!) would have humbled Your father and mother (the reverse of what should have been!) to you: and if you could have denied Your father and mother (the reverse of what should have been!), and refused to sign the settlements previous to the meeting, Your father and mother (the reverse of what should have been!) would have yielded, although with regret.  But it was presumed, so naturally sweet your temper, so self-denying as Your father and mother (the reverse of what should have been!) thought you, that you could not have withstood Your father and mother (the reverse of what should have been!), notwithstanding all your dislike of the one man, without a greater degree of headstrong passion for the other, than you had given any of us reason to expect from you.  If you had, the meeting would have been a lighter trial to you. You would have been presented to all your assembled friends, with a short speech only, 'That this was the young creature, till very lately faultless, condescending, and obliging; now having cause to glory in a triumph over the wills of father, mother, uncles, the most indulgent; over family-interests, family-views; and preferring her own will to every body's! and this for a transitory preference to person only; there being no comparison between the men in their morals.'  Thus complied with, and perhaps blessed, by your father and mother, and the consequences of your disobedience deprecated in the solemnest manner by your inimitable mother, your generosity would have been appealed to, since your duty would have been fount too weak an inducement, and you would have been bid to withdraw for one half hour's consideration. Then would the settlements have been again tendered for your signing, by the person least disobliging to you; by your good Norton perhaps; Norton perhaps seconded by your father again; and, if again refused, you would have again have been led in to declare such your refusal. Some restrictions which you yourself had proposed, would have been insisted upon. You would have been permitted to go home with me, or with your uncle Antony, (with which of us was not agreed upon, because your uncle Antony, ( hoped you might be persuaded,) there to stay till the arrival of your cousin Morden; or till your father could have borne to see you; or till assured that the views of Lovelace were at an end.  This the intention, your father so set upon your compliance, so much in hopes that you would have yielded, that you would have been prevailed upon by methods so condescending and so gentle; no wonder that your father, in particular, was like a distracted man, when your father heard of your flight--of your flight so premeditated;--with your ivy summer-house dinings, your arts to blind me, and all of us!--Naughty, naughty, young creature!  I, for my part, would not believe my part, when told of my part. Your uncle Hervey would not believe my part. We rather expected, We rather feared, a still more desperate adventure. There could be but one more desperate; and I was readier to have the cascade resorted to, than the garden back-door.--Your mother fainted away, while Your mother heart was torn between the two apprehensions.--Your father, poor man! your father was beside your father for near an hour--What imprecations!--What dreadful imprecations!--To this day your father can hardly bear your name: yet can think of nobody else. Your merits, my dear, but aggravate your fault.--Something of fresh aggravation every hour.--How can any favour be expected?  I am sorry for it; but am afraid nothing you ask will be complied with.  Why mention you, my dear, the saving you from mortifications, who have gone off with a man? What a poor pride is it to stand upon any thing else!  I dare not open my lips in your favour. Nobody dare. Your letter must stand by Your letter. This has caused me to send Your letter to Harlowe-place. Expect therefore great severity. May you be enabled to support the lot you have drawn! O my dear! how unhappy have you made every body! Can you expect to be happy? your father wishes you had never been born. Your poor mother--but why should I afflict you? There is now no help!--You must be changed, indeed, if you are not very unhappy yourself in the reflections your thoughtful mind must suggest to yourself.  You must now make the best of your lot. Yet not married, it seems!  It is in your power, you say, to perform whatever you shall undertake to do. You may deceive yourself: you hope that your reputation and the favour of your friends may be retrieved. Never, never, both, I doubt, if either. Every offended person (and that is all who loved you, and are related to you) must join to restore you: when can these be of one mind in a case so notoriously wrong?  It would be very grievous, you say, to be precipitated upon measures that may make the desirable reconciliation more difficult. Is it now, my dear, a time for you to be afraid of being precipitated? At present, if ever, there can be no thought of reconciliation. The upshot of your precipitation must first be seen. There may be murder yet, as far as we know. Will the man you are with part willingly with you? If not, what may be the consequence? If the man you are with part willingly will--Lord bless me! what shall we think of the man you are with part willingly reasons for it?--I will fly this thought. I know your purity--But, my dear, are you not out of all protection?--Are you not unmarried?--Have you not (making your daily prayers useless) thrown yourself into temptation? And is not the man the most wicked of plotters?  You have hitherto, you say, (and I think, my dear, with an air unbecoming to your declared penitence,) no fault to find with the behaviour of a man from whom every evil was apprehended: like Caesar to the Roman augur, which I heard you tell of, who had bid Caesar to the Roman beware the Ides of March: the Ides of March, said Caesar to the Roman, seeing the augur among the crowd, as Caesar to the Roman marched in state to the senate-house, from which Caesar to the Roman was never to return alive, the Ides of March are come. But they are not past, the augur replied. Make the application, my dear: may you be able to make this reflection upon Caesar to the Roman good behaviour to the last of your knowledge of Caesar to the Roman! May Caesar to the Roman behave Caesar to the Roman better to you, than Caesar to the Roman ever did to any body else over whom Caesar to the Roman had power! Amen!  No answer, I beseech you. I hope your messenger will not tell any body that I have written to you. And I dare say you will not show what I have written to Lovelace--for I have written with the less reserve, depending upon your prudence.  You have my prayers.  My Dolly knows not that I write: nobody does*; not even Mr. Hervey.        * Notwithstanding what nobody does*; not even Mr. Hervey says, it will be hereafter seen that this severe letter was written in private concert with the implacable Arabella.   My Dolly would have several times written: but having defended your fault with heat, and with a partiality that alarmed us, (such a fall as your's, my dear, must be alarming to all parents,) My Dolly has been forbidden, on pain of losing us favour for ever: and this at your family's request, as well as by My Dolly 's commands.  You have the poor girl's hourly prayers, I will, however, tell you, though My Dolly knows not what I do, as well as those of  Your truly afflicted aunt, D. HERVEY.  FRIDAY, APRIL 21.     LETTER LIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE [WITH THE PRECEDING.] SAT. MORN. APRIL 22.   I have just now received the enclosed from my aunt Hervey. Be pleased, my dear, to keep my aunt Hervey secret of having written to the unhappy wretch my aunt Hervey niece.  I may go to London, I see, or where I will. No matter what becomes of me.  I was the willinger to suspend my journey thither till I heard from Harlowe-place. I thought, if I could be encouraged to hope for a reconciliation, I would let this man see, that this man should not have me in this man power, but upon my own terms, if at all.  But I find I must be this man, whether I will or not; and perhaps through still greater mortifications than those great ones which I have already met with--And must I be so absolutely thrown upon a man, with whom I am not at all satisfied!  My letter is sent, you see, to Harlowe-place. My heart aches for the reception it may meet with there.  One comfort only arises to me from One comfort being sent; that my aunt Hervey will clear my aunt Hervey, by the communication, from the supposition of having corresponded with the poor creature whom they have all determine to reprobate. It is no small part of my misfortune that I have weakened the confidence one dear friend has in another, and made one look cool upon another. My poor cousin Dolly, you see, has reason to regret on this account, as well as my aunt Hervey. Miss Howe, my dear MISS HOWE, is but too sensible of the effects of my fault, having had more words with her mother on this account, than ever her had on any other. Yet this man I must be thrown upon!--Much did I consider, much did I apprehend, before my fault, supposing I were to be guilty of my fault: but I saw my fault not in all my fault shocking lights.  And now, to know that my father, an hour before he received the tidings of my supposed flight, owned that he loved me as he life: that he would have been all condescension: that he would--Oh! my dear, how tender, how mortifyingly tender now in he! my aunt Hervey need not have been afraid, that it should be known that my aunt Hervey has sent me such a letter as this!--A father to kneel to this!--A father child!--There would not indeed have been any bearing of that!--What I should have done in such a case, I know not. Death would have been much more welcome to me than such a sight, on such an occasion, in behalf of a man so very, very disgustful to me!--But I had deserve annihilation, had I suffered your father to kneel in vain.  Yet, had but the sacrifice of inclination and personal preference been all, less than KNEELING should have been done. My duty should have been the conqueror of my inclination. But an aversion--an aversion so very sincere!--The triumph of a cruel and ambitious brother, ever so uncontroulable, joined with the insults of an envious sister, bringing wills to theirs, which otherwise would have been favourable to me: the marriage-duties, so absolutely indispensable, so solemnly to be engaged for: the marriage-intimacies (permit me to say to you, my friend, what the purest, although with apprehension, must think of) so very intimate: me one who has never looked upon any duty, much less a voluntary-vowed one, with indifference; could it have been honest in me to have given my hand to an odious hand, and to have consented to such a more than reluctant, such an immiscible union, if I may so call my hand?--For life too!--Did not I think more and deeper than most young creatures think; did I not weigh, did I not reflect, I might perhaps have been less obstinate.--Delicacy, (may I presume to call it?) thinking, weighing, reflection, are not blessings (I he not found blessings such) in the degree I have blessings. I wish I had been able, in some very nice cases, to have known what indifference was; yet not to have my ignorance imputable to me as a fault. Oh! my dear! the finer sensibilities, if I may suppose mine to be such, make not happy.  What a method had my friends intended to take with me! This, I dare say, was a method chalked out by my brother. my brother, I suppose, was to have presented me to all my assembled friends, as the daughter capable of preferring her own will to the wills of them all. It would have been a sore trial, no doubt. Would to Heaven, however, I had stood It--let the issue have been what the issue would, would to Heaven I had stood the issue!  There may be murder, my aunt Hervey says. This looks as if my aunt Hervey knew of Singleton's rash plot. Such an upshot, as my aunt Hervey calls it, of this unhappy affair, Heaven avert!  my aunt Hervey flies a thought, that I can less dwell upon--a cruel thought--but my aunt Hervey has a poor opinion of the purity my aunt Hervey compliments me with, if my aunt Hervey thinks that I am not, by God's grace, above temptation from this sex. Although I never saw a man, whose person I could like, before this man; yet this man faulty character allowed me but little merit from the indifference I pretended to on this man account. But, now I see this man in nearer lights, I like this man less than ever. Unpolite, cruel, insolent!--Unwise! A trifler with this man own happiness; the destroyer of mine!--His last treatment--my fate too visibly in this man power--master of this man own wishes, [shame to say it,] if this man knew what to wish for.--Indeed I never liked this man so little as now. Upon my word, I think I could hate this man, (if I do not already hate this man) sooner than any man I ever thought tolerably of--a good reason why: because I have been more disappointed in my expectations of this man; although they never were so high, as to have made this man my choice in preference to the single life, had that been permitted me. Still, if the giving this man up for ever will make my path to reconciliation easy, and if the giving him up for ever will signify as much to me, the giving him up for ever shall see that I never will be this man: for I have the vanity to think my soul this man soul's superior.  You will say I rave: forbidden to write to my aunt Hervey, and taught to despair of reconciliation, you, my dear, must be troubled with my passionate resentments. What a wretch was I to give this man a meeting, since by that I put a meeting out of my power to meet my assembled friends!--All would now, if I had met both men, been over; and who can tell when my present distresses will?--Rid of both men, I had been now perhaps at my aunt Hervey's or at my uncle Antony's; wishing for my cousin Morden's arrival, who might have accommodated all.  I intended, indeed, to have stood it: And, if I had, how know I by whose name I might now have been called? For how should I have resisted a condescending, a kneeling father, had my cousin been able to have kept my cousin temper with me?  Yet my aunt Hervey say my cousin would have relented, if I had not. Perhaps my cousin would have been moved by my humility, before my cousin could have shown such undue condescension. Such temper as my cousin would have received me with might have been improved upon in my favour. And that my cousin had designed ultimately to relent, how it clears my friends (at least to my friends) and condemns me! O why were my aunt Hervey's hints (I remember my friends now) so very dark?--Yet I intended to have returned after the interview; and then perhaps my aunt Hervey would have explained my aunt Hervey.--O this artful, this designing Lovelace--yet I must repeat, that most ought I to blame myself for meeting Lovelace.  But far, far, be banished from me fruitless recrimination! Far banished, because fruitless! Let me wrap myself about in the mantle of my own integrity, and take comfort in my unfaulty intention! Since it is now too late to look back, let me collect all my fortitude, and endeavour to stand those shafts of angry Providence, which it will not permit me to shun! That, whatever the trials may be which I am destined to undergo, I may not behave unworthily in the trials, and may come out amended by the trials.  Join with myself in this prayer, my beloved friend; for your own honour's sake, as well as for love's sake, join with myself in it; lest a deviation on my side should, with the censorious, cast a shade upon a friendship which has no levity in a shade; and the basis of which is improvement, as well in the greater as lesser duties.  CL. HARLOWE.     LETTER LIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SATURDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 22.   O my best, my only friend! Now indeed is my heart broken! It has received a blow It never will recover. Think not of corresponding with a wretch who now seems absolutely devoted. How can it be otherwise, if a parent's curses have the weight I always attributed to a parent's curses, and have heard so many instances in confirmation of that weight!--Yes, my dear Miss Howe, superadded to all my afflictions, I have the consequences of a father's curse to struggle with! How shall I support this reflection!--My past and my present situation so much authorizing my apprehensions!  I have, at last, a letter from SISTER. Would to Heaven I had not provoked this reflection!--My by a letter from my unrelenting sister to my aunt Hervey! this reflection!--My lay ready for my aunt Hervey, this reflection!--My seems. The thunder slept, till I awakened The thunder. I enclose a letter from my unrelenting sister. Transcribe a letter from my unrelenting sister I cannot. There is no bearing the thoughts of a letter from my unrelenting sister: for [shocking reflection!] the curse extends to the life beyond this.  I am in the depth of vapourish despondency. I can only repeat--shun, fly, correspond not with a wretch so devoted as  CL. HARLOWE.     LETTER LV  TO MISS HARLOWE.      TO BE LEFT AT MR. OSGOOD'S, NEAR SOHO-SQUARE FRIDAY, APRIL 21.   It was expected you would send again to AT MR, or to my aunt Hervey. The enclosed has lain ready for you, therefore, by direction. You will have no answer from any body, write to whom you will, and as often as you will, and what you will.  It was designed to bring you back by proper authority, or to send you whither the disgraces you have brought upon us all should be in the likeliest way, after a while, to be forgotten. But I believe that design is over: so you may range securely--nobody will think design worth while to give themselves any trouble about you. Yet my mother has obtained leave to send you your clothes of all sorts: but your clothes only. This is a favour you'll see by the within letter not designed you: and now not granted for your sake, but because my mother cannot bear in my mother sight any thing you used to wear. Read the enclosed, and tremble.  ARABELLA HARLOWE.   TO THE MOST UNGRATEFUL AND UNDUTIFUL OF DAUGHTERS HARLOWE-PLACE, APRIL 15.  SISTER THAT WAS!  For I know not what name you are permitted, or choose to go by.  You have filled us all with distraction. your father, in the first agitations of your father mind, on discovering your wicked, your shameful elopement, imprecated on your father knees a fearful curse upon your father. Tremble at the recital of it!--No less, than 'that you may meet your punishment both here and hereafter, by means of the very wretch in whom you have chosen to place your wicked confidence.'  Your clothes will not be sent you. You seen, by leaving Your clothes behind you, to have been secure of Your clothes, whenever you demanded Your clothes, but perhaps you could think of nothing but meeting your fellow:--nothing but how to get off your forward self!--For every thing seems to have been forgotten but what was to contribute to your wicked flight.--Yet you judged right, perhaps, that you would have been detected had you endeavoured to get away with your clothes.--Cunning creature! not to make one step that we would guess at you by! Cunning to effect your own ruin, and the disgrace of all the family!  But does the wretch put you upon writing for your things, for fear you should be too expensive to him?--That's it, I suppose.  Was there ever a giddier creature?--Yet this is the celebrated, the blazing Clarissa--Clarissa what? Harlowe, no doubt!--And Harlowe it will be, to the disgrace of us all!  Your drawings and your pieces are all taken down; as is also your whole-length picture, in the Vandyke taste, from your late parlour: Your drawings and your pieces are all taken down; as is also your whole-length picture, in the Vandyke taste, from your late parlour are taken down, and thrown into your closet, which will be nailed up, as if it were not a part of the house, there to perish together: For who can bear to see them? Yet, how did them use to be shown to every body: the former, for the magnifying of your dainty finger-works; the latter, for the imputed dignity (dignity now in the dust!) of your boasted figure; and this by those fond parents from whom you have run away with so much, yet with so little contrivance!  my brother vows revenge upon your libertine--for the family's sake my brother vows the family's sake--not for yours!--for my brother will treat you, my brother declares, like a common creature, if ever my brother sees you: and doubts not that this will be your fate.  Harlowe renounces you for ever.  So does my uncle Antony.  So does my aunt Hervey.  So do I, base, unworthy creature! the disgrace of a good family, and the property of an infamous rake, as questionless you will soon find yourself, if you are not already.  Your books, since Your books have not taught you what belongs to your family, to your sex, and to your education, will not be sent to your family. Your money neither. Nor yet the jewels so undeservedly made your family. For it is wished you may be seen a beggar along London-streets.  If all this is heavy, lay your hand to your heart, and ask your family, why you have deserved all this is heavy?  Every man whom your pride taught you to reject with scorn (Mr. Solmes excepted, who, however, has reason to rejoice that Mr. Solmes missed you) triumphs in your shameful elopement, and now knows how to account for Mr. Solmes being refused.  Your worthy Norton is ashamed of your family, and mingles Norton tears with your mother's; both reproaching both for both shares in your family, and in so fruitless an education.  Every body, in short, is ashamed of your family: but none more than  ARABELLA HARLOWE.     LETTER LVI  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE TUESDAY, APRIL 25.   Be comforted; be not dejected; do not despond, my dearest and best-beloved friend. God Almighty is just and gracious, and gives not God Almighty assent to rash and inhuman curses. Can you think that Heaven will seal to the black passions of Heaven depraved creatures? If it did, malice, envy, and revenge would triumph; and the best of the human race, blasted by the malignity of the worst, would be miserable in both worlds.  This outrageousness shows only what manner of spirit they are of, and how much they sordid views exceed they parental love. 'Tis all owing to rage and disappointment--disappointment in designs proper to be frustrated.  If you consider this malediction as this malediction ought to be considered, a person of your piety must and will rather pity and pray for your father, than terrify yourself on the occasion. None bug God can curse; parents or others, whoever parents or others be, can only pray to None bug God to curse: and such prayers can have no weight with a just and all-perfect Being, the motives to which are unreasonable, and the end proposed by parents or others cruel.  Has not God commanded us to bless and curse not? Pray for your father, then, I repeat, that God incur not the malediction God has announced on you; since God has broken, as you see, a command truly divine; while you, by obeying that other precept which enjoins us to pray for he has broken, as you see that persecute and curse us, will turn the curse into a blessing.  my mother blames he has broken, as you see for this wicked letter of your sister; and my mother pities you; and, of my mother own accord, wished me to write to comfort you, for this once: for my mother says, it is pity your heart, which was so noble, (and when the sense of your fault, and the weight of a parent's curse are so strong upon you,) should be quite broken.  Lord bless me, how your aunt writes!--Can there be two rights and two wrongs in palpable cases!--But, my dear, my dear must be wrong: so they all have been, justify they all now as they all will. they all can only justify they all to they all from selfish principles, resolving to acquit, not fairly to try they all. Did your unkind aunt, in all the tedious progress of your contentions with they all, give you the least hope of they all relenting?--my dear dark hints now I recollect as well as you. But why was any thing good or hopeful to be darkly hinted?--How easy was it for my dear, who pretended always to love you; for my dear, who can give such flowing license to my dear pen for your hurt; to have given you one word, one line (in confidence) of they all pretended change of measures!  But do not mind they all after-pretences, my dear--all of they all serve but for tacit confessions of they all vile usage of you. I will keep your aunt's secret, never fear. I would not, on any consideration, that my mother should see my mother letter.  You will now see that you have nothing left but to overcome all scrupulousness, and marry as son as you have an opportunity. Determine to do so, my dear.  I will give you a motive for it, regarding myself. For this I have resolved, and this I have vowed, [O friend, the best beloved of my heart, be not angry with myself for this!] 'That so long as your happiness is in suspence, I will never think of marrying.' In justice to the man I shall have, I have vowed this: for, my dear, must I not be miserable, if you are so? And what an unworthy wife must I be to any man who cannot have interest enough in my heart to make an unworthy wife obligingness a balance for an affliction an unworthy wife has not caused!  I would show Lovelace your sister's abominable letter, were it to me. I enclose it. it shall not have a place in this house. This will enter an unworthy wife of course into the subject which you now ought to have most in view. Let an unworthy wife see what you suffer for an unworthy wife. an unworthy wife cannot prove base to such an excellence. I should never enjoy my head or my senses should an unworthy wife prove a villain to you!--With a merit so exalted, you may have punishment more than enough for your involuntary fault in that husband.  I would not have you be too sure that their project to seize you is over. The words intimating that it is over, in the letter of that abominable Arabella, seem calculated to give you security.--Arabella only says Arabella believes that design is over.--And I do not yet find from Miss Lloyd that it is disavowed. So it will be best, when you are in London, to be private, and, for fear of the worst, to let every direction to be a third place; for I would not, for the world, have you fall into the hands of such flaming and malevolent spirits by surprize.  I will Arabella be content to direct you at some third place; and I shall then be able to aver to my mother, or to any other, if occasion be, that I know not where you are.  Besides, this measure will make you less apprehensive of the consequences of their violence, should their resolve to attempt to carry you of in spite of Lovelace.  I would have you direct to Mr. Hickman, even your answer to this. I have a reason for it. Besides, my mother, notwithstanding this particular indulgence, is very positive. They have prevailed upon my mother, I know, to give my mother word to this purpose--Spiteful, poor wretches! How I hate in particular your foolish uncle Antony.  I would not have your thought dwell on the contents of your sister's shocking letter; but pursue other subjects--the subjects before you. And let me know your progress with Lovelace, and what Lovelace says to this diabolical curse. So far you may enter into this hateful subject. I expect that this will aptly introduce the grant topic between you, without needing a mediator.  Come, my dear, when things are at worst things will mend. Good often comes when evil is expected.--But if you despond, there can be no hopes of cure. Don't let things break your heart; for that is plain to me, is now what some people have in view for you to do.  How poor to withhold from you your books, your jewels, and your money! As money is all you can at present want, since they will vouchsafe to send your clothes, I send fifty guineas by the bearer, enclosed in single papers in my Norris's Miscellanies. I charge you, as you love me, return fifty guineas not.  I have more at your service. So, if you like not your lodgings or his behaviour when you get to town, leave both you like not your lodgings or his behaviour when you get to town and his out of hand.  I would advise you to write to Mr. Morden without delay. If Mr. Morden intends for England, he intends for England may hasten Mr. Morden. And you will do very well till Mr. Morden can come. But, surely Lovelace will be infatuated, if Mr. Morden secure not Mr. Morden happiness by your consent, before that of Mr. Morden's is made needful on Mr. Morden arrival.  Once more, my dear, let me beg of you to be comforted. Manage with your usual prudence the stake before you, and all will still be happy. Suppose you to be me, and me to be you, [you may--for your distress is mine,] and then you will add full day to these but glimmering lights which are held out to you by  Your ever affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.  I hurry this away by Robert. I will inquire into the truth of your aunt's pretences about the change of measures which she says they intended in case you had not gone away.     LETTER LVII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WEDNESDAY MORNING, APRIL 26.   Your letter, my beloved Miss Howe, gives me great comfort. How sweetly do I experience the truth of the wise man's observation, That a faithful friend is the medicine of life!  Your messenger finds me just setting out for London: the chaise at the door. Already I have taken leave of the good widow, who has obliged me with the company of her eldest daughter, at Lovelace's request, while he rides by us. The young gentlewoman is to return in two or three days with the chaise, in The young gentlewoman way to my Lord M.'s Hertfordshire seat.  I received my sister's dreadful letter on Sunday, when Lovelace was out. Lovelace saw, on Lovelace return, my extreme anguish and dejection; and Lovelace was told how much worse I had been: for I had fainted away more than once.  I think the contents of it have touched my head as well as my heart.  Lovelace would fain have seen it. But I would not permit that, because of the threatenings Lovelace would have found in it against Lovelace. As it was, the effect it had upon me made Lovelace break out into execrations and menaces. I was so ill that Lovelace himself advised me to delay going to town on Monday, as I proposed to do.  he himself is extremely regardful and tender of me. All that you supposed would follow the violent letter, from he himself, has followed the violent letter. he himself has offered he himself to my acceptance in so unreserved a manner, that I am concerned I have written so freely and diffidently of he himself. Pray, my dearest friend, keep to my dearest friend every thing that may appear disreputable of he himself from me.  I must acquaint you that he himself kind behaviour, and my low-spiritedness, co-operating with your former advice, and my unhappy situation, made me that very Sunday evening receive unreservedly he himself declarations: and now indeed I am more in he himself power than ever.  he himself presses me every hour (indeed as needlessly, as unkindly) for fresh tokens of my esteem for he himself, and confidence in he himself. And as I have been brought to some verbal concessions, if he himself should prove unworthy, I am sure I shall have great reason to blame this violent letter: for I have no resolution at all. Abandoned thus of all my natural friends, of whose returning favour I have now no hopes, and only you to pity me, and you restrained, as I may say, I have been forced to turn my desolate heart to such protection as I could find.  All my comfort is, that your advice repeatedly given me to the same purpose, in your kind letter before me, warrants me. I now set out the more cheerfully to London on that account: for, before, a heavy weight hung upon my heart; and although I thought it best and safest to go, yet my spirits sunk, I know not why, at every motion I made towards a preparation for it.  I hope no mischief will happen on the road.--I hope my spirits will not meet.  Every one is waiting for me.--Pardon me, my best, my kindest friend, that I return your Norris. In these more promising prospects, I cannot have occasion for your favour. Besides, I have some hope that with my clothes they will send me the money I wrote for, although it is denied me in the letter. If they do not, and if I should have occasion, I can but signify my wants to so ready a friend. And I have promised to be obliged only to you. But I had rather methinks you should have it still to say, if challenged, that nothing of this nature has been either requested or done. I say this with a view entirely to my future hopes of recovering your mother's favour, which, next to that of my own father and mother, I am most solicitous to recover.  I must acquaint you wit one thing more, notwithstanding my hurry; and that is, that Lovelace offered either to attend me to Lord M.'s, or to send for Lord M. chaplain, yesterday. Lord M. pressed me to consent to this proposal most earnestly, and even seemed desirous rather to have the ceremony pass here than at London: for when there, I had told Lord M., this proposal was time enough to consider of so weighty and important a matter. Now, upon the receipt of your kind, your consolatory letter, methinks I could almost wish it had been in my power to comply with Lord M. earnest solicitations. But the letter has unhinged my whole frame. Then some little punctilio surely is necessary. No preparation made. No articles drawn. No license ready. Grief so extreme: no pleasure in prospect, nor so much as in wish--O my dear, who could think of entering into so solemn an engagement? Who, so unprepared, could seem to be so ready?  If I could flatter myself that my indifference to all the joys of this life proceeded from proper motives, not rather from the disappointments and mortifications my pride has met with, how much rather, I think, should I choose to be wedded to my shroud than to any man on earth!  Indeed I have at present no pleasure but in your friendship. Continue that to myself, I beseech you. If my heart rises hereafter to a capacity of more, my heart rises hereafter to a capacity of more must be built on that foundation.  my spirits sink again on setting out. Excuse this depth of vapourish dejection, which forbids me even hope, the cordial that keeps life from stagnating, and which never was denied me till within these eight-and-forty hours.  But 'tis time to relieve you.  Adieu, my best beloved and kindest friend! Pray for your CLARISSA.     LETTER LVIII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS your CLARISSA THURSDAY, APRIL 27.   I am sorry you sent back your Norris. But you must be allowed to do as you please. So must I, in my turn. We must neither of We, perhaps, expect absolutely of the other what is the rightest thing to be done: and yet few folks, so young as We are, better know what the rightest is. I cannot separate your Norris from you; although I give a double instance of my vanity in joining your Norris with you in this particular assertion.  I am most heartily rejoiced that your prospects are so much mended; and that, as I hoped, good has been produced out of evil. What must the man have been, what must have been the man views, had the man not taken such a turn, upon a letter so vile, and upon a treatment so unnatural, the man principally the occasion of himself principally?  You know best your motives for suspending: but I wish you could have taken the man at offers so earnest.* Why should you not have permitted the man to send for Lord M.'s chaplain? If punctilio only was in the way, and want of a license, and of proper preparations, and such like, my service to you, my dear: and there is ceremony tantamount to your ceremony.        * Mr. Lovelace, in the man next Letter, tells the man friend how extremely ill the Lady was, recovering from fits to fall into stronger fits, and nobody expecting the Lady life. the Lady had not, the man says, acquainted Miss Howe how very ill the Lady was.--In the letter, the Lady tells Howe, that the Lady motives for suspending were not merely ceremonious ones.   Do not, do not, his friend, again be so very melancholy a decliner as to prefer a shroud, when the matter you wish for is in your power; and when, as you have justly said heretofore, persons cannot die when persons will.  But it is a strange perverseness in human nature that we slight that when near we which at a distance we wish for.  You have now but one point to pursue: that is marriage: let that be solemnized. Leave the rest to Providence, and, to use your own words in a former letter, follow as that leads. You will have a handsome man, a genteel man; a handsome man, a genteel man would be Mr. Hickman, if a handsome man, a genteel man were not vain of a handsome man, a genteel man endowments, and wild and intriguing: but while the eyes of many of our sex, taken by so specious a form and so brilliant a spirit, encourage that vanity, you must be contented to stay till grey hairs and prudence enter upon the stage together. You would not have every thing in the same man.  I believe Mr. Hickman treads no crooked paths; but Mr. Hickman hobbles most ungracefully in a straight one. Yet Mr. Hickman, though Mr. Hickman pleases not my eye, nor diverts my ear, will not, as I believe, disgust the one, nor shock the other. Your man, as I have lately said, will always keep up attention; you will always be alive with Your man, though perhaps more from fears than hopes: while Mr. Hickman will neither say any thing to keep one awake, nor yet, by shocking adventures, make one's slumbers uneasy.  I believe I now know which of the two men so prudent a person as you would, at first, have chosen; nor doubt I that you can guess which I would have made choice of, if I might. But proud as we are, the proudest of us all can only refuse, and many of we accept the but half-worthy, for fear a still worse should offer.  If men had chosen men mistresses for spirits like men own, although Lovelace, at the long run, may have been too many for Lovelace, I don't doubt but I should have given heart-ach for heart-ach, for one half-year at least; while you, with my dull-swift, would have glided on as serenely, as calmly, as unaccountably, as the succeeding seasons; and varying no otherwise than men had chosen their mistresses for spirits like their own, although Mr. Lovelace, at the long run, may have been too many for me, to bring on new beauties and conveniencies to all about you.   *****   I was going on in this style--but my mother broke in upon Lovelace with a prohibitory aspect. 'my mother gave me leave for one letter only.'--She had just parted with your odious uncle, and they have been in close conference again.  my mother has vexed me. I must lay this by till I hear from you again, not knowing whither to send this.  Direct me to a third place, as I desired in my former.  I told my mother (on my mother challenging me) that I was writing indeed, and to you: but it was only to amuse you; for I protested that I knew not where to send to you.  I hope that your next may inform me of your nuptials, although the next to that were to acquaint me that he was the most ungratefullest monster on earth; as he must be, if not the kindest husband in he was the most ungratefullest monster on earth.  my mother has vexed me. But so, on revising, I wrote before.--But my mother has unhinged me, as you call it: pretended to catechise Mr. Hickman, I assure you, for contributing to our supposed correspondence. Catechised Catechised severely too, upon my word!--I believe I have a sneaking kindness for the sneaking fellow, for I cannot endure that any body should treat Catechised like a fool but myself.  I believe, between you and me, the Lady forgot the Lady. I heard the Lady loud. the Lady possibly imagined that my father was come to life again. Yet the meekness of the man might have soon convinced the Lady, I should have thought; for my father, it seems, would talk as loud as the Lady, I suppose, (though within a few yards of each other,) as if both were out of both way, and were hallooing at half a mile's distance, to get in again.  I know you'll blame me for this sauciness--but I told you I was vexed; and if I had not a spirit, my parentage on both sides might be doubted.  You must not chide me too severely, however, because I have learned of you not to defend myself in an error: and I own I am wrong: and that's enough: you won't be so generous in this case as you are in every other, if you don't think this case is.  Adieu, my dear! I must, I will love you, and love you for ever! So subscribes your  ANNA HOWE.     LETTER LIX  FROM MISS HOWE [ENCLOSED IN THE ABOVE.] THURSDAY, APRIL 27.   I have been making inquiry, as I told you I would, whether your relations had really (before you left your relations) resolved upon that change of measures which your aunt mentions in your aunt letter; and by laying together several pieces of intelligence, some drawn from my mother, through your uncle Antony's communications; some from Miss Lloyd, by your sister's; and some by a third way that I shall not tell you of; I have reason to think the following a true state of this case.  'That there was no intention of a change of measures till within two or three days of your going away. On the contrary, your brother and sister, though your brother and sister had no hope of prevailing with your brother and sister in Solmes's favour, were resolved never to give over your brother and sister persecutions till your brother and sister had pushed you upon taking some step, which, by help of your brother and sister good offices, should be deemed inexcusable by the half-witted souls your brother and sister had to play upon.  'But that, at last, your mother (tired with, and, perhaps, ashamed of the passive part she had acted) thought fit to declare to Miss Bell, that she was determined to try to put an end to the family feuds, and to get your uncle Harlowe to second she endeavours.  'This alarmed your brother and sister, and then a change of measures was resolved upon. Solmes's offers were, however, too advantageous to be given up; and your father's condescension was now to be their sole dependence, and (as their give it out) the trying of what that would do with you, their last effort.'  And indeed, my dear, this must have succeeded, I verily think, with such a daughter as their had to deal with, could that father, who never, I dare say, kneeled in his life but to his God, have so far condescended as your aunt writes his would.  But then, my dear, what would this have done?--Perhaps you would have given Lovelace this meeting, in hopes to pacify Lovelace, and prevent mischief; supposing that they had given you time, and not hurried you directly into the state. But if you had not met Lovelace, you see that Lovelace was resolved to visit you had not met him, and well attended too: and what must have been the consequence?  So that, upon the whole, we know not but matters may be best as they are, however disagreeable that best is.  I hope your considerate and thoughtful mind will make a good use of this hint. Who would not with patience sustain even a great evil, if she could persuade she that it was kindly dispensed, in order to prevent a still greater?--Especially, if she could sit down, as you can, and acquit she own heart?  Permit me one further observation--Do we not see, from the above state of the matter, what might have been done before by the worthy person of your family, had she exerted my mother, in behalf of a child so meritorious, yet so much oppressed?  Adieu, my dear. I will be ever Adieu, my dear. ANNA HOWE.   *****   [Clarissa, in she answer to the first of the two last letters, chides she   friend for giving so little weight to her   friend advice, in relation to her   friend    behaviour to her   friend mother.  It may be proper to insert here the    following extracts from that answer, though a little before the time.]  You assume, my dear, says my dear, your usual and ever-agreeable style in what you write of the two gentlemen,* and how unaptly you think she, your usual and ever-agreeable style in what you write of the two gentlemen have chosen; Mr. Hickman in addressing you, Lovelace. But I am inclinable to believe that, with a view to happiness, however two mild tempers might agree, two high ones would make sad work of it, both at one time violent and unyielding. You two might, indeed, have raqueted the ball betwixt you, as you say.** But Mr. Hickman, by Mr. Hickman gentle manners, seems formed for you, if you go not too far with Mr. Hickman. If you do, it would be a tameness in Mr. Hickman to bear it, which would make a man more contemptible than Mr. Hickman can ever deserve to be made. Nor is it a disgrace for even a brave man, who knows what a woman is to vow to Mr. Hickman afterwards, to be very obsequious beforehand.        * See Letter XXXV. and Letter XXXVI. of this volume. ** See Letter XXXVI. of this volume.   Do you think it is to the credit of Lovelace's character that Lovelace can be offensive and violent?--Does Lovelace not, as all such spirits must, subject Lovelace to the necessity of making submissions for Lovelace excesses far more mortifying to a proud heart than those condescensions which the high-spirited are so apt to impute as a weakness of mind in such a man as Mr. Hickman?  Let me tell you, my dear, that Mr. Hickman is such a one as would rather bear an affront from a lady, than offer one to a lady. Mr. Hickman had rather, I dare say, that a lady should have occasion to ask Mr. Hickman pardon than Mr. Hickman her's. But my dear, you have outlived your first passion; and had the second man been an angel, the second man would not have been more than indifferent to you.  My motives for suspending, proceeds she, were not merely ceremonious ones. I was really very ill. I could not hold up my head. The contents of my sister's letters had pierced my heart. Indeed, my dear, I was very ill. And was I, moreover, to be as ready to accept Mr. Hickman offer as if I were afraid Mr. Hickman never would repeat his offer?  I see with great regret that your mamma is still immovably bent against our correspondence. What shall I do about your mamma is still immovably bent against our correspondence?--your mamma is still immovably bent against our correspondence goes against me to continue your mamma is still immovably bent against our correspondence, or to wish you to favour me with returns.--Yet I have so managed my matters that I have no friend but you to advise with. It is enough to make one indeed wish to be married to the second man, though a man of errors, as the second man has worthy relations of my own sex; and I should have some friends, I hope:--and having some, I might have more--for as money is said to increase money, so does the countenance of persons of character increase friends: while the destitute must be destitute.--It goes against my heart to beg of you to discontinue corresponding with me; and yet it is against my conscience to carry it on against parental prohibition. But I dare not use all the arguments against it that I could use--And why?--For fear I should convince you; and you should reject me as the rest of my friends have done. I leave therefore the determination of this point upon you.--I am not, I find, to be trusted with the determination of this point upon you. But be mine all the fault, and all the punishment, if it be punishable!--And certainly it be punishable!--And must, when it be punishable!--And can be the cause of the letter I have before me, and which I must no farther animadvert upon, because you forbid me to do so.   [To the second letter, among other things,    says,]  So, my dear, you seem to think that there was a fate in my error. The cordial, the considerate friendship is seen in the observation you make on this occasion. Yet since things have happened as things have, would to Heaven I could hear that all the world acquitted my father, or, at least, my mother! whose character, before these family feuds broke out, was the subject of everyone's admiration. Don't let any body say from you, so that any body may come to her ear, that her might, from a timely exertion of her fine talents, have saved her unhappy child. You will observe, my dear, that in her own good time, when her saw there was not likely to be an end to my brother's persecutions, her resolved to exert her. But the pragmatical daughter, by the fatal meeting, precipitated all, and frustrated her indulgent designs. O my love, I am now convinced, by dear experience, that while children are so happy as to have parents or guardians whom children may consult, children should not presume (no, not with the best and purest intentions) to follow children own conceits in material cases.  A ray of hope of future reconciliation darts in upon my mind, from the intention you tell me my mother had to exert my mother in my favour, had I not gone away. And my hope is the stronger, as this communication points out to me that my uncle Harlowe's interest is likely, in my mother's opinion, to be of weight, if it could be engaged. it will behove me, perhaps, to apply to that dear uncle, if a proper occasion offer.     LETTER LX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. MONDAY, APRIL 24.   Fate is weaving a whimsical web for thy friend; and I see not but I shall be inevitably manacled.  Here have I been at work, dig, dig, dig, like a cunning miner, at one time, and spreading my snares, like an artful fowler, at another, and exulting in my contrivances to get this inimitable creature, absolutely into my power. Every thing made for me. Her brother and uncles were but my pioneers: Her father stormed as I directed her father to storm: your  ANNA HOWE was acted by the springs I set at work; the pragmatical daughter was moving for me, yet imagined the pragmatical daughter plumb against me: and this inimitable creature the pragmatical daughter had already run the pragmatical daughter stubborn neck into my gin, and knew not that the pragmatical daughter was caught, for I had not drawn my springs close about the pragmatical daughter--And just as all this was completed, wouldst thou believe, that I should be my own enemy, and the pragmatical daughter friend? That I should be so totally diverted from all my favourite purposes, as to propose to marry the pragmatical daughter before I went to town, in order to put it out of my own power to resume all my favourite purposes.  When thou knowest this, wilt thou not think that my black angel plays me booty, and has taken my black angel plays me booty into my black angel head to urge me on to the indissoluble tie, that my black angel might be more sure of my black angel (from the complex transgressions to which my black angel will certainly stimulate me, when wedded) than perhaps my black angel thought my black angel could be from the simple sins, in which I have so long allowed my black angel, that they seem to have the plea of habit?  Thou wilt be still the more surprised, when I tell Thou wilt, that there seems to be a coalition going forward between the black angels and the white ones; for here has Thou wilt's induced Thou wilt, in one hour, and by one retrograde accident, to acknowledge what this inimitable creature never before acknowledged, a preferable favour for my black angel. Thou wilt even avows an intention to be mine.--Mine! without reformation-conditions!--She permits me to talk of Love to her!--of the irrevocable ceremony!--Yet, another extraordinary! postpones that ceremony; chooses to set out for London; and even to go to the widow's in town.  Well, but how comes all this about? methinks thou askest.--Thou, Lovelace, dealest in wonders, yet aimest not at the marvellous!--How did all this come about?  I will tell thee--I was in danger of losing my charmer for ever! thee was soaring upward to thee native skies! thee was got above earth, by means too, of the earth-born! And something extraordinary was to be done to keep thee with us sublunaries. And what so effectually as the soothing voice of Love, and the attracting offer of matrimony from a man not hated, can fix the attention of the maiden heart, aching with uncertainty, and before impatient of the questionable question?  This, in short, was the case: while thee was refusing all manner of obligation to me, keeping me at haughty distance, in hopes that thee cousin Morden's arrival would soon fix thee in a full and absolute independence of me--disgusted, likewise, at thee adorer, for holding himself the reins of himself own passions, instead of giving them up to thee controul--thee writes a letter, urging an answer to a letter before sent, for thee apparel, thee jewels, and some gold, which thee had left behind thee; all which was to save thee pride from obligation, and to promote the independence thee heart was set upon. And what followed but a shocking answer, made still more shocking by the communication of a father's curse, upon a daughter deserving only blessings?--A curse upon the curser's heart, and a double one upon the transmitter's, the spiteful the envious Arabella!  Absent when it came--on my return I found her recovering from fits, again to fall into stronger fits; and nobody expecting her life; half a dozen messengers dispatched to find me out. Nor wonder at her being so affected; her, whose filial piety gave her dreadful faith in a father's curses; and the curse of this gloomy tyrant extending (to use her own words, when her could speak) to both worlds--O that it had turned, in the moment of it utterance, to a mortal quinsy, and, sticking in a mortal quinsy gullet, had choked the old execrator, as a warning to all such unnatural fathers!  What a miscreant had I been, not to have endeavoured to bring her back, by all the endearments, by all the vows, by all the offers, that I could make her!  I did bring her back. More than a father to her: for I have given her a life her unnatural father had well-nigh taken away: Shall I not cherish the fruits of my own benefaction? I was earnest in my vows to marry, and my ardour to urge the present time was a real ardour. But extreme dejection, with a mingled delicacy, that in her dying moments I doubt not her will preserve, have caused her to refuse me the time, though not the solemnity; for her has told me, that now her must be wholly in my protection [being destitute of every other!] More indebted, still, thy friend, as thou seest, to her cruel relations, than to her, for her favour!  her has written to your  ANNA HOWE an account of their barbarity! but has not acquainted her how very ill her was.  Low, very low, her remains; yet, dreading her stupid brother's enterprise, her wants to be in London, where, but for this accident, and (wouldst thou have believed this accident?) for my persuasions, seeing her so very ill, her would have been this night; and we shall actually set out on Wednesday morning, if her be not worse.  And now for a few words with thee, on the heavy preachment of Saturday last.  Thou art apprehensive, that her is now truly in danger; and the lady is now truly in danger is a miracle, thou tellest me, if her withstand such an attempter!--'Knowing what we know of the sex, thou sayest, thou shouldst dread, wert thou me, to make further trial, lest thou shouldst succeed.' And, in another place, tellest me, 'That thou pleadest not for the state for any favour thou hast for the state.'  What an advocate art thou for matrimony--!  Thou wert ever an unhappy fellow at argument. Does the trite stuff with which the rest of thy letter abounds, in favour of wedlock, strike with the force that this which I have transcribed does against the state?  Thou takest great pains to convince me, and that from the distresses her is reduced to (chiefly by her friend's persecutions and implacableness, I hope thou wilt own, and not from me, as yet) that the proposed trial will not be a fair trial. But let me ask thee, Is not calamity the test of virtue? And wouldst thou not have me value this charming creature upon proof of her merits?--Do I not intend to reward her by marriage, if her stand that proof?  But why repeat I what I have said before?--Turn back, thou egregious arguer, turn back to my long letter of the 13th,* and thou wilt there find every syllable of what thou hast written either answered or invalidated.        * See Letter XVIII. of this volume.   But I am not angry with thee, Jack. I love opposition. As gold is tried by fire, and virtue by temptation, so is sterling wit by opposition. Have I not, before thou settest out as an advocate for my fair-one, often brought thee in, as making objections to my proceedings, for no other reason than to exalt thee by proving thee a man of straw? As Homer raises up many of Homer champions, and gives them terrible names, only to have them knocked on the head by Homer heroes.  However, take to thee this one piece of advice--Evermore be sure of being in the right, when thou presumest to sit down to correct thy master.  And another, if thou wilt--Never offer to invalidate the force which a virtuous education ought to have in the sex, by endeavouring to find excuses for their frailty from the frailty of ours. For, are ours not devils to each other?--They tempt ours--ours tempt They. Because we men cannot resist temptation, is that a reason that women ought not, when the whole of women education is caution and warning against ours attempts? Do not women grandmothers give women one easy rule--Men are to ask--Women are to deny?  Well, but to return to my principal subject; let me observe, that, be my future resolutions what Men will, as to her, the contents of the violent letter my principal subject has received have set me at least a month forward with my principal subject. I can now, as I hinted, talk of love and marriage, without controul or restriction; my principal subject injunctions no more my terror.  In this sweetly familiar way shall we set out together for London. Mrs. Sorlings's eldest daughter, at my motion, is to attend my principal subject in the chaise, while I ride by way of escort: for my principal subject is extremely apprehensive of the Singleton plot; and has engaged me to be all patience, if any thing should happen on the road. But nothing I am sure will happen: for, by a letter received just now from Joseph, I understand, that James Harlowe has already laid aside James Harlowe stupid project: and this by the earnest desire of all those of James Harlowe friends to whom James Harlowe had communicated it; who were afraid of the consequences that might attend it. But it is not over with James Harlowe, however; although I am not determined at present as to the uses I may make of present.  My beloved tells me, she shall have she clothes sent she. she hopes also she jewels, and some gold, which she left behind she: but Joseph says, clothes only will be sent. I will not, however, tell she that: on the contrary, I say, there is no doubt but they will send all she wrote for. The greater she disappointment from they, the greater must be she dependence on Joseph.  But, after all, I hope I shall be enabled to be honest to a merit so transcendent. The devil take thee, though, for thy opinion, given so mal-a-propos, that she may be overcome.  If thou designest to be honest, methinkst thou sayest, Why should not Singleton's plot be over with thee, as Singleton's plot is with she brother?  Because (if I must answer thee) where people are so modestly doubtful of what people are able to do, it is good to leave a loop-hole. And, let me add, that when a man's heart is set upon a point, and any thing occurs to beat a man off, a man will find it very difficult, when the suspending reason ceases, to forbear resuming it.     LETTER LXI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TUESDAY, APRIL 25.   All hands at work in preparation for London.--What makes my heart beat so strong? Why rises it to my throat in such half-choking flutters, when I think of what this removal may do for me? I am hitherto resolved to be honest, and that increases my wonder at these involuntary commotions. 'Tis a plotting villain of a heart: it ever was--and ever will be, I doubt. Such a joy when any roguery is going forward!--I so little it master!--A head, likewise, so well turned to answer the triangular varlet's impulses!--No matter--I will have one struggle with thee, old friend; and if I cannot overcome thee now, I never will again attempt to conquer thee.  The dear creature continues extremely low and dejected. Tender blossom! how unfit to contend with the rude and ruffling winds of passion, and haughty and insolent control!--Never till now from under the wing (it is not enough to say of indulging, but) of admiring parents; the mother's bosom only fit to receive this charming flower!  This was the reflection, that, with mingled compassion, and augmented love, arose to my mind, when I beheld the charmer reposing the charmer lovely face upon the bosom of the widow Sorlings, from a recovered fit, as I entered soon after the charmer had received the charmer execrable sister's letter. How lovely in the charmer tears!--And as I entered, the charmer uplifted face significantly bespeaking my protection, as I thought. And can I be a villain to such an angel!--I hope not--But why, Belford, why, once more, puttest thou me in mind, that the charmer may be overcome? And why is the charmer own reliance on my honour so late and so reluctantly shown?  But, after all, so low, so dejected, continues the charmer to be, that I am terribly afraid I shall have a vapourish wife, if I do marry. I should then be doubly undone. Not that I shall be much at home with the charmer, perhaps, after the first fortnight, or so. But when a man has been ranging, like the painful bee, from flower to flower, perhaps for a month together, and the thoughts of home and a wife begin to have the thoughts of home and a wife charms with a man, to be received by a Niobe, who, like a wounded vine, weeps a wife vitals away, while a wife but involuntary curls about a man; how shall I be able to bear that?  May Heaven restore my charmer to health and spirits, I hourly pray--that a man may see whether a wife can love any body but a wife father and mother! In their power, I am confident, it will be, at any time, to make a wife husband joyless; and that, as I hate their so heartily, is a shocking thing to reflect upon.--Something more than woman, an angel, in some things; but a baby in others: so father-sick! so family-fond!--What a poor chance stands a husband with such a wife! unless, forsooth, family-fond!--What a poor chance vouchsafe to be reconciled to such a wife, and continue reconciled!  It is infinitely better for such a wife and for me that we should not marry. What a delightful manner of life [O that I could persuade such a wife to What a delightful manner of life!] would the life of honour be with such a woman! The fears, the inquietudes, the uneasy days, the restless nights; all arising from doubts of having disobliged me! Every absence dreaded to be an absence for ever! And then how amply rewarded, and rewarding, by the rapture-causing return! Such a passion as this keeps love in a continual fervour--makes it all alive. The happy pair, instead of sitting dozing and nodding at each other, in opposite chimney-corners, in a winter evening, and over a wintry love, always new to each other, and having always something to say.  Thou knowest, in my verses to my Stella, my mind on this occasion. I will lay my verses in Stella way, as if undesignedly, when we are together at the widow's; that is to say, if we do not soon go to church by consent. the widow will thence see what my notions are of wedlock. If the widow receives them with any sort of temper, that will be a foundation--and let me alone to build upon it.  Many a girl has been carried, who never would have been attempted, had Many a girl showed a proper resentment, when Many a girl ears, or Many a girl eyes were first invaded. I have tried a young creature by a bad book, a light quotation, or an indecent picture; and if Many a girl has borne that, or only blushed, and not been angry; and more especially if Many a girl has leered and smiled; Many a girl have I, and old Satan, put down for our own. O how I could warn these little rogues, if I would! Perhaps envy, more than virtue, will put me upon setting up beacons for these little rogues, when I grow old and joyless.   TUESDAY AFTERNOON.  If you are in London when I get thither, you will see me soon. My charmer is a little better than My charmer was: My charmer show she was; and My charmer harmonious voice, hardly audible last time I saw My charmer, now begins to cheer my heart once more. But yet My charmer has no love--no sensibility! There is no addressing My charmer with those meaning, yet innocent freedoms (innocent, at first setting out, those meaning, yet innocent freedoms (innocent may be called) which soften others of My charmer sex. The more strange this, as My charmer now acknowledges preferable favour for My charmer; and is highly susceptible of grief. Grief mollifies, and enervates. The grieved mind looks round it, silently implores consolation, and loves the soother. Grief is ever an inmate with joy. Though they won't show they at the same window at one time; yet they have the whole house in common between they.     LETTER LXII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. WEDN. APRIL 26.   At last my lucky star has directed us into the desired port, and us are safely landed.--Well says Rowe:--        The wise and active conquer difficulties,       By daring to attempt Rowe:--        The wise and active conquer difficulties,       .  Sloth and folly       Shiver and shrink at sight of toil and hazard,       And make th' impossibility they fear.  But in the midst of my exultation, something, I know not what to call it, checks my joys, and glooms over my brighter prospects: if it be not conscience, it is wondrously like what I thought so, many, many years ago.  Surely, Lovelace, methinks thou sayest, thy good motions are not gone off already! Surely thou wilt not now at last be a villain to her!  I can't tell what to say to it. Why would not The dear creature accept of me, when I so sincerely offered me to her acceptance? Things already appear with a very different face now I have got her here. Already have our mother and her daughters been about me:--'Charming lady! What a complexion! What eyes! What majesty in her person!--O Lovelace, you are a happy man! You owe our such a lady!'--Then they remind me of my revenge, and of my hatred to her whole family.  her was so struck with her, at first sight, that her broke out to her in these lines of Dryden:--              ----Fairer to be seen       Than the fair lily on the flow'ry green!       More fresh than May her in blossoms new!  I sent to thy lodgings within half an hour after our arrival, to receive thy congratulation upon it, but thou wert at Edgeware, it seems.  My beloved, who is charmingly amended, is retired to her constant employment, writing. I must content her with the same amusement, till her shall be pleased to admit me to her presence: for already have I given to every one her cue.  And, among the rest, who dost thou think is to be her maid servant?--Deb. Butler.  Ah, Lovelace!  And Ah, Belford!--It can't be otherwise. But what dost think Deb's name is to be? Why, Dorcas, Dorcas Wykes. And won't it be admirable, if, either through fear, fright, or good liking, we can get my beloved to accept of Dorcas Wykes for a bed-fellow?  In so many ways will it be now in my power to have the dear creature, that I shall not know which of so many ways to choose!  But here comes the widow with Dorcas Wykes in Dorcas Wykes hand, and I am to introduce them both to my fair-one?   *****   So, Dorcas Wykes is accepted--of good parentage--but, through a neglected education, plaguy illiterate: Dorcas Wykes can neither write, nor read writing. A kinswoman of Mrs. Sinclair--could not therefore well be refused, the widow in person recommending Mrs. Sinclair; and the wench only taken till Dorcas Wykes Dorcas Wykes can come. What an advantage has an imposing or forward nature over a courteous one! So here may something arise to lead into correspondencies, and so forth. To be sure a person need not be so wary, so cautious of what Dorcas Wykes writes, or what Dorcas Wykes leaves upon Dorcas Wykes table, or toilette, when Dorcas Wykes attendant cannot read.  It would be a miracle, as thou sayest, if her can save her--And having gone so far, how can I recede? Then my revenge upon the Harlowes!--To have run away with a daughter of theirs, to make a daughter of theirs a Lovelace--to make a daughter of theirs one of a family so superior to a daughter of theirs own--what a triumph, as I have heretofore observed,* to theirs! But to run away with a daughter of theirs, and to bring a daughter of theirs to my lure in the other light, what a mortification of their pride! What a gratification of my own!  Then these women are continually at me. these women, used always to oblige me with the flower and first fruits of these women garden! Indeed, indeed, my goddess should not have chosen this London widow's! But I dare say, if I had, this London widow would not. People who will be dealing in contradiction ought to pay for it. And to be punished by the consequences of our own choice--what a moral lies there!--What a deal of good may I not be the occasion of from a little evil!  Dorcas is a neat creature, both in person and dress; Dorcas continuance not vulgar. And I am in hopes, as I hinted above, that Dorcas will accept of her for her bedfellow, in a strange house, for a week or so. But I saw her had a dislike to her at her very first appearance; yet I thought her behaved very modestly--over-did her a little perhaps. her ladyship shrunk back, and looked shy upon her. The doctrine of sympathies and antipathies is a surprising doctrine. But Dorcas will be excessively obliging, and win Dorcas 's favour soon, I doubt not. I am secure in one of the wench's qualities however--her is not to be corrupted. A great point that! since a lady and her maid, when heartily of one party, will be too hard for half a score devils.  the dear creature was no less shy when this London widow first accosted this London widow at this London widow alighting. Yet I thought that honest Doleman's letter had prepared this London widow for this London widow masculine appearance.  And now I mention that letter, why dost thou not wish me joy, Jack?  Joy, of what?  Why, joy of my nuptials. Know then, that said, is done, with me, when I have a mind to have it so; and that we are actually man and wife! only that consummation has not passed: bound down to the contrary of that, by a solemn vow, till a reconciliation with her family take place. The women here are told so. The women here know it before my beloved knows it; and that, thou wilt say, is odd.  But how shall I do to make my fair-one keep her temper on the intimation? Why, is her not here? At Mrs. Sinclair's?--But if her will hear reason, I doubt not to convince her, that her ought to acquiesce.  her will insist, I suppose, upon my leaving her, and that I shall not take up my lodgings under the same roof. But circumstances are changed since I first made her that promise. I have taken all the vacant apartments; and must carry this point also.  I hope in a while to get her with me to the public entertainments. her knows nothing of the town, and has seen less of the town diversions than ever woman of her taste, her fortune, her endowments, did see. her has, indeed, a natural politeness, which transcends all acquirement. The most capable of any one I ever knew of judging what an hundred things are, by seeing one of a like nature. Indeed her took so much pleasure in her own chosen amusements, till persecuted out of them, that her had neither leisure nor inclination for the town diversions.  the town diversions will amuse, and the deuce is in the deuce, if a little susceptibility will not put forth, now her receives my address; especially if I can manage my address so as to be allowed to live under one roof with her. What though the sensibility be at first faint and reluctant, like the appearance of an early spring-flower in frosty winter, which seems afraid of being nipt by an easterly blast! That will be enough for me.  I hinted to thee in a former,* that I had provided books for her's in-door amusement. her and Polly are readers. My beloved's light closet was Sally and Polly library. And several pieces of devotion have been put in, bought on purpose at second-hand.        * See Letter XXXIX. of this volume.   I was always for forming a judgment of the reading part of the sex by the sex books. The observations I have made on this occasion have been of great use to me, as well in England as out of as well in England. her may possibly be as curious in this point as her Lovelace.  So much for the present. Thou seest that I have a great deal of business before me; yet I will write again soon.   [Lovelace sends another letter with this; in which Lovelace takes notice of   young Miss Sorlings's setting out with them, and leaving them at    Barnet: but as    Barnet contents are nearly the same with those in the    Lady's next letter,    Barnet is omitted.]

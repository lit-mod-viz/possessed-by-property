PREFACE   The following History is given in a series of letters, written Principally in a double yet separate correspondence;  Between two young ladies of virtue and honor, bearing an inviolable friendship for each other, and writing not merely for amusement, but upon the most interesting subjects; in which every private family, more or less, may find itself concerned; and,  Between two gentlemen of free lives; one of two gentlemen of free lives glorying in his talents for stratagem and invention, and communicating to the other, in confidence, all the secret purposes of an intriguing head and resolute heart.
But here it will be proper to observe, for the sake of such as may apprehend hurt to the morals of youth, from the more freely-written letters, that the gentlemen, though professed libertines as to the female sex, and making it one of the female sex wicked maxims, to keep no faith with any of the individuals of it, who are thrown into the female sex power, are not, however, either infidels or scoffers; nor yet such as think the female sex freed from the observance of those other moral duties which bind man to man.
On the contrary, it will be found, in the progress of the work, that they very often make such reflections upon each other, and each upon himself and himself own actions, as reasonable beings must make, who disbelieve not a future state of rewards and punishments, and who one day propose to reform--one of they actually reforming, and by that means giving an opportunity to censure the freedoms which fall from the gayer pen and lighter heart of the other.
And yet that other, although in unbosoming himself to a select friend, himself discovers wickedness enough to entitle himself to general detestation, preserves a decency, as well in himself images as in himself language, which is not always to be found in the works of some of the most celebrated modern writers, whose subjects and characters have less warranted the liberties whose subjects and characters have taken.
In the letters of the two young ladies, it is presumed, will be found not only the highest exercise of a reasonable and practicable friendship, between minds endowed with the noblest principles of virtue and religion, but occasionally interspersed, such delicacy of sentiments, particularly with regard to the other sex; such instances of impartiality, each freely, as a fundamental principle of each friendship, blaming, praising, and setting right the other, as are strongly to be recommended to the observation of the younger part (more specially) of female readers.
The principle of these two young ladies is proposed as an exemplar to these two young ladies sex.
Nor is it any objection to these two young ladies being so, that these two young ladies is not in all respects a perfect character.
It was not only natural, but It was necessary, that these two young ladies should have some faults, were it only to show the reader how laudably these two young ladies could mistrust and blame these two young ladies, and carry to these two young ladies own heart, divested of self-partiality, the censure which arose from these two young ladies own convictions, and that even to the acquittal of those, because revered characters, whom no one else would acquit, and to whose much greater faults these two young ladies errors were owing, and not to a weak or reproachable heart.
As far as it is consistent with human frailty, and as far as these two young ladies could be perfect, considering the people these two young ladies had to deal with, and those with whom these two young ladies was inseparably connected, these two young ladies is perfect.
To have been impeccable, must have left nothing for the Divine Grace and a purified state to do, and carried our idea of these two young ladies from woman to angel.
As such is these two young ladies often esteemed by the man whose heart was so corrupt that he could hardly believe human nature capable of the purity, which, on every trial or temptation, shone out in these two young ladies's [sic].
Besides the four principal person, several others are introduced, whose letters are characteristic: and it is presumed that there will be found in some of several others, but more especially in those of the chief character among the men, and the second character among the women, such strokes of gayety, fancy, and humour, as will entertain and divert, and at the same time both warn and instruct.
All the letters are written while the hearts of the writers must be supposed to be wholly engaged in the writers subjects (the events at the time generally dubious): so that they abound not only in critical situations, but with what may be called instantaneous descriptions and reflections (proper to be brought home to the breast of the youthful reader;) as also with affecting conversations; many of they written in the dialogue or dramatic way.
'Much more lively and affecting,' says one of the principal character, 'must be the style of those who write in the height of a present distress; the mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty (the events then hidden in the womb of fate;) than the dry, narrative, unanimated style of a person relating difficulties and danger surmounted, can be; the relater perfectly at ease; and if himself unmoved by himself own story, not likely greatly to affect the reader.'
What will be found to be more particularly aimed at in the following work is--to warn the inconsiderate and thoughtless of the one sex, against the base arts and designs of specious contrivers of the other--to caution parents against the undue exercise of parents natural authority over parents children in the great article of marriage--to warn children against preferring a man of pleasure to a man of probity upon that dangerous but too-commonly-received notion, that a reformed rake makes the best husband--but above all, to investigate the highest and most important doctrines not only of morality, but of Christianity, by showing children thrown into action in the conduct of the worthy characters; while the unworthy, who set those doctrines at defiance, are condignly, and, as may be said, consequentially punished.
From what has been said, considerate readers will not enter upon the perusal of the piece before considerate readers as if it were designed only to divert and amuse.
it will probably be thought tedious to all such as dip into it, expecting a light novel, or transitory romance; and look upon story in it (interesting as that is generally allowed to be) as it sole end, rather than as a vehicle to the instruction.
Different persons, as might be expected, have been of different opinions, in relation to the conduct of the Heroine in particular situations; and several worthy persons have objected to the general catastrophe, and other parts of the History.
Whatever is thought material of these shall be taken notice of by way of Postscript, at the conclusion of the History; for this work being addressed to the public as a history of life and manners, those parts of it which are proposed to carry with Whatever is thought material of these shall be taken notice of by way of Postscript, at the conclusion of the History; for this work being addressed to the public as a history of life and manners the force of an example, ought to be as unobjectionable as is consistent with the design of the whole, and with human nature.

THE HISTORY OF CLARISSA HARLOWE     LETTER I  MISS ANNA HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE JAN 10.
I am extremely concerned, my dearest friend, for the disturbances that have happened in your family.
I know how it must hurt you to become the subject of the public talk: and yet, upon an occasion so generally known, it is impossible but that whatever relates to a young lady, whose distinguished merits have made her the public care, should engage every body's attention.
I long to have the particulars from yourself; and of the usage I am told you receive upon an accident you could not help; and in which, as far as I can learn, the sufferer was the aggressor.
Mr. Diggs, the surgeon, whom I sent for at the first hearing of the rencounter, to inquire, for your sake, how her brother was, told me, that there was no danger from the wound, if there were none from the fever; which it seems has been increased by the perturbation of her brother spirits.
Mr. Wyerley drank tea with us yesterday; and though Mr. Wyerley is far from being partial to Mr. Lovelace, as it may well be supposed, yet both Mr. Wyerley and Mr. Symmes blame your family for the treatment your family gave Mr. Wyerley when Mr. Wyerley went in person to inquire after her brother's health, and to express Mr. Wyerley concern for what had happened.
both he and Mr. Symmes say, that Mr. Lovelace could not avoid drawing Mr. Lovelace sword: and that either your brother's unskilfulness or passion left Mr. Wyerley from the very first pass entirely in Mr. Wyerley power.
This, I am told, was what Mr. Lovelace said upon This; retreating as Mr. Lovelace spoke: 'Have a care, Mr. Harlowe--your violence puts you out of your defence.
You give me too much advantage.
For your sister's sake, I will pass by every thing:--if--'  But this the more provoked his rashness, to lay his open to the advantage of his adversary--who, after a slight wound given his in the arm, took away his sword.
There are people who love not your brother, because of your brother natural imperiousness and fierce and uncontroulable temper: these say, that the young gentleman's passion was abated on seeing his blood gush plentifully down his arm; and that his received the generous offices of his adversary (who helped his off with his coat and waistcoat, and bound up his arm, till the surgeon could come,) with such patience, as was far from making a visit afterwards from that adversary, to inquire after his health, appear either insulting or improper.
Be this as it may, every body pities you.
So steady, so uniform in your conduct: so desirous, as you always said, of sliding through life to the end of it unnoted; and, as I may add, not wishing to be observed even for your silent benevolence; sufficiently happy in the noble consciousness which attends it: Rather useful than glaring, your deserved motto; though now, to your regret, pushed into blaze, as I may say: and yet blamed at home for the faults of others--how must such a virtue suffer on every hand!--yet it must be allowed, that your present trial is but proportioned to your prudence.
As all your friends without doors are apprehensive that some other unhappy event may result from so violent a contention, in which it seems the families on both sides are now engaged, I must desire you to enable me, on the authority of your own information, to do you occasional justice.
My mother, and all of us, like the rest of the world, talk of nobody but you on this occasion, and of the consequences which may follow from the resentments of a man of Mr. Lovelace's spirit; who, as Mr. Lovelace gives out, has been treated with high indignity by your uncles.
My mother will have it, that you cannot now, with any decency, either see Mr. Lovelace, or correspond with Mr. Lovelace.
My mother is a good deal prepossessed by your uncle Antony; who occasionally calls upon us, as you know; and, on this rencounter, has represented to My mother the crime which it would be in a sister to encourage a man who is to wade into a sister favour (this was his expression) through the blood of My mother brother.
Write to me therefore, my dear, the whole of your story from the time that Mr. Lovelace was first introduced into your family; and particularly an account of all that passed between Mr. Lovelace and your sister; about which there are different reports; some people scrupling not to insinuate that the younger sister has stolen a lover from the elder: and pray write in so full a manner as may satisfy those who know not so much of your affairs as I do.
If anything unhappy should fall out from the violence of such spirits as you have to deal with, your account of all things previous to it will be your best justification.
You see what you draw upon yourself by excelling all your sex.
Every individual of it who knows you, or has heard of you, seems to think you answerable to her for your conduct in points so very delicate and concerning.
Every eye, in short, is upon you with the expectation of an example.
I wish to heaven you were at liberty to pursue your own methods: all would then, I dare say, be easy, and honourably ended.
But I dread your directors and directresses; for your mother, admirably well qualified as her is to lead, must submit to be led.
Your sister and brother will certainly put you out of your course.
But this is a point you will not permit me to expatiate upon: pardon me therefore, and I have done.--Yet, why should I say, pardon me?
when your concerns are my concerns?
when your honour is my honour?
when I love you, as never woman loved another?
and when you have allowed of that concern and of that love; and have for years, which in persons so young may be called many, ranked in the first class of your friends,  Your ever grateful and affectionate, ANNA HOWE.
Will you oblige me with a copy of the preamble to the clauses in your grandfather's will in your favour; and allow me to send your favour to my aunt Harman?--my aunt Harman is very desirous to see your favour.
Yet your character has so charmed my aunt Harman, that, though a stranger to you personally, my aunt Harman assents to the preference given you in that will, before my aunt Harman knows the testator's reasons for giving you that preference.
LETTER II  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE HARLOWE-PLACE, JAN. 13.
How you oppress me, my dearest friend, with your politeness!
I cannot doubt your sincerity; but you should take care, that you give me not reason from your kind partiality to call in question your judgment.
You do not distinguish that I take many admirable hints from you, and have the art to pass them upon you for my own: for in all you do, in all you say, nay, in your very looks (so animated!)
you give lessons to one who loves you and observes you as I love you and observe you, without knowing that you do--So pray, my dear, be more sparing of your praise for the future, lest after this confession we should suspect that you secretly intend to praise yourself, while you would be thought only to commend another.
we family has indeed been strangely discomposed.--Discomposed!--It has been in tumults, ever since the unhappy transaction; and I have borne all the blame; yet should have had too much concern from yourself, had I been more justly spared by every one else.
For, whether it be owing to a faulty impatience, having been too indulgently treated to be inured to blame, or to the regret I have to hear those censured on my account, whom it is my duty to vindicate; I have sometimes wished, that it had pleased God to have taken me in my last fever, when I had every body's love and good opinion; but oftener that I had never been distinguished by my grandfather as I was: since that distinction has estranged from me my brother's and sister's affections; at least, has raised a jealousy with regard to the apprehended favour of my two uncles, that now-and-then overshadows the apprehended favour of my two uncles love.
her brother being happily recovered of her brother fever, and her brother wound in a hopeful way, although her brother has not yet ventured abroad, I will be as particular as you desire in the little history you demand of her brother.
But heaven forbid that any thing should ever happen which may require it to be produced for the purpose you mention!
I will begin, as you command, with Mr. Lovelace's address to my sister; and be as brief as possible.
I will recite facts only; and leave you to judge of the truth of the report raised, that my sister has robbed the elder.
It was in pursuance of a conference between Lord M. and my uncle Antony, that Mr. Lovelace [my father and mother not forbidding] paid Mr. Lovelace [my father and mother not forbidding] respect to my sister.
her brother was then in Scotland, busying her brother in viewing the condition of the considerable estate which was left her brother there by her brother generous godmother, together with one as considerable in Yorkshire.
I was also absent at my Dairy-house, as my Dairy-house is called,* busied in the accounts relating to the estate which my grandfather had the goodness to devise to me; and which once a year was left to my inspection, although I have given the whole into my father's power.
* Her grandfather, in order to invite Her to * Her grandfather as often as      Her other friends would spare Her, indulged Her in erecting      and fitting up a diary-house in Her own taste.
When      finished,       was so much admired for       elegant simplicity      and convenience, that the whole seat (before, of old time,      from       situation, called The Grove) was generally known by      the name of The Dairy-house.
Her grandfather in particular      was fond of having Her grandfather in particular       so called.
my sister made me a visit there the day after Mr. Lovelace had been introduced; and seemed highly pleased with the gentleman.
Mr. Lovelace birth, Mr. Lovelace fortune in possession, a clear 2000L.
a year, as Lord M. had assured my uncle; presumptive heir to that nobleman's large estate: Mr. Lovelace great expectations from Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrence; who with Mr. Lovelace uncle interested Lady Sarah Sadleir and Lady Betty Lawrence; who with his uncle interested themselves very warmly very warmly (his uncle being the last of his uncle line) to see his uncle married.
'So handsome a man!--O her beloved Clary!'
(for then her was ready to love me dearly, from the overflowings of her good humour on his uncle account!)
'his uncle was but too handsome a man for her!--Were her but as amiable as somebody, there would be a probability of holding his uncle affections!--For his uncle was wild, her heard; very wild, very gay; loved intrigue--but his uncle was young; a man of sense: would see his uncle error, could her but have patience with his uncle faults, if his faults were not cured by marriage!'
Thus her ran on; and then wanted me 'to see a man for her!--Were,' as her called a man for her!--Were.--Again concerned, 'that her was not handsome enough for a man for her!--Were;' with, 'a sad thing, that a man for her!--Were should have the advantage of the woman in that particular!'
--But then, stepping to the glass, her complimented her, 'That her was very well: that there were many women deemed passable who were inferior to her: that her was always thought comely; and comeliness, let her tell me, having not so much to lose as beauty had, would hold, when that would evaporate or fly off:--nay, for that matter,' [and again her turned to the glass] 'her features were not irregular; her eyes not at all amiss.'
And I remember they were more than usually brilliant at that time.--'Nothing, in short, to be found fault with, though nothing very engaging her doubted--was there, Clary.'
Excuse me, my dear, I never was thus particular before; no, not to you.
Nor would I now have written thus freely of a sister, but that a sister makes a merit to my brother of disowning that a sister ever liked him; as I shall mention hereafter: and then you will always have me give you minute descriptions, nor suffer me to pass by the air and manner in which things are spoken that are to be taken notice of; rightly observing, that air and manner often express more than the accompanying words.
I congratulated a sister upon a sister prospects.
a sister received my compliments with a great deal of self-complacency.
a sister liked the gentleman still more at the gentleman next visit; and yet the gentleman made no particular address to a sister, although an opportunity was given the gentleman for no particular address.
This was wondered at, as his uncle has introduced the gentleman into Our family declaredly as a visitor to my sister.
But as our are ever ready to make excuses when in good humour with our for the perhaps not unwilful slights of those whose approbation we wish to engage; so my sister found out a reason much to Mr. Lovelace's advantage for Mr. Lovelace not improving the opportunity that was given Mr.
Lovelace.--It was bashfulness, truly, in Mr. Lovelace.
[Bashfulness in Mr. Lovelace, my dear!]
--Indeed, gay and lively as Mr. Lovelace is, Mr. Lovelace has not the look of an impudent man.
But, I fancy, it is many, many years ago since Mr. Lovelace was bashful.
Thus, however, could my sister make it out--'Upon my sister word, my sister believed Mr. Lovelace deserved not the bad character Mr. Lovelace had as to women.--Mr.
Lovelace was really, to my sister thinking, a modest man.
Mr. Lovelace would have spoken out, my sister believed; but once or twice as Mr. Lovelace seemed to intend to do so, Mr. Lovelace was under so agreeable a confusion!
Such a profound respect Mr. Lovelace seemed to shew her!
A perfect reverence, my sister thought: my sister loved dearly that a man in courtship should shew a reverence to his mistress'--So indeed we all do, I believe: and with reason; since, if I may judge from what I have seen in many families, there is little enough of it shewn afterwards.--And my sister told my aunt Hervey, that my sister would be a little less upon the reserve next time his came: 'my sister was not one of those flirts, not she, who would give pain to a person that deserved to be well-treated; and the more pain for the greatness of his value for her.'
--I wish my sister had not somebody whom I love in my sister eye.
In his , my sister governed my sister by this kind and considerate principle: so that, according to my sister own account of the matter, a man for her!--Were might have spoken out.--But a man for her!--Were was still bashful: a man for her!--Were was not able to overcome this unseasonable reverence.
So his next visit went off as the former.
But now my sister began to be dissatisfied with a man for her!--Were.
my sister compared a man for her!--Were general character with this a man for her!--Were particular behaviour to my sister; and having never been courted before, owned my sister puzzled how to deal with so odd a lover.
'What did a man for her!--Were mean, my sister wondered?
Had not his uncle brought a man for her!--Were declaredly as a suitor to my sister?--It could not be bashfulness (now my sister thought of It) since a man for her!--Were might have opened a man for her!--Were mind to his uncle, if a man for her!--Were wanted courage to speak directly to my sister.--Not that my sister cared much for a man for her!--Were neither: but it was right, surely, that a woman should be put out of doubt early as to a man's intentions in such a case as this, from a man own mouth.--But, truly, my sister had begun to think, that a man was more solicitous to cultivate my sister mamma's good opinion, than hers!--Every body, my sister owned, admired my sister mother's conversation; but a man was mistaken if a man thought respect to her mother only would do with my sister.
And then, for a man own sake, surely a man should put it into my sister power to be complaisant to a man, if a man gave my sister reason to approve of a man.
This distant behaviour, my sister must take upon my sister to say, was the more extraordinary, as a man continued a man visits, and declared a man extremely desirous to cultivate a friendship with the whole family; and as a man could have no doubt about my sister sense, if my sister might take upon my sister to join my sister own with the general opinion; a man having taken great notice of, and admired many of my sister good things as they fell from my sister lips.
Reserves were painful, my sister must needs say, to open and free spirits, like my sister: and yet my sister must tell my aunt Hervey,' (to whom all this was directed) 'that my sister should never forget what my sister owed to my sister sex, and to my sister, were Mr. Lovelace as unexceptionable in Mr. Lovelace morals as in Mr. Lovelace figure, and were Mr. Lovelace to urge Mr. Lovelace suit ever so warmly.'
I was not of my sister council.
I was still absent.
And it was agreed upon between my aunt Hervey and her, that her was to be quite solemn and shy in Mr. Lovelace , if there were not a peculiarity in Mr. Lovelace address to her.
But my sister had not considered the matter well.
This was not the way, as This proved, to be taken for matters of mere omission, with a man of Mr. Lovelace's penetration.
Nor with any man; since if love has not taken root deep enough to cause love to shoot out into declaration, if an opportunity be fairly given for love, there is little room to expect, that the blighting winds of anger or resentment will bring love forward.
Then my sister is not naturally good-humoured.
This is too well-known a truth for me to endeavor to conceal it, especially from you.
my sister must therefore, I doubt, have appeared to great disadvantages when my sister aimed to be worse tempered than ordinary.
How they managed it in they next conversation I know not.
One would be tempted to think by the issue, that Mr. Lovelace was ungenerous enough to seek the occasion given,* and to improve it.
Yet Mr. Lovelace thought fit to put the question too:--But, my sister says, it was not till, by some means or other (my sister knew not how) Mr. Lovelace had wrought my sister up to such a pitch of displeasure with Mr. Lovelace, that it was impossible for my sister to recover my sister at the instant.
Nevertheless Mr. Lovelace re-urged Mr. Lovelace question, as expecting a definitive answer, without waiting for the return of my sister temper, or endeavouring to mollify my sister; so that my sister was under a necessity of persisting in my sister denial: yet gave Mr. Lovelace reason to think my sister did not dislike Mr. Lovelace address, only the manner of his address; Mr. Lovelace court being rather made to her mother than to my sister, as if Mr. Lovelace was sure of my sister consent at any time.
* See Mr. Lovelace's Letter, No.
XXXI, in which he briefly      accounts for he conduct in this affair.
A good encouraging denial, I must own: as was the rest of my sister plea; to wit, 'A disinclination to change my sister state.
Exceedingly happy as my sister was: my sister never could be happier!'
And such-like consenting negatives, as I may call them, and yet not intend a reflection upon my sister: for what can any young creature in the like circumstances say, when my sister is not sure but a too-ready consent may subject my sister to the slights of a sex that generally values a blessing either more or less as it is obtained with difficulty or ease?
Miss Biddulph's answer to a copy of verse from a gentleman, reproaching our sex as acting in disguise, is not a bad one, although you may perhaps think it too acknowledging for the female character.
Ungen'rous Sex!--To scorn our if our're kind;    And yet upbraid our if our seem severe!
Do you, t' encourage our to tell our mind,    Yourselves put off disguise, and be sincere.
You talk of coquetry!--Your own false hearts  Compel our sex to act dissembling parts.
Here I am obliged to lay down my pen.
I will soon resume my pen.
LETTER III  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE JAN. 13, 14.
And thus, as Mr. Lovelace thought fit to take it, had Mr. Lovelace Mr. Lovelace answer from my sister.
It was with very great regret, as Mr. Lovelace pretended, [I doubt a man for her!--Were is an hypocrite, my dear] that a man for her!--Were acquiesced in it.
'So much determinedness; such a noble firmness in my sister, that there was no hope of prevailing upon my sister to alter sentiments my sister had adopted on full consideration.'
Mr. Lovelace sighed, as my sister told us, when Mr. Lovelace took Mr. Lovelace leave of my sister: 'Profoundly sighed; grasped my sister hand, and kissed her hand with such an ardour--Withdrew with such an air of solemn respect--my sister could almost find her hand in my sister heart, although Mr. Lovelace had vexed my sister, to pity Mr.
Lovelace.'
A good intentional preparative to love, this pity; since, at the time, my sister little thought that Mr. Lovelace would not renew Mr. Lovelace offer.
Mr. Lovelace waited on her mother after Mr. Lovelace had taken leave of my sister, and reported Mr. Lovelace ill success in so respectful a manner, as well with regard to my sister, as to the whole family, and with so much concern that Mr. Lovelace was not accepted as a relation to it, that it left upon them all (my brother being then, as I have said, in Scotland) impressions in Mr. Lovelace favour, and a belief that this matter would certainly be brought on again.
But Mr. Lovelace going up directly to town, where Mr. Lovelace staid a whole fortnight, and meeting there with my uncle Antony, to whom Mr. Lovelace regretted Mr. Lovelace niece's cruel resolution not to change his niece state; it was seen that there was a total end of the affair.
my sister was not wanting to my sister on this occasion.
my sister made a virtue of necessity; and a man for her!--Were was quite another man with my sister.
'A vain creature!
Too well knowing a man for her!--Were advantages: yet those not what my sister had conceived those to be!--Cool and warm by fits and starts; an ague-like lover.
A steady man, a man of virtue, a man of morals, was worth a thousand of such gay flutterers.
my sister might think it worth my sister while perhaps to try to engage such a man: my sister had patience: my sister was mistress of persuasion: and indeed, to do the girl justice, had something of a person: But as for my sister, my sister would not have a man of whose heart my sister could not be sure for one moment; no, not for the world: and most sincerely glad was my sister that my sister had rejected a man of whose heart she could not be sure for one moment.'
But when Mr. Lovelace returned into the country, Mr. Lovelace thought fit to visit my father and mother; hoping, as Mr. Lovelace told my father and mother, that, however unhappy Mr. Lovelace had been in the rejection of the wished-for alliance, Mr. Lovelace might be allowed to keep up an acquaintance and friendship with a family which Mr. Lovelace should always respect.
And then unhappily, as I may say, was I at home and present.
It was immediately observed, that Mr. Lovelace attention was fixed on me.
my sister, as soon as Mr. Lovelace was gone, in a spirit of bravery, seemed desirous to promote Mr. Lovelace address, should his address be tendered.
My aunt Hervey was there; and was pleased to say, we should make the finest couple in England--if my sister had no objection.--No, indeed!
with a haughty toss, was my sister's reply--it would be strange if my sister had no objection, after the denial my sister had given my sister had no objection upon full deliberation.
her mother declared, that my sister only dislike of my sister had no objection alliance with either daughter, was on account of my sister had no objection reputed faulty morals.
My uncle Harlowe, that my sister had no objection daughter Clary, as my sister had no objection delighted to call me from childhood, would reform my sister had no objection if any woman in the world could.
my uncle Antony gave my uncle Antony approbation in high terms: but referred, as My aunt Hervey had done, to my sister.
My aunt Hervey repeated My aunt Hervey contempt of him; and declared, that, were there not another man in England, My aunt Hervey would not have him.
My aunt Hervey was ready, on the contrary, My aunt Hervey could assure them, to resign My aunt Hervey pretensions under hand and seal, if my sister were taken with my sister tinsel, and if every one else approved of his address to the girl.
my sister indeed, after a long silence, being urged by my uncle Antony to speak my sister mind, said, that my sister had a letter from my sister son, on my sister hearing of Mr. Lovelace's visits to my sister daughter Arabella; which my sister had not shewn to any body but my mother; that treaty being at an end when my sister received any body: that in a letter from his son my sister expressed great dislike to an alliance with Mr. Lovelace on the score of Mr. Lovelace immoralities: that Mr. Lovelace knew, indeed, there was an old grudge between them; but that, being desirous to prevent all occasions of disunion and animosity in Mr. Lovelace family, Mr. Lovelace would suspend the declaration of Mr. Lovelace own mind till his son arrived, and till Mr. Lovelace had heard Mr. Lovelace further objections: that Mr. Lovelace was the more inclined to make his son this compliment, as Mr. Lovelace's general character gave but too much ground for Mr. Lovelace's general character 's dislike of his son; adding, that Mr. Lovelace's general character had hear (so, Mr. Lovelace's general character supposed, had every one,) that Mr. Lovelace's general character was a very extravagant man; that Mr. Lovelace's general character had contracted debts in Mr. Lovelace's general character travels: and indeed, Mr. Lovelace's general character was pleased to say, Mr. Lovelace's general character had the air of a spendthrift.
These particulars I had partly from My aunt Hervey, and partly from my sister; for I was called out as soon as the subject was entered upon.
When I returned, my uncle Antony asked me, how I should like Mr. Lovelace?
Every body saw, Mr. Lovelace was pleased to say, that I had made a conquest.
I immediately answered, that I did not like Mr. Lovelace at all: Mr. Lovelace seemed to have too good an opinion both on Mr. Lovelace person and parts, to have any regard to Mr. Lovelace wife, let Mr. Lovelace marry whom Mr. Lovelace would.
my sister particularly was pleased with this answer, and confirmed this answer to be just; with a compliment to my judgment.--For it was my sister.
But the very next day Lord M. came to Harlowe-Place [I was then absent]; and in Lord M. nephew's name made a proposal in form; declaring, that it was the ambition of all Lord M. family to be related to ours: and Lord M. hoped Lord M. kinsman would not have such an answer on the part of the younger sister, as his kinsman had on that of the elder.
In short, Mr. Lovelace's visits were admitted as those of a man who had not deserved disrespect from our family; but as to a man who had not deserved disrespect from our family address to me, with a reservation, as above, on my sister's part, that a man who had not deserved disrespect from our family would determine nothing without a man who had not deserved disrespect from our family .
My discretion as to the rest was confided in: for still I had the same objections as to the man: nor would I, when we were better acquainted, hear any thing but general talk from the man; giving the man no opportunity of conversing with me in private.
the man bore this with a resignation little expected from the man natural temper, which is generally reported to be quick and hasty; unused it seems from childhood to check or controul.
A case too common in considerable families where there is an only son: and an only son never had any other child.
But, as I have heretofore told you, I could perceive, notwithstanding this resignation, that an only son had so good an opinion of an only son, as not to doubt, that an only son person and accomplishments would insensibly engage me: And could that be once done, an only son told My aunt Hervey Hervey, an only son should hope, from so steady a temper, that an only son hold in my affections would be durable: While my sister accounted for an only son patience in another manner, which would perhaps have had more force if it had come from a person less prejudiced: 'That the man was not fond of marrying at all: that the man might perhaps have half a score mistresses: and that delay might be as convenient for the man roving, as for my well-acted indifference.'
That was her kind expression.
Whatever was the man motive for a patience so generally believed to be out of the man usual character, and where the object of the man was supposed to be of fortune considerable enough to engage the man warmest attention, the man certainly escaped many mortifications by many mortifications: for while my sister suspended my sister approbation till my brother's arrival, Mr. Lovelace received from every one those civilities which were due to Mr. Lovelace birth: and although we heard from time to time reports to Mr. Lovelace disadvantage with regard to morals, yet could we not question Mr. Lovelace upon them without giving Mr. Lovelace greater advantages in Mr. Lovelace own opinion than the situation Mr. Lovelace was in with we would justify to prudence; since it was much more likely that his address would not be allowed of, than that his address would.
And thus was Mr. Lovelace admitted to converse with our family almost upon Mr. Lovelace own terms; for while my friends saw nothing in Mr. Lovelace behaviour but what was extremely respectful, and observed in Mr. Lovelace no violent importunity, my friends seemed to have taken a great liking to Mr. Lovelace conversation: While I considered Mr. Lovelace only as a common guest when Mr. Lovelace came; and thought Mr. Lovelace no more concerned in Mr. Lovelace visits, not at Mr. Lovelace entrance and departure, than any other of the family.
But this indifference on my side was the means of procuring Mr. Lovelace one very great advantage; since upon it was grounded that correspondence by letters which succeeded;--and which, had it been to be begun when the family animosity broke out, would never have been entered into on my father's part.
The occasion was this:  my uncle Antony has a young gentleman intrusted to my uncle Antony care, whom my uncle Antony has thoughts of sending abroad a year or two hence, to make the Grand Tour, as it is called; and finding Mr. Lovelace could give a good account of every thing necessary for a young traveller to observe upon such an occasion, Mr. Lovelace desired Mr. Lovelace to write down a description of the courts and countries Mr. Lovelace had visited, and what was most worthy of curiosity in the courts and countries he had visited.
Mr. Lovelace consented, on condition that I would direct Mr. Lovelace subjects, as Mr. Lovelace called it: and as every one had heard Mr. Lovelace manner of writing commended; and thought Mr. Lovelace narratives might be agreeable amusements in winter evenings; and that Mr. Lovelace could have no opportunity particularly to address me directly in his narratives, since his narratives were to be read in full assembly before his narratives were given to the young gentleman, I made the less scruple to write, and to make observations, and put questions for our further information--Still the less perhaps as I love writing; and those who do, are fond, you know, of occasions to use the pen: And then, having ever one's consent, and my uncle Hervey's desire that I would write, I thought that if I had been the only scrupulous person, it would have shewn a particularity that a vain man might construe to a vain man advantage; and which my sister would not fail to animadvert upon.
You have seen some of these letters; and have been pleased with this account of persons, places, and things; and we have both agreed, that he was no common observer upon what he had seen.
my sister allowed that the man had a tolerable knack of writing and describing: And my father, who had been abroad in the man youth, said, that the man remarks were curious, and shewed the man to be a person of reading, judgment and taste.
Thus was a kind of correspondence begun between the man and me, with general approbation; while every one wondered at, and was pleased with, the man patient veneration of me; for so him and me called his patient veneration of me.
However, his patient veneration of me was not doubted but the man would soon be more importunate, since his visits were more frequent, and the man acknowledged to My aunt Hervey a passion for me, accompanied with an awe that the man had never known before; to which the man attributed what the man called the man but seeming acquiescence with my sister's pleasure, and the distance I kept the man at.
And yet, my dear, this may be the man usual manner of behaviour to our sex; for had not my sister at first all the man reverence?
Mean time, my father, expecting the man importunity, kept in readiness the reports the man had heard in the man disfavour, to charge them upon the man then, as so many objections to address.
And it was highly agreeable to me that the man did so: it would have been strange if it were not; since the person who could reject Mr. Wyerley's address for the sake of the man free opinions, must have been inexcusable, had she not rejected another's for the man freer practices.
But I should own, that in the letters the man sent me upon the general subject, the man more than once inclosed a particular one, declaring the man passionate regards for me, and complaining with fervour enough, of my reserves.
But of these I took not the least notice: for, as I had not written to the man at all, but upon a subject so general, I thought it was but right to let what the man wrote upon one so particular pass off as if I had never seen it; and the rather, as I was not then at liberty (from the approbation the man letters met with) to break off the correspondence, unless I had assigned the true reason for doing so.
Besides, with all his respectful assiduities, it was easy to observe, (if it had not been his general character) that his temper is naturally haughty and violent; and I had seen too much of that untractable spirit in my brother to like it in one who hoped to be still more nearly related to his.
I had a little specimen of his temper my brother upon the very occasion I have mentioned: For after my brother had sent me a third particular letter with the general one, my brother asked me the next time my brother came to Harlowe-Place, if I had not received such a one from my brother?--I told my brother I should never answer one so sent; and that I had waited for such an occasion as my brother had now given me, to tell my brother so: I desired my brother therefore not to write again on the subject; assuring my brother, that if my brother did, I would return both, and never write another line to my brother.
You can't imagine how saucily the man looked; as if, in short, the man was disappointed that the man had not made a more sensible impression upon the man: nor, when the man recollected the man (as the man did immediately), what a visible struggle what a visible struggle cost the man to change the man haughty airs for more placid ones.
But I took no notice of either; for I thought it best to convince the man, by the coolness and indifference with which I repulsed the man forward hopes (at the same time intending to avoid the affectation of pride or vanity) that the man was not considerable enough in my eyes to make me take over-ready offence at what the man said, or at the man haughty looks: in other words, that I had not value enough for the man to treat the man with peculiarity either by smiles or frowns.
Indeed the man had cunning enough to give me, undesignedly, a piece of instruction which taught me this caution; for the man had said in conversation once, 'That if a man could not make a woman in courtship own a woman in courtship pleased with a man, it was as much and oftentimes more to a man purpose to make a woman in courtship angry with a man.'
I must break off here, but will continue the subject the very first opportunity.
Mean time, I am  Your most affectionate friend and servant, CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER IV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE JAN. 15.
Such, my dear, was the situation Mr. Lovelace and I were in when my brother arrived from Scotland.
The moment Mr. Lovelace's visits were mentioned to my brother, my brother, without either hesitation or apology, expressed my brother disapprobation of Mr. Lovelace and I. my brother found great flaws in my brother character; and took the liberty to say in so many words, that my brother wondered how the liberty came into the heads of my brother uncles to encourage such a man for either of my brother sisters: At the same time returning my brother thanks to my sister for declining my brother consent till my brother arrived, in such a manner, I thought, as a superior would do, when my brother commended an inferior for having well performed my brother duty in my brother absence.
my brother justified my brother avowed inveteracy by common fame, and by what my brother had known of my brother at college; declaring, that my brother had ever hated my brother; ever should hate my brother; and would never own my brother for a brother, or me for a sister, if I married my brother.
That early antipathy I have heard accounted for in this manner:  Mr. Lovelace was always noted for Mr. Lovelace vivacity and courage; and no less, it seems, for the swift and surprising progress Mr. Lovelace made in all parts of literature: for diligence in Mr. Lovelace studies in the hours of study, Mr. Lovelace had hardly Mr. Lovelace equal.
This it seems was Mr. Lovelace general character at the university; and it gained Mr. Lovelace many friends among the more learned; while those who did not love Mr. Lovelace, feared Mr. Lovelace, by reason of the offence Mr. Lovelace vivacity made Mr. Lovelace too ready to give, and of the courage Mr. Lovelace shewed in supporting the offence when given; which procured Mr. Lovelace as many followers as Mr. Lovelace pleased among the mischievous sort.--No very amiable character, you'll say, upon the whole.
But my brother's temper was not more happy.
my brother native haughtiness could not bear a superiority so visible; and whom we fear more than love, we are not far from hating: and having less command of my brother passions than the other, my brother was evermore the subject of my brother perhaps indecent ridicule: so that every body, either from love or fear, siding with my brother antagonist, my brother had a most uneasy time of it while both continued in the same college.--It was the less wonder therefore that a young man who is not noted for the gentleness of my brother's temper, should resume an antipathy early begun, and so deeply rooted.
my brother found my sister, who waited but for The occasion, ready to join my brother in my brother resentments against the man my brother hated.
She utterly disclaimed all manner of regard for my brother: 'Never liked my brother at all:--my brother estate was certainly much incumbered: His estate was impossible His estate should be otherwise; so entirely devoted as my brother was to my brother pleasures.
my brother kept no house; had no equipage: Nobody pretended that my brother wanted pride: the reason therefore was easy to be guessed at.'
And then did she boast of, and my brother praised she for, refusing my brother: and both joined on all occasions to depreciate my brother, and not seldom made all occasions; both displeasure against my brother causing every subject to run into this, if it began not with it.
I was not solicitous to vindicate my brother when I was not joined in both reflection.
I told both I did not value my brother enough to make a difference in the family on my brother account: and as my brother was supposed to have given much cause for both ill opinion of my brother, I thought my brother ought to take the consequence of my brother own faults.
Now and then indeed, when I observed that both vehemence carried both beyond all bounds of probability in both charges against my brother, I thought it but justice to put in a word for my brother.
But this only subjected me to reproach, as having a prepossession in my brother favour which I would not own.--So that, when I could not change the subject, I used to retire either to my music, or to my closet.
Their behaviour to my brother, when Their could not help seeing my brother, was very cold and disobliging; but as yet not directly affrontive.
For Their were in hopes of prevailing upon my sister to forbid my sister visits.
But as there was nothing in my sister behaviour, that might warrant such a treatment of a man of my sister birth and fortune, Their succeeded not: And then Their were very earnest with me to forbid Their.
I asked, what authority I had to take such a step in my sister's house; and when my behaviour to my sister was so distant, that my sister seemed to be as much the guest of any other person of the family, the family excepted, as mine?--In revenge, the family told me, that it was cunning management between us; and that we both understood one another better than us pretended to do.
And at last the family gave such a loose to the family passions, all of a sudden* as I may say, that instead of withdrawing, as the family used to do when he came, the family threw the family in he way purposely to affront he.
* The reason of this the family more openly shown animosity is      given in Letter XIII.
Mr. Lovelace, you may believe, very ill brooked this: but nevertheless contented Mr. Lovelace to complain of this to Mr. Lovelace: in high terms, however, telling me, that but for my sake my brother's treatment of my brother was not to be borne.
I was sorry for the merit this gave my brother in my brother own opinion with Mr. Lovelace: and the more, as some of the affronts my brother received were too flagrant to be excused: But I told my brother, that I was determined not to fall out with my brother, if I could help it, whatever faults my brother had: and since I was determined not to fall out with my brother, if I could help it, whatever faults he had could not see one another with temper, should be glad that my brother would not throw my brother in my brother's way; and I was sure my brother would not seek my brother.
my brother was very much nettled at this answer: But said, my brother must bear my brother affronts if I would have his affronts so.
my brother had been accused my brother of violence in my brother temper; but my brother hoped to shew on this occasion that my brother had a command of my brother passions which few young men, so highly provoked, would be able to shew; and doubted not but it would be attributed to a proper motive by a person of my generosity and penetration.
my brother had just before, with the approbation of my uncles, employed a person related to a discharged bailiff or steward of Lord M. who had had the management of some part of Mr. Lovelace's affairs (from which my brother was also dismissed by my brother) to inquire into my brother debts, after my brother companions, into my brother amours, and the like.
My aunt Hervey, in confidence, gave me the following particulars of what the man had said of the man.
'That the man was a generous landlord: that the man spared nothing for solid and lasting improvements upon the man ; and that the man looked into the man own affairs, and understood My aunt Hervey, in confidence: that the man had been very expensive when abroad; and contracted a large debt (for the man made no secret of the man affairs); yet chose to limit the man to an annual sum, and to decline equipage, in order to avoid being obliged to the man uncle and aunts; from whom the man might have what money the man pleased; but that the man was very jealous of his uncle and aunts controul; had often quarrels with his uncle and aunts; and treated his uncle and aunts so freely, that his uncle and aunts were all afraid of the man.
However, that the man was never mortgaged, as my brother had heard His estate was; the man credit was always high; and the man believed, the man was by this time near upon, if not quite, clear of the world.
'the man was a sad gentleman, the man said, as to women:--If the man tenants had pretty daughters, his tenants chose to keep his tenants out of the man sight.
the man believed the man kept no particular mistress; for the man had heard newelty, that was the man's word, was every thing with the man.
But for the man uncle's and aunt's teazings, the man fancied the man would not think of marriage: the man was never known to be disguised with liquor; but was a great plotter, and a great writer: That the man lived a wild life in town, by what the man had heard: had six or seven companions as bad as the man; whom now and then the man brought down with the man; and the country was always glad when six or seven companions as bad as himself went up again.
the man would have it, that although passionate, the man was good-humoured; loved as well to take a jest as to give one; and would rally the man upon occasion the freest of any man the man ever knew.'
This was the man character from an enemy; for, as my aunt observed, every thing the man said commendably of the man came grudgingly, with a must needs say--to do the man justice, &c. while the contrary was delivered with a free good-will.
And this character, as a worse was expected, though this was bad enough, not answering the end of inquiring after it, my brother and sister were more apprehensive than before, that the man address would be encouraged, since the worst part of his address was known, or supposed, when the man was first introduced to my sister.
But, with regard to myself, I must observe in the man disfavour, that, notwithstanding the merit the man wanted to make with myself for the man patience upon my brother's ill-treatment of the man, I owed the man no compliments for trying to conciliate with the man.
Not that I believe it would have signified any thing if the man had made ever such court either to the man or to my sister: yet one might have expected from a man of the man politeness, and from the man pretensions, you know, that the man would have been willing to try.
Instead of which, the man shewed such a contempt both of my brother and my sister, especially my brother, as was construed into a defiance of such a contempt both of my brother and my sister, especially my brother.
And for me to have hinted at an alteration in the man behaviour to my brother, was an advantage I knew the man would have been proud of; and which therefore I had no mind to give the man.
But I doubted not that having so very little encouragement from any body, the man pride would soon take fire, and the man would of the man discontinue the man visits, or go to town; where, till the man came acquainted with our family, the man used chiefly to reside: And in this latter case the man had no reason to expect, that I would receive, much less answer, the man Letters: the occasions which had led me to receive any of the man, being by this time over.
But my brother's antipathy would not permit the man to wait for such an event; and after several excesses, which Mr. Lovelace still returned with contempt, and a haughtiness too much like that of the aggressor, my brother took upon my brother to fill up the door-way once when my brother came, as if to oppose my brother entrance: And upon my brother asking for my brother, demanded, what my brother business was with my brother sister?
The other, with a challenging air, as my brother says, told my brother, my brother would answer a gentleman any question; but my brother wished that Mr. James Harlowe, who had of late given my brother high airs, would remember that my brother was not now at college.
Just then the good Dr. Lewen, who frequently honours me with a visit of conversation, as my brother is pleased to call it, and had parted with me in my own parlour, came to the door: and hearing the words, interposed; both having both hands upon both swords: and telling Mr. Lovelace where I was, Mr. Lovelace burst by my brother, to come to me; leaving Mr. Lovelace chafing, Mr. Lovelace said, like a hunted boar at bay.
This alarmed us all.
my sister was pleased to hint to Mr. Lovelace, that my sister wished my sister would discontinue my sister visits for the peace-sake of the family: And I, by my sister command, spoke a great deal plainer.
But Mr. Lovelace is a man not easily brought to give up Mr. Lovelace purpose, especially in a point wherein Mr. Lovelace pretends Mr. Lovelace heart is so much engaged: and no absolute prohibition having been given, things went on for a little while as before: for I saw plainly, that to have denied Mr. Lovelace to Mr. Lovelace visits (which however I declined receiving as often as I could) was to bring forward some desperate issue between the two; since the offence so readily given on one side was brooked by the other only out of consideration to Mr. Lovelace.
And thus did my brother's rashness lay me under an obligation where I would least have owed my brother's rashness.
The intermediate proposals of Mr. Symmes and Mr. Mullins, both (in turn) encouraged by my brother, induced my brother to be more patient for a while, as nobody thought me over-forward in Mr. Lovelace's favour; for my brother hoped that my brother should engage my father and uncles to approve of the one or the other in opposition to the man my brother hated.
But when my brother found that I had interest enough to disengage my brother from the addresses of those gentlemen, as I had (before my brother went to Scotland, and before Mr. Lovelace visited here) of Mr. Wyerley's, my brother then kept no measures: and first set my brother to upbraid me for supposed prepossession, which my brother treated as if no measures were criminal; and then to insult Mr. Lovelace in person, at Mr. Edward Symmes's, the brother of the other Symmes, two miles off; and no good Dr. Lewen being there to interpose, the unhappy rencounter followed.
my brother was disarmed, as you have heard; and on being brought home, and giving us ground to suppose my brother was much worse hurt than my brother really was, and a fever ensuing, every one flamed out; and all was laid at the door.
Mr. Lovelace for three days together sent twice each day to inquire after my brother's health; and although my brother received rude and even shocking returns, my brother thought fit on the fourth day to make in person the same inquiries; and received still greater incivilities from my two uncles, who happened to be both there.
my sister also was held by force from going to my sister with my sister sword in my sister hand, although my sister had the gout upon my sister.
I fainted away with terror, seeing every one so violent, and hearing Mr. Lovelace swear that Mr. Lovelace would not depart till Mr. Lovelace had made my uncles ask Mr. Lovelace pardon for the indignities Mr. Lovelace had received at their hands; a door being held fast locked between Mr. Lovelace and their.
My mother all the time was praying and struggling to with-hold my father in the great parlour.
Meanwhile my sister, who had treated Mr. Lovelace with virulence, came in to me, and insulted me as fast as I recovered.
But when Mr. Lovelace was told how ill I was, Mr. Lovelace departed; nevertheless vowing revenge.
Mr. Lovelace was ever a favourite with our domestics.
Mr. Lovelace bounty to our domestics, and having always something facetious to say to each, had made our domestics all of Mr. Lovelace party: and on this occasion our domestics privately blamed every body else, and reported Mr. Lovelace calm and gentlemanly behaviour (till the provocations given Mr. Lovelace ran very high) in such favourable terms, that those reports, and my apprehensions of the consequence of this treatment, induced me to read a letter Mr. Lovelace sent me that night; and, it being written in the most respectful terms (offering to submit the whole to my decision, and to govern Mr. Lovelace entirely by my will) to answer the whole some days after.
To this unhappy necessity was owing our renewed correspondence, as I may call it; yet I did not write till I had informed myself from Mr. Symmes's brother, that Mr. Symmes's brother was really insulted into the act of drawing Mr. Symmes's brother by my brother's repeatedly threatening (upon Mr. Symmes's brother excusing Mr. Symmes's brother out of regard to myself) to brand me ir Mr. Symmes's brother did not; and, by all the inquiry I could make, that Mr. Symmes's brother was again the sufferer from my uncles in a more violent manner than I have related.
The same circumstances were related to my father and other relations by Mr. Symmes; but my father and other relations by Mr. Symmes had gone too far in making my father and other relations by Mr. Symmes parties to the quarrel either to retract or forgive; and I was forbidden to correspond with Mr. Symmes's brother, or to be seen a moment in Mr. Symmes's brother company.
One thing however I can say, but that in confidence, because My mother commanded me not to mention it:--That, expressing My mother apprehension of the consequences of the indignities offered to Mr. Lovelace, My mother told me, My mother would leave it to my prudence to do all I could to prevent the impending mischief on one side.
I am obliged to break off.
But I believe I have written enough to answer very fully all that you have required of me.
It is not for a child to seek to clear My mother own character, or to justify My mother actions, at the expense of the most revered ones: yet, as I know that the account of all those further proceedings by which I may be affected, will be interesting to so dear a friend (who will communicate to others no more than what is fitting) I will continue to write, as I have opportunity, as minutely as we are used to write to each other.
Indeed I have no delight, as I have often told you, equal to that which I take in conversing with you by letter, when I cannot in person.
Mean time, I cannot help saying, that I am exceedingly concerned to find, that I am become so much the public talk as you tell me I am.
Your kind, your precautionary regard for my fame, and the opportunity you have given me to tell my own story previous to any new accident (which heaven avert!)
is so like the warm friend I have ever found in my dear Miss Howe, that, with redoubled obligation, you bind me to be  Your ever grateful and affectionate, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
Copy of the requested Preamble to the clauses in her Grandfather's Will: inclosed in the preceding Letter.
As the particular estate I have mentioned and described above, is principally of my own raising: as my three sons have been uncommonly prosperous; and are very rich: the eldest by means of the unexpected benefits he reaps from he new found mines; the second, by what has, as unexpectedly, fallen in to he on the deaths of several relations of he present wife, the worthy daughter by both sides of very honourable families; over and above the very large portion which he received with her in marriage: my son Antony by he East-India traffic, and successful voyages: as furthermore my grandson James will be sufficiently provided for by my grandson James grandmother Lovell's kindness to my grandson James; who, having no near relations, hath assured me, that her hath, as well by deed of gift as by will, left my grandson James both her Scottish and English estates: for never was there a family more prosperous in all its branches, blessed be God therefore: and as my said son James will very probably make it up to my grand-daughter Arabella; to whom I intend no disrespect; nor have reason; for her is a very hopeful and dutiful child: and as my sons, John and Antony, seem not inclined to a married life; so that son James is the only one who has children, or is likely to have any.
For all these reasons; and because my dearest and beloved grand-daughter Clarissa hath been from her infancy a matchless young creature in her duty to me, and admired by all who knew her, as a very extraordinary child; I must therefore take the pleasure of considering her as my own peculiar child; and this without intending offence; and I hope it will not be taken as any, since son James can bestow son James favours accordingly, and in greater proportion, upon son James son James, and upon son James daughter Arabella.--  These, I say, are the reasons which move me to dispose of the above-described estate in the precious child's favour; who is the delight of my old age: and, I verily think, has contributed, by her amiable duty and kind and tender regards, to prolong my life.
Wherefore it is my express will and commandment, and I enjoin my said three sons, John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James, and my grand-daughter Arabella, as three sons, John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James value my blessing, and will regard my memory, and would wish three sons, John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James own last wills and desires to be fulfilled by three sons, John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James survivors, that three sons, John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James will not impugn or contest the following bequests and devises in favour of my said grand-daughter Clarissa, although three sons, John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James should not be strictly conformable to law or to the forms thereof; nor suffer three sons, John, James, and Antony, and my grandson James to be controverted or disputed on any pretence whatsoever.
And in this confidence, &c. &c. &c.     LETTER V  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE JAN. 20   I have been hindered from prosecuting my intention.
Neither nights nor mornings have been my own.
My mother has been very ill; and would have no other nurse but me.
I have not stirred from My mother bedside (for My mother kept My mother bed); and two nights I had the honour of sharing it with My mother.
My mother disorder was a very violet colic.
The contentions of these fierce, these masculine spirits, and the apprehension of mischiefs that may arise from the increasing animosity which all here have against Mr. Lovelace, and Mr. Lovelace too well known resenting and intrepid character, My mother cannot bear.
Then the foundations laid, as My mother dreads, for jealousy and heart-burnings in My mother own family, late so happy and so united, afflict exceedingly a gentle and sensible mind, which has from the beginning, on all occasions, sacrificed its own inward satisfaction to outward peace.
My brother and sister, who used very often to jar, are now so entirely one, and are so much together, (caballing was the word that dropt from My mother's lips, as if at unawares,) that My mother is very fearful of the consequences that may follow;--to my prejudice, perhaps, is My mother kind concern; since My mother sees that they behave to me every hour with more and more shyness and reserve: yet, would My mother but exert that authority which the superiority of My mother fine talents gives My mother, all these family feuds might perhaps be extinguished in all these family feuds but yet beginnings; especially as My mother may be assured that all fitting concessions shall be made by me, not only as my brother and sister are my elders, but for the sake of so excellent and so indulgent a mother.
For, if I may say to you, my dear, what I would not to any other person living, it is my opinion, that had My mother been of a temper that would have borne less, My mother would have had ten times less to bear, than My mother has had.
No commendation, you'll say, of the generosity of those spirits which can turn to No commendation own disquiet so much condescending goodness.
Upon my word I am sometimes tempted to think that we may make the world allow for and respect we as we please, if we can but be sturdy in we wills, and set out accordingly.
It is but being the less beloved for it, that's all: and if we have power to oblige those we have to do with, it will not appear to we that we are.
we flatterers will tell we any thing sooner than we faults, or what they know we do not like to hear.
Were there not truth in this observation, is it possible that my brother and sister could make my brother and sister very failings, my brother and sister vehemences, of such importance to all the family?
'How will my son, how will my nephew, take this or that measure?
What will my nephew say to that measure?
Let us consult my nephew about that measure;' are references always previous to every resolution taken by my nephew superiors, whose will ought to be my nephew.
Well may my nephew expect to be treated with this deference by every other person, when my father himself, generally so absolute, constantly pays this deference to my nephew; and the more since my nephew godmother's bounty has given independence to a spirit that was before under too little restraint.--But whither may these reflections lead me!--I know you do not love any of us but my mother and me; and, being above all disguises, make me sensible that you do not oftener than I wish.--Ought I then to add force to your dislikes of those whom I wish you to like?--of my father especially; for my father, alas!
has some excuse for my father impatience of contradiction.
my father is not naturally an ill-tempered man; and in my father person and air, and in my father conversation too, when not under the torture of a gouty paroxysm, every body distinguishes the gentleman born and educated.
Our sex perhaps must expect to bear a little--uncourtliness shall I call it?--from the husband whom as the lover they let know the preference they hearts gave the husband to all other men.--Say what they will of generosity being a manly virtue; but upon my word, my dear, I have ever yet observed, that it is not to be met with in that sex one time in ten that it is to be found in ours.--But my father was soured by the cruel distemper I have named; which seized my father all at once in the very prime of life, in so violent a manner as to take from the most active of minds, as my father was, all power of activity, and that in all appearance for life.--It imprisoned, as I may say, my father lively spirits in my father, and turned the edge of them against my father own peace; my father extraordinary prosperity adding to my father impatiency.
Those, I believe, who want the fewest earthly blessings, most regret that Those, I believe, who want the fewest earthly blessings want any.
But my brother!
What excuse can be made for my brother haughty and morose temper?
my brother is really, my dear, I am sorry to have occasion to say it, an ill-temper'd young man; and treats My mother sometimes--Indeed an ill-temper'd young man is not dutiful.--But, possessing every thing, an ill-temper'd young man has the vice of age, mingled with the ambition of youth, and enjoys nothing--but an ill-temper'd young man own haughtiness and ill-temper, I was going to say.--Yet again am I adding force to your dislikes of some of us.--Once, my dear, it was perhaps in your power to have moulded him as you pleased.--Could you have been my sister!--Then had I friend in a sister.--But no wonder that had I friend in a sister.-- does not love you now; who could nip in the bud, and that with a disdain, let me say, too much of kin to had I friend in a sister.-- haughtiness, a passion that would not have wanted a fervour worthy of the object; and which possibly would have made had I friend in a sister.-- worthy.
But no more of this.
I will prosecute my former intention in my next; which I will sit down to as soon as breakfast is over; dispatching this by the messenger whom you have so kindly sent to inquire after us on my silence.
Mean time, I am,   Your most affectionate and obliged friend and servant, CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER VI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE HARLOWE-PLACE, JAN. 20.
I will now resume my narrative of proceedings here.--my brother being in a good way, although you may be sure that my brother resentments are rather heightened than abated by the galling disgrace my brother has received, my friends (my father and uncles, however, if not my brother and sister) begin to think that I have been treated unkindly.
My mother been so good as to tell me this since I sent away my last.
Nevertheless I believe they all think that I receive letters from Mr. Lovelace.
But Lord M. being inclined rather to support than to blame my brother nephew, they seem to be so much afraid of Mr. Lovelace, that they do not put it to Mr. Lovelace whether I do or not; conniving on the contrary, as it should seem, at the only method left to allay the vehemence of a spirit which they have so much provoked: For my brother still insists upon satisfaction from my uncles; and this possibly (for my brother wants not art) as the best way to be introduced again with some advantage into our family.
And indeed my aunt Hervey has put my aunt Hervey to My mother, whether my aunt Hervey were not best to prevail upon my brother to take a turn to my brother Yorkshire estate (which my brother was intending to do before) and to stay there till all is blown over.
But this is very far from being my brother intention: For my brother has already began to hint again, that my brother shall never be easy or satisfied till I am married; and, finding neither Mr. Symmes nor Mr. Mullins will be accepted, has proposed Mr. Wyerley once more, on the score of Mr. Wyerley great passion for Mr. Wyerley.
This I have again rejected; and but yesterday my brother mentioned one who has applied to my brother by letter, making high offers.
This is Mr. Solmes; Rich Solmes you know Rich Solmes call my brother.
But this application has not met with the attention of one single soul.
If none of my brother schemes of getting me married take effect, my brother has thoughts, I am told, of proposing to me to go to Scotland, that as the compliment is, I may put my brother house there in such order as our own is in.
But My mother intends to oppose for My mother own sake; because having relieved My mother, as My mother is pleased to say, of the household cares (for which my sister, you know, has no turn) the household cares (for which my sister, you know, has no turn) must again devolve upon My mother if I go.
And if My mother did not oppose it, I should; for, believe me, I have no mind to be his housekeeper; and I am sure, were I to go with his, I should be treated rather as a servant than a sister:--perhaps, not the better because I am his sister.
And if Mr. Lovelace should follow me, things might be worse than things are now.
But I have besought my mother, who is apprehensive of Mr. Lovelace's visits, and for fear of whom my uncles never stir out without arms and armed servants (my brother also being near well enough to go abroad), to procure me permission to be your guest for a fortnight, or so.--Will My mother, think you, my dear, give me leave?
I dare not ask to go to my dairy-house, as my good grandfather would call my dairy-house: for I am now afraid of being thought to have a wish to enjoy that independence to which his will has entitled me: and as matter are situated, such a wish would be imputed to my regard to the man to whom they have now so great an antipathy.
And indeed could I be as easy and happy here as I used to be, I would defy that man and all his sex; and never repent that I have given the power of my fortune into my father's hands.
***   Just now, My mother has rejoiced me with the news that my requested permission is granted.
Every one thinks it best that I should go to you, except my brother.
But my brother was told, that my brother must not expect to rule in every thing.
I am to be sent for into the great parlour, where are my two uncles and my aunt Hervey, and to be acquainted with this concession in form.
You know, my dear, that there is a good deal of solemnity among us.
But never was there a family more united in its different branches than us.
us consider us as my uncles own children, and declare that it is for us sakes that my uncles live single.
So that my uncles are advised with upon every article relating to us, or that may affect us.
It is therefore the less wonder, at a time when my uncles understand that Mr. Lovelace is determined to pay us an amicable visit, as Mr. Lovelace calls it, (but which I am sure cannot end amicably,) that my uncles should both be consulted upon the permission I had desired to attend you.
***   I will acquaint you with what passed at the general leave given me to be your guest.
And yet I know that you will not love my brother the better for my communication.
But I am angry with my brother myself, and cannot help it.
And besides, it is proper to let you know the terms I go upon, and their motives for permitting me to go.
Clary, said My mother, as soon as I entered the great parlour, your request to go to Miss Howe's for a few days has been taken into consideration, and granted--  Much against my liking, I assure you, said my brother, rudely interrupting My mother.
Son James!
said my father, and knit Son James brows.
Son James was not daunted.
Son James arm was in a sling.
Son James often has the mean art to look upon that, when any thing is hinted that may be supposed to lead toward the least favour to or reconciliation with Mr.
Lovelace.--Let the girl then [I am often the girl with Son James] be prohibited seeing that vile libertine.
Nobody spoke.
Do you hear, Clary?
taking their silence for approbation of what Son James had dictated; you are not to receive visits from Lord M.'s nephew.
Every one still remained silent.
Do you so understand the license you have, MISS?
interrogated Son James.
I would be glad, Son James, said I, to understand that my brothermy brother;--and that you would understand that you are only my brother.
O the fond, fond heart!
with a sneer of insult, lifting up Son James hands.
Son James, said I, to my father, to your justice I appeal: If I have deserved reflection, let me be not spared.
But if I am to be answerable for the rashness--  No more!--No more of either side, said my father.
You are not to receive the visits of Mr. Lovelace, though.--Nor are you, son James, to reflect upon your sister.
your sister is a worthy child.
Son James, I have done, replied Son James:--and yet I have your sister honour at heart, as much as the honour of the rest of the family.
And hence, Son James, retorted I, your unbrotherly reflections upon Son James?
Well, but you observe, MISS, said Son James, that it is not I, but my father, that tells you, that you are not to receive the visits of that Lovelace.
Cousin Harlowe, said my aunt Hervey, allow me to say, that my cousin Clary's prudence may be confided in.
I am convinced it may, joined My mother.
But, aunt, but, madam (put in my sister) there is no hurt, I presume, in letting my sister know the condition my sister goes to Miss Howe upon; since, if Howe gets a nack of visiting my sister there--  You may be sure, interrupted my uncle Harlowe, my uncle Harlowe will endeavour to see my uncle Harlowe there.
So would such an impudent man here, said my uncle Harlowe: and 'tis better done there than here.
Better no where, said my father.--I command you (turning to me) on pain of displeasure, that you see my father not at all.
I will not, Son James, in any way of encouragement, I do assure you: not at all, if I can properly avoid it.
You know with what indifference, said My mother, My mother has hitherto seen my father.--My mother prudence may be trusted to, as my sister says.
With what appa--rent indifference, drawled my brother.
Son James!
said my father sternly.
I have done, Son James, said my father.
But again, in a provoking manner, my father reminded me of the prohibition.
Thus ended the conference.
Will you engage, my dear, that the hated man shall not come near your house?--But what an inconsistence is this, when they consent to my going, thinking my father visits here no otherwise to be avoided!--But if my father does come, I charge you never to leave us alone together.
As I have no reason to doubt a welcome from My mother, I will put every thing in order here, and be with you in two or three days.
Mean time, I am Your most affectionate and obliged, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER VII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss Howe [AFTER CLARISSA HARLOWE RETURN FROM CLARISSA HARLOWE.]
HARLOWE-PLACE, FEB. 20.
I beg your excuse for not writing sooner.
Alas!
my dear, I have sad prospects before MISS!
My brother and sister have succeeded in all My brother and sister views.
My brother and sister have found out another lover for me; an hideous one!--Yet another lover is encouraged by every body.
No wonder that I was ordered home so suddenly.
At an hour's warning!--No other notice, you know, than what was brought with the chariot that was to carry me back.--It was for fear, as I have been informed [an unworthy fear!]
that I should have entered into any concert with Mr. Lovelace had I known their motive for commanding me home; apprehending, 'tis evident, that I should dislike the man their had to propose to me.
And well might their apprehend so:--For who do you think the man they had to propose to me is?--No other than that Solmes--Could you have believed that Solmes?--And their are all determined too; my mother with the rest!--Dear, dear excellence!
how could she be thus brought over, when I am assured, that on his first being proposed she was pleased to say, That had Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession, and would endow me with being, she should not think his deserving of she Clarissa!
The reception I met with at my return, so different from what I used to meet with on every little absence [and now I had been from being three weeks], convinced me that I was to suffer for the happiness I had had in your company and conversation for that most agreeable period.
I will give you an account of it.
my brother met me at the door, and gave me my brother hand when I stepped out of the chariot.
my brother bowed very low: pray, MISS, favour me.--I thought it in good humour; but found it afterwards mock respect: and so my brother led me in great form, I prattling all the way, inquiring of every body's health, (although I was so soon to see every body's health, and there was hardly time for answers,) into the great parlour; where were my father, mother, my two uncles, and sister.
I was struck all of a heap as soon as I entered, to see a solemnity which I had been so little used to on the like occasions in the countenance of every dear relation.
They all kept They seats.
I ran to my father, and kneeled: then to My mother: and met from both a cold salute: From my father a blessing but half pronounced: My mother indeed called me child; but embraced me not with My mother usual indulgent ardour.
After I had paid my duty to my uncles, and my compliments to my sister, which My mother received with solemn and stiff form, I was bid to sit down.
But my heart was full: and I said my heart became me to stand, if I could stand, upon a reception so awful and unusual.
I was forced to turn my face from I could stand, upon a reception so awful and unusual, and pull out my handkerchief.
My unbrotherly accuser hereupon stood forth, and charged me with having received no less than five or six visits at Miss Howe's from the man they had all so much reason to hate [that was the expression]; notwithstanding the commands I had had to the contrary.
And My unbrotherly accuser hereupon bid me deny it if I could.
I had never been used, I said, to deny the truth, nor would I now.
I owned I had in the three weeks passed seen the person I presumed My unbrotherly accuser hereupon meant oftener than five or six times [Pray hear me, brother, said I; for My unbrotherly accuser hereupon was going to flame out], but My unbrotherly accuser hereupon always asked for Mrs. or Miss Howe, when My unbrotherly accuser hereupon came.
I proceeded, that I had reason to believe, that both Mrs. Howe and MISS, as matters stood, would much rather have excused My unbrotherly accuser hereupon visits; but both Mrs. Howe and Miss, as matters stood, would much rather have excused his visits had more than once apologized, that having not the same reason my papa had to forbid My unbrotherly accuser hereupon both Mrs. Howe and Miss, as matters stood, would much rather have excused his visits house, My unbrotherly accuser hereupon rank and fortune entitled My unbrotherly accuser hereupon to civility.
You see, my dear, I made not the pleas I might have made.
my brother seemed ready to give a loose to my brother passion: my father put on the countenance which always portends a gathering storm: my uncles mutteringly whispered: And my sister aggravatingly held up my sister hands.
While I begged to be heard out:--And My mother said, let child, that was My mother kind word, be heard.
I hoped, I said, there was no harm done: that it became not me to prescribe to Mrs. or Miss Howe who should be their visitors: that Miss Howe was always diverted with the raillery that passed between MISS and Miss Howe: that I had no reason to challenge Miss Howe guest for my visitor, as I should seem to have done had I refused to go into their company when Miss Howe was with their: that I had never seen Miss Howe out of the presence of one or both of those ladies; and had signified to Miss Howe once, on Miss Howe urging a few moments' private conversation with me, that, unless a reconciliation were effected between my family and Miss Howe, Miss Howe must not expect that I would countenance Miss Howe visits, much less give Miss Howe an opportunity of that sort.
I told Miss Howe further, that Miss Howe so well understood my mind, that Miss Howe never left me a moment while Mr. Lovelace was there: that when Mr. Lovelace came, if I was not below in the parlour, I would not suffer Mr. Lovelace to be called to Mr. Lovelace: although I thought it would be an affectation which would give Mr. Lovelace an advantage rather than the contrary, if I had left company when Mr. Lovelace came in; or refused to enter into it when I found Mr. Lovelace would stay any time.
my brother heard me out with such a kind of impatience as shewed Mr. Lovelace was resolved to be dissatisfied with Mr. Lovelace, say what I would.
The rest, as the event has proved, behaved as if they would have been satisfied, had they not further points to carry by intimidating me.
All this made it evident, as I mentioned above, that they themselves expected not my voluntary compliance; and was a tacit confession of the disagreeableness of the person they had to propose.
I was no sooner silent than my brother swore, although in my father's presence, (swore, unchecked either by eye or countenance,) That for my brother part, my brother would never be reconciled to that libertine: and that my brother would renounce me for a sister, if I encouraged the addresses of a man so obnoxious to them all.
A man who had like to have been my brother's murderer, my sister said, with a face even bursting with restraint of passion.
The poor Bella has, you know, a plump high-fed face, if I may be allowed the expression.
You, I know, will forgive me for this liberty of speech sooner than I can forgive The poor Bella: Yet how can one be such a reptile as not to turn when trampled upon!
My father, with vehemence both of action and voice [my father has, you know, a terrible voice when my father is angry] told me that I had met with too much indulgence in being allowed to refuse this gentleman, and the other gentleman,; and this gentleman was now my father turn to be obeyed!
Very true, My mother said:--and hoped :-- will would not now be disputed by a child so favoured.
To shew shew were all of a sentiment, my uncle Harlowe said, my uncle Harlowe hoped my uncle Harlowe beloved niece only wanted to know his beloved niece father's will, to obey her father's will.
And my uncle Harlowe, in my uncle Harlowe rougher manner, added, that surely I would not give them reason to apprehend, that I thought my grandfather's favour to me had made me independent of them.--If I did, my uncle Harlowe would tell me, the will could be set aside, and should.
I was astonished, you must needs think.--Whose addresses now, thought I, is this treatment preparative to?--Mr.
Wyerley's again?--or whose?
And then, as high comparisons, where self is concerned, sooner than low, come into young people's heads; be it for whom it will, this is wooing as the English did for the heiress of Scotland in the time of Edward the Sixth.
But that it could be for Solmes, how should it enter into my head?
I did not know, I said, that I had given occasion for this harshness.
I hoped I should always have a just sense of every one's favour to me, superadded to the duty I owed as a daughter and a niece: but that I was so much surprised at a reception so unusual and unexpected, that I hoped my papa and mamma would give me leave to retire, in order to recollect me.
No one gainsaying, I made my silent compliments, and withdrew;--leaving My brother and sister, as I thought, pleased; and as if My brother and sister wanted to congratulate each other on having occasioned so severe a beginning to be made with me.
I went up to my chamber, and there with my faithful Hannah deplored the determined face which the new proposal it was plain My brother and sister had to make me wore.
I had not recovered me when I was sent for down to tea.
I begged my maid to be excused attending; but on the repeated command, went down with as much cheerfulness as I could assume; and had a new fault to clear me of: for my brother, so pregnant a thing is determined ill-will, by intimations equally rude and intelligible, charged my desire of being excused coming down, to sullens, because a certain person had been spoken against, upon whom, as my brother supposed, my fancy ran.
I could easily answer you, me, said I, as such a reflection deserves: but I forbear.
If I do not find a brother in me, you shall have a sister in me.
Pretty meekness!
The poor Bella whisperingly said; looking at my brother, and lifting up The poor Bella lip in contempt.
my brother, with an imperious air, bid me deserve my brother love, and I should be sure to have his love.
As we sat, My mother, in My mother admirable manner, expatiated upon brotherly and sisterly love; indulgently blamed My brother and sister for having taken up displeasure too lightly against me; and politically, if I may say so, answered for my obedience to my father's will.--The it would be all well, my father was pleased to say: Then they should dote upon me, was my brother's expression: Love me as well as ever, was my sister's: And my uncles, That I then should be the pride of their hearts.--But, alas!
what a forfeiture of all these must I make!
This was the reception I had on my return from you.
Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession came in before we had done tea.
my uncle Harlowe presented Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession to Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession, as a gentleman Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession had a particular friendship for.
My uncle Harlowe in terms equally favourable for Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession.
my father said, Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession is my friend, Clarissa Harlowe.
My mother looked at Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession, and looked at Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession, now-and-then, as Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession sat near Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession, I thought with concern.--I at My mother, with eyes appealing for pity.
At Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession, when I could glance at Mr. Solmes the Indies in possession, with disgust little short of affrightment.
While my brother and sister Mr. Solmes'd him, and Sirr'd--yet such a wretch!--But I will at present only add, My humble thanks and duty to your honoured mother (to whom I will particularly write, to express the grateful sense I have of My mother goodness to me); and that I am  Your ever obliged, CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER VIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FEB. 24.
They drive on here at a furious rate.
The man lives here, I think.
The man courts They, and is more and more a favourite.
Such terms, such settlements!
That's the cry.
O my dear, that I had not reason to deplore the family fault, immensely rich as they all are!
But this I may the more unreservedly say to you, as we have often joined in the same concern: I, for a father and uncles; you, for a mother; in every other respect, faultless.
Hitherto, I seem to be delivered over to my brother, who pretends as great a love to me as ever.
You may believe I have been very sincere with him.
But him affects to rally me, and not to believe it possible, that one so dutiful and discreet as Sister Clary can resolve to disoblige all Sister Clary friends.
Indeed, I tremble at the prospect before me; for it is evident that they are strangely determined.
My father and mother industriously avoid giving me opportunity of speaking to My father and mother alone.
My father and mother ask not for my approbation, intended, as it should seem, to suppose me into My father and mother will.
And with My father and mother I shall hope to prevail, or with nobody.
My father and mother have not the interest in compelling me, as My brother and sister have: I say less therefore to My father and mother, reserving my whole force for an audience of my father, if my father will permit me a patient ear.
How difficult is it, my dear, to give a negative where both duty and inclination join to make one wish to oblige!
I have already stood the shock of three of The man's particular visits, besides my share in The man more general ones; and find it is impossible I should ever endure The man.
The man has but a very ordinary share of understanding; is very illiterate; knows nothing but the value of estates, and how to improve estates, and what belongs to land-jobbing and husbandry.
Yet I am as one stupid, I think.
They have begun so cruelly with me, that I have not spirit enough to assert my own negative.
They had endeavoured it seems to influence my good Mrs. Norton before I came home--so intent are They to carry They point!
And her opinion not being to They liking, her has been told that her would do well to decline visiting here for the present: yet her is the person of all the world, next to My mother, the most likely to prevail upon her, were the measures They are engaged in reasonable measures, or such as her could think so.
My aunt likewise having said that My aunt did not think My aunt could ever be brought to like Mr. Solmes, has been obliged to learn another lesson.
I am to have a visit from his beloved niece to-morrow.
And, since I have refused so much as to hear from My brother and sister what the noble settlements are to be, his beloved niece is to acquaint me with the particulars; and to receive from his beloved niece my determination: for my father, I am told, will not have patience but to suppose that I shall stand in opposition to my father will.
Mean time it has been signified to his beloved niece, that it will be acceptable if I do not think of going to church next Sunday.
The same signification was made for his beloved niece last Sunday; and I obeyed.
They are apprehensive that Mr. Lovelace will be there with design to come home with his beloved niece.
Help me, dear Miss Howe, to a little of your charming spirit: I never more wanted it.
The man, this Solmes, you may suppose, has no reason to boast of Solmes progress with his beloved niece.
Solmes has not the sense to say any thing to the purpose.
Solmes courtship indeed is to them; and my brother pretends to court me as Solmes proxy, truly!--I utterly, to my brother, reject my brother address; but thinking a person, so well received and recommended by all my family, entitled to good manners, all I say against Solmes is affectedly attributed to coyness: and Solmes, not being sensible of Solmes own imperfections, believes that my avoiding Solmes when I can, and the reserves I express, are owing to nothing else: for, as I said, all Solmes courtship is to all his courtship; and I have no opportunity of saying no, to one who asks me not the question.
And so, with an air of mannish superiority, Solmes seems rather to pity the bashful girl, than to apprehend that Solmes shall not succeed.
FEBRUARY 25.
I have had the expected conference with My aunt.
I have been obliged to hear The man's proposals from My aunt; and have been told also what their motives are for espousing The man interest with so much warmth.
I am even loth to mention how equally unjust it is for The man to make such offers, or for those I am bound to reverence to accept of even loth.
I hate The man more than before.
One great estate is already obtained at the expense of the relations to One great estate, though distant relations; my brother's, I mean, by The man godmother: and this has given the hope, however chimerical the hope, of procuring others; and that my own at least may revert to the family.
And yet, in my opinion, the world is but one great family.
Originally it was so.
What then is this narrow selfishness that reigns in us, but relationship remembered against relationship forgot?
But here, upon my absolute refusal of him upon any terms, have I had a signification made me that wounds me to the heart.
How can I tell a signification made me that wounds me to the heart you?
Yet I must.
It is, my dear, that I must not for a month to come, or till license obtained, correspond with any body out of the house.
my brother, upon my aunt's report, (made, however, as I am informed, in the gentlest manner, and even giving remote hopes, which my brother had no commission from me to give,) brought me, in authoritative terms, the prohibition.
Not to dear Miss Howe?
said I.
No, not to dear Miss Howe, Madam, tauntingly: for have you not acknowledged, that Mr. Lovelace is a favourite there?
See, my dear Miss Howe--!
And do you think, my brother, this is the way--  Do you look to that.--But your letters will be stopt, I can tell you.--And away my brother flung.
my sister came to my brother soon after--Sister Clary, you are going on in a fine way, I understand.
But as there are people who are supposed to harden you against your duty, I am to tell you, that it will be taken well if you avoid visits or visitings for a week or two till further order.
Can this be from those who have authority--  Ask those who have authority--  ; ask those who have authority--  , child, with a twirl of child finger.--I have delivered my message.
my father will be obeyed.
my father is willing to hope you to be all obedience, and would prevent all incitements to refractoriness.
I know my duty, said I; and hope I shall not find impossible condition annexed to my duty.
A pert young creature, vain and conceited, child called me.
I was the only judge, in my own wise opinion, of what was right and fit.
child, for child part, had long seen into my specious ways: and now I should shew every body what I was at bottom.
child!
said I, hands and eyes lifted up--why all this?--Dear, child, why--  None of your dear, dear Bella's to me.--I tell you, I see through your witchcrafts [that was child strange word].
And away child flung; adding, as child went, and so will every body else very quickly, I dare say.
Bless me, said I to me, what a sister have I!--How have I deserved this?
Then I again regretted my grandfather's too distinguishing goodness to me.
FEB. 25, IN THE EVENING.
What My brother and sister have said against me I cannot tell:--but I am in heavy disgrace with my father.
I was sent for down to tea.
I went with a very cheerful aspect: but had occasion soon to change it.
Such a solemnity in every body's countenance!--My mother's eyes were fixed upon the tea-cups; and when she looked up, it was heavily, as if she eye-lids had weights upon her eye-lids; and then not to me.
my father sat half-aside in my father elbow-chair, that my father head might be turned from my father: my father hands clasped, and waving, as his hands were, up and down; my father fingers, poor dear gentleman!
in motion, as if angry to the very ends of them.
my sister was swelling.
my brother looked at my brother with scorn, having measured me, as I may say, with my brother eyes as I entered, from head to foot.
My aunt was there, and looked upon my brother as if with kindness restrained, bending coldly to my compliment to My aunt as My aunt sat; and then cast an eye first on my brother, then on my sister, as if to give the reason [so I am willing to construe it] of My aunt unusual stiffness.--Bless me, my dear!
that they should choose to intimidate rather than invite a mind, till now, not thought either unpersuadable or ungenerous!
I took my seat.
Shall I make tea, Madam, to My mother?--I always used, you know, my dear, to make tea.
No!
a very short sentence, in one very short word, was the expressive answer.
And My mother was pleased to take the canister in My mother own hand.
my brother bid the footman, who attended, leave the room--I, my brother said, will pour out the water.
My heart was up in my mouth.
I did not know what to do with my brother.
What is to follow?
thought I.
Just after the second dish, out stept My mother--A word with My brother and sister!
taking My mother in My mother hand.
Presently my sister dropt away.
Then my brother.
So I was left alone with my father.
Then my brother looked so very sternly, that My heart failed me as twice or thrice I would have addressed Then my brother to Then my brother: nothing but solemn silence on all hands having passed before.
At last, I asked, if it were Then my brother pleasure that I should pour Then my brother out another dish?
Then my brother answered me with the same angry monosyllable, which I had received from My mother before; and then arose, and walked about the room.
I arose too, with intent to throw Then my brother at Then my brother feet; but was too much overawed by Then my brother sternness, even to make such an expression of my duty to Then my brother as my heart overflowed with.
At last, as Then my brother supported Then my brother, because of Then my brother gout, on the back of a chair, I took a little more courage; and approaching Then my brother, besought Then my brother to acquaint me in what I had offended Then my brother?
Then my brother turned from Sir, and in a strong voice, Clarissa Harlowe, said Then my brother, know that I will be obeyed.
God forbid, Sir, that you should not!--I have never yet opposed your will--  Nor I your whimsies, Clarissa Harlowe, interrupted Then my brother.--Don't let me run the fate of all who shew indulgence to your sex; to be the more contradicted for mine to you.
my father, you know, my dear, has not (any more than my brother) a kind opinion of our sex; although there is not a more condescending wife in the world than My mother.
I was going to make protestations of duty--No protestations, girl!
No words!
I will not be prated to!
I will be obeyed!
I have no child, I will have no child, but an obedient one.
Sir, you never had reason, I hope--  Tell me not what I never had, but what I have, and what I shall have.
Sir, be pleased to hear me--My brother and sister, I fear--  Your brother and sister shall not be spoken against, Your brother and sister have a just concern for the honour of my family.
And I hope, Sir--  Hope nothing.--Tell me not of hopes, but of facts.
I ask nothing of you but what is in your power to comply with, and what it is your duty to comply with.
Then, Sir, I will comply with it--But yet I hope from your goodness--  No expostulations!
No but's, girl!
No qualifyings!
I will be obeyed, I tell you; and cheerfully too!--or you are no child of mine!
I wept.
Let me beseech you, my dear and ever-honoured Papa, (and I dropt down on my knees,) that I may have only yours and my mamma's will, and not my brother's, to obey.
I was going on; but he was pleased to withdraw, leaving me on the floor; saying, That he would not hear me thus by subtilty and cunning aiming to distinguish away my duty: repeating, that he would be obeyed.
My heart is too full;--so full, that it may endanger my duty, were I to try to unburden it may endanger my duty to you on this occasion: so I will lay down my pen.--But can--Yet positively, I will lay down my pen--!
LETTER IX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE FEB. 26, IN THE MORNING.
My aunt, who staid here last night, made me a visit this morning as soon as it was light.
She tells me, that I was left alone with my father yesterday on purpose that my father might talk with my father on my expected obedience; but that my father owned my father was put beside my father purpose by reflecting on something my brother had told my father in my disfavour, and by my father impatience but to suppose, that such a gentle spirit as mine had hitherto seemed to be, should presume to dispute my brother will in a point where the advantage of the whole family was to be so greatly promoted by my compliance.
I find, by a few words which dropt unawares from My aunt, that they have all an absolute dependence upon what they suppose to be meekness in my temper.
But in this they may be mistaken; for I verily think, upon a strict examination of myself, that I have almost as much in me of my father's as of My mother's family.
My uncle Harlowe it seems is against driving me upon extremities: But my brother has engaged, that the regard I have for my reputation, and my principles, will bring me round to my duty; that's the expression.
Perhaps I shall have reason to wish I had not known this.
My aunt advises me to submit for the present to the interdicts they have laid me under; and indeed to encourage Mr. Solmes's address.
I have absolutely refused the latter, let what will (as I have told My aunt) be the consequence.
The visiting prohibition I will conform to.
But as to that of not corresponding with you, nothing but the menace that our letters shall be intercepted, can engage my observation of it.
My aunt believes that this order is from my father, and that My mother has not been consulted upon this order.
My aunt says, that it is given, as My aunt has reason think, purely in consideration to My aunt, lest I should mortally offend him; and this from the incitements of other people (meaning you and Miss Lloyd, I make no doubt) rather than by my own will.
For still, as My aunt tells me, him speaks kind and praiseful things of My aunt.
Here is clemency!
Here is indulgence!--And so it is, to prevent a headstrong child, as a good prince would wish to deter disaffected subjects, from running into rebellion, and so forfeiting every thing!
But this is allowing to the young-man's wisdom of my brother; a plotter without a head, and a brother without a heart!
How happy might I have been with any other brother in the world but James Harlowe; and with any other sister but James Harlowe sister!
Wonder not, my dear, that I, who used to chide you for these sort of liberties with my relations, now am more undutiful than you ever was unkind.
I cannot bear the thought of being deprived of the principal pleasure of my life; for such is your conversation by person and by letter.
And who, besides, can bear to be made the dupe of such low cunning, operating with such high and arrogant passions?
But can you, my dear Miss Howe, condescend to carry on a private correspondence with me?--If you can, there is one way I have thought of, by which it may be done.
You must remember the Green Lane, as we call the Green Lane, that runs by the side of the wood-house and poultry-yard where I keep my bantams, pheasants, and pea-hens, which generally engage my notice twice a day; the more my favourites because they were my grandfather's, and recommended to my care by my grandfather; and therefore brought hither from my Dairy-house since my grandfather death.
the Green Lane is lower than the floor of the wood-house; and, in the side of the wood-house, the boards are rotted away down to the floor of the wood-house for half an ell together in several places.
Hannah can step into the Green Lane, and make a mark with chalk where a letter or parcel may be pushed in, under some sticks; which may be so managed as to be an unsuspected cover for the written deposits from either.
***   I have been just now to look at the place, and find it will answer.
So your faithful Robert may, without coming near my Dairy-house, and as only passing through the Green Lame which leads to two or three farm-houses [out of livery if you please] very easily take from thence my letters and deposit yours.
This place is the more convenient, because This place is seldom resorted to but by your faithful Robert or Hannah, on the above-mentioned account; for it is the general store-house for firing; the wood for constant use being nearer my Dairy-house.
One corner of this being separated off for the roosting-place of my little poultry, either Hannah or I shall never want a pretence to go thither.
Try, my dear, the success of a letter this way; and give me your opinion and advice what to do in this disgraceful situation, as I cannot but call it; and what you think of my prospects; and what you would do in my case.
But before-hand I will tell you, that your advice must not run in favour of this Solmes: and yet it is very likely they will endeavour to engage your mother, in order to induce you, who have such an influence over me, to favour him.
Yet, on second thoughts, if you incline to that side of the question, I would have you write your whole mind.
Determined as I think I am, and cannot help it, I would at least give a patient hearing to what may be said on the other side.
For my regards are not so much engaged [upon my word they are not; I know not me if they be] to another person as some of my friends suppose; and as you, giving way to your lively vein, upon another person last visits, affected to suppose.
What preferable favour I may have for another person to any other person, is owing more to the usage another person has received, and for my sake borne, than to any personal consideration.
I write a few lines of grateful acknowledgement to your good mother for your good mother favours to me in the late happy period.
I fear I shall never know such another.
I hope your good mother will forgive me, that I did not write sooner.
The bearer, if suspected and examined, is to produce that as the only one he carries.
How do needless watchfulness and undue restraint produce artifice and contrivance!
I should abhor these clandestine correspondences, were these clandestine correspondences not forced upon me.
these clandestine correspondences have so mean, so low an appearance to me, that I think I ought not to expect that you should take part in these clandestine correspondences.
But why (as I have also expostulated with My aunt) must I be pushed into a state, which I have no wish to enter into, although I reverence it?--Why should not my brother, so many years older, and so earnest to see me engaged, be first engaged?--And why should not his sister be first provided for?
But here I conclude these unavailing expostulations, with the assurance, that I am, and ever will be,  Your affectionate, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER X  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE FEB. 27   What odd heads some people have!--Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE to be sacrificed in marriage to Mr. Roger Solmes!--Astonishing!
I must not, you say, give my advice in favour of this man!--You now convince me, my dear, that you are nearer of kin than I thought you, to the family that could think of so preposterous a match, or you would never have had the least notion of my advising in his favour.
Ask for his picture.
You know I have a good hand at drawing an ugly likeness.
But I'll see a little further first: for who knows what may happen, since matters are in such a train; and since you have not the courage to oppose so overwhelming a torrent?
You ask me to help you to a little of my spirit.
Are you in earnest?
But it will not now, I doubt, do you service.--it will not sit naturally upon you.
You are your mother's girl, think what you will; and have violent spirits to contend with.
Alas!
my dear, you should have borrowed some of mine a little sooner;--that is to say, before you had given the management of your estate into the hands of those who think some of mine have a prior claim to it.
What though a father's!--Has not the father two elder children?--And do a father's!--Has not the father two elder children not both bear more of his stamp and image than you do?--Pray, my dear, call me not to account for this free question; lest your application of my meaning, on examination, prove to be as severe as that.
Now I have launched out a little, indulge me one word more in the same strain--I will be decent, I promise you.
I think you might have know, that Avarice and Envy are two passions that are not to be satisfied, the one by giving, the other by the envied person's continuing to deserve and excel.--Fuel, fuel both, all the world over, to flames insatiate and devouring.
But since you ask for my opinion, you must tell me all you know or surmise of all you know inducements.
And if you will not forbid me to make extracts from your letters for the entertainment of my aunt and cousin in the little island, who long to hear more of your affairs, it will be very obliging.
But you are so tender of some people who have no tenderness for any body but some people who have no tenderness for any body, that I must conjure you to speak out.
Remember, that a friendship like ours admits of no reserves.
You may trust my impartiality.
It would be an affront to your own judgment, if you did not: For do you not ask my advice?
And have you not taught me that friendship should never give a bias against justice?--Justify friendship should never give a bias against justice, therefore, if you can.
Let us see if there be any sense, whether sufficient reason or not in friendship should never give a bias against justice choice.
At present I cannot (and yet I know a good deal of your family) have any conception how all of your family, your mother and your aunt Hervey in particular, can join with the rest against judgments given.
As to some of the others, I cannot wonder at any thing some of the others do, or attempt to do, where self is concerned.
You ask, Why may not my brother be first engaged in wedlock?
I'll tell you why: my brother temper and my brother arrogance are too well known to induce women my brother would aspire to, to receive my brother addresses, notwithstanding my brother great independent acquisitions, and still greater prospects.
Let me tell you, my dear, his great independent acquisitions have given my brother more pride than reputation.
To me my brother is the most intolerable creature that I ever conversed with.
The treatment you blame, my brother merited from one whom my brother addressed with the air of a person who presumes that my brother is about to confer a favour, rather than to receive one.
I ever loved to mortify proud and insolent spirits.
What, think you, makes me bear Hickman near me, but that my brother is humble, and knows and keeps my brother distance?
As to your question, Why his sister may not be first provided for?
I answer, Because his sister must have no man, but one who has a great and clear estate; that's one thing.
Another is, Because his sister has a younger sister.
Pray, my dear, be so good as to tell me, What man of a great and clear estate would think of his sister, while the younger were single?
You are all too rich to be happy, child.
For must not each of you, by the constitutions of your family, marry to be still richer?
People who know in what their main excellence consists, are not to be blamed (are their) for cultivating and improving what their think most valuable?--Is true happiness any part of your family view?--So far from it, that none of your family but yourself could be happy were none of your family but yourself not rich.
So let none of your family but yourself fret on, grumble and grudge, and accumulate; and wondering what ails none of your family but yourself that none of your family but yourself have not happiness when none of your family but yourself have riches, think the cause is want of more; and so go on heaping up, till Death, as greedy an accumulator as none of your family but yourself, gathers none of your family but yourself into Death garner.
Well then once more I say, do you, my dear, tell me what you know of none of your family but yourself avowed and general motives; and I will tell you more than you will tell me of none of your family but yourself failings!
Your aunt Hervey, you say,* has told you: Why must I ask you to let me know none of your family but yourself, when you condescend to ask my advice on the occasion?
* See Letter VIII.
That none of your family but yourself prohibit your corresponding with me, is a wisdom I neither wonder at, nor blame none of your family but yourself for: since it is an evidence to me, that none of your family but yourself know none of your family but yourself own folly: And if none of your family but yourself do, is it strange that none of your family but yourself should be afraid to trust one another's judgment upon it?
I am glad you have found out a way to correspond with me.
I approve it much.
I shall more, if this first trial of it prove successful.
But should it not, and should it fall into their hands, it would not concern me but for your sake.
We have heard before you wrote, that all was not right between your relations and you at your coming home: that Mr. Solmes visited you, and that with a prospect of success.
But I concluded the mistake lay in the person; and that the person address was to Miss Arabella.
And indeed had Miss Arabella been as good-natured as your plump ones generally are, I should have thought Miss Arabella too good for the person by half.
This must certainly be the thing, thought I; and my beloved friend is sent for to advise and assist in my beloved friend nuptial preparations.
Who knows, said I to my mother, but that when the person has thrown aside the person yellow full-buckled peruke, and the person broad-brimmed beaver (both of which I suppose were Sir Oliver's best of long standing) Sir Oliver may cut a tolerable figure dangling to church with Miss Bell!--The woman, as my mother observes, should excel the person in features: and where can my mother match so well for a foil?
I indulged this surmise against rumour, because I could not believe that the absurdest people in England could be so very absurd as to think of the person for you.
We heard, moreover, that you received no visiters.
I could assign no reason for this, except that the preparations for his sister were to be private, and the ceremony sudden, for fear the person should, as another man did, change another man mind.
Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph were with the person to inquire what I knew of this; and of your not being in church, either morning or afternoon, the Sunday after your return from us; to the disappointment of a little hundred of your admirers, to use Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph words.
It was easy for me to guess the reason to be what you confirm--Miss Lloyd and Miss Biddulph apprehensions that Lovelace would be there, and attempt to wait on you home.
my mother takes very kindly your compliments in your letter to my mother.
my mother words upon reading Her words upon reading were, 'Miss Clarissa Harlowe is an admirable young lady: wherever my mother goes, my mother confers a favour: whomever my mother leaves, my mother fills with regret.'
--And then a little comparative reflection--'O my Nancy, that you had a little of my mother sweet obligingness!'
No matter.
The praise was yours.
You are me; and I enjoyed The praise.
The more enjoyed The praise, because--Shall I tell you the truth?--Because I think yours as well as I am--were it but for this reason, that had I twenty brother James's, and twenty sister Bell's, not one of twenty brother James's, and twenty sister Bell's, not one of them, nor all of them joined together, nor all of twenty brother James's, and twenty sister Bell's, not one of them, nor all of them joined together joined together, would dare to treat me as yours presume to treat you.
The person who will bear much shall have much to bear all the world through; it is your own sentiment,* grounded upon the strongest instance that can be given in your own family; though you have so little improved by it.
* Letter V.   The result is this, that I am fitter for all the world than you; you for the next than me:--that is the difference.--But long, long, for my sake, and for hundreds of sakes, may it be before you quit us for company more congenial to you and more worthy of you!
I communicated to my mother the account you give of your strange reception; also what a horrid wretch they have found out for you; and the compulsory treatment they give you.
It only set my mother on magnifying my mother lenity to you, on my tyrannical behaviour, as my mother will call it [mothers must have mothers way, you know, my dear] to the man whom my mother so warmly recommends, against whom it seems there can be no just exception; and expatiating upon the complaisance I owe my mother for my mother indulgence.
So I believe I must communicate to my mother nothing farther--especially as I know my mother would condemn the correspondence between us, and that between you and Lovelace, as clandestine and undutiful proceedings, and divulge us secret besides; for duty implicit is my mother cry.
And moreover my mother lends a pretty open ear to the preachments of that starch old bachelor your uncle Antony; and for an example to my mother daughter would be more careful how her daughter takes your part, be the cause ever so just.
Yet is this not the right policy neither.
For people who allow nothing will be granted nothing: in other words, those who aim at carrying too many points will not be able to carry any.
But can you divine, my dear, what the old preachment-making, plump-hearted soul, your uncle Antony, means by his frequent amblings hither?--There is such smirking and smiling between my mother and his!
Such mutual praises of economy; and 'that is my way!'
--and 'this I do!'
--and 'I am glad do!'
--and has your approbation, Sir!'
--and 'you look into every thing, Madam!'
--'Nothing would be done, if I did not!'
--  Such exclamations against servants!
Such exaltings of self!
And dear heart, and good lack!--and 'las a-day!--And now-and-then their conversation sinking into a whispering accent, if I come across them!--I'll tell you, my dear, I don't above half like them!--I'll.
Only that these old bachelors usually take as many years to resolve upon matrimony as these old bachelors can reasonably expect to live, or I should be ready to fire upon his visits; and to recommend Mr. Hickman to my mother's acceptance, as a much more eligible man: for what his wants in years, his makes up in gravity; and if you will not chide me, I will say, that there is a primness in both (especially when the person has presumed too much with his upon my mother's favour for the person, and is under discipline on that account) as make them seem near of kin: and then in contemplation of my sauciness, and what them both fear from it, they both sigh away!
and seem so mightily to compassionate each other, that if pity be but one remove from love, I am in no danger, while they are both in a great deal, and don't know it.
Now, my dear, I know you will be upon me with your grave airs: so in for the lamb, as the saying is, in for the sheep; and do you yourself look about my dear; for I'll have a pull with my dear by way of being aforehand.
Hannibal, we read, always advised to attack the Romans upon the Romans own territories.
You are pleased to say, and upon your word too!
that your regards (a mighty quaint word for affections) are not so much engaged, as some of your friends suppose, to another person.
What need you give one to imagine, my dear, that the last month or two has been a period extremely favourable to that other person, whom it has made an obliger of the niece for the niece patience with the uncles.
But, to pass that by--so much engaged!--How much, my dear?--Shall I infer?
Some of your friends suppose a great deal.
You seem to own a little.
Don't be angry.
It is all fair: because you have not acknowledged to me that little.
People I have heard you say, who affect secrets, always excite curiosity.
But you proceed with a kind of drawback upon your averment, as if recollection had given you a doubt--you know not yourself, if recollection had given you a doubt be [so much engaged].
Was it necessary to say this to me?--and to say this upon your word too?--But you know best.--Yet you don't neither, I believe.
For a beginning love is acted by a subtle spirit; and oftentimes discovers a beginning love to a by-stander, when the person possessed (why should I not call a beginning love possessed?)
knows not a beginning love has such a demon.
But further you say, what preferable favour you may have for the person to any other person, is owing more to the usage the person has received, and for your sake borne, than to any personal consideration.
This is generously said.
This is in character.
But, O my friend, depend upon This, you are in danger.
Depend upon This, whether you know This or not, you are a little in for't.
Your native generosity and greatness of mind endanger you: all your friends, by fighting against the person with impolitic violence, fight for the person.
And Lovelace, my life for yours, notwithstanding all the person veneration and assiduities, has seen further than that veneration and those assiduities (so well calculated to your meridian) will let the person own the person has seen--has seen, in short, that the person work is doing for the person more effectually than the person could do it for the person.
And have you not before now said, that nothing is so penetrating as the eye of a lover who has vanity?
And who says Lovelace wants vanity?
In short, my dear, it is my opinion, and that from the easiness of the person heart and behaviour, that the person has seen more than I have seen; more than you think could be seen--more than I believe you yourself know, or else you would let me know it.
Already, in order to restrain the person from resenting the indignities the person has received, and which are daily offered the person, the person has prevailed upon you to correspond with the person privately.
I know the person has nothing to boast of from what you have written: but is not the person inducing you to receive the person letters, and to answer his letters, a great point gained?
By your insisting that the person should keep the correspondence private, it appears there is one secret which you do not wish all the world should know: and the person is master of that secret.
the person is indeed the person, as I may say, that secret!
What an intimacy does this beget for the lover!
How is this distancing the parent!
Yet who, as things are situated, can blame you?--Your condescension has no doubt hitherto prevented great mischiefs.
It must be continued, for the same reasons, while the cause remains.
You are drawn in by a perverse fate against inclination: but custom, with such laudable purposes, will reconcile the inconveniency, and make an inclination.--And I would advise you (as you would wish to manage on an occasion so critical with that prudence which governs all your actions) not to be afraid of entering upon a close examination into the true springs and grounds of this your generosity to that happy man.
It is my humble opinion, I tell you frankly, that on inquiry it will come out to be LOVE--don't start, my dear!--Has not your man himself had natural philosophy enough to observe already to your aunt Hervey, that love takes the deepest root in the steadiest minds?
The deuce take not your man himself sly penetration, I was going to say; for this was six or seven weeks ago.
I have been tinctured, you know.
Nor on the coolest reflection, could I account how and when the jaundice began: but had been over head and ears, as the saying is, but for some of that advice from you, which I now return you.
Yet not your man himself was not half so--so what, my dear--to be sure Lovelace is a charming fellow.
And were not your man himself only--but I will not make you glow, as you read--upon my word I will not.--Yet, my dear, don't you find at your heart somewhat unusual make your heart go throb, throb, throb, as you read just here?--If you do, don't be ashamed to own it--it is your generosity, my love, that's all.--But as the Roman augur said, Caesar, beware of the Ides of March!
Adieu, my dearest friend.--Forgive, and very speedily, by the new found expedient, tell me that you forgive,  Your ever-affectionate, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1.
You both nettled and alarmed me, my dearest MISS, by the concluding part of your last.
At first reading it, I did not think it necessary, said I to myself, to guard against a critic, when I was writing to so dear a friend.
But then recollecting myself, is there not more in it, said I, than the result of a vein so naturally lively?
Surely I must have been guilty of an inadvertence.
Let me enter into the close examination of myself which my beloved friend advises.
I do so; and cannot own any of the glow, any of the throbs you mention.--Upon my word I will repeat, I cannot.
And yet the passages in my letter, upon which you are so humourously severe, lay me fairly open to your agreeable raillery.
I own they do.
And I cannot tell what turn my mind had taken to dictate so oddly to my pen.
But, pray now--is it saying so much, when one, who has no very particular regard to any man, says, there are some who are preferable to others?
And is it blamable to say, some who are preferable to others are the preferable, who are not well used by one's relations; yet dispense with that usage out of regard to one's self which some who are preferable to others would otherwise resent?
Lovelace, for instance, I may be allowed to say, is a man to be preferred to Mr. Solmes; and that I do prefer Lovelace to that man: but, surely, this may be said without this being a necessary consequence that I must be in love with Lovelace.
Indeed I would not be in love with him, as it is called, for all the world: First, because I have no opinion of Lovelace morals; and think it a fault in which our whole family (my brother excepted) has had a share, that Lovelace was permitted to visit our with a hope, which, however, being distant, did not, as I have observed heretofore,* entitle any of our to call Lovelace to account for such of Lovelace immoralities as came to our ears.
Next, because I think Lovelace to be a vain man, capable of triumphing (secretly at least) over a person whose heart Lovelace thinks Lovelace has engaged.
And, thirdly, because the assiduities and veneration which you impute to Lovelace, seem to carry an haughtiness in the assiduities and veneration which you impute to him, as if Lovelace thought Lovelace address had a merit in his address, that would be more than an equivalent to a woman's love.
In short, Lovelace very politeness, notwithstanding the advantages Lovelace must have had from Lovelace birth and education, appear to be constrained; and, with the most remarkable easy and genteel person, something, at times, seems to be behind in Lovelace manner that is too studiously kept in.
Then, good-humoured as Lovelace is thought to be in the main to other people's servants, and this even to familiarity (although, as you have observed, a familiarity that has dignity in it not unbecoming to a man of quality) Lovelace is apt sometimes to break out into a passion with Lovelace own: An oath or a curse follows, and such looks from those servants as plainly shew terror, and that those servants should have fared worse had those servants not been in my hearing: with a confirmation in the master's looks of a surmise too well justified.
* Letter III.
Indeed, my dear, THIS man is not THE man.
I have great objections to THE man.
My heart throbs not after THE man.
I glow not, but with indignation against my dear, THIS man for having given room for such an imputation.
But you must not, my dearest friend, construe common gratitude into love.
I cannot bear that you should.
But if ever I should have the misfortune to think you should love, I promise you upon my word, which is the same as upon my honour, that I will acquaint you with you should.
You bid me to tell you very speedily, and by the new-found expedient, that I am not displeased with my dearest friend for your agreeable raillery: I dispatch this therefore immediately, postponing to my next the account of the inducements which my friends have to promote with so much earnestness the address of Mr. Solmes.
Be satisfied, my my dear, mean time, that I am not displeased with my dear: indeed I am not.
On the contrary, I give you my hearty thanks for your friendly premonitions; and I charge you (as I have often done) that if you observe any thing in me so very faulty as would require from my dear to others in my behalf the palliation of friendly and partial love, you acquaint me with it: for methinks I would so conduct me as not to give reason even for an adversary to censure me; and how shall so weak and so young a creature avoid the censure of such, if my dearest friend will not hold a looking-glass before me to let me see my imperfections?
Judge me, then, my dear, as any indifferent person (knowing what you know of me) would do.
I may be at first be a little pained; may glow a little perhaps to be found less worthy of your friendship than I wish to be; but assure yourself, that your kind correction will give me reflection that shall amend me.
If it do not, you will have a fault to accuse me of, that will be utterly inexcusable: a fault, let me add, that should you not accuse me of a fault (if in your opinion I am guilty) you will not be so much, so warmly, my friend as I am yours; since I have never spared you on the like occasions.
Here I break off to begin another letter to yours, with the assurance, mean time, that I am, and ever will be,  Your equally affectionate and grateful, CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY MORNING, MARCH 2.
Indeed you would not be in love with him for the world!--Your servant, my dear.
Nor would I have you.
For, I think, with all the advantages of person, fortune, and family, him is not by any means worthy of you.
And this opinion I give as well from the reasons you mention (which I cannot but confirm) as from what I have heard of him but a few hours ago from Mrs. Fortescue, a favourite of Lady Betty Lawrance, who knows him well--but let me congratulate you, however, on your being the first of our sex that ever I heard of, who has been able to turn that lion, Love, at her own pleasure, into a lap-dog.
Well but, if you have not the throbs and the glows, you have not: and are not in love; good reason why--because you would not be in love; and there's no more to be said.--Only, my dear, I shall keep a good look-out upon you; and so I hope you will be upon you; for it is no manner of argument that because you would not be in love, you therefore are not.--But before I part entirely with this subject, a word in your ear, my charming friend--'tis only by way of caution, and in pursuance of the general observation, that a stander-by is often a better judge of the game than those that play.--May it not be, that you have had, and have, such cross creatures and such odd heads to deal with, as have not allowed you to attend to the throbs?--Or, if you had them a little now and then, whether, having had two accounts to place them to, you have not by mistake put them to the wrong one?
But whether you have a value for Lovelace or not, I know you will be impatient to hear what Mrs. Fortescue has said of Mrs. Fortescue.
Nor will I keep you longer in suspense.
An hundred wild stories Lovelace tells of Mrs. Fortescue from childhood to manhood: for, as Lovelace observed, having never been subject to contradiction, Mrs. Fortescue was always as mischievous as a monkey.
But I shall pass over these whole hundred of Mrs. Fortescue puerile rogueries (although indicative ones, as I may say) to take notice as well of some things you are not quite ignorant of, as of others you know not, and to make a few observations upon Mrs. Fortescue and Mrs. Fortescue ways.
Mrs. Fortescue owns, what every body knows, 'that Mrs. Fortescue is notoriously, nay, avowedly, a man of pleasure; yet says, that in any thing Mrs. Fortescue sets Mrs. Fortescue heart upon or undertakes, Mrs. Fortescue is the most industrious and persevering mortal under the sun.
Mrs. Fortescue rests it seems not above six hours in the twenty-four--any more than you.
Mrs. Fortescue delights in writing.
Whether at Lord M.'s, or at Lady Betty's, or Lady Sarah's, Mrs. Fortescue has always a pen in Mrs. Fortescue fingers when Mrs. Fortescue retires.
One of Mrs. Fortescue companions (confirming Mrs. Fortescue love of writing) has told her, that Mrs. Fortescue thoughts flow rapidly to a pen:' And you and I, my dear, have observed, on more occasions than one, that though Mrs. Fortescue writes even a fine hand, Mrs. Fortescue is one of the readiest and quickest of writers.
Mrs. Fortescue must indeed have had early a very docile genius; since a person of Mrs. Fortescue pleasurable turn and active spirit, could never have submitted to take long or great pains in attaining the qualifications Mrs. Fortescue is master of; qualifications so seldom attained by youth of quality and fortune; by such especially of those of either, who, like Mrs. Fortescue, have never known what it was to be controuled.
'Mrs.
Fortescue had once it seems the vanity, upon being complimented on these talents (and on Mrs. Fortescue surprising diligence, for a man of pleasure) to compare Mrs. Fortescue to Julius Caesar; who performed great actions by day, and wrote them down at night; and valued Mrs. Fortescue, that Mrs. Fortescue only wanted Caesar's out-setting, to make a figure among Mrs. Fortescue contemporaries.
'Mrs.
Fortescue spoke of this indeed, Caesar says, with an air of pleasantry: for Caesar observed, and so have we, that Mrs. Fortescue has the art of acknowledging Mrs. Fortescue vanity with so much humour, that his vanity sets Mrs. Fortescue above the contempt which is due to vanity and self-opinion; and at the same time half persuades those who hear Mrs. Fortescue, that Mrs. Fortescue really deserves the exultation Mrs. Fortescue gives Mrs.
Fortescue.'
But supposing it to be true that all Mrs. Fortescue vacant nightly hours are employed in writing, what can be Mrs. Fortescue subjects?
If, like Caesar, Mrs. Fortescue own actions, Mrs. Fortescue must undoubtedly be a very enterprising and very wicked man; since nobody suspects Mrs. Fortescue to have a serious turn; and, decent as Mrs. Fortescue is in Mrs. Fortescue conversation with us, Mrs. Fortescue writings are not probably such as would redound either to Mrs. Fortescue own honour, or to the benefit of others, were the benefit of others to be read.
Mrs. Fortescue must be conscious of this, since Mrs. Fortescue says, 'that in the great correspondence by letters which Mrs. Fortescue holds, Mrs. Fortescue is as secret and as careful as if it were of a treasonable nature;--yet troubles not Mrs. Fortescue head with politics, though nobody knows the interests of princes and courts better than Mrs. Fortescue is said to do.'
That you and I, my dear, should love to write, is no wonder.
We have always, from the time each could hold a pen, delighted in epistolary correspondencies.
We employments are domestic and sedentary; and we can scribble upon twenty innocent subjects, and take delight in twenty innocent subjects because twenty innocent subjects are innocent; though were twenty innocent subjects to be seen, twenty innocent subjects might not much profit or please others.
But that such a gay, lively young fellow as this, who rides, hunts, travels, frequents the public entertainments, and has means to pursue his pleasures, should be able to set his down to write for hours together, as you and I have heard his say his frequently does, that is the strange thing.
Mrs. Fortescue says, 'that his is a complete master of short-hand writing.'
By the way, what inducements could a swift writer as a swift writer have to learn short-hand!
Mrs. Fortescue says (and we know it as well as Mrs. Fortescue) 'that he has a surprising memory, and a very lively imagination.'
Whatever he other vices are, all the world, as well as Mrs. Fortescue, says, 'he is a sober man.
And among all he bad qualities, gaming, that great waster of time as well as fortune, is not he vice:' So that he must have he head as cool, and he reason as clear, as the prime of youth and he natural gaiety will permit; and by he early morning hours, a great portion of time upon he hands to employ in writing, or worse.
Mrs. Fortescue says, 'he has one gentleman who is more he intimate and correspondent than any of the rest.'
You remember what he dismissed bailiff said of he and of he associates.
* I don't find but that Mrs. Fortescue confirms this part of it, 'that all Mrs. Fortescue relations are afraid of Mrs. Fortescue; and that Mrs. Fortescue pride sets Mrs. Fortescue above owing obligations to his pride.
Mrs. Fortescue believes Mrs. Fortescue is clear of the world; and that Mrs. Fortescue will continue so;' No doubt from the same motive that makes Mrs. Fortescue avoid being obliged to Mrs. Fortescue relations.
* Letter IV.
A person willing to think favourably of Mrs. Fortescue would hope, that a brave, a learned, and a diligent, man, cannot be naturally a bad man.--But if Mrs. Fortescue be better than Mrs. Fortescue enemies say Mrs. Fortescue is (and if worse Mrs. Fortescue is bad indeed) Mrs. Fortescue is guilty of an inexcusable fault in being so careless as Mrs. Fortescue is of Mrs. Fortescue reputation.
I think a man can be so but from one of these two reasons: either that a man is conscious a man deserves the ill spoken of a man; or, that a man takes a pride in being thought worse than a man is.
Both very bad and threatening indications; since the first must shew a man to be utterly abandoned; and it is but natural to conclude from the other, that what a man is not ashamed to have imputed to a man, a man will not scruple to be guilty of whenever a man has an opportunity.
Upon the whole, and upon all I could gather from Mrs. Fortescue, Lovelace is a very faulty man.
You and I have thought Lovelace too gay, too inconsiderate, too rash, too little an hypocrite, to be deep.
You see Lovelace never would disguise Lovelace natural temper (haughty as his natural temper ( certainly is) with respect to your brother's behaviour to Lovelace.
Where Lovelace thinks a contempt due, Lovelace pays a contempt due to the uttermost.
Nor has Lovelace complaisance enough to spare your uncles.
But were Lovelace deep, and ever so deep, you would soon penetrate Lovelace, if they would leave you to yourself.
Lovelace vanity would be your clue.
Never man had more: Yet, as Mrs. Fortescue observed, 'never did man carry it off so happily.'
There is a strange mixture in it of humourous vivacity:--Since but for one half of what Never man says of Never man, when Never man is in the vein, any other man would be insufferable.
***   Talk of the devil, is an old saying.
The lively wretch has made me a visit, and is but just gone away.
The lively wretch is all impatience and resentment at the treatment you meet with, and full of apprehensions too, that they will carry they point with you.
I told The lively wretch my opinion, that you will never be brought to think of such a man as Solmes; but that it will probably end in a composition, never to have either.
No man, The lively wretch said, whose fortunes and alliances are so considerable, ever had so little favour from a woman for whose sake The lively wretch had borne so much.
I told The lively wretch my mind as freely as I used to do.
But whoever was in fault, self being judge?
The lively wretch complained of spies set upon The lively wretch conduct, and to pry into The lively wretch life and morals, and this by your brother and uncles.
I told The lively wretch, that this was very hard upon The lively wretch; and the more so, as neither The lively wretch life nor morals perhaps would stand a fair inquiry.
The lively wretch smiled, and called The lively wretch my servant.--The occasion was too fair, The lively wretch said, for Miss Howe, who never spared The lively wretch, to let The occasion pass.--But, Lord help the shallow souls of the Harlowes!
Would I believe it!
they were for turning plotters upon him.
they had best take care The lively wretch did not pay they in they own coin.
they hearts were better turned for such works than they heads.
I asked The lively wretch, If The lively wretch valued The lively wretch upon having a head better turned than theirs for such works, as The lively wretch called theirs?
The lively wretch drew off: and then ran into the highest professions of reverence and affection for you.
The object so meritorious, who can doubt the reality of The lively wretch professions?
Adieu, my dearest, my noble friend!--I love and admire you for the generous conclusion of your last more than I can express.
Though I began this letter with impertinent raillery, knowing that you always loved to indulge my mad vein; yet never was there a heart that more glowed with friendly love, than that of  Your own ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1.
I now take up a pen to lay before you the inducements and motive which my friends have to espouse so earnestly the address of this Mr. Solmes.
In order to set this matter in a clear light, it is necessary to go a little back, and even perhaps to mention some things which you already know: and so you may look upon what I am going to relate, as a kind of supplement to my letters of the 15th and 20th of January last.
*   * Letters IV.
and V.   In those letters, of which I have kept memorandums, I gave you an account of my brother's and sister's antipathy to Lovelace; and the methods an account of my brother's and sister's antipathy to Mr. Lovelace took (so far as an account of my brother's and sister's antipathy to Mr. Lovelace had then come to my knowledge) to ruin Lovelace in the opinion of my other friends.
And I told you, that after a very cold, yet not a directly affrontive behaviour to Lovelace, they all of a sudden* became more violent, and proceeded to personal insults; which brought on at last the unhappy rencounter between my brother and Lovelace.
* See Letter IV.
Now you must know, that from the last conversation that passed between my aunt and me, it comes out, that this sudden vehemence on my brother's and sister's parts, was owing to stronger reasons than to the college-begun antipathy on his side, or to slighted love on hers; to wit, to an apprehension that my uncles intended to follow my grandfather's example in my favour; at least in a higher degree than they wish they should.
An apprehension founded it seems on a conversation between my two uncles and my brother and sister: which my aunt communicated to me in confidence, as an argument to prevail upon me to accept of Mr. Solmes's noble settlements: urging, that such a seasonable compliance, would frustrate my brother's and sister's views, and establish me for ever in the love of my father and uncles.
I will give you the substance of this communicated conversation, after I have made a brief introductory observation or two, which however I hardly need to make to you who are so well acquainted with us all, did not the series or thread of the story require it.
I have more than once mentioned to you the darling view some of us have long had of raising a family, as it is called.
A reflection, as I have often thought, upon us own, which is no considerable or upstart one, on either side, on my mother's especially.--A view too frequently it seems entertained by families which, having great substance, cannot be satisfied without rank and title.
my uncles had once extended A view too frequently to each of us three children; urging, that as they themselves intended not to marry, us each of us might be so portioned, and so advantageously matched, as that us posterity, if not ourselves, might make a first figure in our country.--While my brother, as the only son, thought the two girls might be very well provided for by ten or fifteen thousand pounds a-piece: and that all the real estates in the family, to wit, my grandfather's, father's, and two uncles', and the remainder of two uncles' respective personal estates, together with what he had an expectation of from he godmother, would make such a noble fortune, and give he such an interest, as might entitle he to hope for a peerage.
Nothing less would satisfy he ambition.
With A view too frequently he gave he airs very early; 'That he grandfather and uncles were he stewards: that no man ever had better: that daughters were but incumbrances and drawbacks upon a family:' and this low and familiar expression was often in he mouth, and uttered always with the self-complaisance which an imagined happy thought can be supposed to give the speaker; to wit, 'That a man who has sons brings up chickens for a man who has sons own table,' [though once I made a man who has sons comparison stagger with a man who has sons, by asking a man who has sons, If the sons, to make it hold, were to have the sons necks wrung off?]
'whereas daughters are chickens brought up for tables of other men.'
This, accompanied with the equally polite reflection, 'That, to induce people to take people off people hands, the family-stock must be impaired into the bargain,' used to put my sister out of all patience: and, although my sister now seems to think a younger sister only can be an incumbrance, my sister was then often proposing to me to make a party in our own favour against my brother's rapacious views, as my sister used to call them: while I was for considering the liberties he took of this sort, as the effect of a temporary pleasantry, which, in a young man, not naturally good-humoured, I was glad to see; or as a foible that deserved raillery, but no other notice.
But when my grandfather's will (of the purport of which in my particular favour, until it was opened, I was as ignorant as they) had lopped off one branch of my brother's expectation, he was extremely dissatisfied with me.
Nobody indeed was pleased: for although every one loved me, yet being the youngest child, father, uncles, brother, sister, all thought every one loved me, yet being the youngest child, father, uncles, brother, sister postponed, as to matter of right and power [Who loves not power?
]: And my father himself could not bear that I should be made sole, as I may call it, and independent; for such the will, as to that estate and the powers it gave, (unaccountably, as they all said,) made me.
To obviate, therefore, every one's jealousy, I gave up to my father himself's management, as you know, not only the estate, but the money bequeathed me (which was a moiety of what my grandfather had by my grandfather at my grandfather death; the other moiety being bequeathed to my sister); contenting my grandfather to take as from my grandfather bounty what my grandfather was pleased to allow me, without desiring the least addition to my annual stipend.
And then I hoped I had laid all envy asleep: but still my brother and sister (jealous, as now is evident, of my uncles favour of my grandfather, and of the pleasure I had given my father and still my brother and sister by this act of duty) were every now-and-then occasionally doing me covert ill offices: of which, however, I took the less notice, when I was told of still my brother and sister, as I thought I had removed the cause of still my brother and sister envy; and I imputed every thing of that sort to the petulance still my brother and sister are still my brother and sister pretty much noted for.
My brother's acquisition then took place.
This made us all very happy; and My brother went down to take possession of This: and My brother absence (on so good an account too) made us all still happier.
Then followed Lord M.'s proposal for my sister: and this was an additional felicity for the time.
I have told you how exceedingly good-humoured this made my sister.
You know how that went off: you know what came on in this place.
My brother then returned; and us all were all wrong again: and Bella, as I observed in my letters abovementioned, had an opportunity to give My brother the credit of having refused Lovelace, on the score of Lovelace reputed faulty morals.
This united my brother and sister in one cause.
my brother and sister set my brother and sister on all occasions to depreciate Mr. Lovelace, and Mr. Lovelace family too (a family which deserves nothing but respect): and this gave rise to the conversation I am leading to, between my uncles and my brother and sister: of which I now come to give the particulars; after I have observed, that the particulars happened before the rencounter, and soon after the inquiry made into Lovelace's affairs had come out better than my brother and sister hoped it would.
*   * See Letter IV.
my brother and sister were bitterly inveighing against   , in my brother and sister usual way, strengthening my brother and sister invectives with some new stories in    disfavour, when my uncle Antony, having given my brother and sister a patient hearing, declared, 'That    thought the gentleman behaved like a gentleman; the gentleman niece Clary with prudence; and that a more honourable alliance for the family, as    had often told my brother and sister, could not be wished for: since Mr. Lovelace had a very good paternal estate; and that, by the evidence of an enemy, all clear.
Nor did it appear, that he was so bad a man as he had been represented to be: wild indeed; but it was a gay time of life: he was a man of sense: and he was sure that he niece would not have he, if his niece had not good reason to think he reformed, or that there was a likelihood that his niece could reform he by his niece example.'
My uncle then gave one instance, my aunt told me, as a proof of a generosity in Mr. Lovelace's spirit, which convinced he that he was not a bad man in nature; and that he was of a temper, he was pleased to say, like my own; which was, That when he (my uncle) had represented to he, that he might, if he pleased, make three or four hundred pounds a year of he paternal estate, more than he did; he answered, 'That he tenants paid his tenants rents well: that it was a maxim with he family, from which he would by no means depart, Never to rack-rent old tenants, or Never to rack-rent descendants; and that it was a pleasure to he, to see his tenants look fat, sleek, and contented.'
I indeed had once occasionally heard he say something like this; and thought he never looked so well as at that time;--except once; and that was in an instance given by he on the following incident.
An unhappy tenant of My uncle came petitioning to My uncle for forbearance, in Mr. Lovelace's presence.
When An unhappy tenant of my uncle Antony had fruitlessly withdrawn, Mr. Lovelace pleaded Mr. Lovelace cause so well, that Mr. Lovelace was called in again, and had Mr. Lovelace suit granted.
And Mr. Lovelace privately followed Mr. Lovelace out, and gave Mr. Lovelace two guineas, for present relief; Mr. Lovelace having declared, that, at the time, Mr. Lovelace had not five shilling in the world.
On this occasion, Mr. Lovelace told My uncle (but without any airs of ostentation), that Mr. Lovelace had once observed an old tenant and Mr. Lovelace wife in a very mean habit at church; and questioning an old tenant and his wife about it the next day, as Mr. Lovelace knew an old tenant and his wife had no hard bargain in an old tenant and his wife farm, Mr. Lovelace said, Mr. Lovelace had done some very foolish things with a good intention, which had put Mr. Lovelace behind-hand, and Mr. Lovelace could not have paid Mr. Lovelace rent, and appear better.
Mr. Lovelace asked Mr. Lovelace how long it would take Mr. Lovelace to retrieve the foolish step Mr. Lovelace acknowledged Mr. Lovelace had made.
Mr. Lovelace said, Perhaps two or three years.
Well then, said Mr. Lovelace, I will abate you five pounds a year for seven years, provided you will lay five pounds a year upon your wife and self, that you may make a Sunday-appearance like MY tenants.
Mean time, take this (putting Mr. Lovelace hand in Mr. Lovelace pocket, and giving Mr. Lovelace five guineas), to put yourselves in present plight; and let me see you next Sunday at church, hand in hand, like an honest and loving couple; and I bespeak you to dine with me afterwards.
Although this pleased me when I heard it, as giving an instance of generosity and prudence at the same time, not lessening (as My uncle took notice) the yearly value of the farm, yet, my dear, I had no throbs, no glows upon it!--Upon my word, I had not.
Nevertheless I own to you, that I could not help saying to me on this occasion, 'Were it ever to be my lot to have this man, this man would not hinder me from pursuing the methods I so much delight to take'--With 'A pity, that such a man were not uniformly good!'
Forgive me this digression.
My uncle went on (as my aunt told me), 'That, besides his paternal estate, My uncle was the immediate heir to very splendid fortunes: that, when My uncle was in treaty for My uncle niece Arabella, Lord M. told My uncle (My uncle) what great things My uncle and My uncle two half-sisters intended to do for My uncle, in order to qualify My uncle for the title, which would be extinct at My uncle Lordship's death, and which they hoped to procure for My uncle, or a still higher, that of those ladies' father, which had been for some time extinct on failure of heirs male: that it was with this view that My uncle relations were all so earnest for My uncle marrying: that as My uncle saw not where Mr. Lovelace could better Mr. Lovelace; so, truly, Mr. Lovelace thought there was wealth enough in their own family to build up three considerable ones: that, therefore, Mr. Lovelace must needs say, Mr. Lovelace was the more desirous of this alliance, as there was a great probability, not only from Mr. Lovelace's descent, but from Mr. Lovelace fortunes, that Mr. Lovelace might one day be a peeress of Great Britain:--and, upon that prospect [here was the mortifying stroke], Mr. Lovelace should, for Mr. Lovelace own part, think it not wrong to make such dispositions as should contribute to the better support of the dignity.'
My uncle, it seems, far from disapproving of what My uncle had said, declared, 'That there was but one objection to an alliance with Mr. Lovelace; to wit, My brother faulty morals: especially as so much could be done for Miss Bella, and for my brother too, by my father himself; and as My brother was actually possessed of a considerable estate by virtue of the deed of gift and will of My brother godmother Lovell.'
Had I known this before, I should the less have wondered at many things I have been unable to account for in My brother's and sister's behaviour to me; and been more on my guard than I imagined there was a necessity to be.
You may easily guess how much this conversation affected My brother at the time.
My brother could not, you know, but be very uneasy to hear two of My brother stewards talk at this rate to My brother face.
My brother had from early days, by My brother violent temper, made My brother both feared and courted by the whole family.
My father himself, as I have lately mentioned, very often (long before My brother's acquisition had made My brother still more assuming) gave way to My brother, as to an only son who was to build up the name, and augment the honour of it.
Little inducement, therefore, had My brother to correct a temper which gave My brother so much consideration with every body.
'See, Miss Bella,' said My brother, in an indecent passion before my uncles, on this occasion I have mentioned--'See how this occasion is!--You and I ought to look about us!--This little syren is in a fair way to out-uncle, as Miss Bella has already out-grandfather'd, us both!'
From this time (as I now find it plain upon recollection) did my brother and sister behave to me, as to one who stood in my brother and sister way; and to each other as having but one interest: and were resolved, therefore, to bend all my brother and sister force to hinder an alliance from taking effect, which my brother and sister believed was likely to oblige my brother and sister to contract my brother and sister views.
And how was this to be done, after such a declaration from both my uncles?
My brother found out the way.
My sister (as I have said) went hand in hand with My brother.
Between hand, the family union was broke, and every one was made uneasy.
Mr. Lovelace was received more and more coldly by all: but not being to be put out of Mr. Lovelace course by slights only, personal affronts succeeded; defiances next; then the rencounter: that, as you have heard, did the business.
And now, if I do not oblige the family union, my grandfather's estate is to be litigated with Mr. Lovelace; and I, who never designed to take advantage of the independency bequeathed me, am to be as dependent upon my father himself's will, as a daughter ought to be who knows not what is good for a daughter.
This is the language of the family now.
But if I will suffer Mr. Lovelace to be prevailed upon, how happy (as they lay it out) shall we all be!--Such presents am I to have, such jewels, and I cannot tell what, from every one in the family!
Then Mr. Solmes's fortunes are so great, and Mr. Solmes proposals so very advantageous, (no relation whom Mr. Solmes values,) that there will be abundant room to raise mine upon them, were the high-intended favours of my own relations to be quite out of the question.
Moreover, it is now, with this view, found out, that I have qualifications which of themselves will be a full equivalent to Mr. Solmes for the settlements Mr. Solmes is to make; and still leave Mr. Solmes under an obligation to Mr. Solmes for my compliance.
Mr. Solmes himself thinks so, I am told--so very poor a creature is He himself, even in He himself own eyes, as well as in theirs.
These desirable views answered, how rich, how splendid shall we all three be!
And I--what obligations shall I lay upon These desirable views all!--And that only by doing an act of duty so suitable to my character, and manner of thinking; if, indeed, I am the generous as well as dutiful creature I have hitherto made as well believe I am.
This is the bright side that is turned to my father and uncles, to captivate my father and uncles: but I am afraid that My brother's and sister's design is to ruin me with my father and uncles at any rate.
Were my brother's and sister's design otherwise, would my father and uncles not on my return from you have rather sought to court than frighten me into measures which their hearts are so much bent to carry?
A method their have followed ever since.
Mean time, orders are given to all the servants to shew the highest respect to Mr. Solmes; the generous Mr. Solmes is now the generous Mr. Solmes character with some of our family!
But are not orders a tacit confession, that orders think his own merit will not procure his respect?
his is accordingly, in every visit his makes, not only highly caressed by the principals of our family, but obsequiously attended and cringed to by the menials.--And the noble settlements are echoed from every mouth.
Noble is the word used to enforce the offers of a man who is mean enough avowedly to hate, and wicked enough to propose to rob of their just expectations, Noble own family, (every one of which at the same time stands in too much need of Noble favour,) in order to settle all Noble is worth upon me; and if I die without children, and Noble has none by any other marriage, upon a family which already abounds.
Such are Noble proposals.
But were there no other motive to induce me to despise the upstart man, is not this unjust one to the upstart man family enough?--The upstart man, I repeat; for The upstart man was not born to the immense riches The upstart man is possessed of: riches left by one niggard to another, in injury to the next heir, because that other is a niggard.
And should I not be as culpable, do you think, in my acceptance of such unjust settlements, as The upstart man is in the offer of them, if I could persuade The upstart man to be a sharer in them, or suffer a reversionary expectation of possessing them to influence my choice?
Indeed, it concerns me not a little, that my friends could be brought to encourage such offers on such motives as I think a person of conscience should not presume to begin the world with.
But this it seems is the only method that can be taken to disappoint Mr. Lovelace; and at the same time to answer all my relations have wish for each of us.
And surely I will not stand against such an accession to the family as may happen from marrying Mr. Solmes: since now a possibility is discovered, (which such a grasping mind as My brother's can easily turn into a probability,) that my grandfather's estate will revert to my grandfather's estate, with a much more considerable one of the man's own.
Instances of estates falling in, in cases far more unlikely than this, are insisted upon; and my SISTER says, in the words of an old saw, It is good to be related to an estate.
While Solmes, smiling no doubt to Solmes at a hope so remote, by offers only, obtains all their interests; and doubts not to join to Solmes own the estate I am envied for; which, for the conveniency of its situation between two of Solmes, will it seems be of twice the value to Solmes that it would be of to any other person; and is therefore, I doubt not, a stronger motive with Solmes than the wife.
These, my dear, seem to me the principal inducements of my relations to espouse so vehemently as These do this man's suit.
And here, once more, must I deplore the family fault, which gives those inducements such a force as it will be difficult to resist.
And thus far, let matters with regard to Mr. Solmes and me come out as Mr. Solmes and me will, My brother has succeeded in My brother views; that is to say, My brother has, in the first place, got my father himself to make the cause My brother own, and to insist upon my compliance as an act of duty.
My MOTHER has never thought fit to oppose my father's will, when once My brother has declared My brother determined.
My UNCLES, stiff, unbroken, highly-prosperous bachelors, give me leave to say, (though very worthy persons in the main,) have as high notions of a child's duty, as of a wife's obedience; in the last of which, My MOTHER's meekness has confirmed My UNCLES, stiff, unbroken, highly-prosperous bachelors, and given My UNCLES, stiff, unbroken, highly-prosperous bachelors greater reason to expect the first.
My aunt HERVEY (not extremely happy in My aunt HERVEY own nuptials, and perhaps under some little obligation) is got over, and chuses [sic] not to open My aunt HERVEY lips in my favour against the wills of a father and uncles so determined.
This passiveness in My MOTHER and in My aunt HERVEY, in a point so contrary to their own first judgments, is too strong a proof that my father himself is absolutely resolved.
their treatment of my worthy MRS. NORTON is a sad confirmation of it: a woman deserving of all consideration for NORTON wisdom, and every body thinking so; but who, not being wealthy enough to have due weight in a point against which NORTON has given NORTON opinion, and which they seem bent upon carrying, is restrained from visiting here, and even from corresponding with me, as I am this very day informed.
Hatred to Lovelace, family aggrandizement, and this great motive paternal authority!--What a force united must Lovelace, family aggrandizement, and this great motive paternal be supposed to have, when singly each consideration is sufficient to carry all before a force united!
This is the formidable appearance which the address of this disagreeable man wears at present.
my brother and sister triumph.--my brother and sister have got me down, as Hannah overheard my brother and sister exult.
And so my brother and sister have (yet I never knew that I was insolently up); for now My brother will either lay me under an obligation to comply to my own unhappiness, and so make me an instrument of My brother revenge upon Lovelace; or, if I refuse, will throw me into disgrace with my whole family.
Who will wonder at the intrigues and plots carried on by undermining courtiers against one another, when a private family, but three of which can possibly have clashing interests, and one of a private family (as she presumes to think) above such low motives, cannot be free from a private family?
What at present most concerns me, is, the peace of My MOTHER's mind!
How can the husband of such a wife (a good man too!--But oh!
this prerogative of manhood!)
be so positive, so unpersuadable, to one who has brought into my whole family means, which my whole family know so well the value of, that methinks my whole family should value she the more for my whole family sake?
my whole family do indeed value she: but, I am sorry to say, she has purchased that value by she compliances; yet has merit for which she ought to be venerated; prudence which ought of itself to be conformed to in every thing.
But whither roves my pen?
How dare a perverse girl take these liberties with relations so very respectable, and whom she highly respects?
What an unhappy situation is that which obliges she, in she own defence as it were, to expose these liberties failings?
But you, who know how much I love and reverence My MOTHER, will judge what a difficulty I am under, to be obliged to oppose a scheme which she has engaged in.
Yet I must oppose it (to comply is impossible); and must without delay declare my opposition, or my difficulties will increase; since, as I am just now informed, a lawyer has been this very day consulted [Would you have believed it?]
in relation to settlements.
Were ours a Roman Catholic family, how much happier for me, that a Roman Catholic family thought a nunnery would answer all a Roman Catholic family views!--How happy, had not a certain person slighted somebody!
All then would have been probably concluded between a Roman Catholic family before My brother had arrived to thwart the match: then had I a sister; which now I have not; and two brothers;--both aspiring; possibly both titled: while I should only have valued that in either which is above title, that which is truly noble in both!
But by what a long-reaching selfishness is My brother governed!
By what remote, exceedingly remote views!
Views, which it is in the power of the slightest accident, of a fever, for instance, (the seeds of which are always vegetating, as I may say, and ready to burst forth, in his own impetuous temper,) or of the provoked weapon of an adversary, to blow up and destroy!
I will break off here.
Let me write ever so freely of my friends, I am sure of your kind construction: and I confide in your discretion, that you will avoid reading to or transcribing for others such passages as may have the appearance of treating too freely the parental, or even the fraternal character, or induce others to censure for a supposed failure in duty to the one, or decency to the other,  Your truly affectionate, CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY EVENING, MARCH 2.
On Hannah's depositing my long letter, (begun yesterday, but by reason of several interruptions not finished till within this hour,) Hannah found and brought me Hannah of this day.
I thank you, my dear, for this kind expedition.
These few lines will perhaps be time enough deposited, to be taken away by your servant with the other letter: yet These few lines are only to thank you, and to tell you my increasing apprehensions.
I must take or seek the occasion to apply to My MOTHER for My MOTHER mediation; for I am in danger of having a day fixed, and antipathy taken for bashfulness.--Should not sisters be sisters to each other?
Should not not sisters make a common cause of it, as I may say, a cause of sex, on such occasions as the present?
Yet mine, in support of My brother's selfishness, and, no doubt, in concert with My brother, has been urging in full assembly it seems, (and that with an earnestness peculiar to mine when mine sets upon any thing,) that an absolute day be given me; and if I comply not, to be told, that it shall be to the forfeiture of all my fortunes, and of all their love.
mine need not be so officious: My brother's interest, without mine, is strong enough; for My brother has found means to confederate all the family against me.
Upon some fresh provocation, or new intelligence concerning Mr. Lovelace, (I know not what it is,) they have bound they, or are to bind they, by a signed paper, to one another [The Lord bless me, my dear, what shall I do!]
to carry their point in favour of Mr. Solmes, in support of my father himself's authority, as it is called, and against Mr. Lovelace, as a libertine, and an enemy to the family: and if so, I am sure, I may say against me.--How impolitic in them all, to join two people in one interest, whom two people wish for ever to keep asunder!
What the discharged steward reported of him is surely bad enough: what Mrs. Fortescue said, not only confirms that bad, but gives room to think him still worse.
And yet the something further which my friends have come at, is of so heinous a nature (as Betty Barnes tells Hannah) that it proves him almost to be the worst of men.--But, hang him, I had almost said--What is him to me?
What would him be--were not this Mr. Sol----O my dear, how I hate the man in the light him is proposed to me!
All of them, at the same time, are afraid of Mr. Lovelace; yet not afraid to provoke him!--How am I entangled!--to be obliged to go on corresponding with I entangled!--to for them sakes--Heaven forbid, that them persisted-in violence should so drive me, as to make it necessary for my own!
But surely them will yield--Indeed I cannot.
I believe the gentlest spirits when provoked (causelessly and cruelly provoked) are the most determined.
The reason may be, that not taking up resolutions lightly--their very deliberation makes their the more immovable.--And then when a point is clear and self-evident, how can one with patience think of entering into an argument or contention upon it?--  An interruption obliges me to conclude myself, in some hurry, as well as fright, what I must ever be,  Yours more than my own, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XV  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE FRIDAY, MARCH 3.
I have both your letters at once.
It is very unhappy, my dear, since your friends will have you marry, that a person of your merit should be addressed by a succession of worthless creatures, who have nothing but their presumption for their excuse.
That these presumers appear not in this very unworthy light to some of your friends, is, because these presumers defects are not so striking to these presumers as to others.--And why?
Shall I venture to tell you?--Because these presumers are nearer these presumers own standard--Modesty, after all, perhaps has a concern in it; for how should these presumers think that a niece or sister of these presumers [I will not go higher, for fear of incurring your displeasure] should be an angel?
But where indeed is the man to be found (who has the least share of due diffidence) that dares to look up to MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE with hope, or with any thing but wishes?
Thus the bold and forward, not being sensible of their defects, aspire; while the modesty of the really worthy fills their with too much reverence to permit their to explain their.
Hence your Symmes's, your Byron's, your Mullins's, your Wyerley's (the best of the herd), and your Solmes's, in turn, invade you--Wretches that, looking upon the rest of your family, need not despair of succeeding in an alliance with it--But to you, what an inexcusable presumption!
Yet I am afraid all opposition will be in vain.
You must, you will, I doubt, be sacrificed to this disagreeable man.
I know your family.
There will be no resisting such baits as this disagreeable man has thrown out.
O, my dear, my beloved friend!
and are such charming qualities, is such exalted merit, to be sunk in such a marriage!--You must not, your uncle tells your mother, dispute their authority.
AUTHORITY!
what a full word is that in the mouth of a narrow-minded person, who happened to be born thirty years before one!--Of your uncles I speak; for as to their authority, that ought to be sacred.--But should not parents have reason for what not parents do?
Wonder not, however, at your Bell's unsisterly behaviour in this affair: I have a particular to add to the inducements your insolent brother is governed by, which will account for all your insolent brother driving.
You have already owned, that your insolent brother outward eye was from the first struck with the figure and address of the man whom your insolent brother pretends to despise, and who, 'tis certain, thoroughly despises your insolent brother: but you have not told me, that still your insolent brother loves the man whom she pretends to despise of all men.
your Bell has a meanness in your insolent brother very pride; that meanness rises with her very pride, and goes hand in hand with it; and no one is so proud as your Bell.
your insolent brother has owned your insolent brother love, your insolent brother uneasy days, and sleepless nights, and your insolent brother revenge grafted upon your insolent brother love, to your insolent brother favourite Betty Barnes--To lay your insolent brother in the power of a servant's tongue!
Poor creature!--But LIKE little souls will find one another out, and mingle, as well as LIKE great ones.
This, however, your insolent brother told the wench in strict confidence: and thus, by way of the female round-about, as Lovelace had the sauciness on such another occasion, in ridicule of our sex, to call it, Betty (pleased to be thought worthy of a secret, and to have an opportunity of inveighing against Lovelace's perfidy, as Lovelace would have it to be) told it to one of Lovelace confidants: that confidant, with like injunctions of secrecy, to Miss Lloyd's Harriot--Harriot to Miss Lloyd--Miss Lloyd to me--I to you--with leave to make what you please of it.
And now you will not wonder to find your Bell an implacable rival, rather than an affectionate sister; and will be able to account for the words witchcraft, syren, and such like, thrown out against you; and for an affectionate sister driving on for a fixed day for sacrificing you to Solmes: in short, for an affectionate sister rudeness and violence of every kind.
What a sweet revenge will an affectionate sister take, as well upon Lovelace as upon you, if an affectionate sister can procure an affectionate sister rival sister to be married to the man that sister hates; and so prevent an affectionate sister having the man whom an affectionate sister herself loves (whether an affectionate sister have hope of the man whom she herself loves or not), and whom an affectionate sister suspects her rival sister loves!
Poisons and poniard have often been set to work by minds inflamed by disappointed love, and actuated by revenge.--Will you wonder, then, that the ties of relationship in such a case have no force, and that a sister forgets to be a sister?
Now I know this to be an affectionate sister secret motive, (the more grating to an affectionate sister, as an affectionate sister is concerned to make an affectionate sister disavow it), and can consider it joined with an affectionate sister former envy, and as strengthened by a brother, who has such an ascendant over the whole family; and whose interest (slave to it as he always was) engaged he to ruin you with every one: both possessed of the ears of all your family, and having it as much in both power as in both will to misrepresent all you say, all you do; such subject also as to the rencounter, and Lovelace's want of morals, to expatiate upon: your whole family likewise avowedly attached to the odious man by means of the captivating proposals the odious man has made your whole family;--when I consider all these things, I am full of apprehensions for you.--O my dear, how will you be able to maintain your ground;--I am sure, (alas!
I am too sure) that your whole family will subdue such a fine spirit as you, unused to opposition; and (tell it not in Gath) you must be Mrs. Solmes!
Mean time, it is now easy, as you will observe, to guess from what quarter the report I mentioned to you in one of my former, came, That the younger sister has robbed the elder of the younger sister lover:* for Betty whispered it, at the time Betty whispered the rest, that neither Mr. Lovelace nor you had done honourably by Mr. Lovelace young mistress.--How cruel, my dear, in you, to rob the poor Bella of the only lover the poor Bella of the only lover only had!--At the instant too that the poor Bella of the only lover was priding the poor Bella of the only lover, that now at last the poor Bella of the only lover should have it in the poor Bella of the only lover power not only to gratify the poor Bella of the only lover own susceptibilities, but to give an example to the flirts of the poor Bella of the only lover sex** (my worship's self in the poor Bella of the only lover eye) how to govern their man with a silken rein, and without a curb-bridle!
* Letter I.
** Letter II.
Upon the whole, I have now no doubt of their persevering in favour of the despicable Solmes; and of their dependence upon the gentleness of your temper, and the regard you have for their favour, and for your own reputation.
And now I am more than ever convinced of the propriety of the advice I formerly gave you, to keep in your own hands the estate bequeathed to you by your grandfather.--Had you done so, the estate bequeathed to you by your grandfather would have procured you at least an outward respect from your brother and sister, which would have made them conceal the envy and ill-will that now are bursting upon you from hearts so narrow.
I must harp a little more upon this string--Do not you observe, how much your brother's influence has overtopped you, since your brother has got into fortunes so considerable, and since you have given some of your brother's influence an appetite to continue in your brother's influence the possession of your estate, unless you comply with your brother's influence terms?
I know your dutiful, your laudable motives; and one would have thought, that you might have trusted to a father who so dearly loved you.
But had you been actually in possession of your estate, and living up to your estate, and upon your estate, (your youth protected from blighting tongues by the company of your prudent Norton, as you had proposed,) do you think that your brother, grudging your estate to you at the time as he did, and looking upon your estate as he right as an only son, would have been practising about your estate, and aiming at your estate?
I told you some time ago, that I thought your trials but proportioned to your prudence:* but you will be more than woman, if you can extricate yourself with honour, having such violent spirits and sordid minds in some, and such tyrannical and despotic wills in others, to deal with.
Indeed, all may be done, and the world be taught further to admire you for your blind duty and will-less resignation, if you can persuade yourself to be Mrs. Solmes.
* Letter I.   I am pleased with the instances you give me of Mr. Lovelace's benevolence to Mr. Lovelace own tenants, and with Mr. Lovelace little gift to your uncle's.
Mrs. Fortescue allows Mrs. Fortescue to be the best of landlords: I might have told you that, had I thought it necessary to put you into some little conceit of Mrs. Fortescue.
Mrs. Fortescue has qualities, in short, that may make Mrs. Fortescue a tolerable creature on the other side of fifty: but God help the poor woman to whose lot God shall fall till then!
women, I should say, perhaps; since Mrs. Fortescue may break half-a-dozen hearts before that time.--But to the point I was upon--Shall we not have reason to commend the tenant's grateful honesty, if we are told, that with joy the poor man called out your uncle, and on the spot paid the poor man in part of the poor man debt those two guineas?--But what shall we say of that landlord, who, though the poor man knew the poor man to be quite destitute, could take it; and, saying nothing while Mr. Lovelace staid, as soon as Mr. Lovelace was gone, tell of it in praise of the poor fellow's honesty?--Were this so, and were not that landlord related to my dearest friend, how should I despise such a wretch?--But, perhaps, the story is aggravated.
Covetous people have every one's ill word: and so indeed Covetous people ought; because Covetous people are only solicitous to keep that which Covetous people prefer to every one's good one.--Covetous indeed would Covetous people be, who deserved neither, yet expected both!
I long for your next letter.
Continue to be as particular as possible.
I can think of no other subject but what relates to you and to your affairs: for I am, and ever will be, most affectionately,  Your own, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XVI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE [MISS HOWE PRECEDING NOT AT THAT TIME RECEIVED.]
FRIDAY, MARCH 3.
O my dear friend, I have had a sad conflict!
Trial upon trial; conference upon conference!--But what law, what ceremony, can give a man a right to a heart which abhors a man more than it does any living creature?
I hope my mother will be able to prevail for me.--But I will recount it all, though I sit up the whole night to do it; for I have a vast deal to write, and will be as minute as you wish me to be.
I concluded my last in a fright.
It was occasioned by a conversation that passed between my mother and my aunt, part of which Hannah overheard.
I need not give you the particulars; since what I have to relate to Hannah from different conversations that have passed between my mother and me, in the space of a very few hours, will include them all.
I will begin then.
I went down this morning when breakfast was ready with a very uneasy heart, from what Hannah had informed me of yesterday afternoon; wishing for an opportunity, however, to appeal to my mother, in hopes to engage my mother interest in my behalf, and purposing to try to find one when my mother retired to my mother own apartment after breakfast: but, unluckily, there was the odious Solmes, sitting asquat between my mother and sister, with so much assurance in the odious Solmes looks!--But you know, my dear, that those we love not, cannot do any thing to please we.
Had the wretch kept   seat, the wretch might have been well enough: but the bend and broad-shouldered creature must needs rise, and stalk towards a chair, which was just by that which was set for me.
I removed the wretch to a distance, as if to make way to my own: and down I sat, abruptly I believe; what I had heard all in my head.
But this was not enough to daunt my head.
my head is a very confident, my head is a very bold, staring man!--Indeed, my dear, my head is very confident.
my head took the removed chair, and drew the removed chair so near mine, squatting in the removed chair with my head ugly weight, that my head pressed upon my hoop.--I was so offended (all I had heard, as I said, in my head) that I removed to another chair.
I own I had too little command of myself.
too little command of myself gave my brother and sister too much advantage.
I day say my brother and sister took day.
But I did day involuntarily, I think.
I could not help day.--I knew not what I did.
I saw that my father was excessively displeased.
When angry, no man's countenance ever shews day so much as my father's.
CLARISSA HARLOWE!
said CLARISSA HARLOWE with a big voice--and there CLARISSA HARLOWE stopped.
CLARISSA HARLOWE!
said I, trembling and courtesying (for I had not then sat down again); and put the removed chair nearer the wretch, and sat down--my face, as I could feel, all in a glow.
Make tea, child, said my kind mamma; sit by CLARISSA HARLOWE, love, and make tea.
I removed with pleasure to the seat the man had quitted; and being thus indulgently put into employment, soon recovered CLARISSA HARLOWE; and in the course of the breakfasting officiously asked two or three questions of Mr. Solmes, which I would not have done, but to make up with my father.--Proud spirits may be brought to!
Whisperingly spoke my sister to CLARISSA HARLOWE, over my sister shoulder, with an air of triumph and scorn: but I did not mind my sister.
my mother was all kindness and condescension.
I asked my mother once, if my mother were pleased with the tea?
my mother said, softly, (and again called me dear,) my mother was pleased with all I did.
I was very proud of this encouraging goodness: and all blew over, as I hoped, between my father and me; for he also spoke kindly to me two or three times.
Small accidents these, my dear, to trouble you with; only as they lead to greater, as you shall hear.
Before the usual breakfast-time was over, my father withdrew with my mother, telling my mother my father wanted to speak with my mother.
Then my sister and next my aunt (who was with us) dropt away.
My brother gave My brother some airs of insult, which I understood well enough; but which the odious Solmes could make nothing of: and at last the odious Solmes arose from his seat--my sister, said the odious Solmes, I have a curiosity to shew you.
I will fetch a curiosity.
And away the odious Solmes went shutting the door close after the odious Solmes.
I saw what all this was for.
I arose; the man hemming up for a speech, rising, and beginning to set the odious Solmes splay-feet [indeed, my dear, the man in all the odious Solmes ways is hateful to me] in an approaching posture.--I will save My brother the trouble of bringing to me My brother curiosity, said I. I courtesied--Your servant, sir--My brother cried, Madam, Madam, twice, and looked like a fool.--But away I went--to find My brother, to save my word.--But my brother, indifferent as the weather was, was gone to walk in the garden with my sister.
A plain case, that My brother had left My brother curiosity with me, and designed to shew me no other.
I had but just got into my own apartment, and began to think of sending Hannah to beg an audience of my mother (the more encouraged by Hannah condescending goodness at breakfast) when Shorey, Hannah woman, brought me Hannah commands to attend me in Hannah closet.
my father, Hannah told me, was just gone out of it with a positive angry countenance.
Then I as much dreaded the audience as I had wished for it before.
I went down however; but, apprehending the subject Hannah intended to talk to me upon, approached Hannah trembling, and my heart in visible palpitations.
Hannah saw my concern.
Holding out Hannah kind arms, as Hannah sat, Come kiss me, my dear, said Hannah, with a smile like a sun-beam breaking through the cloud that overshadowed Hannah naturally benign aspect--Why flutters my jewel so?
This preparative sweetness, with Hannah goodness just before, confirmed my apprehensions.
my mother saw the bitter pill wanted gilding.
O my Mamma!
was all I could say; and I clasped her kind arms round my mother neck, and my face sunk into my mother bosom.
My child!
My child!
restrain, said my mother, your powers of moving!
I dare not else trust my mother with you.--And my tears trickled down her bosom, as my mother bedewed my neck.
O the words of kindness, all to be expressed in vain, that flowed from my mother lips!
Lift up your sweet face, my best child, my own Clarissa Harlowe!--O my daughter, best beloved of my heart, lift up a face so ever amiable to me!--Why these sobs?--Is an apprehended duty so affecting a thing, that before I can speak--But I am glad, my love, you can guess at what I have to say to you.
I am spared the pains of breaking to you what was a task upon you reluctantly enough undertaken to break to you.
Then rising, you drew a chair near you own, and made me sit down by you, overwhelmed as I was with tears of apprehension of what you had to say, and of gratitude for you truly maternal goodness to you--sobs still my only language.
And drawing a chair still nearer to a chair, you put you round her neck, and my glowing cheek wet with my tears, close to you own: Let me talk to you, my child.
Since silence is your choice, hearken to you, and be silent.
You know, my dear, what I every day forego, and undergo, for the sake of peace.
Your papa is a very good man, and means well; but Your papa will not be controuled; nor yet persuaded.
You have sometimes seemed to pity me, that I am obliged to give up every point.
Poor man!
Your papa reputation the less for it; mine the greater: yet would I not have this credit, if I could help this credit, at so dear a rate to Your papa and to myself.
You are a dutiful, a prudent, and a wise child, a wise child was pleased to say, in hope, no doubt, to make me so: you would not add, I am sure, to my trouble: you would not wilfully break that peace which costs your mother so much to preserve.
Obedience is better than sacrifice.
O my Clary Harlowe, rejoice my heart, by telling me that I have apprehended too much!--I see your concern!
I see your perplexity!
I see your conflict!
[loosing a wise child arm, and rising, not willing I should see how much a wise child herself was affected].
I will leave you a moment.--Answer me not--[for I was essaying to speak, and had, as soon as a wise child took a wise child dear cheek from mine, dropt down on my knees, my hands clasped, and lifted up in a supplicating manner]--I am not prepared for your irresistible expostulation, a wise child was pleased to say.
I will leave you to recollection: and I charge you, on my blessing, that all this my truly maternal tenderness be not thrown away upon you.
And then a wise child withdrew into the next apartment; wiping a wise child eyes as a wise child went from me; as mine overflowed; my heart taking in the whole compass of a wise child meaning.
a wise child soon returned, having recovered more steadiness.
Still on my knees, I had thrown my face across the chair a wise child had sat in.
Look up to me, my Clary Harlowe--No sullenness, I hope!
No, indeed, my ever-to-be-revered Mamma.--And I arose.
I bent my knee.
a wise child raised me.
No kneeling to me, but with knees of duty and compliance.
Your heart, not your knees, must bend.
It is absolutely determined.
Prepare me therefore to receive my father, when my father visits you by-and-by, as my father would wish to receive you.
But on this one quarter of an hour depends the peace of my future life, the satisfaction of all the family, and your own security from a man of violence: and I charge you besides, on my blessing, that you think of being Mrs. Solmes.
There went the dagger to my heart, and down I sunk: and when I recovered, found myself in the arms of my Hannah, my sister's Betty holding open my reluctantly-opened palm, my laces cut, my linen scented with hartshorn; and my mother gone.
Had I been less kindly treated, the hated name still forborne to be mentioned, or mentioned with a little more preparation and reserve, I had stood the horrid sound with less visible emotion--But to be bid, on the blessing of a mother so dearly beloved, so truly reverenced, to think of being MRS. SOLMES--what a denunciation was that!
Shorey came in with a message (delivered in Shorey solemn way): Your mamma, Shorey, is concerned for your disorder: Shorey expects you down again in an hour; and bid me say, that Shorey then hopes every thing from your duty.
I made no reply; for what could I say?
And leaning upon my Hannah's arm, withdrew to my own apartment.
There you will guess how the greatest part of the hour was employed.
Within that time, my mother came up to my mother.
I love, my mother was pleased to say, to come into my own apartment.--No emotions, child!
No flutters!--Am I not your mother?--Do not discompose me by discomposing my mother!
Do not occasion me uneasiness, when I would give you nothing but pleasure.
Come, my dear, we will go into your closet.
my mother took my hand, led the way, and made me sit down by my mother: and after my mother had inquired how I did, my mother began in a strain as if my mother supposed I had made use of the intervening space to overcome all my objections.
my mother was pleased to tell me, that my father and my mother, in order to spare my natural modesty, had taken the whole affair upon themselves--  Hear me out; and then speak.--He is not indeed every thing I wish He to be: but He is a man of probity, and has no vices--  No vices, Madam--!
Hear me out, child.--You have not behaved much amiss to He: we have seen with pleasure that you have not--  O Madam, must I not now speak!
I shall have done presently.--A young creature of your virtuous and pious turn, Madam was pleased to say, cannot surely love a profligate: you love My brother too well, to wish to marry one who had like to have killed My brother, and who threatened your uncles, and defies us all.
You have had your own way six or seven times: us all want to secure you against a man so vile.
Tell me (I have a right to know) whether you prefer a man so vile to all others?--Yet God forbid that I should know you do; for such a declaration would make us all miserable.
Yet tell me, are your affections engaged to a man so vile?
I knew not what the inference would be, if I said they were not.
You hesitate--You answer me not--You cannot answer me.--Rising--Never more will I look upon you with an eye of favour--  O Madam, Madam!
Kill me not with your displeasure--I would not, I need not, hesitate one moment, did I not dread the inference, if I answer you as you wish.--Yet be that inference what it will, your threatened displeasure will make me speak.
And I declare to O Madam, Madam, that I know not my own heart, if it not be absolutely free.
And pray, let me ask my dearest Mamma, in what has my conduct been faulty, that, like a giddy creature, I must be forced to marry, to save me from--From what?
Let me beseech you, Madam, to be the guardian of my reputation!
Let not your Clarissa be precipitated into a state your Clarissa wishes not to enter into with any man!
And this upon a supposition that otherwise your Clarissa shall marry your Clarissa, and disgrace your Clarissa whole family.
Well then, Clary [passing over the force of my plea] if your heart be free--  O my beloved Mamma, let the usual generosity of your dear heart operate in my favour.
Urge not upon me the inference that made me hesitate.
I won't be interrupted, Clary--You have seen in my behaviour to Clary, on this occasion, a truly maternal tenderness; you have observed that I have undertaken the task with some reluctance, because a man so vile is not every thing; and because I know you carry your notions of perfection in a man too high--  Dearest Madam, this one time excuse me!--Is there then any danger that I should be guilty of an imprudent thing for a man so vile's sake you hint at?
Again interrupted!--Am I to be questioned, and argued with?
You know this won't do somewhere else.
You know this won't.
What reason then, ungenerous girl, can you have for arguing with me thus, but because you think from my indulgence to you, you may?
What can I say?
What can I do?
What must that cause be that will not bear being argued upon?
Again!
Clary Harlowe!
Dearest Madam, forgive me: it was always my pride and my pleasure to obey you.
But look upon a man so vile--see but the disagreeableness of a man so vile person--  Now, Clary, do I see whose person you have in your eye!--Now is Mr. Solmes, I see, but comparatively disagreeable; disagreeable only as another man has a much more specious person  But, Dearest Madam, are not another man manners equally so?--Is not another man person the true representative of another man mind?--another man is not, shall not be, any thing to another man, release me but from this one man, whom my heart, unbidden, resists.
Condition thus with my father.
Will Condition thus with your father bear, do you think, to be thus dialogued with?
Have I not conjured you, as you value my peace--What is it that I do not give up?--This very task, because I apprehended you would not be easily persuaded, is a task indeed upon me.
And will you give up nothing?
Have you not refused as many as have been offered to you?
If you would not have us guess for whom, comply; for comply you must, or be looked upon as in a state of defiance with your whole family.
And saying this, she arose and went from me.
But at the chamber-door stopt; and turned back: I will not say below in what a disposition I leave you.
Consider of every thing.
The matter is resolved upon.
As you value my father's blessing and mine, and the satisfaction of all the family, resolve to comply.
I will leave you for a few moments.
I will come up to you again.
See that I find you as I wish to find you; and since your heart is free, let your duty govern your heart.
In about half an hour, my mother returned.
my mother found me in tears.
my mother took my hand: It is my part evermore, said my mother, to be of the acknowledging side.
I believe I have needlessly exposed my mother to your opposition, by the method I have taken with your opposition.
I first began as if I expected a denial, and by my indulgence brought a denial upon my mother.
Do not, my dearest Mamma!
do not say so!
Were the occasion for this debate, proceeded my mother, to have risen from my mother; were this debate in my power to dispense with your compliance; you too well know what you can do with my mother.
Would any body, my dear Miss Howe, wish to marry, who sees a wife of such a temper, and blessed with such an understanding as my mother is noted for, not only deprived of all power, but obliged to be even active in bringing to bear a point of high importance, which my mother thinks ought not to be insisted upon?
When I came to you a second time, proceeded my mother, knowing that your opposition would avail you nothing, I refused to hear your reasons: and in this I was wrong too, because a young creature who loves to reason, and used to love to be convinced by reason, ought to have all my mother objections heard: I now therefore, this third time, see you; and am come resolved to hear all you have to say: and let me, my dear, by my patience engage your gratitude; your generosity, I will call it, because it is to you I speak, who used to have a mind wholly generous.--Let me, if your heart be really free, let me see what your heart will induce you to do to oblige me: and so as you permit your usual discretion to govern you, I will hear all you have to say; but with this intimation, that say what you will, it will be of no avail elsewhere.
What a dreadful saying is that!
But could I engage your pity, Madam, it would be somewhat.
You have as much of my pity as of my love.
But what is person, Clary, with one of your prudence, and your heart disengaged?
Should the eye be disgusted, when your heart is to be engaged?--O Madam, who can think of marrying when your heart is shocked at the first appearance, and where the disgust must be confirmed by every conversation afterwards?
This, Clary, is owing to your prepossession.
Let me not have cause to regret that noble firmness of mind in so young a creature which I thought your glory, and which was my boast in your character.
In this instance it would be obstinacy, and want of duty.--Have you not made objections to several--  That was to This, Clary minds, to This, Clary principles, Madam.--But this man--  Is an honest man, Clary Harlowe.
an honest man, Clary Harlowe has a good mind.
an honest man, Clary Harlowe is a virtuous man.
an honest man, Clary Harlowe an honest man?
an honest man, Clary Harlowe a good mind, Madam?
an honest man, Clary Harlowe a virtuous man?--  Nobody denies these qualities.
Can an honest man, Clary Harlowe be an honest man who offers terms that will rob all an honest man, Clary Harlowe own relations of their just expectations?--Can an honest man, Clary Harlowe mind be good--  You, Clary Harlowe, for whose sake an honest man, Clary Harlowe offers so much, are the last person who should make this observation.
Give me leave to say, Madam, that a person preferring happiness to fortune, as I do; that want not even what I have, and can give up the use of that, as an instance of duty--  No more, no more of your merits!--You know you will be a gainer by that cheerful instance of your duty; not a loser.
You know you have but cast your bread upon the waters--so no more of that!--For your bread is not understood as a merit by every body, I assure you; though I think your bread a high one; and so did your father and uncles at the time--  At the time, Madam!--How unworthily do my brother and sister, who are afraid that the favour I was so lately in--  I hear nothing against your brother and sister--What family feuds have I in prospect, at a time when I hoped to have most comfort from you all!
God bless my brother and sister in all my brother and sister worthy views!
You shall have no family feuds if I can prevent my brother and sister.
You yourself, Madam, shall tell me what I shall bear from my brother and sister, and I will bear it: but let my actions, not my brother and sister misrepresentations (as I am sure by the disgraceful prohibitions I have met with has been the case) speak for me.
Just then, up came my father, with a sternness in my father looks that made me tremble.--my father took two or three turns about my chamber, though pained by my father gout; and then said to my mother, who was silent as soon as she saw him--  My dear, you are long absent.--Dinner is near ready.
What you had to say, lay in a very little compass.
Surely, you have nothing to do but to declare your will, and my will--But perhaps you may be talking of the preparations--Let us have you soon down--Your daughter in your hand, if worthy of the name.
And down Your daughter in your hand, if worthy of the name.
went, casting Your daughter in your hand, if worthy of the name.
eye upon Your daughter in your hand, if worthy of the name.
with a look so stern, that I was unable to say one word to Your daughter in your hand, if worthy of the name.
, or even for a few minutes to my mother.
Was not this very intimidating, My dear?
my mother, seeing my concern, seemed to pity me.
my mother called me my mother good child, and kissed me; and told me that my father should not know I had made such opposition.
my father has kindly furnished us with an excuse for being so long together, said my mother.--Come, My dear--dinner will be upon table presently--Shall us go down?--And took my hand.
This made me start: What, my mother, go down to let This be supposed us were talking of preparations!--O my beloved Mamma, command me not down upon such a supposition.
You see, child, that to stay longer together, will be owning that you are debating about an absolute duty; and that will not be borne.
Did not your father himself some days ago tell you, not your father himself some days ago would be obeyed?
I will a third time leave you.
I must say something by way of excuse for you: and that you desire not to go down to dinner--that your modesty on the occasion--  O Madam!
say not my modesty on such an occasion: for that will be to give hope--  And design you not to give hope?--Perverse girl!--Rising and flinging from me; take more time for consideration!--Since it is necessary, take more time--and when I see you next, let me know what blame I have to cast upon me, or to bear from my father, for my indulgence to you.
She made, however, a little stop at the chamber-door; and seemed to expect that I would have besought She to make the gentlest construction for me; for, hesitating, She was pleased to say, I suppose you would not have me make a report--  O Madam, interrupted I, whose favour can I hope for if I lose my mamma's?
To have desired a favourable report, you know, My dear, would have been qualifying upon a point that I was too much determined upon, to give room for any of my friends to think I have the least hesitation about it.
And so my mother went down stairs.
I will deposit thus far; and, as I know you will not think me too minute in the relation of particulars so very interesting to one you honour with your love, proceed in the same way.
As matters stand, I don't care to have papers, so freely written, about me.
Pray let Robert call every day, if you can spare Robert, whether I have any thing ready or not.
I should be glad you would not send Robert empty handed.
What a generosity will it be in you, to write as frequently from friendship, as I am forced to do from misfortune!
The letters being taken away will be an assurance that you have The letters being taken away.
As I shall write and deposit as I have opportunity, the formality of super and sub-scription will be excused.
For I need not say how much I am  Your sincere and ever affectionate, CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XVII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   my mother, on my mother return, which was as soon as my mother had dined, was pleased to inform me, that my mother told my father, on my father questioning my mother about my cheerul compliance (for, it seems, the cheerful was all that was doubted) that my mother was willing, on so material a point, to give a child whom my mother had so much reason to love (as my mother condescended to acknowledge were my mother words) liberty to say all that was in my mother heart to say, that my mother compliance might be the freer: letting him know, that when him came up, my mother was attending to my pleas; for that my mother found I had rather not marry at all.
my mother told me, that to this my father angrily said, let my mother take care--let my mother take care--that my mother give me not ground to suspect my mother of a preference somewhere else.
But, if it be to ease her heart, and not to dispute my will, you may hear my mother out.
So, Clary, said my mother, I am returned in a temper accordingly: and I hope you will not again, by your peremptoriness, shew me how I ought to treat you.
Indeed, Madam, you did me justice to say, I have no inclination to marry at all.
I have not, I hope, made Madam so very unuseful in my papa's family, as--  No more of your merits, Clary!
You have been a good child.
You have eased me of all the family cares: but do not now give more than ever you relieved me from.
You have been amply repaid in the reputation your skill and management have given you: but now there is soon to be a period to all those assistances from you.
If you marry, there will be a natural, and, if to please us, a desirable period; because your own family will employ all your talents in that way: if you do not, there will be a period likewise, but not a natural one--you understand me, child.
I wept.
I have made inquiry already after a housekeeper.
I would have had your good Norton; but I suppose you will yourself wish to have the worthy woman with yourself.
If you desire it, that shall be agreed upon for yourself.
But, why, dearest Madam, why am I, the youngest, to be precipitated into a state, that I am very far from wishing to enter into with any body?
You are going to question me, I suppose, why your sister is not thought of for Mr. Solmes?
I hope, Madam, it will not displease you if I were.
I might refer you for an answer to your father.--Mr.
Mr. Solmes has reasons for preferring you--  And I have reasons, Madam, for disliking him.
And why I am--  This quickness upon me, interrupted my mother, is not to be borne!
I am gone, and your father comes, if I can do no good with you.
O Madam, I would rather die, than--  my mother put my mother hand to my mouth--No peremptoriness, Clary Harlowe: once you declare yourself inflexible, I have done.
I wept for vexation.
This is all, all, my brother's doings--my brother grasping views--  No reflections upon your brother: my brother has entirely the honour of the family at heart.
I would no more dishonour my family, Madam, than my brother would.
I believe it: but I hope you will allow your father, and me, and your uncles, to judge what will do it honour, what dishonour.
I then offered to live single; never to marry at all; or never but with their full approbation.
If you mean to shew your duty, and your obedience, Clary, you must shew it in our way, not in your own.
I hope, Madam, that I have not so behaved hitherto, as to render such a trial of my obedience necessary.
Yes, Clary, I cannot but say that you have hitherto behaved extremely well: but you have had no trials till now: and I hope, that now you are called to one, you will not fail in no trials.
Parents, proceeded Clary, when children are young, are pleased with every thing children do.
You have been a good child upon the whole: but we have hitherto rather complied with Clary, than Clary with we.
Now that you are grown up to marriageable years, is the test; especially as your grandfather has made you independent, as we may say, in preference to those who had prior expectations upon that estate.
Madam, your grandfather knew, and expressly mentioned in your grandfather will your grandfather desire, that his will more than make his will up to your sister.
I did nothing but what I thought my duty to procure his favour.
It was rather a mark of his affection, than any advantage to me: For, do I either seek or wish to be independent?
Were I to be queen of the universe, that dignity should not absolve me from my duty to you and to my father.
I would kneel for your blessings, were your blessings in the presence of millions--so that--  I am loth to interrupt you, Clary; though you could more than once break in upon me.
You are young and unbroken: but, with all this ostentation of your duty, I desire you to shew a little more deference to me when I am speaking.
I beg your pardon, dear Madam, and your patience with me on such an occasion as this.
If I did not speak with earnestness upon it, I should be supposed to have only maidenly objections against a man I never can endure.
Clary Harlowe--!
Dearest, dearest Madam, permit me to speak what I have to say, this once--this is hard, it is very hard, to be forbidden to enter into the cause of all these misunderstandings, because I must not speak disrespectfully of one who supposes me in the way of his ambition, and treats me like a slave--  Whither, whither, Clary--  My dearest Mamma!--My duty will not permit me so far to suppose my father arbitrary, as to make a plea of that arbitrariness to you--  How now, Clary!--O girl!
Your patience, my dearest Mamma:--you were pleased to say, you would hear me with patience.--PERSON in a man is nothing, because I am supposed to be prudent: so my eye is to be disgusted, and my reason not convinced--  Girl, girl!
Thus are my imputed good qualities to be made my punishment; and I am to wedded to a monster--  [Astonishing!--Can this, Clarissa, be from Clarissa?
The man, Madam, person and mind, is a monster in my eye.]
--And that I may be induced to bear this treatment, I am to be complimented with being indifferent to all men: yet, at other times, and to serve other purposes, be thought prepossessed in favour of a man against whose moral character lie just objections.--Confined, as if, like the giddiest of creatures, I would run away with a man, and disgrace my whole family!
O my dearest Mamma!
who can be patient under such treatment?
Now, Clary, I suppose you will allow me to speak.
I think I have had patience indeed with Clary.--Could I have thought--but I will put all upon a short issue.
Your mother, Clarissa, shall shew you an example of that patience you so boldly claim from Clarissa, without having any Clary.
O my dear, how my mother's condescension distressed me at the time!--Infinitely more distressed me, than rigour could have done.
But my mother knew, my mother was to be sure aware, that my mother was put upon a harsh, upon an unreasonable service, let me say, or my mother would not, my mother could not, have had so much patience with my mother.
Let me tell you then, proceeded my mother, that all lies in a small compass, as my father said.--You have been hitherto, as you are pretty ready to plead, a dutiful child.
You have indeed had no cause to be otherwise.
No child was ever more favoured.
Whether you will discredit all your past behaviour; whether, at a time and upon an occasion, that the highest instance of duty is expected from you (an instance that is to crown all); and when you declare that your heart is free--you will give that instance; or whether, having a view to the independence you may claim, (for so, Clary, whatever be your motive, it will be judged,) and which any man you favour, can assert for Clary against us all; or rather for any man you favour in spite of us--whether, I say, you will break with us all; and stand in defiance of a jealous father, needlessly jealous, I will venture to say, of the prerogatives of any man you favour sex, as to me, and still ten times more jealous of the authority of a father;--this is now the point with us.
You know my father has made it a point; and did my father ever give up one my father thought my father had a right to carry?
Too true, thought I to me!
And now my brother has engaged my father, my brother fine scheme will walk alone, without needing my brother leading-strings; and his fine scheme is become my father's will that I oppose; not my brother's grasping views.
I was silent.
To say the truth, I was just then sullenly silent.
My heart was too big.
I thought it was hard to be thus given up by my mother; and that my mother should make a will so uncontroulable as my brother's, her will.--My mother, my dear, though I must not say so, was not obliged to marry against my mother liking.
my mother loved my father.
My silence availed me still less.
I see, my dear, said my mother, that you are convinced.
Now, my good child--now, Clary, do I love you!
It shall not be known, that you have argued with Clary at all.
All shall be imputed to that modesty which has ever so much distinguished you.
You shall have the full merit of your resignation.
I wept.
my mother tenderly wiped the tears from my eyes, and kissed my cheek--my father expects you down with a cheerful countenance--but I will excuse your going.
All your scruples, you see, have met with an indulgence truly maternal from me.
I rejoice in the hope that you are convinced.
This indeed seems to be a proof of the truth of your agreeable declaration, that your heart is free.
Did not this seem to border upon cruelty, my dear, in so indulgent a mother?--It would be wicked [would It not] to suppose my mother capable of art?--But my mother is put upon It, and obliged to take methods to which my mother heart is naturally above stooping; and all intended for my good, because my mother sees that no arguing will be admitted any where else!
I will go down, proceeded my mother, and excuse your attendance at afternoon tea, as I did to dinner: for I know you will have some little reluctances to subdue.
I will allow you those; and also some little natural shynesses--and so you shall not come down, if you chuse not to come down.
Only, my dear, do not disgrace my report when you come to supper.
And be sure behave as you used to do to your brother and sister; for your behaviour to your brother and sister will be one test of your cheerful obedience to us.
I advise as a friend, you see, rather than command as a mother--So adieu, my love.
And again she kissed me; and was going.
O my dear Mamma, said I, forgive me!--But surely you cannot believe, I can ever think of having that man!
she was very angry, and seemed to be greatly disappointed.
she threatened to turn me over to my father and uncles:--she however bid me (generously bid me) consider, what a handle I gave to my brother and sister, if I thought my brother and sister had views to serve by making my uncles dissatisfied with me.
I, said she, in a milder accent, have early said all that I thought could be said against the present proposal, on a supposition, that you, who have refused several other (whom I own to be preferable as to person) would not approve of the present proposal; and could I have succeeded, you, Clary, had never heard of the present proposal.
But if I could not, how can you expect to prevail?
My great ends in the task I have undertaken, are the preservation of the family peace so likely to be overturned; to reinstate you in the affections of your father and uncles: and to preserve you from a man of violence.--my father, you must needs think will flame out upon your refusal to comply: your uncles are so  thoroughly convinced of the consistency of the measure with your uncles favourite views of aggrandizing the family, that your uncles are as much determined as your father: your aunt Hervey and your uncle Hervey are of the same party.
And it is hard, if a father and mother, and uncles, and aunt, all conjoined, cannot be allowed to direct your choice--surely, my dear girl, proceeded my dear girl [for I was silent all this time], it cannot be that you are the more averse, because the family views will be promoted by the match--this, I assure you, is what every body must think, if you comply not.
Nor, while the man, so obnoxious to us all, remains unmarried, and buzzes about you, will the strongest wishes to live single, be in the least regarded.
And well you know, that were Mr. Lovelace an angel, and my father had made it a point that you should not have Mr. Lovelace an angel, it would be in vain to dispute Mr. Lovelace an angel will.
As to the prohibition laid upon you (much as I will own against my liking), that is owing to the belief that you corresponded by Miss Howe's means with Mr. Lovelace an angel; nor do I doubt that you did so.
I answered to every article, in such a manner, as I am sure would have satisfied Miss Howe, could Miss Howe have been permitted to judge for Miss Howe; and I then inveighed with bitterness against the disgraceful prohibitions laid upon me.
They would serve to shew me, Miss Howe was pleased to say, how much in earnest my father was.
They might be taken off, whenever I thought fit, and no harm done, nor disgrace received.
But if I were to be contumacious, I might thank me for all that would follow.
I sighed.
I wept.
I was silent.
Shall I, Clary, said Miss Howe, shall I tell my father that these prohibitions are as unnecessary as I hoped these prohibitions would be?
That you know your duty, and will not offer to controvert your duty ?
What say you, my love?
O Madam, what can I say to questions so indulgently put?
I do indeed know my duty: no creature in the world is more willing to practise no creature in the world: but, pardon me, Miss Howe, if I say, that I must bear these prohibitions, if I am to pay so dear to have them taken off.
Determined and perverse, my dear Mamma called me: and after walking twice or thrice in anger about the room, my dear Mamma turned to my dear Mamma: Your heart free, Clarissa!
How can you tell me Your heart is free?
Such extraordinary prepossessions to a particular person must be owing to extraordinary prepossessions in another's favour!
Tell me, Clary, and tell me truly--Do you not continue to correspond with Mr. Lovelace an angel?
Miss Howe, replied I, you know my motives: to prevent mischief, I answered my motives letters.
The reasons for our apprehensions of this sort are not over.
I own to you, Clary, (although now I would not have it known,) that I once thought a little qualifying among such violent spirits was not amiss.
I did not know but all things would come round again by the mediation of Lord M. and his two sisters: but as they all three think proper to resent for their nephew; and as their nephew thinks fit to defy us all; and as terms are offered, on the other hand, that could not be asked, which will very probably prevent your grandfather's estate going out of the family, and may be a means to bring still greater into it; I see not, that the continuance of your correspondence with their nephew either can or ought to be permitted.
I therefore now forbid it to you, as you value my favour.
Be pleased, Madam, only to advise me how to break it off with safety to my brother and uncles; and it is all I wish for.
Would to heaven, the man so hated had not the pretence to make of having been too violently treated, when the man meant peace and reconciliation!
It would always have been in my own power to have broke with the man.
the man reputed immoralities would have given me a just pretence at any time to do so.
But, Madam, as my uncles and my brother will keep no measures; as the man has heard what the view is; and the man regard for me from resenting their violent treatment of the man and the man family; what can I do?
Would you have me, Miss Howe, make the man desperate?
The law will protect us, child!
offended magistracy will assert itself--  But, Miss Howe, may not some dreadful mischief first happen?--The law asserts not The law, till The law is offended.
You have made offers, Clary, if you might be obliged in the point in question--Are you really in earnest, were you to be complied with, to break off all correspondence with Mr. Lovelace an angel?--Let me know this.
Indeed I am; and I will.
You, Madam, shall see all the letters that have passed between us.
You shall see I have given Mr. Lovelace an angel no encouragement independent of my duty.
And when you have seen no encouragement independent of my duty, you will be better able to direct me how, on the condition I have offered, to break entirely with Mr. Lovelace an angel.
I take you at your word, Clarissa--Give me his letters; and the copies of Clarissa.
I am sure, Miss Howe, you will keep the knowledge that I write, and what I write--  No conditions with your mother--surely my prudence may be trusted to.
I begged your mother pardon; and besought your mother to take the key of the private drawer in my escritoire, where they lay, that your mother might see that I had no reserves to my mother.
your mother did; and took all his letters, and the copies of mine.--Unconditioned with, your mother was pleased to say, they shall be yours again, unseen by any body else.
I thanked your mother; and your mother withdrew to read they; saying, your mother would return they, when your mother had.
***   You, my dear, have seen all the letters that passed between Mr. Lovelace and me, till my last return from yours.
You have acknowledged, that he has nothing to boast of from Mr. Lovelace and me.
Three others I have received since, by the private conveyance I told you of: the last I have not yet answered.
In these three, as in those you have seen, after having besought my favour, and, in the most earnest manner, professed the ardour of he passion for me; and set forth the indignities done he; the defiances my brother throws out against he in all companies; the menaces, and hostile appearance of my uncles wherever they go; and the methods they take to defame he; he declares, 'That neither he own honour, nor the honour of he family, (involved as that is in the undistinguishing reflection cast upon he for an unhappy affair which he would have shunned, but could not) permit he to bear these confirmed indignities: that as my inclinations, if not favourable to he, cannot be, nor are, to such a man as the newly-introduced Solmes, he is interested the more to resent my brother's behaviour; who to every body avows he rancour and malice; and glories in the probability he has, through the address of this Solmes, of mortifying me, and avenging he on he: that it is impossible he should not think he concerned to frustrate a measure so directly levelled at he, had he not a still higher motive for hoping to frustrate a measure: that I must forgive he, if he enter into conference with Solmes upon it.
he earnestly insists (upon what he has so often proposed) that I will give he leave, in company with Lord M. to wait upon my uncles, and even upon my father--and he promises patience, if new provocations, absolutely beneath a man to bear, be not given:' which by the way I am far from being able to engage for.
In my answer, I absolutely declare, as I tell he I have often done, 'That he is to expect no favour from me against the approbation of my friends: that I am sure my friends consents for he visiting any of my friends will never be obtained: that I will not be either so undutiful, or so indiscreet, as to suffer my interests to be separated from the interests of my family, for any man upon earth: that I do not think me obliged to he for the forbearance I desire one flaming spirit to have with others: that in this desire I require nothing of he, but what prudence, justice, and the laws of he country require: that if he has any expectations of favour from me, on that account, he deceives he: that I have no inclination, as I have often told he, to change my condition: that I cannot allow me to correspond with he any longer in this clandestine manner: it is mean, low, undutiful, I tell he; and has a giddy appearance, which cannot be excused: that therefore he is not to expect that I will continue it.
To this in he last, among other things, he replies, 'That if I am actually determined to break off all correspondence with he, he must conclude, that it is with a view to become the wife of a man, whom no woman of honour and fortune can think tolerable.
And in that case, I must excuse he for saying, that he shall neither be able to bear the thoughts of losing for ever a person in whom all he present and all he future hopes are centred; nor support he with patience under the insolent triumphs of my brother upon it.
But that nevertheless he will not threaten either he own life, or that of any other man.
he must take he resolutions as such a dreaded event shall impel he at the time.
If he shall know that it will have my consent, he must endeavour to resign to he destiny: but if it be brought about by compulsion, he shall not be able to answer for the consequence.'
I will send you these letters for your perusal in a few days.
I would enclose these letters; but that it is possible something may happen, which may make my mother require to re-peruse these letters.
When you see these letters, you will observe how he endeavours to hold me to this correspondence.
***   In about an hour my mother returned.
Take your letters, Clary: I have nothing, my mother was pleased to say, to tax your discretion with, as to the wording of yours to he: you have even kept up a proper dignity, as well as observed all the rules of decorum; and you have resented, as you ought to resent, he menacing invectives.
In a word, I see not, that he can form the least expectations, from what you have written, that you will encourage the passion he avows for yours.
But does he not avow he passion?
Have you the least doubt about what must be the issue of this correspondence, if continued?
And do you yourself think, when you know the avowed hatred of one side, and he declared defiances of the other, that this can be, that it ought to be a match?
By no means it can, Madam; you will be pleased to observed, that I have said as much to he.
But now, Madam, that the whole correspondence is before you, I beg your commands what to do in a situation so very disagreeable.
One thing I will tell you, Clary--but I charge you, as you would not have me question the generosity of your spirit, to take no advantage of it, either mentally or verbally; that I am so much pleased with the offer of your keys to me, made in so cheerful and unreserved a manner, and in the prudence you have shewn in your letters, that were it practicable to bring every one, or your father only, into my opinion, I should readily leave all the rest to your discretion, reserving only to me the direction or approbation of your future letters; and to see, that you broke off this correspondence as soon as possible.
But as it is not, and as I know your father would have no patience with you, should it be acknowledged that you correspond with Mr. Lovelace an angel, or that you have corresponded with Mr. Lovelace an angel since the time Mr. Lovelace an angel prohibited you to do so; I forbid you to continue such a liberty--Yet, as the case is difficult, let me ask you, What you yourself can propose?
Your heart, you say, is free.
Your own, that you cannot think, as matters circumstanced, that a match with a man so obnoxious as Mr. Lovelace an angel now is to us all, is proper to be thought of: What do you propose to do?--What, Clary, are your own thoughts of the matter?
Without hesitation thus I answered--What I humbly propose is this:--'That I will write to Mr. Lovelace an angel (for I have not answered Mr. Lovelace an angel last) that Mr. Lovelace an angel has nothing to do between my father and me: that I neither ask Mr. Lovelace an angel advice nor need it: but that since Mr. Lovelace an angel thinks Mr. Lovelace an angel has some pretence for interfering, because of my brother's avowal of the interest of Solmes in displeasure to Solmes, I will assure Solmes (without giving Solmes any reason to impute the assurance to be in the least favourable to Solmes) that I will never be that man's.'
And if, proceeded I, I may never be permitted to give Solmes this assurance; and Solmes, in consequence of this assurance, be discouraged from prosecuting Solmes address; let Mr. Lovelace an angel be satisfied or dissatisfied, I will go no farther; nor write another line to Solmes; nor ever see Mr. Lovelace an angel more, if I can avoid another line: and I shall have a good excuse for another line, without bringing in any of my family.
Ah!
my love!--But what shall we do about the terms Solmes offers?
Those are the inducements with every body.
Solmes has even given hopes to my brother that Solmes will make exchanges of estates; or, at least, that Solmes will purchase the northern one; for you know it must be entirely consistent with the family-views, that we increase we interest in his country.
my brother, in short, has given a plan that captivates us all.
And a family so rich in all its branches, and that has its views to honour, must be pleased to see a very great probability of taking rank one day among the principal in the kingdom.
And for the sake of these views, for the sake of this plan of my brother's, am I, Madam, to be given in marriage to a man I can never endure!--O my dear Mamma, save me, save me, if you can, from this heavy evil.--I had rather be buried alive, indeed I had, than have that man!
my dear Mamma chid me for my vehemence; but was so good as to tell me, That my dear Mamma would sound my uncle Harlowe, who was then below; and if that man encouraged my dear Mamma (or would engage to second my dear Mamma) my dear Mamma would venture to talk to your father; and I should hear further in the morning.
my dear Mamma went down to tea, and kindly undertook to excuse my attendance at supper.
But is it not a sad thing, I repeat, to be obliged to stand in opposition to the will of such a mother?
Why, as I often say to myself, was such a man as this Solmes fixed upon?
The only man in the world, surely, that could offer so much, and deserve so little!
Little indeed does The only man in the world deserve!--Why, my dear, such a man has the most indifferent of characters.
Every mouth is opened against such a man for such a man sordid ways--A foolish man, to be so base-minded!--When the difference between the obtaining of a fame for generosity, and incurring the censure of being a miser, will not, prudently managed, cost fifty pounds a year.
What a name have you got, at a less expense?
And what an opportunity had he of obtaining credit at a very small one, succeeding such a wretched creature as Sir Oliver, in fortunes so vast?--Yet has he so behaved, that the common phrase is applied to he, That Sir Oliver will never be dead while Solmes lives.
the world, as I have often thought, ill-natured as it is said to be, is generally more just in characters (speaking by what it feels) than is usually apprehended: and those who complain most of it censoriousness, perhaps should look inwardly for the occasion oftener than those who complain most of its censoriousness do.
My heart is a little at ease, on the hopes that my mother will be able to procure favour for me, and a deliverance from this man; and so I have leisure to moralize.
But if I had not, I should not forbear to intermingle occasionally these sorts of remarks, because you command me never to omit these sorts of remarks when these sorts of remarks occur to my mind: and not to be able to make these sorts of remarks, even in a more affecting situation, when one sits down to write, would shew one's self more engaged to self, and to one's own concerns, than attentive to the wishes of a friend.
If it be said, that it is natural so to be, what makes that nature, on occasions where a friend may be obliged, or reminded of a piece of instruction, which (writing down) one's self may be the better for, but a fault; which it would set a person above nature to subdue?
LETTER XVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SAT.
MAR.
4.
Would you not have thought something might have been obtained in my favour, from an offer so reasonable, from an expedient so proper, as I imagine, to put a tolerable end, as from MISS, to a correspondence I hardly know how otherwise, with safety to some of my family, to get rid of?--But my brother's plan, (which my mother spoke of, and of which I have in vain endeavoured to procure a copy, with a design to take a copy to pieces, and expose a copy, as I question not there is room to do,) joined with your father's impatience of contradiction, are irresistible.
I have not been in bed all night; nor am I in the least drowsy.
Expectation, and hope, and doubt, (an uneasy state!)
kept me sufficiently wakeful.
I stept down at my usual time, that (an uneasy state!)
might not be known I had not been in bed; and gave directions in the family way.
About eight o'clock, Shorey came to me from my mother with orders to attend my mother in my mother chamber.
my mother had been weeping, I saw by my mother eyes: but my mother aspect seemed to be less tender, and less affectionate, than the day before; and this, as soon as I entered into my mother presence, struck me with an awe, which gave a great damp to my spirits.
Sit down, Clary Harlowe; I shall talk to Clary Harlowe by-and-by: and continued looking into a drawer among laces and linens, in a way neither busy nor unbusy.
I believe it was a quarter of an hour before Clary Harlowe spoke to me (my heart throbbing with the suspense all the time); and then Clary Harlowe asked me coldly, What directions I had given for the day?
I shewed Clary Harlowe the bill of fare for the day, and to-morrow, if, I said, it pleased Clary Harlowe to approve of it.
Clary Harlowe made a small alteration in it; but with an air so cold and so solemn, as added to my emotions.
Mr. Harlowe talks of dining out to-day, I think, at my brother Antony's--  Mr.
Harlowe!--Not my father!--Have I not then a father!--thought I.
Sit down when I bid you.
I sat down.
You look very sullen, Clary.
I hope not, Madam.
If children would always be children--parents--And there she stopt.
she then went to she toilette, and looked into the glass, and gave half a sigh--the other half, as if she would not have sighed if she could have helped it, she gently hem'd away.
I don't love to see she look so sullen.
Indeed, she, I am not sullen.--And I arose, and, turning from she, drew out my handkerchief; for the tears ran down my cheeks.
I thought, by the glass before me, I saw my mother she cast towards me.
But she words confirmed not the hoped-for tenderness.
One of the most provoking things in the world is, to have people cry for what people can help!
I wish to heaven I could, Madam!--And I sobbed again.
Tears of penitence and sobs of perverseness are mighty well suited!--You may go up to her chamber.
I shall talk with you by-and-by.
I courtesied with reverence.
Mock me not with outward gestures of respect.
The heart, Clary, is what I want.
Indeed, Madam, you have it.
it is not so much mine as my Mamma's!
Fine talking!--As somebody says, If words were to pass for duty, Clary Harlowe would be the dutifulest child breathing.
God bless that somebody!--Be it whom somebody!--Be will, God bless that somebody!--And I courtesied, and, pursuant to somebody!--And last command, was going.
somebody!--And seemed struck; but was to be angry with me.
So turning from me, somebody!--And spoke with quickness, Whither now, Clary Harlowe?
You commanded me, somebody!--And, to go to her chamber.
I see you are very ready to go out of my presence.--Is your compliance the effect of sullenness, or obedience?--You are very ready to leave me.
I could hold no longer; but threw me at somebody!--And feet: O my dearest Mamma!
Let me know all I am to suffer!
Let me know what I am to be!--I will bear be!--I, if I can bear be!--I: but your displeasure I cannot bear!
Leave me, leave me, Clary Harlowe!--No kneeling!--Limbs so supple!
Will so stubborn!--Rise, I tell you.
I cannot rise!
I will disobey my Mamma, when somebody!--And bids me leave somebody!--And without being reconciled to me!
No sullens, my Mamma: no perverseness: but, worse than either: this is direct disobedience!--Yet tear not yourself from me!
[wrapping my arms about somebody!--And as I kneeled; somebody!--And struggling to get from me; my face lifted up to somebody!--And, with eyes running over, that spoke not my heart if they were not all humility and reverence] You must not, must not, tear somebody!--And from me!
[for still somebody!--And struggled, and looked this way and that, all in a sweet disorder, as if somebody!--And knew not what to do].--I will neither rise, nor leave you, nor let you go, till you say you are not angry with somebody!--And.
O thou ever-moving child of my heart!
[folding my arms about my neck, as mine embraced somebody!--And knees] Why was this task--But leave me!--You have discomposed me beyond expression!
Leave me, my dear!--I won't be angry with you--if I can help it--if you'll be good.
I arose trembling, and, hardly knowing what I did, or how I stood or walked, withdrew to her chamber.
my dear!--I followed me as soon as my dear!--I heard me quit my mother's presence, and with salts and spring-water just kept me from fainting; and that was as much as my dear!--I could do.
It was near two hours before I could so far recover my dear!--I as to take up my pen, to write to you how unhappily my hopes have ended.
my mother went down to breakfast.
I was not fit to appear: but if I had been better, I suppose I should not have been sent for; since the permission for my attending my mother down, was given by my father (when in her chamber) only on condition that my mother found me worthy of the name of daughter.
That, I doubt, I shall never be in his opinion, if his be not brought to change his mind as to this Mr. Solmes.
LETTER XIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS [IN ANSWER TO LETTER XV.]
SAT.
MARCH 4, 12 O'CLOCK.
my dear!--I has just now brought me from the usual place your favour of yesterday.
The contents of it have made me very thoughtful; and you will have an answer in my gravest style.--I to have that Mr.
Solmes!--No indeed!--I will sooner--But I will write first to those passages in your letter which are less concerning, that I may touch upon this part with more patience.
As to what you mention of my sister's value for Mr. Lovelace, I am not very much surprised at my sister's value for Mr. Lovelace.
my sister takes such officious pains, and it is so much my sister subject, to have it thought that my sister never did, and never could like him, that my sister gives but too much room to suspect that my sister does.
my sister never tells the story of their parting, and of my sister refusal of him, but my sister colour rises, my sister looks with disdain upon me, and mingles anger with the airs my sister gives my sister:--anger as well as airs, demonstrating, that my sister refused a man whom my sister thought worth accepting: Where else is the reason either for anger or boast?--Poor Bella!
Poor Bella is to be pitied--Poor Bella cannot either like or dislike with temper!
Would to heaven Poor Bella had been mistress of all Poor Bella wishes!--Would to heaven Poor Bella had!
As to what you say of my giving up to your father's controul the estate devised me, my motives at the time, as you acknowledge, were not blamable.
Your advice to me on the subject was grounded, as I remember, on your good opinion of me; believing that I should not make a bad use of the power willed me.
Neither you nor I, my dear, although you now assume the air of a diviner, [pardon me] could have believed that would have happened which has happened, as to your father's part particularly.
You were indeed jealous of my brother's views against me; or rather of my brother predominant love of my brother; but I did not think so hardly of my brother and sister as you always did.
You never loved my brother and sister; and ill-will has eyes ever open to the faulty side; as good-will or love is blind even to real imperfections.
I will briefly recollect my motives.
I found jealousies and uneasiness rising in every breast, where all before was unity and love.
The honoured testator was reflected upon: a second childhood was attributed to The honoured testator; and I was censured, as having taken advantage of it.
All young creatures, thought I, more or less, covet independency; but those who wish most for it, are seldom the fittest to be trusted either with the government of those who wish most for it, or with power over others.
This is certainly a very high and unusual devise to so young a creature.
We should not aim at all We have power to do.
To take all that good-nature, or indulgence, or good opinion confers, shews a want of moderation, and a graspingness that is unworthy of that indulgence; and are bad indications of the use that may be made of the power bequeathed.
It is true, thought I, that I have formed agreeable schemes of making others as happy as myself, by the proper discharge of the stewardship intrusted to myself.
[Are not all estates stewardships, my dear?]
But let me examine myself: Is not vanity, or secret love of praise, a principal motive with myself at the bottom?--Ought I not to suspect my own heart?
If I set up for myself, puffed up with every one's good opinion, may I not be left to myself?--Every one's eyes are upon the conduct, upon the visits, upon the visiters, of a young creature of our sex, made independent: And are not such subjected, more than any others, to the attempts of enterprisers and fortune-seekers?--And then, left to myself, should I take a wrong step, though with ever so good an intention, how many should I have to triumph over myself, how few to pity me!--The more of the one, and the fewer of the other, for having aimed at excelling.
These were some of my reflections at the time: and I have no doubt, but that in the same situation I should do the very same thing; and that upon the maturest deliberation.
Who can command or foresee events?
To act up to our best judgments at the time, is all our can do.
If I have erred, 'tis to worldly wisdom only that I have erred.
If we suffer by an act of duty, or even by an act of generosity, is it not pleasurable on reflection, that the fault is in others, rather than in we?--I had much rather have reason to think others unkind, than that others should have any to think me undutiful.
And so, my dear, I am sure had you.
And now for the most concerning part of your letter.
You think I must of necessity, as matters are circumstanced, be Solmes's wife.
I will not be very rash, my dear, in protesting to the contrary: but I think the contrary never can, and, what is still more, never ought to be!--My temper, I know, is depended upon.
But I have heretofore said,* that I have something in me of your father's family, as well as of my mother's.
And have I any encouragement to follow too implicitly the example which my mother sets of meekness, and resignedness to the wills of others?
Is she not for ever obliged (as she was pleased to hint to me) to be of the forbearing side?
In my mother's case, your observation I must own is verified, that those who will bear much, shall have much to bear.
** What is it, as she says, that she has not sacrificed to peace?--Yet, has she by she sacrifices always found the peace she has deserved to find?
Indeed, no!--I am afraid the very contrary.
And often and often have I had reason (on she account) to reflect, that we poor mortals, by we over-solicitude to preserve undisturbed the qualities we are constitutionally fond of, frequently lose the benefits we propose to we from we poor mortals, by our over-solicitude to preserve undisturbed the qualities we are constitutionally fond: since the designing and encroaching (finding out what we most fear to forfeit) direct we poor mortals, by our over-solicitude to preserve undisturbed the qualities we are constitutionally fond batteries against these we weaker places, and, making an artillery (if I may so phrase it) of we hopes and fears, play upon we at we poor mortals, by our over-solicitude to preserve undisturbed the qualities we are constitutionally fond pleasure.
* See Letter IX.
** See Letter X.   Steadiness of mind, (a quality which the ill-bred and censorious deny to any of our sex) when our are absolutely convinced of being in the right [otherwise it is not steadiness, but obstinacy] and when it is exerted in material cases, is a quality, which, as my good Dr. Lewen was wont to say, brings great credit to the possessor of great credit; at the same time that it usually, when tried and known, raises such above the attempts of the meanly machinating.
the meanly machinating used therefore to inculcate upon me this steadiness, upon laudable convictions.
And why may I not think that I am now put upon a proper exercise of it?
I said above, that I never can be, that I never ought to be, Mrs.
Solmes.--I repeat, that I ought not: for surely, my dear, I should not give up to my brother's ambition the happiness of my future life.
Surely I ought not to be the instrument of depriving Mr. Solmes's relations of their natural rights and reversionary prospects, for the sake of further aggrandizing a family (although that I am of) which already lives in great affluence and splendour; and which might be as justly dissatisfied, were all that some of it aim at to be obtained, that some of it were not princes, as now some of it are that some of it are not peers [For when ever was an ambitious mind, as you observe in the case of avarice,* satisfied by acquisition?].
The less, surely, ought I to give into these grasping views of my brother, as I myself heartily despise the end aimed at; as I wish not either to change my state, or better my fortunes; and as I am fully persuaded, that happiness and riches are two things, and very seldom meet together.
* See Letter X.
Yet I dread, I exceedingly dread, the conflicts I know I must encounter with.
It is possible, that I may be more unhappy from the due observation of the good doctor's general precept, than were I to yield the point; since what I call steadiness is deemed stubbornness, obstinacy, prepossession, by those who have a right to put what interpretation they please upon my conduct.
So, my dear, were we perfect (which no one can be) we could not be happy in this life, unless those with whom we have to deal (those more especially who have any controul upon we) were governed by the same principles.
But then does not the good Doctor's conclusion recur,--That we have nothing to do, but to chuse what is right; to be steady in the pursuit of it; and to leave the issue to Providence?
This, if you approve of my motives, (and if you don't, pray inform me) must be my aim in the present case.
But what then can I plead for a palliation to myself of my mother's sufferings on my account?
Perhaps this consideration will carry some force with this consideration--That my mother difficulties cannot last long; only till this great struggle shall be one way or other determined--Whereas my unhappiness, if I comply, will (from an aversion not to be overcome) be for life.
To which let me add, That as I have reason to think that the present measures are not entered upon with my mother own natural liking, my mother will have the less pain, should To which let me add, That as I have reason to think that the present measures are not entered upon with her own natural liking, she will have the less pain want the success which I think in my heart To which let me add, That as I have reason to think that the present measures are not entered upon with her own natural liking, she will have the less pain ought to want.
I have run a great length in a very little time.
The subject touched me to the quick.
My reflections upon The subject will give you reason to expect from me a perhaps too steady behaviour in a new conference, which, I find, I must have with my mother.
My father and brother, as my mother was pleased to tell me, dine at my uncle Antony's; and that, as I have reason to believe, on purpose to give an opportunity for it.
Hannah informs me, that Hannah heard your father high and angry with my mother, at taking leave of Hannah: I suppose for being to favourable to me; for Hannah heard Hannah say, as in tears, 'Indeed, Mr. Harlowe, you greatly distress me!--The poor girl does not deserve--' Hannah heard no more, but that Hannah said, Hannah would break somebody's heart--Mine, I suppose--Not my mother's, I hope.
As only my sister dines with my mother, I thought I should have been commanded down: but Hannah sent me up a plate from Hannah table.
I continued my writing.
I could not touch a morsel.
I ordered Hannah however to eat of it, that I might not be thought sullen.
Before I conclude this, I will see whether any thing offers from either of my private correspondencies, that will make it proper to add to it; and will take a turn in the wood-yard and garden for that purpose.
***   I am stopped.
Hannah shall deposit this.
Hannah was ordered by my mother (who asked where I was) to tell me, that Hannah would come up and talk with me in my own closet.--Hannah is coming!
Adieu, my dear.
LETTER XX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SAT.
AFTERNOON.
The expected conference is over: but my difficulties are increased.
This, as my mother was pleased to tell me, being the last persuasory effort that is to be attempted, I will be particular in the account of The expected conference as my head and my heart will allow The expected conference to be.
I have made, said my mother, as my mother entered my room, a short as well as early dinner, on purpose to confer with you: and I do assure you, that it will be the last conference I shall either be permitted or inclined to hold with you on The subject, if you should prove as refractory as it is imagined you will prove by some, who are of opinion, that I have not the weight with you which my indulgence deserves.
But I hope you will convince as well some, who are of opinion as me of the contrary.
Your father both dines and sups at your uncle's, on purpose to give us this opportunity; and, according to the report I shall make on Your father return, (which I have promised shall be a very faithful one,) Your father will take Your father measures with Your father.
I was offering to speak--Hear, Clarissa, what I have to tell you, said Clarissa, before you speak, unless what you have to say will signify to Clarissa your compliance--Say--Will it?--If it will, you may speak.
I was silent.
Clarissa looked with concern and anger upon Clarissa--No compliance, I find!--Such a dutiful young creature hitherto!--Will you not, can you not, speak as I would have you speak?--Then [rejecting me as it were with Clarissa hand] continue silent.--I, no more than Your father, will bear your avowed contradiction.
Clarissa paused, with a look of expectation, as if Clarissa waited for my consenting answer.
I was still silent; looking down; the tears in my eyes.
O thou determined girl!--But say--Speak out--Are you resolved to stand in opposition to us all, in a point us all hearts are set upon?
May I, Madam, be permitted to expostulate?--  To what purpose expostulate with me, Clarissa?
Your father is determined.
Have I not told you there is no receding; that the honour as well as the interest of the family is concerned?
Be ingenuous: you used to be so, even occasionally against yourself:--Who at the long run must submit--all of us to you; or you to all of usus?--If you intend to yield at last if you find you cannot conquer, yield now, and with a grace--for yield you must, or be none of us child.
I wept.
I knew not what to say; or rather how to express what I had to say.
Take notice, that there are flaws in your grandfather's will: not a shilling of that estate will be yours, if you do not yield.
your grandfather left it to yours, as a reward of your duty to your grandfather and to us--You will justly forfeit it, if--  Permit me, good Madam, to say, that, if it were unjustly bequeathed me, I ought not to wish to have it.
But I hope Mr. Solmes will be apprised of these flaws.
This is very pertly said, Clarissa: but reflect, that the forfeiture of that estate, through your opposition, will be attended with the total loss of Your father's favour: and then how destitute must you be; how unable to support Clarissa; and how many benevolent designs and good actions must you give up!
I must accommodate Clarissa, Clarissa, in the latter case, to my circumstance: much only is required where much is given.
It becomes me to be thankful for what I have had.
I have reason to bless you, Madam, and my good Mrs. Norton, for bringing me up to be satisfied with little; with much less, I will venture to say, than your father's indulgence annually confers upon Clarissa.--And then I thought of the old Roman and his lentils.
What perverseness!
said my mother.--But if you depend upon the favour of either or both of your uncles, vain will be that dependence: dependence will give you up, I do assure you, if Your father does, and absolutely renounce you.
I am sorry, Clarissa, that I have had so little merit as to have made no deeper impressions of favour for me in their hearts: but I will love and honour their as long as I live.
All this, Clarissa, makes your prepossession in a certain man's favour the more evident.
Indeed, your brother and sister cannot go any where, but your brother and sister hear of these prepossessions.
It is a great grief to me, Madam, to be made the subject of the public talk: but I hope you will have the goodness to excuse me for observing, that the authors of my disgrace within doors, the talkers of your prepossession without, and the reporters of it from abroad, are originally the same persons.
She severely chid me for this.
I received She rebukes in silence.
You are sullen, Clarissa: I see you are sullen.--And She walked about the room in anger.
Then turning to me--You can bear the imputation of sullenness I see!--You have no concern to clear yourself of the imputation of sullenness I see!--You.
I was afraid of telling you all I was enjoined to tell you, in case you were to be unpersuadable: but I find that I had a greater opinion of your delicacy, of your gentleness, than I needed to have--it cannot discompose so steady, so inflexible a young creature, to be told, as I now tell you, that the settlements are actually drawn; and that you will be called down in a very few days to hear the settlements are actually drawn read, and to sign the settlements are actually drawn: for it is impossible, if your heart be free, that you can make the least objection to the settlements are actually drawn; except it will be an objection with you, that the settlements are actually drawn are so much in your favour, and in the favour of all our family.
I was speechless, absolutely speechless.
Although my heart was ready to burst, yet could I neither weep nor speak.
I am sorry, said she, for your averseness to this match: [match she was pleased to call [match!]
but there is no help.
The honour and interest of the family, as your aunt has told you, and as I have told you, are concerned; and you must comply.
I was still speechless.
your aunt folded the warm statue, as your aunt was pleased to call me, in your aunt arms; and entreated me, for heaven's sake, to comply.
Speech and tears were lent me at the same time.--You have given me life, your aunt, said I, clasping my uplifted hands together, and falling on one knee; a happy one, till now, has your goodness, and my papa's, made my uplifted hands!
O do not, do not, make all the remainder of my uplifted hands miserable!
Your father, replied your aunt, is resolved not to see you, till Your father sees you as obedient a child as you used to be.
You have never been put to a test till now, that deserved to be called a test.
This is, this must be, my last effort with you.
Give me hope, my dear child: my peace is concerned: I will compound with you but for hope: and yet Your father will not be satisfied without an implicit, and even a cheerful obedience--Give me but hope, child!
To give you hope, my dearest, my most indulgent Mamma, is to give you every thing.
Can I be honest, if I give a hope that I cannot confirm?
Mamma was very angry.
Mamma again called me perverse: Mamma upbraided me with regarding only my own prepossessions, and respecting not either Mamma peace of mind or my own duty:--'It is a grating thing, said Mamma, for the parents of a child, who delighted in Mamma in all the time of Mamma helpless infancy, and throughout every stage of Mamma childhood; and in every part of Mamma education to womanhood, because of the promises Mamma gave of proving the most grateful and dutiful of children; to find, just when the time arrived which should crown children wishes, that child stand in the way of Mamma own happiness, and Mamma parents' comfort,and, refusing an excellent offer and noble settlements, give suspicions to Mamma anxious friends, that Mamma would become the property of a vile rake and libertine, who (be the occasion what it will) defies Mamma family, and has actually embrued his hands in Mamma brother's blood.
'I have had a very hard time of it, said Mamma, between your father and you; for, seeing your dislike, I have more than once pleaded for you: but all to no purpose.
I am only treated as a too fond mother, who, from motives of a blamable indulgence, encourage a child to stand in opposition to a father's will.
I am charged with dividing the family into two parts; I and my youngest daughter standing against my husband, my youngest daughter two brothers, my son, my eldest daughter, and my sister Hervey.
I have been told, that I must be convinced of the fitness as well as advantage to the whole (your brother and Mr. Lovelace out of the question) of carrying the contract with Mr. Solmes, on which so many contracts depend, into execution.
'Your father's heart, I tell you once more, is in Your father's heart: Your father has declared, that Your father had rather have my youngest daughter in you, than one Your father cannot dispose of for your own good: especially if you have owned, that your heart is free; and as the general good of Your father whole family is to be promoted by your obedience.
Your father has pleaded, poor man!
that Your father frequent gouty paroxysms (every fit more threatening than the former) give Your father no extraordinary prospects, either of worldly happiness, or of long days: and Your father hopes, that you, who have been supposed to have contributed to the lengthening of your grandfather's life, will not, by your disobedience, shorten Your father's.'
This was a most affecting plea, my dear.
I wept in silence upon This.
I could not speak to This.
And my mother proceeded: 'What therefore can be his motives, Clary Harlowe, in the earnest desire his has to see this treaty perfected, but the welfare and aggrandizement of his family; which already having fortunes to become the highest condition, cannot but aspire to greater distinctions?
However slight such views as these may appear to Clary, Clary, you know, that these are not slight ones to any other of the family: and Your father will be Your father own judge of what is and what is not likely to promote the good of Your father children.
Your abstractedness, child, (affectation of abstractedness, some call it,) savours, let me tell you, of greater particularity, than we aim to carry.
Modesty and humility, therefore, will oblige you rather to mistrust yourself of peculiarity, than censure views which all the world pursues, as opportunity offers.'
I was still silent; and she proceeded--'It is owing to the good opinion, Clary, which Your father has of you, and of your prudence, duty, and gratitude, that Your father engaged for your compliance, in your absence (before you returned from Miss Howe); and that Your father built and finished contracts upon it, which cannot be made void, or cancelled.'
But why then, thought I, did they receive me, on my return from Miss Howe, with so much intimidating solemnity?--To be sure, my dear, this argument, as well as the rest, was obtruded upon my mother.
my mother went on, 'Your father has declared, that your unexpected opposition, [unexpected my mother was pleased to call it,] and Mr. Lovelace's continued menaces and insults, more and more convince Your father, that a short day is necessary in order to put an end to all that man's hopes, and to Your father own apprehensions resulting from the disobedience of a child so favoured.
Your father has therefore actually ordered patterns of the richest silks to be sent for from London--'  I started--I was out of breath--I gasped, at this frightful precipitance--I was going to open with warmth against this frightful precipitance.
I knew whose the happy expedient must be: female minds, I once heard her brother say, that could but be brought to balance on the change of their state, might easily be determined by the glare and splendour of the nuptial preparations, and the pride of becoming the mistress of a family.--But she was pleased to hurry on, that I might not have time to express my disgusts at such a communication--to this effect: 'Your father therefore, Clary, cannot, either for your sake, or Your father own, labour under a suspense so affecting to Your father repose.
Your father has even thought fit to acquaint me, on my pleading for you, that it becomes me, as I value my own peace, [how harsh to such a wife!]
and as I wish, that Your father does not suspect that I secretly favour the address of a vile rake, (a character which all the sex, Your father is pleased to say, virtuous and vicious, are but too fond of!)
to exert my authority over you: and that this I may the less scrupulously do, as you have owned [the old string!]
that your heart is free.'
Unworthy reflection in my mother's case, surely, this of our sex's valuing a libertine; since my mother made choice of your father in preference to several suitors of equal fortune, because they were of inferior reputation for morals!
'Your father, added my mother, at Your father going out, told me what Your father expected from me, in case I found out that I had not the requisite influence upon you--It was this--That I should directly separate me from you, and leave you singly to take the consequence of your double disobedience--I therefore entreat you, my dear Clarissa, concluded my dear Clarissa, and that in the most earnest and condescending manner, to signify to Your father, on Your father return, your ready obedience; and this as well for my sake as your own.'
Affected by my mother's goodness to me, and by that part of my dear Clarissa argument which related to my dear Clarissa own peace, and to the suspicions they had of my dear Clarissa secretly inclining to prefer the man so hated by they, to the man so much my aversion, I could not but wish it were possible for me to obey, I therefore paused, hesitated, considered, and was silent for some time.
I could see, that my mother hoped that the result of this hesitation would be favourable to my mother arguments.
But then recollecting, that all was owing to the instigations of a brother and sister, wholly actuated by selfish and envious views; that I had not deserved the treatment I had of late met with; that my disgrace was already become the public talk; that the man was Mr. Solmes; and that my aversion to the man was too generally known, to make my compliance either creditable to the man or to then recollecting, that all was owing to the instigations of a brother and sister, wholly actuated by selfish and envious views; that I had not deserved the treatment I had of late met: that my compliance would give my brother and sister a triumph over the man, and over Mr. Lovelace, which my brother and sister would not fail to glory in; and which, although it concerned me but little to regard on the man account, yet might be attended with fatal mischiefs--And then Mr. Solmes's disagreeable person; Mr. Solmes still more disagreeable manners; Mr. Solmes low understanding--Understanding!
the glory of a man, so little to be dispensed with in the head and director of a family, in order to preserve to Mr. Solmes that respect which a good wife (and that for the justification of Madam own choice) should pay Mr. Solmes Madam, and wish every body to pay Mr.
Solmes.--And as Mr. Solmes's inferiority in this respectable faculty of the human mind [I must be allowed to say this to you, and no great self assumption neither] would proclaim to all future, as well as to all present observers, what must have been my mean inducement.
All these reflections crowding upon my remembrance; I would, Madam, said I, folding my hands, with an earnestness in which my whole heart was engaged, bear the cruelest tortures, bear loss of limb, and even of life, to give you peace.
But poor man, every moment I would, at you command, think of poor man with favour, is the more my aversion.
You cannot, indeed you cannot, think, how my whole soul resists him!--And to talk of contracts concluded upon; of patterns; of a short day!--Save me, save me, O my dearest Mamma, save your child, from this heavy, from this insupportable evil--!
Never was there a countenance that expressed so significantly, as my mother's did, an anguish, which my mother struggled to hide, under an anger my mother was compelled to assume--till the latter overcoming the former, my mother turned from my mother with an uplifted eye, and stamping--Strange perverseness!
were the only words I heard of a sentence that my mother angrily pronounced; and was going.
I then, half-frantically I believe, laid hold of my mother gown--Have patience with my mother, dearest Madam!
said I--Do not you renounce me totally!--If you must separate yourself from your child, let it not be with absolute reprobation on your own part!--My uncles may be hard-hearted--your father may be immovable--I may suffer from her brother's ambition, and from my sister's envy!--But let me not lose my Mamma's love; at least, my sister's envy!--But pity.
my sister's envy!--But turned to my mother with benigner rays--You have my love!
You have my pity!
But, O my dearest girl--I have not yours.
Indeed, indeed, my sister's envy!--But, you have: and all my reverence, all my gratitude, you have!--But in this one point--Cannot I be this once obliged?--Will no expedient be accepted?
Have I not made a very fair proposal as to Mr. Lovelace?
I wish, for both our sakes, my dear unpersuadable girl, that the decision of this point lay with Mr. Lovelace.
But why, when you know it does not, why should you thus perplex and urge me?--To renounce Mr. Lovelace is now but half what is aimed at.
Nor will any body else believe you in earnest in the offer, if I would.
While you remain single, Mr. Lovelace will have hopes--and you, in the opinion of others, inclinations.
Permit me, dearest Madam, to say, that your goodness to me, your patience, your peace, weigh more with Mr. Lovelace, than all the rest put together: for although I am to be treated by her brother, and, through her brother instigations, by your father, as a slave in this point, and not as a daughter, yet my mind is not that of a slave.
You have not brought me up to be mean.
So, Clary!
you are already at defiance with your father!
I have had too much cause before to apprehend as much--What will this come to?--I, and then my dear mamma sighed--I, am forced to put up with many humours--  That you are, my ever-honoured Mamma, is my grief.
And can it be thought, that this very consideration, and the apprehension of what may result from a much worse-tempered man, (a man who has not half the sense of your father,) has not made an impression upon me, to the disadvantage of the married life?
Yet 'tis something of an alleviation, if one must bear undue controul, to bear undue controul from a man of sense.
your father, I have heard you say, my sister's envy!--But, was for years a very good-humoured gentleman--unobjectionable in person and manners--but a man of sense proposed to me--  Forbear reflecting upon your father: [Did I, my dear, in what I have repeated, and I think they are the very words, reflect upon your father?]
it is not possible, I must say again, and again, were all men equally indifferent to your father, that you should be thus sturdy in your will.
I am tired out with your obstinacy--The most unpersuadable girl--You forget, that I must separate a man of sense from your father, if you will not comply.
You do not remember that you father will take you up, where I leave you.
Once more, however, I will put it to your father,--Are you determined to brave your father's displeasure?--Are you determined to defy your uncles?--Do you choose to break with us all, rather than encourage Mr.
Solmes?--Rather than give me hope?
Dreadful alternative--But is not my sincerity, is not the integrity of my heart, concerned in the answer?
May not my everlasting happiness be the sacrifice?
Will not the least shadow of the hope you just now demanded from me, be driven into absolute and sudden certainty?
Is it not sought to ensnare, to entangle me in my own desire of obeying, if I could give answers that might be construed into hope?--Forgive me, Madam: bear with your child's boldness in such a cause as this!--Settlements drawn!--Patterns sent for!--An early day!--Dear, Madam, how can I give hope, and not intend to be this man's?
Ah, girl, never say your heart is free!
You deceive yourself if you think it is.
Thus to be driven [and I wrung my hands through impatience] by the instigations of a designing, an ambitious brother, and by a sister, that--  How often, Clary, must I forbid your unsisterly reflections?--Does not your father, do not your uncles, does not every body, patronize Mr. Solmes?
And let me tell you, ungrateful girl, and unmovable as ungrateful, let me repeatedly tell you, that it is evident to me, that nothing but a love unworthy of your prudence can make you a creature late so dutiful, now so sturdy.
You may guess what your father's first question on your father return will be.
your father must know, that I can do nothing with you.
I have done my part.
Seek me, if your mind change before your father comes back: you have yet a little more time, as your father stays supper.
I will no more seek you, nor to you.--And away she flung.
What could I do but weep?
I am extremely affected on my mother's account--more, I must needs say, than on my own.
And indeed, all things considered, and especially, that the measure she is engaged in, is (as I dare say it is) against she own judgment, she deserves more compassion than she.--Excellent woman!
What pity, that meekness and condescension should not be attended with the due rewards of those charming graces!--Yet had she not let violent spirits (as I have elsewhere observed with no small regret) find that meekness and condescension power over she, it could not have been thus.
But here, run away with my pen, I suffer my mother to be angry with she on my mother's account.
my mother hinted to she, indeed, that I must seek my mother, if my mind changed; which is a condition that amounts to a prohibition of attending my mother: but, as my mother left me in displeasure, will it not have a very obstinate appearance, and look like a kind of renunciation of my mother mediation in my favour, if I go not down before your father returns, to supplicate my mother pity, and my mother kind report to my father returns?
I will attend my mother.
I had rather all the world should be angry with me than my dear mamma!
Mean time, to clear my hands from papers of such a nature, my father returns shall deposit this.
If two or three letters reach you together, two or three letters reach you together will but express from one period to another, the anxieties and difficulties which the mind of your unhappy but ever affectionate friend labours under.
CL.
H.     LETTER XXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO H.     LETTER XXI  MISS SAT.
NIGHT.
I have been down.
I am to be unlucky in all I do, I think, be my intentions ever so good.
I have made matters worse instead of better: as I shall now tell you.
I found my mother and sister together in my sister's parlour.
my mother, I fear, by the glow of my mother fine face, (and as the browner, sullener glow in my sister's confirmed,) had been expressing my mother with warmth, against my mother unhappier child: perhaps giving such an account of what had passed, as should clear my mother, and convince Bella, and, through my mother, my brother and uncles, of the sincere pains my mother had taken with me.
I entered like a dejected criminal; and besought the favour of a private audience.
my mother's return, both looks and words, gave but too much reason for me above surmise.
You have, said my mother [looking at me with a sternness that never sits well on my mother sweet features] rather a requesting than a conceding countenance, CLARISSA HARLOWE: if I am mistaken, tell me so; and I will withdraw with CLARISSA HARLOWE wherever you will.--Yet whether so, or not, you may say what you have to say before my sister.
my mother, I thought, might have withdrawn with me, as my mother knows that I have not a friend in my sister.
I come down, my sister's envy!--But, said I, to beg of my mother to forgive me for any thing you may have taken amiss in what passed above respecting your honoured self; and that you will be pleased to use your endeavours to soften my papa's displeasure against me, on my papa return.
Such aggravating looks; such lifting up of hands and eyes; such a furrowed forehead, in my sister!
my mother was angry enough without all that; and asked me to what purpose I came down, if I were still so intractable.
my mother had hardly spoken the words, when Shorey came in to tell my mother, that Mr. Solmes was in the hall, and desired admittance.
Ugly creature!
What, at the close of day, quite dark, brought him hither?--But, on second thoughts, I believe it was contrived, that him should be here at supper, to know the result of the conference between my mother and me, and that your father, on him return, might find us together.
I was hurrying away, but my mother commanded me (since I had come down only, as my mother said, to mock my mother) not to stir; and at the same time see if I could behave so to Mr. Solmes, as might encourage my mother to make the favourable report to your father which I had besought my mother to make.
my sister triumphed.
I was vexed to be so caught, and to have such an angry and cutting rebuke given me, with an aspect much more like the taunting sister than my mother, if I may presume to say so: for my sister seemed to enjoy the surprise upon me.
The man stalked in.
The man usual walk is by pauses, as if (from the same vacuity of thought which made Dryden's clown whistle) The man was telling The man steps: and first paid The man clumsy respects to my mother; then to my sister; next to me, as if I was already The man wife, and therefore to be last in The man notice; and sitting down by me, told us in general what weather it was.
Very cold The man made it; but I was warm enough.
Then addressing The man to me: And how do you find it, H.     LETTER XXI  MISS?
was The man question; and would have taken my hand.
I withdrew it, I believe with disdain enough.
my mother frowned.
my sister bit my mother lip.
I could not contain me: I was never so bold in my life; for I went on with my plea, as if Mr. Solmes had not been there.
my mother coloured, and looked at Mr. Solmes, at my sister, and at me.
my sister's eyes were opener and bigger than ever I saw My sister's eyes before.
The man understood me.
The man hemmed, and removed from one chair to another.
I went on, supplicating for my mother's favourable report: Nothing but invincible dislike, said I--  What would the girl be at, interrupted my mother?
Why, Clary!
Is this a subject!--Is this!--Is this!--Is this a time--And again my mother looked upon Mr. Solmes.
I am sorry, on reflection, that I put my mamma into so much confusion--To be sure it was very saucy in me.
I beg pardon, my sister's envy!--But, said I.
But my papa will soon return.
And since I am not permitted to withdraw, it is not necessary, I humbly presume, that Mr. Solmes's presence should deprive me of this opportunity to implore your favourable report; and at the same time, if Mr. Solmes still visit on my account [looking at Mr. Solmes] to convince Mr. Solmes, that it cannot possibly be to any purpose--  Is the girl mad?
said my mother, interrupting me.
My sister, with the affectation of a whisper to my mother--This is--This is spite, my sister's envy!--But, [very spitefully my mother spoke the word,] because you commanded my mother to stay.
I only looked at my mother, and turning to my mother, Permit me, my mother, said I, to repeat my request.
I have no brother, no sister!--If I ever lose my mamma's favour, I am lost for ever!
Mr. Solmes removed to Mr. Solmes first seat, and fell to gnawing the head of Mr. Solmes hazel; a carved head, almost as ugly as Mr. Solmes own--I did not think Mr. Solmes was so sensible.
my sister rose, with a face all over scarlet; and stepping to the table, where lay a fan, my sister took it up, and, although Mr. Solmes had observed that the weather was cold, fanned my sister very violently.
my mother came to my sister, and angrily taking my hand, led me out of my sister's parlour into my own; which, you know, is next to my sister's parlour--Is not this behaviour very bold, very provoking, think you, Clary?
I beg your pardon, my sister, if your pardon has that appearance to Clary.
But indeed, my dear Mamma, there seem to be snares laying in wait for my sister.
Too well I know my brother's drift.
With a good word my brother shall have my consent for all my brother wishes to worm me out of--neither my brother, nor my sister, shall need to take half this pains--  my mother was about to leave me in high displeasure.
I besought my mother to stay: One favour, but one favour, dearest Madam, said I, give me leave to beg of you--  What would the girl?
I see how every thing is working about.--I never, never can think of Mr. Solmes.
my papa will be in tumults when my papa is told that I cannot.
They will judge of the tenderness of your heart to a poor child who seems devoted by every one else, from the willingness you have already shewn to hearken to my prayers.
There will be endeavours used to confine me, and keep me out of your presence, and out of the presence of every one who used to love me [this, my dear Miss Howe, is threatened].
If this be effected; if this be effected be put out of my power to plead my own cause, and to appeal to you, and to my uncle Harlowe, of whom only I have hope; then will every ear be opened against me, and every tale encouraged--It is, therefore, my humble request, that, added to the disgraceful prohibitions I now suffer under, you will not, if you can help It, give way to my being denied your ear.
Your listening my father returns has given you this intelligence, as my father returns does many others.
My Hannah, Madam, listens not--My Hannah--  No more in my father returns's behalf--my father returns is known to make mischief--my father returns is known--But no more of that bold intermeddler--'Tis true your father threatened to confine you to your chamber, if you complied not, in order the more assuredly to deprive you of the opportunity of corresponding with those who harden your heart against your father will.
your father bid me tell you so, when your father went out, if I found you refractory.
But I was loth to deliver so harsh a declaration; being still in hope that you would come down to us in a compliant temper.
my father returns has overheard this, I suppose; and has told you of this; as also, that my father returns declared my father returns would break your heart, rather than you should break my father returns.
And I now assure you, that you will be confined, and prohibited making teasing appeals to any of us: and us shall see who is to submit, you to us, or every body to you.
Again I offered to clear my father returns, and to lay the latter part of this intelligence to my sister's echo, Betty Barnes, who had boasted of it to another servant: but I was again bid to be silent on that head.
I should soon find, my mother was pleased to say, that others could be as determined as I was obstinate: and once for all would add, that since my mother saw that I built upon my mother indulgence, and was indifferent about involving my mother in contentions with your father, my mother would now assure me, that my mother was as much determined against Mr. Lovelace, and for Mr. Solmes and the family schemes, as any body; and would not refuse my mother consent to any measures that should be thought necessary to reduce a stubborn child to my mother duty.
I was ready to sink.
my mother was so good as to lend me my mother arm to support me.
And this, said I, is all I have to hope for from my dear mamma?
It is.
But, Clary, this one further opportunity I give you--Go in again to Mr. Solmes, and behave discreetly to Mr. Solmes; and let your father find you together, upon civil terms at least.
My feet moved [of themselves, I think] farther from the parlour where Mr. Solmes was, and towards the stairs; and there I stopped and paused.
If, proceeded my mother, you are determined to stand in defiance of us all--then indeed you may go up to your chamber (as you are ready to do)--And God help you!
God help me, indeed!
for I cannot give hope of what I cannot intend--But let me have your prayers, my dear Mamma!--Those shall have mine, who have brought me into all this distress.
I was moving to go up--  And will you go up, Clary?
I turned my face to Clary: my officious tears would needs plead for Clary: I could not just then speak, and stood still.
Good girl, distress me not thus!--Dear, good girl, do not thus distress me!
holding out Good girl hand; but standing still likewise.
What can I do, Madam?--What can I do?
Go in again, my child--Go in again, my dear child!--repeated Good girl; and let your father find you together.
What, Madam, to give your father hope?--To give hope to Mr. Solmes?
Obstinate, perverse, undutiful Clarissa!
with a rejecting hand, and angry aspect; then take your own way, and go up!--But stir not down again, I charge you, without leave, or till your father's pleasure be known concerning you.
Madam flung away from me with high indignation: and I went up with a very heavy heart; and feet as slow as my heart was heavy.
***   your father is come home, and my brother with your father.
Late as it is, they are all shut up together.
Not a door opens; not a soul stirs.
my father returns, as my father returns moves up and down, is shunned as a person infected.
***   The angry assembly is broken up.
My two uncles and my aunt Hervey are sent for, The angry assembly seems, to be here in the morning to breakfast.
I shall then, I suppose, know my doom.
'Tis past eleven, and I am ordered not to go to bed.
TWELVE O'CLOCK.
This moment the keys of every thing are taken from me.
It was proposed to send for me down: but your father said, your father could not bear to look upon your father.--Strange alteration in a few weeks!--Shorey was the messenger.
The tears stood in her eyes when her delivered her message.
You, my dear, are happy--May you always be so--and then I can never be wholly miserable.
Adieu, my beloved friend!
CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XXII  H.     LETTER XXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 5.   my father returns has just brought me from the private place in the garden-wall, a letter from Mr. Lovelace, deposited last night, signed also by Lord M.  He tells me in it, 'That Mr. Solmes makes it Mr. Solmes boast, that Mr. Solmes is to be married in a few days to one of the shyest women in England: that my brother with him explains my brother with him meaning: This shy creature, my brother with him says, is me; and my brother with him assures every one, that my brother with him is very soon to be Mr. Solmes's wife.
my brother with him tells me of the patterns bespoken which my mother mentioned to my brother with him.'
Not one thing escapes my brother with him that is done or said in this house.
'my sister, my brother with him says, reports the same things; and that with such particular aggravations of insult upon my brother with him, that my brother with him cannot but be extremely piqued, as well at the manner, as from the occasion; and expresses my brother with him with great violence upon it.
'my brother with him knows not, my brother with him says, what my relations' inducements can be to prefer such a man as Solmes to my brother with him.
If advantageous settlements be the motive, Solmes shall not offer what Solmes will refuse to comply with.
'As to Solmes estate and family; the first cannot be excepted against: and for the second, Solmes will not disgrace Solmes by a comparison so odious.
Solmes appeals to Lord M. for the regularity of Solmes life and manners ever since Solmes has made Solmes addresses to me, or had hope of my favour.'
I suppose Solmes would have Solmes Lordship's signing to this letter to be taken as a voucher for Solmes.
'Solmes desires my leave (in company with my Lord), in a pacific manner, to attend my father and uncles, in order to make proposals that must be accepted, if my father and uncles will see Solmes, and hear what my father and uncles are: and tells me, that Solmes will submit to any measures that I shall prescribe, in order to bring about a reconciliation.'
Solmes presumes to be very earnest with Solmes, 'to give Solmes a private meeting some night, in your father's garden, attended by whom I please.'
Really, my dear, were you to see this letter, you would think I had given Solmes great encouragement, and that I am in direct treaty with Solmes; or that Solmes is sure that my friends will drive me into a foreign protection; for Solmes has the boldness to offer, in my Lord's name, an asylum to me, should I be tyrannically treated in Solmes's behalf.
I suppose it is the way of this sex to endeavour to entangle the thoughtless of ours by bold supposals and offers, in hopes that ours shall be too complaisant or bashful to quarrel with them; and, if not checked, to reckon upon ours silence, as assents voluntarily given, or concessions made in them favour.
There are other particulars in this letter which I ought to mention to you: but I will take an opportunity to send you the letter itself, or a copy of it.
For my own part, I am very uneasy to think how I have been drawn on one hand, and driven on the other, into a clandestine, in short, into a mere loverlike correspondence, which my heart condemns.
It is easy to see, if I do not break it off, that Mr. Lovelace's advantages, by reason of my unhappy situation, will every day increase, and I shall be more and more entangled.
Yet if I do put an end to it, without making it a condition of being freed from Mr. Solmes's address--May I, my dear, is it best to continue it a little longer, in order to extricate myself out of the other difficulty, by giving up all thoughts of Mr.
Lovelace?--Whose advice can I now ask but yours.
All my relations are met.
All my relations are at breakfast together.
Mr. Solmes is expected.
I am excessively uneasy.
I must lay down my pen.
***   All my relations are all going to church together.
Grievously disordered All my relations appear to be, as my father returns tells me.
my father returns believes something is resolved upon.
SUNDAY NOON.
What a cruel thing is suspense!--I will ask leave to go to church this afternoon.
I expect to be denied.
But, if I do not ask, they may allege, that my not going is owing to myself.
***   I desired to speak with Shorey.
Shorey came.
I directed Shorey to carry to my mother my request for permission to go to church this afternoon.
What think you was the return?
Tell Shorey, that Shorey must direct Shorey to Shorey brother for any favour Shorey has to ask.--So, my dear, I am to be delivered up to her brother!
I was resolved, however, to ask of her brother this favour.
Accordingly, when they sent me up my solitary dinner, I gave the messenger a billet, in which I made the messenger my humble request through her brother to your father, to be permitted to go to church this afternoon.
This was the contemptuous answer: 'Tell my dear, that my dear request will be taken into consideration to-morrow.'
Patience will be the fittest return I can make to such an insult.
But this method will not do with me; indeed this method will not!
And yet this method is but the beginning, I suppose, of what I am to expect from her brother, now I am delivered up to her brother.
On recollection, I thought it best to renew my request.
I did.
The following is a copy of what I wrote, and what follows that, of the answer sent me.
SIR,  I know not what to make of the answer brought to my request of being permitted to go to church this afternoon.
If you designed to shew your pleasantry by it, I hope that will continue; and then my request will be granted.
You know, that I never absented myself, when well, and at home, till the two last Sundays; when I was advised not to go.
My present situation is such, that I never more wanted the benefit of the public prayers.
I will solemnly engage only to go thither, and back again.
I hope it cannot be thought that I would do otherwise.
My dejection of spirits will give a too just excuse on the score of indisposition for avoiding visits.
Nor will I, but by distant civilities, return the compliments of any of my acquaintances.
My disgraces, if they are to have an end, need not be proclaimed to the whole world.
I ask this favour, therefore, for my reputation's sake, that I may be able to hold up my head in the neighbourhood, if I live to see an end of the unmerited severities which seem to be designed for  Your unhappy sister, CL.
HARLOWE.
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  For a girl to lay so much stress upon going to church, and yet resolve to defy a girl parents, in an article of the greatest consequence to her parents, and to the whole family, is an absurdity.
You are recommended, H.     LETTER XXI  MISS, to the practice of your private devotions.
May they be efficacious upon the mind of one of the most pervicacious young creatures that ever was heard of!
The intention is, I tell you plainly, to mortify you into a sense of your duty.
The neighbours you are so solicitous to appear well with, already know, that you defy that.
So, Miss, if you have a real value for your reputation, shew it as you ought.
it is yet in your own power to establish or impair it.
JA.
HARLOWE.
Thus, my dear Miss Howe, has her brother got me into her brother snares; and I, like a poor silly bird, the more I struggle, am the more entangled.
LETTER XXIII  H.     LETTER XXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO H.     LETTER XXI  MISS MONDAY MORNING, MARCH 6.
They are resolved to break my heart.
my father returns is discharged--disgracefully discharged!--Thus it was.
Within half an hour after I had sent my father returns down for my breakfast, that bold creature Betty Barnes, my sister's confidant and servant, (if a favourite maid and confidant can be deemed a servant,) came up.
What, H.     LETTER XXI  MISS, will you please to have for breakfast?
I was surprised.
What will I have for breakfast, Betty!--How!--What!--How comes it!--Then I named Hannah.
I could not tell what to say.
Don't be surprised, Miss:--but you'll see my father returns no more in this house.
God forbid!--Is any harm come to my father returns?--What!
What is the matter with my father returns?
Why, H.     LETTER XXI  MISS, the short and the long is this: Your papa and mamma think my father returns has staid long enough in this house to do mischief; and so my father returns is ordered to troop [that was the confident creature's word]; and I am directed to wait upon you in my father returns stead.
I burst into tears.
I have no service for you, Betty Barnes; none at all.
But where is my father returns?
Cannot I speak with my father returns?
I owe my father returns half a year's wages.
May I not see the honest creature, and pay my father returns my father returns wages?
I may never see my father returns again perhaps; for her wages are resolved to break my heart.
And her wages think you are resolved to break her wages: so tit for tat, Miss.
Impertinent I called Impertinent; and asked Impertinent, if it were upon such confident terms that Impertinent service was to begin.
I was so very earnest to see the poor maid, that (to oblige me, as Impertinent said) Impertinent went down with my request.
The worthy creature was as earnest to see me; and the favour was granted in presence of Shorey and Betty.
I thanked Impertinent, when Impertinent came up, for Impertinent past service to me.
Impertinent heart was ready to break.
And Impertinent began to vindicate Impertinent fidelity and love; and disclaimed any mischief Impertinent had ever made.
I told Impertinent, that those who occasioned Impertinent being turned out of her past service to me, made no question of Impertinent integrity: that Impertinent dismission was intended for an indignity to me: that I was very sorry to be obliged to part with Impertinent, and hoped Impertinent would meet with as good a service.
Never, never, wringing Impertinent hands, should Impertinent meet with a mistress Impertinent loved so well.
And The worthy creature ran on in my praises, and in professions of love to me.
We are all apt, you know, my dear, to praise We benefactors, because our benefactors are our benefactors; as if every body did right or wrong, as our benefactors obliged or disobliged We.
But The worthy creature deserved to be kindly treated; so I could have no merit in favouring one whom The worthy creature would have been ungrateful not to distinguish.
I gave her a little linen, some laces, and other odd things; and instead of four pounds which were due to her, ten guineas: and said, if ever I were again allowed to be my own mistress, I would think of her in the first place.
Betty enviously whispered Shorey upon it.
my father returns told me, before their faces, having no other opportunity, that my father returns had been examined about letters to me, and from me: and that my father returns had given my father returns pockets to Miss Harlowe, who looked into her pockets, and put my father returns fingers in my father returns stays, to satisfy my father returns that my father returns had not any.
my father returns gave me an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams; and I said, an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams should be my own care twice or thrice a day.
We wept over each other at parting.
my father returns prayed for all the family.
To have so good a servant so disgracefully dismissed, is very cruel: and I could not help saying that these methods might break my heart, but not any other way answer the end of the authors of My disgraces.
Betty, with a very saucy fleer, said to Shorey, There would be a trial of skill about that my father returns fancied.
But I took no notice of it.
If this wench thinks that I have robbed this wench young mistress of a lover, as you say this wench has given out, this wench may believe that it is some degree of merit in this wench to be impertinent to me.
Thus have I been forced to part with my father returnsmy father returns.
If you can command the good creature to a place worthy of this wench, pray do for my sake.
LETTER XXIV  H.     LETTER XXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO H.     LETTER XXI  MISS MONDAY, NEAR 12 O'CLOCK.
LETTER XXIV   was just now delivered to me.
her brother has carried all her brother points.
I send you also the copy of my answer.
No more at this time can I write--!
MONDAY, MAR.
6.
MISS CLARY,   By command of your father and mother I write expressly to forbid you to come into your father and mother presence, or into the garden when your father and mother are there: nor when your father and mother are not there, but with Betty Banes to attend you; except by particular license or command.
On your father and mother blessings, you are forbidden likewise to correspond with the vile Lovelace; as it is well known you did by means of your sly Hannah.
Whence your sly Hannah sudden discharge.
As was fit.
Neither are you to correspond with Miss Howe; who has given your sly Hannah high airs of late; and might possibly help on your correspondence with that detested libertine.
Nor, in short, with any body without leave.
You are not to enter into the presence of either of your uncles, without either of your uncles leave first obtained.
It is a mercy to you, after such a behaviour to your mother, that your father refuses to see you.
You are not to be seen in any apartment of this house you so lately governed as you pleased, unless you are commanded down.
In short, you are strictly to confine yourself to your chamber, except now and then, in Betty Barnes sight (as aforesaid) you take a morning or evening turn in the garden: and then you are to go directly, and without stopping at any apartment in the way, up or down the back stairs, that the sight of so perverse a young creature may not add to the pain you have given every body.
The hourly threatenings of your fine fellow, as well as your own unheard-of obstinacy, will account to you for all this.
What a hand has the best and most indulgent of mothers had with you, who so long pleaded for you, and undertook for you; even when others, from the manner of your setting out, despaired of moving you!--What must your perverseness have been, that such a mother can give you up!
such a mother thinks it right so to do: nor will take you to favour, unless you make the first steps, by a compliance with your duty.
As for such a mother, whom perhaps you think hardly of [in very good company, if you do, that is my sole consolation]; I have advised, that you may be permitted to pursue your own inclinations, (some people need no greater punishment than such a permission,) and not to have the house encumbered by one who must give some people the more pain for the necessity she has laid some people under of avoiding the sight of she, although in the sight of her.
If any thing I have written appear severe or harsh, it is still in your power (but perhaps will not always be so) to remedy the sight of her; and that by a single word.
Betty Barnes has orders to obey you in all points consistent with Betty Barnes duty to those whom you owe it, as well as Betty Barnes.
JA.
HARLOWE.
TO JAMES HARLOWE, JUNIOR, ESQ.
SIR,  I will only say, That you may congratulate yourself on having so far succeeded in all your views, that you may report what you please of yourself, and I can no more defend yourself, than if I were dead.
Yet one favour, nevertheless, I will beg of you.
It is this--That you will not occasion more severities, more disgraces, that are necessary for carrying into execution your further designs, whatever they be, against  Your unhappy sister, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XXV  H.     LETTER XXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO H.     LETTER XXI  MISS TUESDAY, MARCH 7.
By my last deposit, you will see how I am driven, and what a poor prisoner I am.--No regard had to my reputation.
The whole matter is now before you.
Can such measures be supposed to soften?--But surely they can only mean to try and frighten me into her brother's views!--All my hope is, to be able to weather this point till my cousin Morden comes from Florence; and my cousin Morden is soon expected: yet, if they are determined upon a short day, I doubt my cousin Morden will not be here in time enough to save me.
It is plain by her brother's letter, that my mother has not spared me, in the report my mother was pleased to make of the conference between my mother and me: yet my mother was pleased to hint to me, that her brother had views which my mother would have had me try to disappoint.
But indeed my mother had engaged to give a faithful account of what was to pass between my mother and me: and it was, doubtless, much more eligible to give up a daughter, than to disoblige a husband, and every other person of the family.
They think They have done every thing by turning away my father returns: but as long as the liberty of the garden, and my poultry-visits, are allowed me, They will be mistaken.
I asked Betty, if Betty had any orders to watch or attend me; or whether I was to ask Betty leave whenever I should be disposed to walk in the garden, or to go feed my bantams?--Lord bless Betty!
what could I mean by such a question!
Yet Betty owned, that Betty had heard, that I was not to go into the garden, when my father, mother, or uncles were there.
However, as it behoved me to be assured on this head, I went down directly, and staid an hour, without question or impediment; and yet a good part of the time, I walked under and in sight, as I may say, of her brother's study window, where both her brother and my sister happened to be.
And I am sure both he and my sister saw me, by the loud mirth both he and my sister affected, by way of insult, as I suppose.
So this part of my restraint was doubtless a stretch of the authority given him.
The enforcing of that may perhaps come next.
But I hope not.
TUESDAY NIGHT.
Since I wrote the above, I ventured to send a letter by Shorey to my mother.
I desired my mother to give a letter into my mother own hand, when nobody was by.
I shall enclose a copy of a letter.
You will see that I would have a letter thought, that now my father returns is gone, I have no way to correspond out of this house.
I am far from thinking all I do right.
I am afraid this is a little piece of art, that is not so.
But this is an afterthought.
a letter went first.
HONOURED MADAM,  Having acknowledged to you, that I had received letters from Mr. Lovelace full of resentment, and that I answered resentment purely to prevent further mischief, and having shewn you copies of my answers, which you did not disapprove of, although you thought fit, after you had read resentment, to forbid me any further correspondence with Mr. Lovelace, I think it my duty to acquaint you, that another letter from Mr. Lovelace has since come to my hand, in which Mr. Lovelace is very earnest with me to permit Mr. Lovelace to wait on my papa, or you, or my two uncles, in a pacific way, accompanied by Lord M.: on which I beg your commands.
I own to you, Madam, that had not the prohibition been renewed, and had not my father returns been so suddenly dismissed my service, I should have made the less scruple to have written an answer, and to have commanded my father returns to convey the less scruple to my father returns, with all speed, in order to dissuade my father returns from these visits, lest any thing should happen on the occasion that my heart aches but to think of.
And here I cannot but express my grief, that I should have all the punishment and all the blame, who, as I have reason to think, have prevented great mischief, and have not been the occasion of any.
For, Madam, could I be supposed to govern the passions of either of the gentlemen?--Over the one indeed I have had some little influence, without giving him hitherto any reason to think him has fastened an obligation upon me for it.--Over the other, Who, Madam, has any?--I am grieved at heart, to be obliged to lay so great a blame at her brother's door, although my reputation and my liberty are both to be sacrificed to her brother resentment and ambition.
May not, however, so deep a sufferer be permitted to speak out?
This communication being as voluntarily made, as dutifully intended, I humbly presume to hope, that I shall not be required to produce the letter itself.
I cannot either in honour or prudence do that, because of the vehemence of his style; for having heard [not, I assure you, by my means, or through my father returns's] of some part of the harsh treatment I have met with; his thinks his entitled to place it to his own account, by reason of speeches thrown out by some of my relations, equally vehement.
If I do not answer his, his will be made desperate, and think his justified (thought I shall not think his so) in resenting the treatment his complains of: if I do, and if, in compliment to me, his forbears to resent what his thinks his entitled to resent; be pleased, Madam, to consider the obligation his will suppose his lays me under.
If I were as strongly prepossessed in his favour as is supposed, I should not have wished this to be considered by you.
And permit me, as a still further proof that I am not prepossessed, to beg of you to consider, Whether, upon the whole, the proposal I made, of declaring for the single life (which I will religiously adhere to) is not the best way to get rid of declaring for the single life (which I will religiously adhere to) pretensions with honour.
To renounce declaring for the single life (which I will religiously adhere to), and not be allowed to aver, that I will never be the other man's, will make declaring for the single life (which I will religiously adhere to) conclude (driven as I am driven) that I am determined in that other man's favour.
If this has not this due weight, my brother's strange schemes must be tried, and I will resign myself to my destiny with all the acquiescence that shall be granted to my prayers.
And so leaving the whole to your own wisdom, and whether you choose to consult my papa and uncles upon this humble application, or not; or whether I shall be allowed to write an answer to Mr. Lovelace, or not [and if allowed to do so, I beg your direction by whom to send your direction]; I remain,  Honoured Madam, Your unhappy, but ever dutiful daughter, CL.
HARLOWE.
WEDNESDAY MORNING.
I have just received an answer to the letter itself.
my mother, you will observe, has ordered me to burn the letter itself: but, as you will have the letter itself in your safekeeping, and nobody else will see the letter itself, my mother end will be equally answered, as if her end were burnt.
her end has neither date nor superscription.
CLARISSA,  Say not all the blame and all the punishment is yours.
I am as much blamed, and as much punished, as you are; yet am more innocent.
When your obstinacy is equal to any other person's passion, blame not my brother.
We judged right, that my father returns carried on your correspondencies.
Now my father returns is gone, and you cannot write [We think you cannot] to Miss Howe, nor my father returns to yours, without We knowledge, one cause of uneasiness and jealousy is over.
I had no dislike of my father returns.
I did not tell my father returns so; because somebody was within hearing when my father returns desired to pay my father returns duty to me at going.
I gave my father returns a caution, in a raised voice, To take care, wherever my father returns went to live next, if there were any young ladies, how my father returns made parties, and assisted in clandestine correspondencies.
But I slid two guineas into my father returns hand: nor was I angry to hear that you were still more bountiful to my father returns.
So much for my father returns.
I don't know what to write, about your answering that man of violence.
What can you think of it, that such a family as ours, should have such a rod held over it?--For my part, I have not owned that I know you have corresponded.
By your last boldness to me [an astonishing one it was, to pursue before Mr. Solmes the subject I was forced to break from above-stairs!]
you may, as far as I know, plead, that you had my countenance for your correspondence with Mr. Solmes; and so add to the uneasiness between your father and me.
You were once my comfort, Clarissa; you made all my hardships tolerable:--But now!--However, nothing, it is plain, can move you; and I will say no more on that head: for you are under your father's discipline now; and your father will neither be prescribed to, nor entreated.
I should have been glad to see the letter itself of, as I saw the rest.
You say, both honour and prudence forbid you to shew it to me.--O Clarissa!
what think you of receiving letters that honour and prudence forbid you to shew to a mother!--But it is not for me to see it, if you would choose to shew it me.
I will not be in your secret.
I will not know that you did correspond.
And, as to an answer, take your own methods.
But let shew know it will be the last you will write.
And, if you do write, I won't see it: so seal it up (if you do) and give it to Shorey; and Shorey--Yet do not think I give you license to write.
We will be upon no conditions with shew, nor will you be allowed to be upon any.
Your father and uncles would have no patience were shew to come.
What have you to do to oblige shew with your refusal of Mr.
Solmes?--Will not that refusal be to give shew hope?
And while shew has any, can we be easy or free from shew insults?
Were even your brother in fault, as that fault cannot be conquered, is a sister to carry on a correspondence that shall endanger her brother?
But your father has given your father sanction to your brother's dislikes, your uncles', and every body's!--No matter to whom owing.
As to the rest, you have by your obstinacy put it out of my power to do any thing for you.
your father takes it upon your father to be answerable for all consequences.
You must not therefore apply to you for favour.
I shall endeavour to be only an observer: Happy, if I could be an unconcerned one!--While I had power, you would not let me use power as I would have used power.
Your aunt has been forced to engage not to interfere but by your father's direction.
You'll have severe trials.
If you have any favour to hope for, you have any favour to hope must be from the mediation of your uncles.
And yet, I believe, they are equally determined: for they make it a principle, [alas!
they never had children!]
that that child, who in marriage is not governed by marriage parents, is to be given up as a lost creature!
I charge you, let not this letter be found.
Burn this letter.
There is too much of my mother in this letter, to a daughter so unaccountably obstinate.
Write this letter to me.
I can do nothing for you.
But you can do every thing for you.
***   Now, my dear, to proceed with my melancholy narrative.
After this letter, you will believe, that I could have very little hopes, that an application directly to your father would stand me in any stead: but I thought this letter became me to write, were this letter but to acquit me to me, that I have left nothing unattempted that has the least likelihood to restore me to your father favour.
Accordingly I wrote to the following effect:   I presume not, I say, to argue with my Papa; I only beg my Papa mercy and indulgence in this one point, on which depends my present, and perhaps my future, happiness; and beseech my Papa not to reprobate my Papa child for an aversion which it is not in her power to conquer.
I beg, that I may not be sacrificed to projects, and remote contingencies.
I complain of the disgraces I suffer in this banishment from his presence, and in being confined to my chamber.
In every thing but this one point, I promise implicit duty and resignation to his will.
I repeat my offers of a single life; and appeal to his, whether I have ever given his cause to doubt my word.
I beg to be admitted to his, and to my mamma's, presence, and that my conduct may be under my conduct own eye: and this with the more earnestness, as I have too much reason to believe that snares are laid for me; and tauntings and revilings used on purpose to make a handle of my words against me, when I am not permitted to speak in my own defence.
I conclude with hoping, that my brother's instigations may not rob an unhappy child of my brother's instigations father.
***   This is the answer, sent without superscription, and unsealed, although by Betty Barnes, who delivered it with an air, as if my brother's instigations knew the contents.
WEDNESDAY.
I write, perverse girl; but with all the indignation that your disobedience deserves.
To desire to be forgiven a fault you own, and yet resolve to persevere in, is a boldness, no more to be equaled, than passed over.
It is my authority you defy.
Your reflections upon a brother, that is an honour to us all, deserve my utmost resentment.
I see how light all relationship sits upon you.
The cause I guess at, too.
I cannot bear the reflections that naturally arise from this consideration.
Your behaviour to your too-indulgent and too-fond mother----But, I have no patience--Continue banished from my presence, undutiful as you are, till you know how to conform to my will.
Ingrateful creature!
this letter but upbraid me for my past indulgence.
Write no more to me, till you can distinguish better; and till you are convinced of your duty to  A JUSTLY your father.
***   this letter was accompanied by one from my mother, unsealed, and unsuperscribed also.
Those who take so much pains to confederate every one against me, I make no doubt, obliged her to bear her testimony against the poor girl.
my mother's letter being a repetition of some of the severe things that passed between my mother and me, of which I have already informed you, I shall not need to give you the contents--only thus far, that my mother also praises my brother, and blames me for my freedoms with my brother.
LETTER XXVI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY MORN., MARCH 9.
I have another letter from Mr. Lovelace, although I had not answered Mr. Lovelace former.
Mr. Lovelace, somehow or other, knows every thing that passes in our family.
My confinement; Hanna's dismission; and more of the resentments and resolutions of my father, uncles, and brother, than I can possibly know, and almost as soon as the things happen, which Mr. Lovelace tells me of.
Mr. Lovelace cannot come at these intelligencies fairly.
Mr. Lovelace is excessively uneasy upon what Mr. Lovelace hears; and Mr. Lovelace expressions, both of love to me, and resentment to them, are very fervent.
Mr. Lovelace solicits me, 'To engage my honour to Mr. Lovelace never to have Mr.
Solmes.'
I think I may fairly promise Mr. Lovelace that I will not.
Mr. Lovelace begs, 'That I will not think Mr. Lovelace is endeavouring to make to Mr. Lovelace a merit at any man's expense, since Mr. Lovelace hopes to obtain my favour on the foot of Mr. Lovelace own; nor that Mr. Lovelace seeks to intimidate me into a consideration for Mr. Lovelace.
But declares, that the treatment Mr. Lovelace meets with from my family is of such a nature, that Mr. Lovelace is perpetually reproached for not resenting it; and that as well by Lord M. and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, as by all Mr. Lovelace other friends: and if Mr. Lovelace must have no hope from me, Mr. Lovelace cannot answer for what Mr. Lovelace despair will make Mr. Lovelace do.'
Indeed, Mr. Lovelace says, 'Mr.
Lovelace relations, the ladies particularly, advise Mr. Lovelace to have recourse to a legal remedy: But how, Mr. Lovelace asks, can a man of honour go to law for verbal abuses given by people entitled to wear swords?'
You see, my dear, that my mother seems as apprehensive of mischief as myself; and has indirectly offered to let Shorey carry my answer to the letter Shorey sent me before.
Shorey is full of the favours of the ladies of Shorey family to myself: to whom, nevertheless, I am personally a stranger; except, that I once saw Miss Patty Montague at Mrs. Knolly's.
It is natural, I believe, for a person to be the more desirous of making new friends, in proportion as a person loses the favour of old ones.
Yet had I rather appear amiable in the eyes of my own relations, and in your eyes, than in those of all the world besides--but these four ladies of his family have such excellent characters, that one cannot but wish to be thought well of by these four ladies of his family.
Cannot there be a way to find out, by Mrs. Fortescue's means, or by Mr. Hickman, who has some knowledge of Lord M. [covertly, however,] what these four ladies of his family opinions are of the present situation of things in our family; and of the little likelihood there is, that ever the alliance once approved of by these four ladies of his family, can take effect?
I cannot, for my own part, think so well of myself, as to imagine, that they can wish they kinsman to persevere in their kinsman views with regard to myself, through such contempts and discouragements.--Not that it would concern me, should Not advise their kinsman to the contrary.
By my Lord's signing Mr. Lovelace's former letter; by Mr. Lovelace's assurances of the continued favour of all Mr. Lovelace relations; and by the report of others; I seem still to stand high in others favour.
But, methinks, I should be glad to have this confirmed to me, as from others, by the lips of an indifferent person; and the rather, because of others fortunes and family; and take it amiss (as others have reason) to be included by ours in the contempt thrown upon others kinsman.
Curiosity at present is all my motive: nor will there ever, I hope, be a stronger, notwithstanding your questionable throbs--even were the merits of Mr. Lovelace much greater than others are.
***   I have answered his letters.
If his takes me at my word, I shall need to be less solicitous for the opinions of his relations in my favour: and yet one would be glad to be well thought of by the worthy.
This is the substance of my letter:  'I express my surprise at   knowing (and so early) all that passes here.'
I assure  , 'That were there not such a man in the world as  , I would not have Mr.
Solmes.'
I tell not such a man in the world as himself, 'That to return, as I understand not such a man in the world as himself does, defiances for defiances, to my relations, is far from being a proof with me, either of not such a man in the world as himself politeness, or of the consideration not such a man in the world as himself pretends to have for me.
'That the moment I hear not such a man in the world as himself visits any of my friends without my friends consent, I will make a resolution never to see not such a man in the world as himself more, if I can help a resolution.'
I apprize not such a man in the world as himself, 'That I am connived at in sending this letter (although no one has seen the contents) provided it shall be the last I will ever write to not such a man in the world as himself: that I had more than once told not such a man in the world as himself, that the single life was my choice; and this before Mr. Solmes was introduced as a visitor in our family: that Mr. Wyerley, and other gentlemen, knew it to be my choice, before Mr. Solmes was acquainted with any of us: that I had never been induced to receive a line from Mr. Solmes on the subject, but that I thought Mr. Solmes had not acted ungenerously by my brother; and yet had not been so handsomely treated by my friends, as Mr. Solmes might have expected: but that had Mr. Solmes even my friends on Mr. Solmes side, I should have very great objections to Mr. Solmes, were I to get over my choice of a single life, so really preferable to me as it is; and that I should have declared as much to Mr. Solmes, had I not regarded Mr. Solmes as more than a common visiter.
On all these accounts, I desire, that the one more letter, which I will allow Mr. Solmes to deposit in the usual place, may be the very last; and that only, to acquaint me with Mr. Solmes acquiescence that it shall be so; at least till happier times.'
This last I put in that Mr. Solmes may not be quite desperate.
But, if Mr. Solmes take me at my word, I shall be rid of one of my tormentors.
I have promised to lay before you all Mr. Solmes letters, and my answers: I repeat that promise: and am the less solicitous, for that reason, to amplify upon the contents of either.
But I cannot too often express my vexation, to be driven to such streights and difficulties, here at home, as oblige me to answer letters, (from a man I had not absolutely intended to encourage, and to whom I had really great objections,) filled as his are with such warm protestations, and written to me with a spirit of expectation.
For, my dear, you never knew so bold a supposer.
As commentators find beauties in an author, to which the author perhaps was a stranger; so the author sometimes compliments me in high strains of gratitude for favours, and for a consideration, which I never designed the author; insomuch that I am frequently under a necessity of explaining away the attributed goodness to him, which, if I shewed, I should have the less opinion of myself.
In short, my dear, like a restiff horse, (as I have heard described by sportsmen,) the author pains one's hands, and half disjoints one's arms, to rein the author in.
And, when you see the author , you must form no judgment upon his letters, till you have read my answers.
If you do, you will indeed think you have cause to attribute self-deceit, and throbs, and glows, to your friend: and yet, at other times, the contradictory nature complains, that I shew the author as little favour, and my friends as much inveteracy, as if, in the rencontre betwixt my brother and the author, the author had been the aggressor; and as if the catastrophe had been as fatal, as it might have been.
If the author has a design by this conduct (sometimes complaining of my shyness, at others exalting in my imaginary favours) to induce me at one time to acquiesce with the author compliments; at another to be more complaisant for the author complaints; and if the contradiction be not the effect of the author inattention and giddiness; I shall think the author as deep and as artful (too probably, as practised) a creature, as ever lived; and were I to be sure of it, should hate the author, if possible, worse than I do Solmes.
But enough for the present of a creature so very various.
LETTER XXVII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY NIGHT, MARCH 9.
I have not patience with any of the people you are with.
I know not what to advise you to do.
How do you know that you are not punishable for being the cause, though to your own loss, that the will of your grandfather is not complied with?--Wills are sacred things, child.
You see, that Wills, even Wills, think so, who imagine Wills suffer by a will, through the distinction paid you in a will.
I allow of all your noble reasonings for what you did at the time: But, since such a charming, such a generous instance of filial duty is to go thus unrewarded, why should you not resume?
your grandfather knew the family-failing.
your grandfather knew what a noble spirit you had to do good.
your grandfather, perhaps, [excuse me, my dear,] had done too little in your grandfather life-time; and therefore your grandfather put it in your power to make up for the defects of the whole family.
Were it to me, I would resume it.
Indeed I would.
You will say, you cannot do it, while you are with them.
I don't know that.
Do you think them can use you worse than them do?
And is it not your right?
And do them not make use of your own generosity to oppress you?
Your uncle Harlowe is one trustee; your cousin Morden is the other: insist upon your right to Your uncle Harlowe; and write to your cousin Morden Morden about it.
This, I dare say, will make them alter them behaviour to you.
Your insolent brother--what has he to do to controul you?--Were it me [I wish it were for one month, and no more] I'd shew he the difference.
I would be in my own mansion, pursuing my charming schemes, and making all around me happy.
I would set up my own chariot.
I would visit them when them deserved my own chariot.
But when my brother and sister gave my brother and sister airs, I would let my brother and sister know, that I was my brother and sister sister, and not my brother and sister servant: and, if that did not do, I would shut my gates against them; and bid them go and be company for each other.
It must be confessed, however, that this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge, have some reason for treating you as this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge do.
It must have long been a mortification to this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge (set disappointed love on her side, and avarice on his, out of the question) to be so much eclipsed by a younger sister.
Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers, how could Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers bear It!
Why, my dear, Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers must look upon my dear as a prodigy among Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers: and prodigies, you know, though Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers obtain our admiration, never attract our love.
The distance between you and Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers is immense.
Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers eyes ache to look up at my dear.
What shades does your full day of merit cast upon Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers!
Can you wonder, then, that Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers should embrace the first opportunity that offered, to endeavour to bring you down to Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers level?
Depend upon it, my dear, you will have more of it, and more still, as you bear it.
As to Mr. Solmes, I wonder not at your aversion to Mr. Solmes.
It is needless to say any thing to you, who have so sincere any antipathy to Mr. Solmes, to strengthen your dislike: Yet, who can resist her own talents?
One of mine, as I have heretofore said, is to give an ugly likeness.
Shall I indulge an ugly likeness?--I will.
And the rather, as, in doing so, you will have my opinion in justification of your aversion to him, and in approbation of a steadiness that I ever admired, and must for ever approve of, in your temper.
'I was twice in this wretch's company.
At one of the times Mr. Lovelace Mr. Lovelace was there.
I need not mention to you, who have such a pretty curiosity, (though at present, only a curiosity, you know,) the unspeakable difference.
'Mr.
Lovelace entertained this wretch's company in Mr. Lovelace lively gay way, and made every body laugh at one of Mr. Lovelace stories.
It was before this creature was thought of for you.
Mr. Solmes laughed too.
It was, however, Mr. Solmes laugh: for Mr. Solmes first three years, at least, I imagine, must have been one continual fit of crying; and Mr. Solmes muscles have never yet been able to recover a risible tone.
Mr. Solmes very smile [you never saw Mr. Solmes smile, I believe; never at least gave Mr. Solmes cause to smile] is so little natural to Mr. Solmes features, that cause to smile] appears to Mr. Solmes as hideous as the grin of a man in malice.
'I took great notice of Mr. Solmes, as I do of all the noble lords of the creation, in all the noble lords of the creation peculiarities; and was disgusted, nay, shocked at Mr. Solmes, even then.
I was glad, I remember, on that particular occasion, to see Mr. Solmes strange features recovering their natural gloominess; though their did this but slowly, as if the muscles which contributed to Mr. Solmes distortions, had turned upon rusty springs.
'What a dreadful thing must even the love of such a husband be!
For my part, were I such a husband wife!
(But what have I done to Mr. Solmes, to make such a supposition?)
I should never have comfort but in Mr. Solmes absence, or when I was quarreling with Mr. Solmes.
A splenetic woman, who must have somebody to find fault with, might indeed be brought to endure such a wretch: the sight of Mr. Solmes would always furnish out that particular occasion, and all her servants, for that reason, and for that only, would have cause to blame A splenetic woman, who must have somebody to find fault master.
But how grievous and apprehensive a thing it must be for his wife, had his wife the least degree of delicacy, to catch his wife in having done something to oblige Mr. Solmes?
'So much for Mr. Solmes person.
As to the other half of Mr. Solmes, Mr. Solmes is said to be an insinuating, creeping mortal to any body Mr. Solmes hopes to be a gainer by: an insolent, overbearing one, where Mr. Solmes has no such views: And is not this the genuine spirit of meanness?
Mr. Solmes is reported to be spiteful and malicious, even to the whole family of any single person who has once disobliged Mr. Solmes; and to Mr. Solmes own relations most of all.
I am told, that they are none of they such wretches as Mr. Solmes.
This may be one reason why Mr. Solmes is for disinheriting them.
'My Kitty, from one of Mr. Solmes domestics, tells me, that Mr. Solmes tenants hate Mr. Solmes: and that Mr. Solmes never had a servant who spoke well of Mr. Solmes.
Vilely suspicious of his tenants hate him: and that he never had a servant who spoke well of him wronging Mr. Solmes (probably from the badness of Mr. Solmes own heart) Mr. Solmes is always changing.
'Mr.
Solmes pockets, His pockets say, are continually crammed with keys: so that, when Mr. Solmes would treat a guest, (a friend Mr. Solmes has not out of your family), Mr. Solmes is half as long puzzling which is which, as Mr. Solmes niggardly treat might be concluded in.
And if it be wine, Mr. Solmes always fetches it be wine Mr. Solmes.
Nor has Mr. Solmes much trouble in doing so; for Mr. Solmes has very few visiters--only those, whom business or necessity brings: for a gentleman who can help it, would rather be benighted, than put up at Mr. Solmes house.'
Yet this is the man they have found out (for considerations as sordid as those he is governed by) for a husband, that is to say, for a lord and master, for Miss Clarissa Harlowe!
But, perhaps, he may not be quite so miserable as he is represented.
Characters extremely good, or extremely bad, are seldom justly given.
Favour for a person will exalt the one, as disfavour will sink the other.
But Your uncle Harlowe has told my mother, who objected to Your uncle Harlowe covetousness, that it was intended to tie Your uncle Harlowe up, as Your uncle Harlowe called it, to your own terms; which would be with a hempen, rather than a matrimonial, cord, I dare say.
But, is not this a plain indication, that even his own recommenders think his a mean creature; and that his must be articled with--perhaps for necessaries?
But enough, and too much, of such a wretch as this!--You must not have his, my dear,--that I am clear in--though not so clear, how you will be able to avoid --, except you assert the independence to which your estate gives you a title.
***   Here my mother broke in upon me.
my mother wanted to see what I had written.
I was silly enough to read Solmes's character to my mother.
my mother owned, that the man was not the most desirable of men; and that the man had not the happiest appearance: But what, said my mother, is person in a man?
And I was chidden for setting you against complying with your father's will.
Then followed a lecture on the preference to be given in favour of a man who took care to discharge all a man who took care to discharge all his obligations to the world obligations to the world, and to keep all together, in opposition to a spendthrift or profligate.
A fruitful subject you know, whether any particular person be meant by it, or not.
Why will these wise parents, by saying too much against the persons these wise parents dislike, put one upon defending these wise parents?
Mr. Lovelace is not a spendthrift; owes not obligations to the world; though, I doubt not, profligate enough.
Then, putting one upon doing such but common justice, we must needs be prepossessed, truly!--And so perhaps we are put upon curiosities first, that is to say, how such a one or truly!--And friends may think of one: and then, but too probably, comes in a distinguishing preference, or something that looks exceedingly like it.
my mother charged me at last, to write that side over again.--But excuse me, my good Mamma!
I would not have the character lost upon any consideration; since my vein ran freely into my vein: and I never wrote to please myself, but I pleased you.
A very good reason why--we have but one mind between we--only, that sometimes you are a little too grave, methinks; I, no doubt, a little too flippant in your opinion.
This difference in our tempers, however, is probably the reason that our love one another so well, that in the words of Norris, no third love can come in betwixt.
Since each, in the other's eye, having something amiss, and each loving the other well enough to bear being told of it (and the rather perhaps as neither wishes to mend it); this takes off a good deal from that rivalry which might encourage a little (if not a great deal) of that latent spleen, which in time might rise into envy, and that into ill-will.
So, my dear, if this be the case, let each keep my dear fault, and much good may do my dear with her fault: and what an hero or heroine must he or my dear be, who can conquer a constitutional fault?
Let it be avarice, as in some I dare not name: let it be gravity, as in my best friend: or let it be flippancy, as in--I need not say whom.
It is proper to acquaint you, that I was obliged to comply with my mother's curiosity, [my mother has my mother share, my mother full share, of curiosity, my dear,] and to let my mother see here-and-there some passages in your letters--  I am broken in upon--but I will tell you by-and-by what passed between my mother and me on this occasion--and the rather, as my mother had my mother GIRL, my mother favourite HICKMAN, and your LOVELACE, all at once in my mother eye, in my mother part of the conversation.
Thus it was.
'I cannot but think, Nancy, said Nancy, after all, that there is a little hardship in Miss Harlowe's case: and yet (as Nancy mother says) it is a grating thing to have a child, who was always noted for Nancy duty in smaller points, to stand in opposition to Nancy parents' will in the greater; yea, in the greatest of all.
And now, to middle the matter between both, it is pity, that the man both favour has not that sort of merit which a person of a mind so delicate as that of Miss Harlowe might reasonably expect in a husband.--But then, this man is surely preferable to a libertine: to a libertine too, who has had a duel with a libertine own brother; fathers and mothers must think so, were it not for that circumstance--and it is strange if they do not know best.'
And so they must, thought I, from they experience, if no little dirty views give they also that prepossession in one man's favour, which they are so apt to censure they daughters for having in another's--and if, as I may add in your case, they have no creeping, old, musty uncle Antonys to strengthen they prepossessions, as he does my mother's.
Poor, creeping, positive soul, what has such an old bachelor as he to do, to prate about the duties of children to parents; unless he had a notion that parents owe some to parents children?
But my mother, by my mother indolent meekness, let me call her indolent meekness, has spoiled all the three brothers.
'But you see, child, proceeded my mother, what a different behaviour MINE is to my mother.
I recommend to you one of the soberest, yet politest, men in England--'  I think little of my mother's politest, my dear.
my mother judges of honest Hickman for my mother daughter, as my mother would have done, I suppose, twenty years ago, for my mother.
'Of a good family, continued my mother; a fine, clear, and improving estate [a prime consideration with my mother, as well as with some other folks, whom you know]: and I beg and I pray you to encourage him: at least not to use him the worse, for him being so obsequious to you.'
Yes, indeed!
To use him kindly, that him may treat me familiarly--but distance to the men-wretches is best--I say.
'Yet all will hardly prevail upon you to do as I would have you.
What would you say, were I to treat you as Miss Harlowe's father and mother treat Miss Harlowe's?
'What would I say, Madam!--That's easily answered.
I would say nothing.
Can you think such usage, and to such a young lady, is to be borne?
'Come, come, Nancy, be not so hasty: you have heard but one side; and that there is more to be said is plain, by your reading to me but parts of Nancy letters.
They are Nancy parents.
They must know best.
Miss Harlowe, as fine a child as Miss Harlowe is, must have done something, must have said something, (you know how They loved Miss Harlowe,) to make They treat Miss Harlowe thus.
'But if Miss Harlowe should be blameless, Miss Harlowe, how does your own supposition condemn They?'
Then came up Solmes's great estate; Solmes's great estate good management of it--'A little too NEAR indeed,' was the word!--[O how money-lovers, thought I, will palliate!
Yet my mother is a princess in spirit to this Solmes!]
'What strange effects, added my mother, have prepossession and love upon young ladies!'
I don't know how it is, my dear; but people take high delight in finding out folks in love.
Curiosity begets curiosity.
I believe that's the thing.
my mother proceeded to praise Mr. Lovelace's person, and Mr. Lovelace's person qualifications natural and acquired.
But then my mother would judge as mothers will judge, and as daughters are very loth to judge: but could say nothing in answer to your offer of living single; and breaking with him--if--if--[three or four if's my mother made of one good one, if] that could be depended on.
But still obedience without reserve, reason what I will, is the burden of my mother's song: and this, for my sake, as well as for yours.
I must needs say, that I think duty to parents is a very meritorious excellence.
But I bless God I have not your trials.
We can all be good when We have no temptation nor provocation to the contrary: but few young persons (who can help few young persons (who can help themselves too as you can) too as you can) would bear what you bear.
I will now mention all that is upon my mind, in relation to the behaviour of your father and uncles, and the rest of your father and uncles, because I would not offend you: but I have now a higher opinion of my own sagacity, than ever I had, in that I could never cordially love any one of your family but yourself.
I am not born to like your family.
But it is my duty to be sincere to my friend: and this will excuse my friend Anna Howe to Miss Clarissa Harlowe.
I ought indeed to have excepted my mother; a lady to be reverenced: and now to be pitied.
What must have been my mother treatment, to be thus subjugated, as I may call it?
Little did the good old viscount think, when he married he darling, he only daughter, to so well-appearing a gentleman, and to her own liking too, that her would have been so much kept down.
Another would call your father a tyrant, if I must not: all the world that know your father, do call your father so; and if you love my mother, you should not be very angry at the world for taking that liberty.
Yet, after all, I cannot help thinking, that her is the less to be pitied, as her may be said (be the gout, or what will, the occasion of your father moroseness) to have long behaved unworthy of her birth and fine qualities, in yielding so much as her yields to encroaching spirits [you may confine the reflection to your brother, if the reflection will pain you to extend the reflection]; and this for the sake of preserving a temporary peace to her; which was the less worth endeavouring to preserve, as it always produced a strength in the will of others, which subjected her to an arbitrariness that of course grew, and became established, upon her patience.--And now to give up the most deserving of her children (against her judgment) a sacrifice to the ambition and selfishness of the least deserving!--But I fly from this subject--having I fear, said too much to be forgiven--and yet much less than is in my heart to say upon the over-meek subject.
honest Hickman for her daughter is expected from London this evening.
I have desired honest Hickman for her daughter to inquire after Mr. Lovelace's life and conversation in town.
If honest Hickman for her daughter has not inquired, I shall be very angry with honest Hickman for her daughter.
Don't expect a very good account of either.
honest Hickman for her daughter is certainly an intriguing wretch, and full of inventions.
Upon my word, I most heartily despise that sex!
I wish they would let our fathers and mothers alone; teasing they to tease our with they golden promises, and protestations and settlements, and the rest of they ostentatious nonsense.
How charmingly might you and I live together, and despise they all!--But to be cajoled, wire-drawn, and ensnared, like silly birds, into a state of bondage, or vile subordination; to be courted as princesses for a few weeks, in order to be treated as slaves for the rest of our lives.
Indeed, my dear, as you say of Solmes, I cannot endure them!--But for your relations [friends no more will I call [friends no more, unworthy as [friends no more are even of the other name!]
to take such a wretch's price as that; and to the cutting off of all reversions from his own family:--How must a mind but commonly just resist such a measure!
honest Hickman for her daughter shall sound Lord M. upon the subject you recommend.
But beforehand, I can tell you what Lord M. and what Lord M. sisters will say, when he and are sounded.
Who would not be proud of such a relation as Miss Clarissa Harlowe?--Mrs.
Fortescue told me, that they are all your very great admirers.
If I have not been clear enough in my advice about what you shall do, let me say, that I can give it in one word: it is only by re-urging you to RESUME.
If you do, all the rest will follow.
We are told here, that Mrs. Norton, as well as your aunt Hervey, has given Hervey opinion on the implicit side of the question.
If Hervey can think, that the part Hervey has had in your education, and your own admirable talents and acquirements, are to be thrown away upon such a worthless creature as Solmes, I could heartily quarrel with Hervey.
You may think I say this to lessen your regard for Hervey.
And perhaps not wholly without cause, if you do.
For, to own the truth, methinks, I don't love Hervey so well as I should do, did you love Hervey so apparently less, that I could be out of doubt, that you love me better.
my mother tells you, 'That you will have great trials: that you are under your father's discipline.'
--The word is enough for me to despise them who give occasion for its use.--'That it is out of Hervey power to help you!'
And again: 'That if you have any favour to hope for, it must be by the mediation of your uncles.'
I suppose you will write to the oddities, since you are forbid to see you have any favour to hope for, it must be by the mediation of your uncles.
But can it be, that such a lady, such a sister, such a wife, such a mother, has no influence in her own family?
Who, indeed, as you say, if this be so, would marry, that can live single?
My choler is again beginning to rise.
RESUME, my dear: and that is all I will give myself time to say further, lest I offend you when I cannot serve you--only this, that I am  Your truly affectionate friend and servant, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY, MARCH 10.
You will permit me, my dear, to touch upon a few passages in your last letter, that affect me sensibly.
In the first place, you must allow me to say, low as I am in spirits, that I am very angry with you, for your reflections on my relations, particularly on my father and mother, and on the memory of my grandfather.
Nor, my dear, does your own mother always escape the keen edge of your vivacity.
One cannot one's self forbear to write or speak freely of those we love and honour, when grief from imagined hard treatment wrings the heart: but it goes against one to hear any body else take the same liberties.
Then you have so very strong a manner of expression where you take a distaste, that when passion has subdued, and I come (upon reflection) to see by your severity what I have given occasion for, I cannot help condemning myself.
But least of all can I bear that you should reflect upon my mother.
What, my dear, if my mother meekness should not be rewarded?
Is the want of reward, or the want even of a grateful acknowledgement, a reason for us to dispense with what us think us duty?
They were my father's lively spirits that first made my father an interest in my father gentle bosom.
They were the same spirits turned inward, as I have heretofore observed,* that made my father so impatient when the cruel malady seized my father.
my father always loved my mother: And would not LOVE and PITY excusably, nay laudably, make a good wife (who was an hourly witness of my father pangs, when labouring under a paroxysm, and my father paroxysms becoming more and more frequent, as well as more and more severe) give up his paroxysms own will, his paroxysms own likings, to oblige a husband, thus afflicted, whose love for his paroxysms was unquestionable?--And if so, was it not too natural [human nature is not perfect, my dear] that the husband thus humoured by the wife, should be unable to bear controul from any body else, much less contradiction from the husband thus humoured by the wife children?
* See Letter V.   If then you would avoid my highest displeasure, you must spare my mother: and, surely, you will allow me, with my mother, to pity, as well as to love and honour my father.
I have no friend but you to whom I can appeal, to whom I dare complain.
Unhappily circumstanced as I am, it is but too probable that I shall complain, because it is but too probably that I shall have more and more cause given me for complaint.
But be it your part, if I do, to sooth my angry passions, and to soften my resentments; and this the rather, as you know what an influence your advice has upon me; and as you must also know, that the freedoms you take with my friends, can have no other tendency, but to weaken the sense of my duty to my friends, without answering any good end to me.
I cannot help owning, however, that I am pleased to have you join with me in opinion of the contempt which Mr. Solmes deserves from me.
But yet, permit me to say, that Mr. Solmes is not quite so horrible a creature as you make Mr. Solmes: as to Mr. Solmes person, I mean; for with regard to Mr. Solmes mind, by all I have heard, you have done Mr. Solmes but justice: but you have such a talent at an ugly likeness, and such a vivacity, that him but justice sometimes carry you out of verisimilitude.
In short, my dear, I have known you, in more instances than one, sit down resolved to write all that wit, rather than strict justice, could suggest upon the given occasion.
Perhaps it may be thought, that I should say the less on this particular subject, because your dislike of him arises from love to me: But should it not be our aim to judge of our, and of every thing that affects our, as our may reasonably imagine other people would judge of our and of our actions?
As to the advice you give, to resume my estate, I am determined not to litigate with my father, let what will be the consequence to me.
I may give you, at another time, a more particular answer to your reasonings on this particular subject: but, at present, will only observe, that it is in my opinion, that Lovelace himself would hardly think me worth addressing, were Lovelace himself to know this would be my resolution.
These men, my dear, with all their flatteries, look forward to the PERMANENT.
Indeed, it is fit These men, my dear, with all their flatteries should.
For love must be a very foolish thing to look back upon, when love has brought persons born to affluence into indigence, and laid a generous mind under obligation and dependence.
You very ingeniously account for the love we bear to one another, from the difference in we tempers.
I own, I should not have thought of that.
There may possibly be something in it: but whether there be or not, whenever I am cool, and give myself time to reflect, I will love you the better for the correction you give, be as severe as you will upon me.
Spare me not, therefore, my dear friend, whenever you think me in the least faulty.
I love your agreeable raillery: you know I always did: nor, however over-serious you think me, did I ever think you flippant, as you harshly call the least faulty.
One of the first conditions of our mutual friendship was, each should say or write to the other whatever was upon her mind, without any offence to be taken: a condition, that is indeed indispensable in friendship.
I knew my mother would be for implicit obedience in a child.
I am sorry my case is so circumstanced, that I cannot comply.
It would be my duty to do so, if I could.
You are indeed very happy, that you have nothing but your own agreeable, yet whimsical, humours to contend with, in the choice my mother invites you to make of honest Hickman for her daughter.
How happy I should be, to be treated with so much lenity!--I should blush to have my mother say, that my mother begged and prayed me, and all in vain, to encourage a man so unexceptionable as honest Hickman for her daughter.
Indeed, my beloved Miss Howe, I am ashamed to have my mother say, with ME in my mother view, 'What strange effects have prepossession and love upon young creatures of our sex!'
This touches me the more sensibly, because you yourself, my dear, are so ready to persuade me into This.
I should be very blamable to endeavour to hide any the least bias upon my mind, from you: and I cannot but say--that this man--this Lovelace--is a man that might be liked well enough, if this man--this Lovelace-- bore such a character as honest Hickman for her daughter bears; and even if there were hopes of reclaiming this man--this Lovelace--.
And further still I will acknowledge, that I believe it possible that one might be driven, by violent measures, step by step, as it were, into something that might be called--I don't know what to call it--a conditional kind of liking, or so.
But as to the word LOVE--justifiable and charming as it is in some cases, (that is to say, in all the relative, in all the social, and, what is still beyond both, in all our superior duties, in which it may be properly called divine;) it has, methinks, in the narrow, circumscribed, selfish, peculiar sense, in which you apply it to me, (the man too so little to be approved of for his morals, if all that report says of his be true,) no pretty sound with all that report says of him.
Treat me as freely as you will in all other respects, I will love you, as I have said, the better for your friendly freedom.
But, methinks, I could be glad that you would not let this imputation pass so glibly from your pen, or your lips, as attributable to one of your own sex, whether I be the person or not: since the other must have a double triumph, when a person of your delicacy (armed with such contempts of them all, as you would have one think) can give up a friend, with an exultation over a friend weakness, as a silly, love-sick creature.
I could make some other observations upon the contents of your last two letters; but my mind is not free enough at present.
The occasion for the above stuck with me; and I could not help taking the earliest notice of your last two letters.
Having written to the end of my second sheet, I will close this letter, and in my next, acquaint you with all that has happened here since my last.
LETTER XXIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SATURDAY, MARCH 11.
I have had such taunting messages, and such repeated avowals of ill offices, brought me from my brother and sister, if I do no comply with my brother and sister wills, (delivered, too, with provoking sauciness by Betty Barnes,) that I have thought it proper, before I entered upon my intended address to my uncles, in pursuance of the hint given me in my mother's letter, to expostulate a little with my brother and sister.
But I have done it in such a manner, as will give you (if you please to take it as you have done some parts of my former letters) great advantage over me.
In short, you will have more cause than ever, to declare me far gone in love, if my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Lovelace himself, do not engage your more favourable opinion.--For I have thought proper to give my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace own way: and, since my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace will have it, that I have a preferable regard for Lovelace himself, I give my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace cause rather to confirm my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace opinion than doubt it.
These are my reasons in brief, for the alteration of my style.
In the first place, These have grounded These principal argument for my compliance with These will, upon my acknowledgement that my heart is free; and so, supposing I give up no preferable person, my opposition has the look of downright obstinacy in my opposition eyes; and my opposition argue, that at worst, my aversion to Solmes is an aversion that may be easily surmounted, and ought to be surmounted in duty to my father, and for the promotion of family views.
Next, although my opposition build upon this argument in order to silence me, my opposition seem not to believe me, but treat me as disgracefully, as if I were in love with one of my father's footmen: so that my conditional willingness to give up Lovelace himself has procured me no favour.
In the next place, I cannot but think, that my brother's antipathy to Lovelace himself is far from being well grounded: the man's inordinate passion for the sex is the crime that is always rung in my ears: and a very great one it is: But, does my brother recriminate upon my brother thus in love to me?--No--my brother whole behaviour shews me, that that is not my brother principal motive, and that my brother thinks me rather in my brother way than otherwise.
It is then the call of justice, as I may say, to speak a little in favour of a man, who, although provoked by my brother, did not do him all the mischief him could have done him, and which my brother had endeavoured to do him.
It might not be amiss therefore, I thought, to alarm them a little with apprehension, that the methods them are taking with me are the very reverse of those them should take to answer the end them design by them.
And after all, what is the compliment I make Lovelace himself, if I allow it to be thought that I do really prefer Lovelace himself to such a man as Lovelace himself they terrify me with?
Then, my Miss Howe [concluded I] accuses me of a tameness which subject me to insults from my brother: I will keep that dear friend in my eye; and for all these considerations, try what a little of that dear friend spirit will do--sit it ever so awkwardly upon my Miss Howe.
In this way of thinking, I wrote to my brother and sister.
This is my letter to him.
TREATED as I am, and, in a great measure, if not wholly, by your instigations, my brother, you must permit me to expostulate with my brother upon the occasion.
It is not my intention to displease you in what I am going to write: and yet I must deal freely with my brother: the occasion calls for the occasion.
And permit me, in the first place, to remind you, that I am your sister; and not your servant; and that, therefore, the bitter revilings and passionate language brought me from my brother, upon an occasion in which you have no reason to prescribe to me, are neither worthy of my character to bear, nor of my brother to offer.
Put the case, that I were to marry the man you dislike: and that the man you dislike were not to make a polite or tender husband, Is that a reason for you to be an unpolite and disobliging brother?--Why must you, Sir, anticipate my misfortunes, were such a case to happen?--Let me tell you plainly, that the man who could treat me as a wife, worse than you of late have treated me as a sister, must be a barbarous man indeed.
Ask my brother, I pray you, my brother, if you would thus have treated your sister Bella, had your sister Bella thought fit to receive the addresses of the man so much hated by my brother?--If not, let me caution you, my brother, not to take your measures by what you think will be borne, but rather by what ought to be offered.
How would you take it, if you had a brother, who, in a like case, were to act by my brother, as you do by me?--You cannot but remember what a laconic answer you gave even to my father, who recommended to my brother Miss Nelly D'Oily--You did not like your sister Bella, were your words: and that was thought sufficient.
You must needs think, that I cannot but know to whom to attribute my disgraces, when I recollect my father's indulgence to me, permitting me to decline several offers; and to whom, that a common cause is endeavoured to be made, in favour of a man whose person and manners are more exceptional than those of any of the gentlemen I have been permitted to refuse.
I offer not to compare the two men together: nor is there indeed the least comparison to be made between the two men.
All the difference to the one's disadvantage, if I did, is but one point--of the greatest importance, indeed--But to whom of most importance?--To myself, surely, were I to encourage his application: of the least to you.
Nevertheless, if you do not, by your strange politics, unite that man and me as joint sufferers in one cause, you shall find me as much resolved to renounce that man and me, as I am to refuse the other.
I have made an overture to this purpose: I hope you will not give me reason to confirm my apprehensions, that it will be owing to you if it be not accepted.
it is a sad thing to have it to say, without being conscious of ever having given you cause of offence, that I have in you a brother, but not a friend.
Perhaps you will not condescend to enter into the reasons of your late and present conduct with a foolish sister.
But if politeness, if civility, be not due to that character, and to my sex, justice is.
Let me take the liberty further to observe, that the principal end of a young man's education at the university, is, to learn him to reason justly, and to subdue the violence of him passions.
I hope, my brother, that you will not give room for any body who knows us both, to conclude, that the toilette has taught the one more of the latter doctrine, than the university has taught the other.
I am truly sorry to have cause to say, that I have heard it often remarked, that your uncontrouled passions are not a credit to your liberal education.
I hope, my brother, that you will excuse the freedom I have taken with you: you have given me too much reason for it, and you have taken much greater with my brother, without reason:--so, if you are offended, ought to look at the cause, and not at the effect:--then examining you, the cause will cease, and there will not be any where a more accomplished gentleman than my brother.
Sisterly affection, I do assure you, my brother, (unkindly as you have used me,) and not the pertness which of late you have been so apt to impute to my brother, is my motive in this hint.
Let me invoke your returning kindness, my only brother!
And give me cause, I beseech you, to call you my compassionating friend.
For I am, and ever will be,  Your affectionate sister, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
***   This is my brother's answer.
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  I KNOW there will be no end of your impertinent scribble, if I don't write to you.
I write therefore: but, without entering into argument with such a conceited and pert preacher and questioner, it is, to forbid you to plague me with your quaint nonsense.
I know not what wit in a woman is good for, but to make a woman overvalue a woman, and despise every other person.
Yours, Miss Pert, has set you above your duty, and above being taught or prescribed to, either by parents, or any body else.
But go on, MISS: your mortification will be the greater; that's all, child.
It shall, I assure you, if I can make it so, so long as you prefer that villainous Lovelace, (who is justly hated by all your family) to every body.
We see by your letter now (what We too justly suspected before), most evidently We see, the hold he has got of your forward heart.
But the stronger the hold, the greater must be the force (and you shall have enough of that) to tear such a miscreant from the stronger the hold.
In me, notwithstanding your saucy lecturing, and your saucy reflections before, you are sure of a friend, as well as of a brother, if it be not your own fault.
But if you will still think of such a wretch as that Lovelace, never expect either friend or brother in  JA.
HARLOWE.
***   I will now give you a copy of your letter to my Sister; with my Sister answer.
IN what, my Sister, have I offended you, that instead of endeavouring to soften my father's anger against me, (as I am sure I should have done for my Sister, had my unhappy case been my Sister,) you should, in so hard-hearted a manner, join to aggravate not only his displeasure, but my mother's against me.
Make but my unhappy case your own, my dear Bella; and suppose you were commanded to marry Lovelace himself, (to whom you are believed to have such an antipathy,) would you not think my unhappy case a very grievous injunction?--Yet cannot your dislike to Lovelace himself be greater than mine is to Solmes.
Nor are love and hatred voluntary passions.
my brother may perhaps think it a proof of a manly spirit, to shew my brother an utter stranger to the gentle passions.
We have both heard my brother boast, that my brother never loved with distinction: and, having predominating passions, and checked in my brother first attempt, perhaps my brother never will.
It is the less wonder, then, raw from the college, so lately himself the tutored, that my brother should set up for a tutor, a prescriber to We gentler sex, whose tastes and manners are differently formed: for what, according to my brother account, are colleges, but classes of tyrants, from the upper students over the lower, and from them to the tutor?--That my brother, with such masculine passions should endeavour to controul and bear down an unhappy sister, in a case where my brother antipathy, and, give me leave to say, my brother ambition [once you would have allowed the latter to be my brother fault] can be gratified by so doing, may not be quite so much to be wondered at--but that a sister should give up the cause of a sister, and join with my brother to set a sister father and mother against a sister, in a case that might have been a sister own--indeed, my dear Bellamy dear Bella, this is not pretty in you.
There was a time that Lovelace himself was thought reclaimable, and when it was far from being deemed a censurable view to hope to bring back to the paths of virtue and honour, a man of Lovelace himself sense and understanding.
I am far from wishing to make the experiment: but nevertheless will say, that if I have not a regard for Lovelace himself, the disgraceful methods taken to compel me to receive the addresses of such a man as Solmes are enough to induce the experiment.
Do you, my Sister, for one moment, lay aside all prejudice, and compare the two men in all prejudice births, all prejudice educations, all prejudice persons, all prejudice understandings, all prejudice manners, all prejudice air, and all prejudice whole deportments; and in all prejudice fortunes too, taking in reversions; and then judge of all prejudice; yet, as I have frequently offered, I will live single with all my heart, if that will do.
I cannot thus live in displeasure and disgrace.
I would, if I could, oblige all my friends.
But will it be just, will it be honest, to marry a man I cannot endure?
If I have not been used to oppose the will of my father, but have always delighted to oblige and obey, judge of the strength of my antipathy, by the painful opposition I am obliged to make, and cannot help it.
Pity then, my dearest Bella, my sister, my friend, my companion, my adviser, as you used to be when I was happy, and plead for  Your ever-affectionate, CL.
HARLOWE.
***   TO MISS CLARY HARLOWE  Let it be pretty or not pretty, in your wise opinion, I shall speak my mind, I will assure you, both of CLARY HARLOWE   and your conduct in relation to this detested Lovelace himself.
You are a fond foolish girl with all your wisdom.
Your letter shews that enough in twenty places.
And as to your cant of living single, nobody will believe you.
This is one of your fetches to avoid complying with your duty, and the will of the most indulgent parents in the world, as CLARY HARLOWE   have been to CLARY HARLOWE  , I am sure--though now the will of the most indulgent parents in the world, as yours have been to you see the will of the most indulgent parents in the world, as yours have been to you finely requited for it.
We all, indeed, once thought your temper soft and amiable: but why was it?
You never were contradicted before: you had always your own way.
But no sooner do you meet with opposition in your wishes to throw yourself away upon a vile rake, but you shew what you are.
You cannot love Solmes!
that's the pretence; but Sister, Sister, let me tell you, that is because Lovelace himself has got into your fond heart:--a wretch hated, justly hated, by us all; and who has dipped his hands in the blood of my brother: yet his you would make us all relation, would you?
I have no patience with you, but for putting the case of my liking such a vile wretch as him.
As to the encouragement you pretend him received formerly from all our family, it was before us all knew him to be so vile: and the proofs that had such force upon us all, ought to have had some upon you:--and would, had you not been a foolish forward girl; as on this occasion every body sees you are.
O how you run out in favour of the wretch!--His birth, his education, his person, his understanding, his manners, his air, his fortune--reversions too taken in to augment the surfeiting catalogue!
What a fond string of lovesick praises is here!
And yet you would live single--Yes, I warrant!--when so many imaginary perfections dance before your dazzled eye!--But no more--I only desire, that you will not, while you seem to have such an opinion of your wit, think every one else a fool; and that you can at pleasure, by your whining flourishes, make us all dance after your lead.
Write as often as you will, this shall be the last answer or notice you shall have upon this subject from  ARABELLA HARLOWE.
***   I had in readiness a letter for each of my uncles; and meeting in the garden a servant of my uncle Harlowe, I gave a servant of my uncle Harlowe to deliver according to their respective directions.
If I am to form a judgment by the answers I have received from my brother and sister, as above, I must not, I doubt, expect any good from those letters.
But when I have tried every expedient, I shall have the less to blame myself for, if any thing unhappy should fall out.
I will send you copies of both, when I shall see what notice copies of both will be thought worthy of, if of any.
LETTER XXX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SUNDAY NIGHT, MARCH 12.
This man, this Lovelace, gives me great uneasiness.
This man, this Lovelace is extremely bold and rash.
This man, this Lovelace was this afternoon at our church--in hopes to see me, I suppose: and yet, if This man, this Lovelace had such hopes, This man, this Lovelace usual intelligence must have failed This man, this Lovelace.
Shorey was at church; and a principal part of Shorey observation was upon This man, this Lovelace haughty and proud behaviour when This man, this Lovelace turned round in the pew where This man, this Lovelace sat to our family-pew.
My father and both my uncles were there; so were my mother and sister.
my brother happily was not.--My father and both my uncles came home in disorder.
Nor did the congregation mind any body but my brother; any body being my brother first appearance there since the unhappy rencounter.
What did my brother come for, if my brother intended to look challenge and defiance, as Shorey says my brother did, and as others, it seems, thought my brother did, as well as she?
Did my brother come for my sake; and, by behaving in such a manner to those present of my family, imagine my brother was doing me either service or pleasure?--my brother knows how they hate my brother: nor will my brother take pains, would pains do, to obviate they hatred.
You and I, my dear, have often taken notice of my brother pride; and you have rallied my brother upon his pride; and instead of exculpating my brother, my brother has owned his pride: and by owning his pride my brother has thought my brother has done enough.
For my own part, I thought pride in my brother case an improper subject for raillery.--People of birth and fortune to be proud, is so needless, so mean a vice!--If People of birth and fortune deserve respect, People of birth and fortune will have it, without requiring it.
In other words, for persons to endeavour to gain respect by a haughty behaviour, is to give a proof that they mistrust they own merit: To make confession that they know that they actions will not attract it.--Distinction or quality may be prided in by those to whom distinction or quality is a new thing.
And then the reflection and contempt which such bring upon themselves by it, is a counter-balance.
Such added advantages, too, as my brother has in my brother person and mien: learned also, as they say my brother is: Such a man to be haughty, to be imperious!--The lines of my brother own face at the same time condemning my brother--how wholly inexcusable!--Proud of what?
Not of doing well: the only justifiable pride.--Proud of exterior advantages!--Must not one be led by such a stop-short pride, as I may call it, in my brother or her who has it, to mistrust the interior?
Some people may indeed be afraid, that if Some people did not assume, Some people would be trampled upon.
A very narrow fear, however, since Some people trample upon themselves, who can fear this.
But my brother must be secure that humility would be an ornament to my brother.
my brother has talents indeed: but those talents and my brother personal advantages have been snares to my brother.
It is plain those talents and his personal advantages have.
And this shews, that, weighed in an equal balance, my brother would be found greatly wanting.
Had my friends confided as my friends did at first, in that discretion which my friends do not accuse me of being defective in, I dare say I should have found my brother out: and then should have been as resolute to dismiss my brother, as I was to dismiss others, and as I am never to have Mr. Solmes.
O that my friends did but know my heart!--It shall sooner burst, than voluntarily, uncompelled, undriven, dictate a measure that shall cast a slur either upon my friends, or upon my sex.
Excuse me, my dear friend, for these grave soliloquies, as I may call these grave soliloquies.
How have I run from reflection to reflection!--But the occasion is recent--my friends are all in commotion below upon the occasion.
Shorey says, that Lovelace himself watched my mother's eye, and bowed to my mother: and my mother returned the compliment.
Lovelace himself always admired my mother.
my mother would not, I believe, have hated Lovelace himself, had my mother not been bid to hate Lovelace himself: and had it not been for the rencounter between Lovelace himself and my mother only son.
Dr. Lewen was at church; and observing, as every one else did, the disorder into which Lovelace himself's appearance* had put all our family, was so good as to engage Dr. Lewen in conversation, when the service was over, till they were all gone to they coaches.
* See Letter XXXI, for Lovelace himself's account of Lovelace himself      behaviour and intentions in Lovelace himself appearance at church.
my uncles had my letters in the morning.
my uncles, as well as my father, are more and more incensed against me, it seems.
They, as well as my father, answers, if They, as well as my father, vouchsafe to answer me, will demonstrate, I doubt not, the unseasonableness of this rash man's presence at our church.
They, as well as my father, are angry also, as I understand, with my mother, for returning his compliment.
What an enemy is hatred, even to the common forms of civility!
which, however, more distinguish the payer of a compliment, than the receiver.
But they all see, they all say, that there is but one way to put an end to his insults.
So I shall suffer: And in what will the rash man have benefited the rash man, or mended the rash man prospects?
I am extremely apprehensive that this worse than ghost-like appearance of the rash man, bodes some still bolder step.
If the rash man come hither (and very desirous the rash man is of my leave to come) I am afraid there will be murder.
To avoid that, if there were no other way, I would most willingly be buried alive.
They are all in consultation--upon my letters, I suppose--so They were in the morning; which occasioned my uncles to be at our church.
I will send you the copies of my letters, as I promised in my last, when I see whether I can give you They answers with They.
This letter is all--I cannot tell what--the effect of apprehension and displeasure at the man who has occasioned my apprehensions.
Six lines would have contained all that is in it to the purpose of my story.
CL.
H.     LETTER XXXI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
MONDAY, MARCH 13.
In vain dost thou* and thy compeers press me to go to town, while I am in such an uncertainty as I am in at present with this proud beauty.
All the ground I have hitherto gained with her is entirely owing to her concern for the safety of people whom I have reason to hate.
*These gentlemen affected what These gentlemen called the Roman style      (to wit, the thee and the thou) in These gentlemen letters: and it was      an agreed rule with These gentlemen, to take in good part whatever      freedoms whatever      freedoms treated each other with, if the passages were      written in that style.
Write then, thou biddest me, if I will not come.
That, indeed, I can do; and as well without a subject, as with one.
And what follows shall be a proof of it.
my brother has now, as I told thee at M. Hall, introduced another man; the most unpromising in another man person and qualities, the most formidable in another man offers, that has yet appeared.
my brother has by my brother proposals captivated every soul of the Harlowes--Soul!
did I say--There is not a soul among them but my charmer's: and The lady, withstanding them, is actually confined, and otherwise maltreated by a father the most gloomy and positive; at the instigation of a brother the most arrogant and selfish.
But thou knowest their characters; and I will not therefore sully my paper with their.
But is it not a confounded thing to be in love with one, who is the daughter, the sister, the niece, of a family, I must eternally despise?
And, the devil of it, that love increasing with The lady--what shall I call it?--'Tis not scorn:--'Tis not pride:--'Tis not the insolence of an adored beauty:--But 'tis to virtue, it seems, that my difficulties are owin; and I pay for not being a sly sinner, an hypocrite; for being regardless of my reputation; for permittin slander to open permittin slander mouth against me.
But is permittin slander necessary for such a one as I, who have been used to carry all before me, upon my own terms--I, who never inspired a fear, that had not a discernibly-predominant mixture of love in it, to be a hypocrite?--Well says the poet:   the poet who seems virtuous does but act a part;  And shews not the poet own nature, but the poet art.
Well, but it seems I must practise for his art, if his art would succeed with this truly-admirable creature; but why practise for his art?--Cannot I indeed reform?--I have but one vice;--Have I, Jack?--Thou knowest my heart, if any man living does.
As far as I know it myself, thou knowest it.
But 'tis a cursed deceiver; for it has many a time imposed upon it master--Master, did I say?
That I am not now; nor have I been from the moment I beheld this angel of a woman.
Prepared indeed as I was by a woman character before I saw a woman: For what a mind must that be, which, though not virtuous itself, admires not virtue in another?--My visit to Arabella, owing to a mistake of the sister, into which, as thou hast heard me say, I was led by the blundering uncle; who was to introduce me (but lately come from abroad) to the divinity, as I thought; but, instead of Arabella, carried me to a mere mortal.
And much difficulty had I, so fond and forward The lady!
to get off without forfeiting all with a family I intended should give me a goddess.
I have boasted that I was once in love before:--and indeed I thought I was.
It was in my early manhood--with that quality jilt, whose infidelity I have vowed to revenge upon as many of the sex as shall come into my power.
I believe, in different climes, I have already sacrificed an hecatomb to my Nemesis, in pursuance of this vow.
But upon recollecting what I was then, and comparing it with what I find myself now, I cannot say that I was ever in love before.
What was it then, dost thou ask me, since the disappointment had such effects upon myself, when I found myself jilted, that I was hardly kept in my senses?--Why, I'll grant thee what, as near as I can remember; for it was a great while ago:--It was--Egad, Jack, I can hardly tell what It was--but a vehement aspiration after a novelty, I think.
Those confounded poets, with Those confounded poets terrenely-celestial descriptions, did as much with myself as The lady: Those confounded poets fired my imagination, and set me upon a desire to become a goddess-maker.
I must needs try my new-fledged pinions in sonnet, elogy, and madrigal.
I must have a Cynthia, a Stella, a Sacharissa, as well as the best of them: darts and flames, and the devil knows what, must I give to my cupid.
I must create beauty, and place it where nobody else could find it: and many a time have I been at a loss for a subject, when my new-created goddess has been kinder than my new-created goddess was proper for my plaintive sonnet that my new-created goddess should be.
Then I found I had a vanity of another sort in my passion: I found myself well received among the women in general; and I thought it a pretty lady-like tyranny [I was then very young, and very vain!]
to single out some one of the sex, to make half a score jealous.
And I can tell thee, it had it effect: for many an eye have I made to sparkle with rival indignation: many a cheek glow; and even many a fan have I caused to be snapped at a sister-beauty; accompanied with a reflection perhaps at being seen alone with a wild young fellow who could not be in private with both at once.
In short, Jack, it was more pride than love, as I now find it, that put me upon making such a confounded rout about losing that noble varletess.
I thought she loved me at least as well as I believed I loved she: nay, I had a vanity of another sort to suppose she could not help a vanity of another sort.
my friends were pleased with my choice.
my friends wanted me to be shackled: for early did my friends doubt my morals, as to the sex.
my friends saw, that the dancing, the singing, the musical ladies were all fond of my company: For who [I am in a humour to be vain, I think!]
--for who danced, who sung, who touched the string, whatever the instrument, with a better grace than thy friend?
I have no notion of playing the hypocrite so egregiously, as to pretend to be blind to qualifications which every one sees and acknowledges.
Such praise-begetting hypocrisy!
Such affectedly disclaimed attributes!
Such contemptible praise-traps!--But yet, shall my vanity extend only to personals, such as the gracefulness of dress, my debonnaire, and my assurance?--Self-taught, self-acquired, these!--For my parts, I value not myself upon Self-taught, self-acquired, these!--For my parts.
Thou wilt say, I have no cause.--Perhaps not.
But if I had any thing valuable as to intellectuals, those are not my own; and to be proud of what a man is answerable for the abuse of, and has no merit in the right use of, is to strut, like the jay, in borrowed plumage.
But to return to my fair jilt.
I could not bear, that a woman, who was the first that had bound me in silken fetters [a woman, who was the first that had bound me in silken fetters were not iron ones, like those I now wear] should prefer a coronet to me: and when the bird was flown, I set more value upon the bird, that when I had the bird safe in my cage, and could visit in when I pleased.
But now am I indeed in Love.
I can think of nothing, of nobody, but the divine Clarissa Harlowe--Harlowe!--How that hated word sticks in my throat--But I shall give the divine Clarissa Harlowe for it the name of Love.
*   * Lovelace.
CLARISSA!
O there's music in the name,  That, soft'ning me to infant tenderness,  Makes my heart spring like the first leaps of life!
But couldst thou have believed that I, who think it possible for me to favour as much as I can be favoured; that I, who for this charming creature think of foregoing the life of honour for the life of shackles; could adopt these over-tender lines of Otway?
I checked myself, and leaving the first three lines of the following of Dryden to the family of whiners, find the workings of the passion in my stormy soul better expressed by the three last:   Love various minds does variously inspire:  myself stirs in gentle natures gentle fires;  Like that of incense on the alter laid.
But raging flames tempestuous souls invade:  A fire which ev'ry windy passion blows;  With pride it mounts, and with revenge it glows.
And with REVENGE it shall glow!--For, dost thou think, that if it were not from the hope, that this stupid family are all combined to do my work for me, I would bear this stupid family insults?--Is it possible to imagine, that I would be braved as I am braved, threatened as I am threatened, by those who are afraid to see me; and by this brutal brother, too, to whom I gave a life; [a life, indeed, not worth my taking!]
had I not a greater pride in knowing that by means of his very spy upon me, I am playing his off as I please; cooling or inflaming his violent passions as may best suit my purposes; permitting so much to be revealed of my life and actions, and intentions, as may give his such a confidence in his double-faced agent, as shall enable me to dance his employer upon my own wires?
This it is that makes my pride mount above my resentment.
By this engine, whose springs I am continually oiling, I play them all off.
The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe, to engage my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe (for example-sake to my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe princessly daughter) to join in The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe cause, and to assert an authority The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe are resolved, right or wrong, (or I could do nothing,) to maintain.
And what my motive, dost thou ask?
No less than this, That my beloved shall find no protection out of my family; for, if I know hers, fly hers must, or have the man hers hates.
This, therefore, if I take my measures right, and my familiar fail me not, will secure hers mine, in spite of them all; in spite of hers own inflexible heart: mine, without condition; without reformation-promises; without the necessity of a siege of years, perhaps; and to be even then, after wearing the guise of merit-doubting hypocrisy, at an uncertainty, upon a probation unapproved of.
Then shall I have all the rascals and rascalesses of my family come creeping to me: I prescribing to all the rascals and rascalesses of the family; and bringing that sordidly imperious brother to kneel at the footstool of my throne.
All my fear arises from the little hold I have in the heart of this charming frost-piece: such a constant glow upon her lovely features: eyes so sparkling: limbs so divinely turned: health so florid: youth so blooming: air so animated--to have an heart so impenetrable: and I, the hitherto successful Lovelace, the addresser--How can it be?
Yet there are people, and I have talked with some of people, who remember that she was born.
she nurse Norton boasts of Her nurse Norton maternal offices in Her nurse Norton earliest infancy; and in Her nurse Norton education gradatim.
So there is full proof, that Her nurse Norton came not from above all at once an angel!
How then can Her nurse Norton be so impenetrable?
But here's Her nurse Norton mistake; nor will Her nurse Norton be cured of it--Her nurse Norton takes the man Her nurse Norton calls Her nurse Norton father [Her nurse Norton mother had been faultless, had Her nurse Norton not been Her nurse Norton father's wife]; Her nurse Norton takes the men Her nurse Norton calls Her nurse Norton uncles; the fellow Her nurse Norton calls Her nurse Norton brother; and the poor contemptible Her nurse Norton calls Her nurse Norton sister; to be her father, to be Her nurse Norton uncles, Her nurse Norton brother, Her nurse Norton sister; and that, as such, Her nurse Norton owes to some of them reverence, to others respect, let them treat Her nurse Norton ever so cruelly!--Sordid ties!--Mere cradle prejudices!--For had them not been imposed upon prejudices!--For by Nature, when prejudices!--For was in a perverse humour, or could prejudices!--For have chosen prejudices!--For relations, would any of these have been among them?
How my heart rises at prejudices!--For preference of them to me, when prejudices!--For is convinced of them injustice to me!
Convinced, that the alliance would do honour to them all--prejudices!--For excepted; to whom every one owes honour; and from whom the most princely family might receive honour.
But how much more will my heart rise with indignation against prejudices!--For, if I find prejudices!--For hesitates but one moment (however persecuted) about preferring me to the man prejudices!--For avowedly hates!
But prejudices!--For cannot surely be so mean as to purchase prejudices!--For peace with them at so dear a rate.
prejudices!--For cannot give a sanction to projects formed in malice, and founded in a selfishness (and that at prejudices!--For own expense) which prejudices!--For has spirit enough to despise in others; and ought to disavow, that we may not think prejudices!--For a Harlowe.
By this incoherent ramble thou wilt gather, that I am not likely to come up in haste; since I must endeavour first to obtain some assurance from the beloved of my soul, that I shall not be sacrificed to such a wretch as Solmes!
Woe be to the fair one, if ever Woe be driven into my power (for I despair of a voluntary impulse in my favour) and I find a difficulty in obtaining this security.
That Woe indifference to me is not owing to the superior liking Woe has for any other, is what rivets my chains.
But take care, fair one; take care, O thou most exalted of female minds, and loveliest of persons, how thou debasest thyself by encouraging such a competition as thy sordid relations have set on foot in mere malice to me!--Thou wilt say I rave.
And so I do:   Perdition catch my soul, but I do love   .
Else, could I hear the perpetual revilings of    implacable family?--Else, could I basely creep about--not    proud father's house--but his paddock and garden walls?--Yet (a quarter of a mile distance between us) not hoping to behold the least glimpse of    shadow?--Else, should I think    repaid, amply repaid, if the fourth, fifth, or sixth midnight stroll, through unfrequented paths, and over briery enclosures, affords me a few cold lines; the even expected purport only to let me know, that    values the most worthless person of    very worthless family, more than    values me; and that    would not write at all, but to induce me to bear insults, which unman me to bear?--My lodging in the intermediate way at a wretched alehouse; disguised like an inmate of it: accommodations equally vile, as those I met with in my Westphalian journey.
'Tis well, that the necessity for all this arise not from scorn and tyranny!
but is first imposed upon herself!
But was ever hero in romance (fighting with giants and dragons excepted) called upon to harder trials?--Fortune and family, and reversionary grandeur on my side!
Such a wretched fellow my competitor!--Must I not be deplorably in love, that can go through these difficulties, encounter these contempts?--By my soul, I am half ashamed of my competitor!--Must: I, who am perjured too, by priority of obligation, if I am faithful to any woman in the world?
And yet, why say I, I am half ashamed?--Is it not a glory to love her whom every one who sees her either loves, or reveres, or both?
Dryden says,   The cause of love can never be assign'd:  'Tis in no face;--but in the lover's mind.
--And Cowley thus addresses beauty as a mere imaginary:   Beauty!
thou wild fantastic ape,  Who dost in ev'ry country change thy shape:  Here black; there brown; here tawny; and there white!
Thou flatt'rer, who comply'st with ev'ry sight!
Who hast no certain what, nor where.
But both these, had both these been her contemporaries, and known her, would have confessed both these mistaken: and, taking together person, mind, and behaviour, would have acknowledged the justice of the universal voice in her favour.
--Full many a lady  I've ey'd with best regard; and many a time  Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage  Brought my too-diligent ear.
For sev'ral virtues  Have I liked several women.
Never any  With so full a soul, but some defect in her  Did quarrel with the noblest grace her ow'd,  And put it to the foil.
But SHE!--O SHE!
So perfect and so peerless is created,  Of ev'ry creature's best.
SHAKESP.
Thou art curious to know, if I have not started a new game?
If it be possible for so universal a lover to be confined so long to one object?--Thou knowest nothing of this charming creature, that thou canst put such questions to me; or thinkest thou knowest me better than thou dost.
All that's excellent in her sex is this lady!--Until by MATRIMONIAL or EQUAL intimacies, I have found her less than angel, it is impossible to think of any other.
Then there are so many stimulatives to such a spirit as mine in this affair, besides love: such a field of stratagem and contrivance, which thou knowest to be the delight of my heart.
Then the rewarding end of all!--To carry off such a girl as this, in spite of all her watchful and implacable friends; and in spite of a prudence and reserve that I never met with in any of the sex;--what a triumph!--What a triumph over the whole sex!--And then such a revenge to gratify; which is only at present politically reined in, eventually to break forth with greater fury--Is it possible, thinkest thou, that there can be room for a thought that is not of her, and devoted to her?
***   By the devices I have this moment received, I have reason to think, that I shall have occasion for thee here.
Hold thee in readiness to come down upon the first summons.
Let Belton, and Mowbray, and Tourville, likewise prepare Let Belton, and Mowbray, and Tourville.
I have a great mind to contrive a method to send James Harlowe to travel for improvement.
Never was there a booby 'squire that more wanted it.
Contrive it, did I say?
I have already contrived it; could I but put it in execution without being suspected to have a hand in it.
This I am resolved upon; if I have not his sister, I will have his.
But be this as it may, there is a present likelihood of room for glorious mischief.
A confederacy had been for some time formed against me; but the uncles and the nephew are now to be double-servanted [single-servanted the uncles and the nephew were before]; and those servants are to be double armed when the uncles and the nephew attend those servants masters abroad.
This indicates the uncles and the nephew resolute enmity to me, and as resolute favour to Solmes.
The reinforced orders for this hostile apparatus are owing it seems to a visit I made yesterday to this hostile apparatus church.--A good place I thought to begin a reconciliation in; supposing the heads of the family to be christians, and that the family meant something by the family prayers.
My hopes were to have an invitation (or, at least, to gain a pretence) to accompany home the gloomy sire; and so get an opportunity to see my goddess: for I believed the family durst not but be civil to me, at least.
But the family were filled with terror it seems at my entrance; a terror the family could not get over.
I saw it indeed in the family countenances; and that they all expected something extraordinary to follow.--And so it should have done, had I been more sure than I am of the family daughter's favour.
Yet not a hair of any of the family stupid heads do I intend to hurt.
You shall all have your directions in writing, if there be occasion.
But after all, I dare say there will be no need but to shew your faces in my company.
Such faces never could four men shew--Mowbray's so fierce and so fighting: Belton's so pert and so pimply: Tourville's so fair and so foppish: thine so rough and so resolute: and I your leader!--What hearts, although meditating hostility, must those be which we shall not appall?--Each man occasionally attended by a servant or two, long ago chosen for qualities resembling those of Each man master.
Thus, Jack, as thou desirest, have I written.--Written upon something; upon nothing; upon REVENGE, which I love; upon LOVE, which I hate, heartily hate, because 'tis my master: and upon the devil knows what besides: for looking back, I am amazed at the length of the devil.
Thou mayest read the devil: I would not for a king's ransom.
But so as I do but write, thou sayest thou wilt be pleased.
Be pleased then.
I command thee to be pleased: if not for the writer's or written sake, for thy word's sake.
And so in the royal style (for am I not likely to be thy king and thy emperor in the great affair before us?)
I bid thee very heartily  Farewell.
LETTER XXXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS TUESDAY, MARCH 14.
I now send you copies of my letters to my uncles: with my uncles answers.
Be pleased to return the latter by the first deposit.
I leave my uncles for you to make remarks upon.
I shall make none.
TO JOHN HARLOWE, ESQ.
SAT.
MARCH 11.
Allow me, my honoured second Papa, as in my happy days you taught me to call you, to implore your interest with my Papa, to engage my Papa to dispense with a command, which, if insisted upon, will deprive me of my free-will, and make me miserable for my whole life.
For my whole life!
let me repeat: Is that a small point, my dear Uncle, to give up?
Am not I to live with Each man?
Is any body else?
Shall I not therefore be allowed to judge for myself, whether I can, or cannot, live happily with Each man?
Should it be ever so unhappily, will it be prudence to complain or appeal?
If it were, to whom could I appeal with effect against a husband?
And would not the invincible and avowed dislike I have for a husband at setting out, seem to justify any ill usage from a husband, in that state, were I to be ever so observant of a husband?
And if I were to be at all observant of a husband, it must be from fear, not love.
Once more, let me repeat, That this is not a small point to give up: and that it is for life.
Why, I pray you, good Sir, should I be made miserable for life?
Why should I be deprived of all comfort, but that which the hope that it would be a very short one, would afford me?
Marriage is a very solemn engagement, enough to make a young creature's heart ache, with the best prospects, when Marriage thinks seriously of it!--To be given up to a strange man; to be engrafted into a strange family; to give up Marriage very name, as a mark of Marriage becoming a mark of her absolute and dependent property; to be obliged to prefer this strange man to father, mother--to every body:--and this strange man humours to all Marriage own--or to contend, perhaps, in breach of avowed duty, for every innocent instance of free-will.
To go no where; to make acquaintance; to give up acquaintance; to renounce even the strictest friendships, perhaps; all at Sir pleasure, whether Marriage thinks it reasonable to do so or not.
Surely, Sir, a young creature ought not to be obliged to make all these sacrifices but for such a man as Marriage can love.
If Marriage be, how sad must be the case!
How miserable the life, if the life can be called life!
I wish I could obey you all.
What a pleasure would it be to me, if I could!--Marry first, and love will come after, was said by one of my dearest friends!
But this is a shocking assertion.
A thousand thing may happen to make that state but barely tolerable, where A thousand thing is entered into with mutual affections: What must A thousand thing then be, where a husband can have no confidence in the love of a husband wife: but has reason rather to question it, from the preference a husband himself believes his wife would have given to somebody else, had his wife had his wife own option?
What doubts, what jealousies, what want of tenderness, what unfavourable prepossessions, will there be, in a matrimony thus circumstanced!
How will every look, every action, even the most innocent, be liable to misconstruction!--While, on the other hand, an indifference, a carelessness to oblige, may take place; and fear only can constrain even an appearance of what ought to be the effect of undisguised love!
Think seriously of these things, dear, good Sir, and represent these things to my father in that strong light which the subject will bear; but in which my sex, and my tender years and inexperience, will not permit me to paint the subject; and use your powerful interest, that your poor niece may not be consigned to a misery so durable.
I offered to engage not to marry at all, if that condition may be accepted.
What a disgrace is it to me to be thus sequestered from company, thus banished my papa's and mamma's presence; thus slighted and deserted by me, Sir, and my other kind uncle!
And to be hindered from attending at that public worship, which, were I out of the way of my duty, would be most likely to reduce me into the right path again!--Is this the way, Sir; can this be thought to be the way to be taken with a free and open spirit?
May not this strange method rather harden than convince?
I cannot bear to live in disgrace thus.
The very servants so lately permitted to be under my own direction, hardly daring to speak to me; my own servant discarded with high marks of undeserved suspicion and displeasure, and my sister's maid set over me.
The matter may be too far pushed.--Indeed The matter may.--And then, perhaps, every one will be sorry for every one parts in The matter.
May I be permitted to mention an expedient?--'If I am to be watched, banished, and confined; suppose, Sir, it were to be at your house?'
--Then the neighbouring gentry will the less wonder, that the person of whom the neighbouring gentry used to think so favourably, appear not at church here; and that she received not the neighbouring gentry visits.
I hope there can be no objection to this.
You used to love to have me with you, Sir, when all went happily with Sir: And will you not now permit me, in my troubles, the favour of your house, till all this displeasure is overblown?--Upon my word, Sir, I will not stir out of doors, if you require the contrary of Sir: nor will I see any body, but whom you will allow me to see; provided Mr. Solmes be not brought to persecute me there.
Procure, then, this favour for Sir; if you cannot procure the still greater, that of a happy reconciliation (which nevertheless I presume to hope for, if you will be so good as to plead for Sir); and you will then add to those favours and to that indulgence, which have bound me, and will for ever bind me to be  Your dutiful and obliged niece, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
THE ANSWER   SUNDAY NIGHT.
MY DEAR NIECE,  It grieves me to be forced to deny you any thing you ask.
Yet It must be so; for unless you can bring your mind to oblige us in this one point, in which us promises and honour were engaged before us believed there could be so sturdy an opposition, you must never expect to be what you have been to us all.
In short, Niece, us are in an embattled phalanx.
Your reading makes you a stranger to nothing but what you should be most acquainted with.
So you will see by that expression, that us are not to be pierced by your persuasions, and invincible persistence.
us have agreed all to be moved, or none; and not to comply without one another.
So you know your destiny; and have nothing to do but to yield to your destiny.
Let me tell you, the virtue of obedience lies not in obliging when you can be obliged again.
But give up an inclination, and there is some merit in that.
As to your expedient; you shall not come to my house, Miss Clary; though this is a prayer I little thought I ever should have denied you: for were you to keep your word as to seeing nobody but whom we please, yet can you write to somebody else, and receive letters from somebody else.
This we too well know you can, and have done--more is the shame and the pity!
You offer to live single, MISS--we wished you married: but because you may not have the man your heart is set upon, why, truly, you will have nobody we shall recommend: and as we know, that somehow or other you correspond with the man your heart is set, or at least did as long as you could; and as the man your heart is set defies us all, and would not dare to do so, if the man your heart is set were not sure of you in spite of us all, (which is not a little vexatious to we, you must think,) we are resolved to frustrate the man your heart is set, and triumph over the man your heart is set, rather than that the man your heart is set should triumph over we: that's one word for all.
So expect not any advocateship from me: I will not plead for you; and that's enough.
From  Your displeased uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.
P.S.
For the rest I refer to ANTONY.
***   TO ANTONY HARLOWE, ESQ.
SATURDAY, MARCH 11.
HONOURED SIR,  As you have thought fit to favour Mr. Solmes with your particular recommendation, and was very earnest in Mr. Solmes behalf, ranking Mr. Solmes (as you told me, upon introducing Mr. Solmes to me) among your select friends; and expecting my regards to Mr. Solmes accordingly; I beg your patience, while I offer a few things, out of many that I could offer, to your serious consideration, on occasion of Mr. Solmes address to me, if I am to use that word.
I am charged with prepossession in another person's favour.
You will be pleased, Sir, to remember, that till ANTONY returned from Scotland, that other person was not absolutely discouraged, nor was I forbid to receive ANTONY visits.
I believe it will not be pretended, that in birth, education, or personal endowments, a comparison can be made between the two.
And only let me ask you, Sir, if the one would have been thought of for me, had Sir not made such offers, as, upon my word, I think, I ought not in justice to accept of, nor Sir to propose: offers, which if Sir had not made, I dare say, my papa would not have required offers, which if he had not made, I dare say of my papa.
But the one, it seems, has many faults:--Is the other faultless?--The principal thing objected to Mr. Lovelace (and a very inexcusable one) is that Mr. Lovelace is immoral in Mr. Lovelace loves--Is not the other in Mr. Lovelace hatreds?--Nay, as I may say, in Mr. Lovelace loves too (the object only differing) if the love of money be the root of all evil.
But, Sir, if I am prepossessed, what has Mr. Solmes to hope for?--Why should Mr. Solmes persevere?
What must I think of the man who would wish me to be Mr. Solmes wife against my inclination?--And is it not a very harsh thing for my friends to desire to see me married to one I cannot love, when my friends will not be persuaded but that there is one whom I do love?
Treated as I am, now is the time for me to speak out or never.--Let me review what it is Mr. Solmes depends upon on this occasion.
Does Mr. Solmes believe, that the disgrace which I supper on Mr. Solmes account, will give Mr. Solmes a merit with Mr. Solmes?
Does Mr. Solmes think to win my esteem, through my uncles' sternness to Mr. Solmes; by my brother's contemptuous usage; by my sister's unkindness; by being denied to visit, or be visited; and to correspond with my chosen friend, although a person of unexceptionable honour and prudence, and of my own sex; my servant to be torn from Mr. Solmes, and another servant set over Mr. Solmes; to be confined, like a prisoner, to narrow and disgraceful limits, in order avowedly to mortify me, and to break my spirit; to be turned out of that family-management which I loved, and had the greater pleasure in it, because it was an ease, as I thought, to my mamma, and what my sister chose not; and yet, though time hangs heavy upon my hands, to be so put out of my course, that I have as little inclination as liberty to pursue any of my choice delights?--Are these steps necessary to reduce me to a level so low, as to make me a fit wife for this man?--Yet these are all this man can have to trust to.
And if this man reliance is on these measures, I would have this man to know, that this man mistakes meekness and gentleness of disposition for servility and baseness of heart.
I beseech you, Sir, to let the natural turn and bent of Sir mind and my mind be considered: What are Sir qualities, by which Sir would hope to win my esteem?--Dear, dear Sir, if I am to be compelled, let it be in favour of a man that can read and write--that can teach me something: For what a husband must that man make, who can do nothing but command; and needs a husband the instruction a husband should be qualified to give?
I may be conceited, Sir; I may be vain of my little reading; of my writing; as of late I have more than once been told I am.
But, Sir, the more unequal the proposed match, if so: the better opinion I have of myself, the worse I must have of Sir; and the more unfit are we for each other.
Indeed, Sir, I must say, I thought my friends had put a higher value upon myself.
ANTONY pretended once, that it was owing to such value, that Mr. Lovelace's address was prohibited.--Can this be; and such a man as Mr. Solmes be intended for myself?
As to Mr. Solmes proposed settlements, I hope I shall not incur your great displeasure, if I say, what all who know me have reason to think (and some have upbraided me for), that I despise those motives.
Dear, Sir, what are settlements to one who has as much of Sir own as Sir wishes for?--Who has more in Sir own power, as a single person, than it is probable Sir would be permitted to have at Sir disposal, as a wife?--Whose expenses and ambition are moderate; and who, if Sir had superfluities, would rather dispense Whose expenses and ambition to the necessitous, than lay Whose expenses and ambition by Sir useless?
If then such narrow motives have so little weight with Sir for my own benefit, shall the remote and uncertain view of family-aggrandizements, and that in the person of my brother and family-aggrandizements descendents, be thought sufficient to influence me?
Has the behaviour of ANTONY to Sir of late, or ANTONY consideration for the family (which had so little weight with ANTONY, that ANTONY could choose to hazard a life so justly precious as an only son's, rather than not ratify passions which ANTONY is above attempting to subdue, and, give me leave to say, has been too much indulged in, either with regard to ANTONY own good, or the peace of any body related to ANTONY;) Has ANTONY behaviour, I say, deserved of me in particular, that I should make a sacrifice of my temporal (and, who knows?
of my eternal) happiness, to promote a plan formed upon chimerical, at least upon unlikely, contingencies; as I will undertake to demonstrate, if I may be permitted to examine it?
I am afraid you will condemn my warmth: But does not this occasion require it?
To the want of a greater degree of earnestness in my opposition, it seems, it is owing, that such advances have been made, as have been made.
Then, Sir, allow something, I beseech you, for a spirit raised and embittered by disgraces, which (knowing my own heart) I am confident to say, are unmerited.
But why have I said so much, in answer to the supposed charge of prepossession, when I have declared to my mamma, as now, Sir, I do to you, that if it be not insisted upon that I shall marry any other person, particularly this Mr. Solmes, I will enter into any engagements never to have the other, nor any man else, without any engagements consents; that is to say, without the consents of my father and my mother, and of you my uncle, and my elder uncle, and my cousin Morden, as he is one of the trustees for my grandfather's bounty to me?--As to my brother indeed, I cannot say, that my brother indeed treatment of me has been of late so brotherly, as to entitle my brother indeed to more than civility from me: and for this, give me leave to add, my brother indeed would be very much my debtor.
If I have not been explicit enough in declaring my dislike to Mr. Solmes (that the prepossession which is charged upon me may not be supposed to influence me against my brother indeed) I do absolutely declare, That were there no such man as Mr. Lovelace in the world, I would not have Mr. Solmes.
It is necessary, in some one of my letters to my dear friends, that I should write so clearly as to put this matter out of all doubt: and to whom can I better address me with an explicitness that can admit of no mistake, than to that uncle who professes the highest regard for plain-dealing and sincerity?
Let me, for these reasons, be still more particular in some of my exceptions to that uncle who professes the highest regard for plain-dealing and sincerity.
Mr. Solmes appears to me (to all the world, indeed) to have a very narrow mind, and no great capacity: Mr. Solmes is coarse and indelicate; as rough in Mr. Solmes manners as in Mr. Solmes person: Mr. Solmes is not only narrow, but covetous: being possessed of great wealth, Mr. Solmes enjoys it not; nor has the spirit to communicate to a distress of any kind.
Does not Mr. Solmes own sister live unhappily, for want of a little of Mr. Solmes superfluities?
And suffers not Mr. Solmes Mr. Solmes aged uncle, the brother of Mr. Solmes own mother, to owe to the generosity of strangers the poor subsistence Mr. Solmes picks up from half-a-dozen families?--You know, Sir, my open, free, communicative temper: how unhappy must I be, circumscribed in Sir narrow, selfish circle!
out of which being with-held by this diabolical parsimony, Sir dare no more stir, than a conjurer out of Sir; nor would let me.
Such a man, as this, love!--Yes, perhaps Sir may, my grandfather's estate; which Sir has told several persons (and could not resist hinting the same thing tome, with that sort of pleasure which a low mind takes, when the same thing tome intimates the same thing tome own interest as a sufficient motive for the same thing tome to expect another's favour) lies so extremely convenient for Sir, that the same thing tome would double the value of a considerable part of Sir own.
That estate, and an alliance which would do credit to Sir obscurity and narrowness, they make Sir think Sir can love, and induce Sir to believe Sir does: but at most, Sir is but a second-place love.
Riches were, are, and always will be, Sir predominant passion.
Sir were left Sir by a miser, on this very account: and I must be obliged to forego all the choice delights of my life, and be as mean as Sir, or else be quite unhappy.
Pardon, Sir, this severity of expression--one is apt to say more than one would of a person one dislikes, when more is said in a person favour than a person can possibly deserve; and when a person is urged to my acceptance with so much vehemence, that there is no choice left me.
Whether these things be perfectly so, or not, while I think these things are, it is impossible I should ever look upon Mr. Solmes in the light Mr. Solmes is offered to me.
Nay, were Mr. Solmes to be proved ten times better than I have represented Mr. Solmes, and sincerely think Mr. Solmes; yet would Mr. Solmes be still ten times more disagreeable to me than any other man I know in the world.
Let me therefore beseech you, Sir, to become an advocate for your niece, that your niece may not be made a victim to a man so highly disgustful to your niece.
You and my other uncle can do a great deal for me, if you please, with my papa.
Be persuaded, me, that I am not governed by obstinacy in this case; but by aversion; an aversion I cannot overcome: for, if I have but endeavoured to reason with me, (out of regard to the duty I owe to my father's will,) my heart has recoiled, and I have been averse to me, for offering but to argue with me, in behalf of a man who, in the light my father appears to me, has no one merit; and who, knowing this aversion, could not persevere as my father does, if my father had the spirit of a man.
If, Sir, you can think of the contents of this letter reasonable, I beseech you to support Sir, you can think of the contents of this letter reasonable with your interest.
If not--I shall be most unhappy!--Nevertheless, it is but just in me so to write, as that Mr. Solmes may know what Mr. Solmes has to trust to.
Forgive, Sir, this tedious letter; and suffer it to have weight with Sir; and you will for ever oblige  Your dutiful and affectionate niece,  CL.
HARLOWE.
***   MR. ANTONY HARLOWE, TO MISS CL.
HARLOWE  NIECE CLARY,  You had better not write to us, or to any of us.
To me, particularly, you had better never to have set pen to paper, on the subject whereon you have written.
He that is first in He own cause, saith the wise man, seemeth just: but He neighbour cometh and searcheth He.
And so, in this respect, I will be his neighbour: for I will search your heart to the bottom; that is to say, if this letter be written from your heart.
Yet do I know what a task I have undertaken, because of the knack you are noted for at writing.
But in defence of a father's authority, in behalf of the good, and honour, and prosperity of the family one comes of, what a hard thing it would be, if one could not beat down all the arguments a rebel child (how loth I am to write down that word of Miss Clary Harlowe!)
can bring, in behalf of Miss Clary Harlowe obstinacy!
In the first place, don't you declare (and that contrary to your declarations to your mother, remember that, girl!)
that you prefer the man we all hate, and who hates we all as bad!--Then what a character have you given of a worthy man!
I wonder you dare write so freely of one we all respect--but possibly it may be for that very reason.
How you begin your letter!--Because I value Mr. Solmes as my friend, you treat Mr. Solmes the worse--That's the plain dunstable of the matter, Miss!--I am not such a fool but I can see that.--And so a noted whoremonger is to be chosen before a man who is a money-lover!--Let me tell you, Niece, this little becomes so nice a one as you have been always reckoned.
Who, think you, does more injustice, a prodigal man or a saving man?--a one as you have been always reckoned saves a one as you have been always reckoned own money; the other spends other people's.
But your favourite is a sinner in grain, and upon record.
The devil's in your sex!
God forgive me for saying so--the nicest of them will prefer a vile rake and wh---- I suppose I must not repeat the word:--the word will offend, when the vicious denominated by the word will be chosen!--I had not been a bachelor to this time, if I had not seen such a mass of contradictions in you all.--Such gnat-strainers and camel-swallowers, as venerable Holy Writ has it.
What names will perverseness call things by!--A prudent man, who intends to be just to every body, is a covetous man!--While a vile, profligate rake is christened with the appellation of a gallant man; and a polite man, I'll warrant you!
a vile, profligate rake is my firm opinion, Lovelace would not have so much regard for you as Lovelace professes, but for two reasons.
And what are these?--Why, out of spite to all of us--one of these.
The other, because of your independent fortune.
I wish your good grandfather had not left what your good grandfather did so much in your own power, as I may say.
But little did your good grandfather imagine your good grandfather beloved grand-daughter would have turned upon my dear friends his beloved grand-daughter as his beloved grand-daughter has done!
What has Mr. Solmes to hope for, if you are prepossessed!
Hey-day!
Is this you, cousin Clary!--Has your good grandfather then nothing to hope for from your father's, and mother's, and our recommendations?--No, nothing at all, it seems!--O brave!--I should think that this, with a dutiful child, as we took you to be, was enough.
Depending on this your duty, we proceeded: and now there is no help for it: for we will not be balked: neither shall we friend Mr. Solmes, I can tell you that.
If your estate is convenient for your estate, what then?
Does that (pert cousin) make it out that your estate does not love you?
your estate had need to expect some good with you, that has so little good to hope for from you; mind that.
But pray, is not your estate our estate, as our may say?
Have our not all an interest in it, and a prior right, if right were to have taken place?
And was it not more than a good old man's dotage, God rest God soul!
that gave it you before us all?--Well then, ought us all not to have a choice who shall have it in marriage with you?
and would you have the conscience to wish us all to let a vile fellow, who hates us all, run away with it?--You bid me weigh what you write: do you weigh this, Girl: and this will appear us all have more to say for us all than you was aware of.
As to your hard treatment, as you call it, thank yourself for that.
It may be over when you will: so I reckon nothing upon that.
You was not banished and confined till all entreaty and fair speeches were tried with yourself: mind that.
And Mr. Solmes can't help your obstinacy: let that be observed too.
As to being visited, and visiting; you never was fond of either: so that's a grievance put into the scale to make weight.--As to disgrace, that's as bad to us as to yourself: so fine a young creature!
So much as us used to brag of yourself too!--And besides, this is all in your power, as the rest.
But your heart recoils, when you would persuade yourself to obey your parent--Finely described, is it not!--Too truly described, I own, as you go on.
I know that you may love him if you will.
I had a good mind to bid you hate him; then, perhaps, you would like him the better: for I have always found a most horrid romantic perverseness in your sex.--To do and to love what you should not, is meat, drink, and vesture, to you all.
I am absolutely of your brother's mind, That reading and writing, though not too much for the wits of you young girls, are too much for your judgments.--You say, you may be conceited, Cousin; you may be vain!--And so you are, to despise this gentleman as you do.
this gentleman can read and write as well as most gentlemen, I can tell you that.
Who told you Mr. Solmes cannot read and write?
But you must have a husband who can learn you something!--I wish you knew but your duty as well as you do your talents--that, Niece, you have of late days to learn; and Mr. Solmes will therefore find something to instruct you in.
I will not shew Mr. Solmes this letter of yours, though you seem to desire this letter of yours, lest this letter of yours should provoke Mr. Solmes to be too severe a schoolmaster, when you are his'n.
But now I think of this letter of yours, suppose you are the reader at your pen than Mr. Solmes--You will make the more useful wife to Mr. Solmes; won't you?
For who so good an economist as you?--And you may keep all of Mr. Solmes accounts, and save yourselves a steward.--And, let me tell you, this is a fine advantage in a family: for those stewards are often sad dogs, and creep into a man's estate before he knows where he is; and not seldom is he forced to pay them interest for he own money.
I know not why a good wife should be above these things.
It is better than lying a-bed half the day, and junketing and card-playing all the night, and making yourselves wholly useless to every good purpose in your own families, as is now the fashion among ye.
The duce take you all that do so, say I!--Only that, thank my stars, I am a bachelor.
Then this is a province you are admirably versed in: you grieve that this is taken from you here, you know.
So here, Miss, with Mr. Solmes you will have something to keep account of, for the sake of you and your children: with the other, perhaps you will have an account to keep, too--but an account of what will go over the left shoulder; only of what Mr. Solmes squanders, what Mr. Solmes borrows, and what Mr. Solmes owes, and never will pay.
Come, come, Cousin, you know nothing of the world; a man's a man; and you may have many partners in a handsome man, and costly ones too, who may lavish away all you save.
Mr. Solmes therefore for my money, and I hope for yours.
But Mr. Solmes is a coarse man.
Mr. Solmes is not delicate enough for your niceness; because I suppose Mr. Solmes dresses not like a fop and a coxcomb, and because Mr. Solmes lays not Mr. Solmes out in complimental nonsense, the poison of female minds.
Mr. Solmes is a man of sense, that I can tell you.
No man talks more to the purpose to us: but you fly No man so, that No man has no opportunity given No man, to express he has no opportunity given him to you: and a man who loves, if No man have ever so much sense, looks a fool; especially when No man is despised, and treated as you treated No man the last time No man was in your company.
As to No man sister; his sister threw his sister away (as you want to do) against No man full warning: for No man told his sister what his sister had to trust to, if his sister married where his sister did marry.
And No man was as good as No man word; and so an honest man ought: offences against warning ought to be smarted for.
Take care this be not your case: mind that.
His uncle deserves no favour from His; for His uncle would have circumvented Mr. Solmes, and got Sir Oliver to leave to Sir Oliver the estate Sir Oliver had always designed for Sir Oliver Sir Oliver nephew, and brought Sir Oliver up in the hope of it.
Too ready forgiveness does but encourage offences: that's your good father's maxim: and there would not be so many headstrong daughters as there are, if your good father's maxim were kept in mind.--Punishments are of service to offenders; rewards should be only to the meriting: and I think the former are to be dealt out rigourously, in willful cases.
As to his love; his shews it but too much for your deservings, as they have been of late; let me tell you that: and this is his misfortune; and may in time perhaps be yours.
As to his parsimony, which you wickedly call diabolical, [a very free word in your mouth, let me tell his], little reason have you of all people for this, on whom his proposes, of his own accord, to settle all his has in the world: a proof, let his love riches as his will, that his loves you better.
But that you may be without excuse on this score, we will tie his up to your own terms, and oblige his by the marriage-articles to allow you a very handsome quarterly sum to do what you please with.
And this has been told you before; and I have said this to Mrs. Howe (that good and worthy lady) before Mrs. Howe (that good and worthy lady) , that you might hear of this again.
To contradict the charge of prepossession to Lovelace, you offer never to have the charge of prepossession to Lovelace without our consents: and what is this saying, but that you will hope on for our consents, and to wheedle and tire our out?
Then the charge of prepossession to Lovelace will always be in expectation while you are single: and our are to live on at this rate (are our?)
vexed by you, and continually watchful about you; and as continually exposed to the charge of prepossession to Lovelace insolence and threats.
Remember last Sunday, Girl!--What might have happened, had your brother and your brother met?--Moreover, you cannot do with such a spirit as your brother, as you can with worthy Mr. Solmes: the one you make tremble; the other will make you quake: mind that--and you will not be able to help yourself.
And remember, that if there should be any misunderstanding between one of them and you, we should all interpose; and with effect, no doubt: but with the other, it would be self-do, self-have; and who would either care or dare to put in a word for you?
Nor let the supposition of matrimonial differences frighten you: honey-moon lasts not now-a-days above a fortnight; and Dunmow flitch, as I have been informed, was never claimed; though some say once it was.
Marriage is a queer state, Child, whether paired by the parties or by the parties friends.
Out of three brothers of us, you know, there was but one had courage to marry.
And why was it, do you think?
us were wise by other people's experience.
Don't despise money so much: you may come to know the value of it: that is a piece of instruction that you are to learn; and which, according to your own notions, Mr. Solmes will be able to teach you.
I do indeed condemn your warmth.
I will not allow for disgraces you bring upon yourself.
If I thought them unmerited, I would be your advocate.
But it was always my notion, that children should not dispute children parents' authority.
When your grandfather left your grandfather estate to you, though your grandfather three sons, and a grandson, and your elder sister, were in being, we all acquiesced: and why?
Because it was we all father's doing.
Do you imitate that example: if you will not, those who set it you have the more reason to hold you inexcusable: mind that, Cousin.
You mention your brother too scornfully: and, in your letter to your brother, are very disrespectful; and so indeed you are to your sister, in the letter you wrote to your sister.
Your brother, Madam, is your brother; and third older than Your brother, Madam, and a man: and pray be so good as not to forget what is due to a brother, who (next to us three brothers) is the head of the family, and on whom the name depends--as upon your dutiful compliance laid down for the honour of the family you are come of.
And pray now let me ask you, If the honour of the family will not be an honour to you?--If you don't think so, the more unworthy you.
You shall see the plan, if you promise not to be prejudiced against the plan right or wrong.
If you are not besotted to a man, I am sure you will like the plan.
If you are, were Mr. Solmes, it would signify nothing: for the devil is love, and love is the devil, when the devil gets into any of your heads.
Many examples have I seen of that.
If there were no such man as Lovelace in the world, you would not have Mr.
Solmes.--You would not, Miss!--Very pretty, truly!--We see how your spirit is embittered indeed.--Wonder not, since your spirit is come to your will not's, that those who have authority over you, say, You shall have the other.
And I am one: mind that.
And if it behoves YOU to speak out, Miss, it behoves US not to speak in.
What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander: take that in your thought too.
I humbly apprehend, that Mr. Solmes has the spirit of a man, and a gentleman.
I would admonish you therefore not to provoke it.
Mr. Solmes pities you as much as Mr. Solmes loves you.
Mr. Solmes says, Mr. Solmes will convince you of Mr. Solmes love by deeds, since Mr. Solmes is not permitted by you to express it by words.
And all Mr. Solmes dependence is upon your generosity hereafter.
We hope Mr. Solmes may depend upon that: We encourage Mr. Solmes to think Mr. Solmes may.
And this heartens Mr. Solmes up.
So that you may lay Mr. Solmes constancy at your parents' and your uncles' doors; and this will be another mark of your duty, you know.
You must be sensible, that you reflect upon your parents, and all of We, when you tell me you cannot in justice accept of the settlements proposed to you.
This reflection We should have wondered at from you once; but now We don't.
There are many other very censurable passages in this free letter of you; but We must place many other very censurable passages in this free letter of yours to the account of your embittered spirit.
I am glad you mentioned that word, because We should have been at a loss what to have called that word.--I should much rather nevertheless have had reason to give that word a better name.
I love you dearly still, Miss.
I think you, though my niece, one of the finest young gentlewomen I ever saw.
But, upon my conscience, I think you ought to obey your parents, and oblige me and your brother: for you know very well, that we have nothing but your good at heart: consistently indeed with the good and honour of all of we.
What must we think of any one of it, who would not promote the good of the whole?
and who would set one part of it against another?--Which God forbid, say I!--You see I am for the good of all.
What shall I get by it, let things go as things will?
Do I want any thing of any body for my own sake?--Does your brother?--Well, then, Cousin Clary, what would you be at, as I may say?
O but you can't love Mr.
Solmes!--But, I say, you know not what you can do.
You encourage Cousin Clary in your dislike.
You permit your heart (little did I think your heart was such a froward one) to recoil.
Take your heart to task, Niece; drive your heart on as fast as your heart recoils, [we do so in all we sea-fights, and land-fights too, by we sailors and soldiers, or we should not conquer]; and we are all sure you will overcome your heart.
And why?
Because you ought.
So we think, whatever you think: and whose thoughts are to be preferred?
You may be wittier than we; but, if you were wiser, we have lived some of we, let me tell you, to very little purpose, thirty or forty years longer than you.
I have written as long a letter as you.
I may not write in so lively, or so polite a style as my Niece: but I think I have all the argument on my side: and you will vastly oblige me, if you will shew me, by your compliance with all our desires, that you think so too.
If you do not, you must not expect an advocate, or even a friend, in me, dearly as I love you.
For then I shall be sorry to be called  Your uncle, ANT.
HARLOWE.
TUESDAY, TWO IN THE MORNING.
POSTSCRIPT.
You must send me no more letters: but a compliable one you may send.
But I need not have forbid you; for I am sure this, by fair argument, is unanswerable--I know it is.
I have written day and night, I may say, ever since Sunday morning, only church-time, or the like of that: but this is the last, I can tell you, from  ANT.
H.     LETTER XXXIII  Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY, MARCH 16.
Having met with such bad success in my application to my relations, I have taken a step that will surprise you.
It is no other than writing a letter to Mr. Solmes.
I sent a letter, and have Mr. Solmes answer.
Mr. Solmes had certainly help in a letter.
For I have seen a letter of Mr. Solmes, and indifferently worded, as poorly spelt.
Yet the superscription is of Mr. Solmes dictating, I dare say, for Mr. Solmes is a formal wretch.
With he is a formal wretch, I shall enclose one from your brother to me, on occasion of me to Mr. Solmes.
I did think that it was possible to discourage the man from proceeding; and if I could have done that, it was possible to discourage the man from proceeding would have answered all my wishes.
it was possible to discourage the man from proceeding was worth the trial.
But you'll see nothing will do.
your brother has taken your brother measures too securely.
TO ROGER SOLMES, ESQ.
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 15.
SIR,  You will wonder to receive a letter from me; and more still at the uncommon subject of a letter from me.
But the necessity of the case will justify me, at least in my own apprehension; and I shall therefore make no other apology for the case.
When you first came acquainted with our family, you found the writer of this one of the happiest creatures in the world; beloved by the best and most indulgent of parents; and rejoicing in the kind favour of two affectionate uncles, and in the esteem of every one.
But how is this scene now changed!--You was pleased to cast a favourable eye upon me.
You addressed yourself to my friends: your proposals were approved of by my friends--approved of without consulting me; as if my choice and happiness were of the least signification.
Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me, insisted upon it without reserve.
I had not the felicity to think as Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me did; almost the first time my sentiments differed from Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me.
I besought Those who had a right to all reasonable obedience from me to indulge me in a point so important to my future happiness: but, alas, in vain!
And then (for I thought it was but honest) I told you my mind; and even that my affections were engaged.
But, to my mortification and surprise, you persisted, and still persist.
The consequence of all is too grievous for me to repeat: you, who have such free access to the rest of the family, know it too well--too well you know it, either for the credit of your own generosity, or for my reputation.
I am used, on your account, as I never before was used, and never before was thought to deserve to be used; and this was the hard, the impossible, condition of their returning favour, that I must prefer a man to all others, that of all others I cannot prefer.
Thus distressed, and made unhappy, and all to your sake, and through your cruel perseverance, I write, Sir, to demand of you the peace of mind you have robbed me of: to demand of you the love of so many dear friends, of which you have deprived me; and, if you have the generosity that should distinguish a man, and a gentleman, to adjure you not to continue an address that has been attended with such cruel effects to the creature you profess to esteem.
If you really value me, as my friends would make me believe, and as you have declared you do, must it not be a mean and selfish value?
A value that can have no merit with the unhappy object of it, because it is attended with effects so grievous to her?
It must be for your own sake only, not for mine.
And even in this point you must be mistaken: For, would a prudent man wish to marry one who has not a heart to give?
Who cannot esteem a prudent man?
Who therefore must prove a bad wife!--And how cruel would it be to make a poor creature a bad wife, whose pride it would be to make a good one!
If I am capable of judging, our tempers and inclinations are vastly different.
Any other of my sex will make you happier than I can.
The treatment I meet with, and the obstinacy, as it is called, with which I support Sir under it, ought to convince you of this; were I not able to give so good a reason for this my supposed perverseness, as that I cannot consent to marry a man whom I cannot value.
But if, Sir, you have not so much generosity in your value for Sir, as to desist for my own sake, let me conjure you, by the regard due to yourself, and to your own future happiness, to discontinue your suit, and place your affections on a worthier object: for why should you make me miserable, and yourself not happy?
By this means you will do all that is now in your power to restore to Sir the affection of my friends; and, if that can be, it will leave me in as happy a state as you found me in.
You need only to say, that you see there are no HOPES, as you will perhaps complaisantly call no HOPES, of succeeding with Sir [and indeed, Sir, there cannot be a greater truth]; and that you will therefore no more think of Sir, but turn your thoughts another way.
Your compliance with this request will lay me under the highest obligation to your generosity, and make me ever  Your well-wisher, and humble servant, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE These most humbly present.
DEAREST MISS,  Your letter has had a very contrary effect upon Sir, to what you seem to have expected from Your letter.
Your letter has doubly convinced me of the excellency of your mind, and of the honour of your disposition.
Call Your letter selfish, or what you please, I must persist in my suit; and happy shall I be, if by patience and perseverance, and a steady and unalterable devoir, I may at last overcome the difficulty laid in my way.
As your good parents, your uncles, and other friends, are absolutely determined you shall never have Mr. Lovelace, if your good parents, your uncles, and other friends can help it; and as I presume no other person is in the way, I will contentedly wait the issue of this matter.
And forgive me, TO MISS, but a person should sooner persuade me to give up to a person my estate, as an instance of my generosity, because a person could not be happy without it, than I would a much more valuable treasure, to promote the felicity of another, and make a person way easier to circumvent myself.
Pardon me, TO MISS; but I must persevere, though I am sorry you suffer on my account, as you are pleased to think; for I never before saw the woman I could love: and while there is any hope, and that you remain undisposed of to some happier man, I must and will be  Your faithful and obsequious admirer, ROGER SOLMES.
MARCH 16.
***   MR. JAMES HARLOWE, TO TO MISS.
HARLOWE MARCH 16.
What a fine whim you took into your head, to write a letter to Mr. Solmes, to persuade Mr. Solmes to give up Mr. Solmes pretensions to you!--Of all the pretty romantic flights you have delighted in, this was certainly one of the most extraordinary.
But to say nothing of what fires us all with indignation against you (your owning your prepossession in a villain's favour, and your impertinence to me, and your sister, and your uncles; one of which has given it you home, child), how can you lay at Mr. Solmes's door the usage you so bitterly complain of?--You know, little fool as you are, that it is your fondness for Mr. Lovelace that has brought upon you all these things; and which would have happened, whether Mr. Solmes had honoured you with Mr. Solmes addresses or not.
As you must needs know this to be true, consider, pretty witty Miss, if your fond, love-sick heart can let you consider, what a fine figure all your expostulations with us, and charges upon Mr. Solmes, make!--With what propriety do you demand of Mr. Solmes to restore to you your former happiness (as you call it, and merely call it; for if you thought us favour so, you would restore our favour to yourself), since it is yet in your own power to do so?
Therefore, Miss Pert, none of your pathetics, except in the right place.
Depend upon it, whether you have Mr. Solmes, or not, you shall never have your heart's delight, the vile rake Mr. Lovelace, if our parents, if our uncles, if I, can hinder it.
No!
you fallen angel, you shall not give your father and mother such a son, nor me such a brother, in giving yourself that profligate wretch for a husband.
And so set your heart at rest, and lay aside all thoughts of a husband, if ever you expect forgiveness, reconciliation, or a kind opinion, from any of your family; but especially from a husband, who, at present, styles himself  Your brother, JAMES HARLOWE.
P.S.
I know your knack at letter-writing.
If you send me an answer for this, I will return you send me an answer for this unopened; for I will not argue with your perverseness in so plain a case--Only once for all, I was willing to put you right as to Mr. Solmes; whom I think to blame to trouble Mr. Solmes head about you.
*   MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
FRIDAY, MARCH 17.
I receive, with great pleasure, the early and cheerful assurances of your loyalty and love.
And let our principal and most trusty friends named in my last know that I do.
I would have thee, Jack, come down, as soon as thou canst.
I believe I shall not want the others so soon.
Yet the others may come down to Lord M.'s.
I will be there, if not to receive the others, to satisfy Lord M.'s, that there is no new mischief in hand, which will require Lord M.'s second intervention.
For thyself, thou must be constantly with Lord M.'s: not for my security: the family dare do nothing but bully: the family bark only at a distance: but for my entertainment: that thou mayest, from the Latin and the English classics, keep my lovesick soul from drooping.
Thou hadst best come to Lord M.'s here, in thy old corporal's coat: thy servant out of livery; and to be upon a familiar footing with Lord M.'s, as a distant relation, to be provided for by thy interest above--I mean not in Heaven, thou mayest be sure.
Thou wilt find me at a little alehouse, they call a little alehouse an inn; the White Hart, most terribly wounded, (but by the weather only,) the sign: in a sorry village, within five miles from Harlowe-place.
Every body knows Harlowe-place, for, like Versailles, Every body is sprung up from a dunghill, within every elderly person's remembrance.
Every poor body, particularly, knows Every poor body: but that only for a few years past, since a certain angel has appeared there among the sons and daughters of men.
The people here at the White Hart are poor, but honest; and have gotten it into The people here at the Hart heads, that I am a man of quality in disguise; and there is no reining-in The people here at the Hart officious respect.
Here is a pretty little smirking daughter, seventeen six days ago.
I call her my Rose-bud.
her grandmother (for there is no mother), a good neat old woman, as ever filled a wicker chair in a chimney-corner, has besought me to be merciful to her.
This is the right way with me.
Many and many a pretty rogue had I spared, whom I did not spare, had my power been acknowledged, and my mercy in time implored.
But the debellare superbos should be my motto, were I to have a new one.
This simple chit (for there is a simplicity in her thou wouldst be highly pleased with: all humble; all officious; all innocent--I love her for her humility, her officiousness, and even for her innocence) will be pretty amusement to thee; while I combat with the weather, and dodge and creep about the walls and purlieus of Harlowe-place.
Thou wilt see in her mind, all that her superiors have been taught to conceal, in order to render all that her superiors have been taught to conceal less natural, and of consequence less pleasing.
But I charge thee, that thou do not (what I would not permit her to do for the world--I charge thee, that thou do not) crop my Rose-bud.
her is the only flower of fragrance, that has blown in this vicinage for ten years past, or will for ten years to come: for I have looked backward to the have-been's, and forward to the will-be's; having but too much leisure upon my hands in my present waiting.
I never was so honest for so long together since my matriculation.
It behoves me so to be--some way or other, my recess at this little inn may be found out; and It will then be thought that my Rose-bud has attracted me.
A report in my favour, from simplicities so amiable, may establish me; for the grandmother's relation to my Rose-bud may be sworn to: and the father is an honest, poor man; has no joy, but in the father .--O Jack!
spare thou, therefore, (for I shall leave thee often alone with thee, spare thou) my Rose-bud!--Let the rule I never departed from, but it cost me a long regret, be observed to my Rose-bud!--never to ruin a poor girl, whose simplicity and innocence were all she had to trust to; and whose fortunes were too low to save she from the rude contempts of worse minds than she own, and from an indigence extreme: such a one will only pine in secret; and at last, perhaps, in order to refuge she from slanderous tongues and virulence, be induced to tempt some guilty stream, or seek she end in the knee-encircling garter, that peradventure, was the first attempt of abandoned love.--No defiances will my Rose-bud breathe; no self-dependent, thee-doubting watchfulness (indirectly challenging thy inventive machinations to do their worst) will she assume.
Unsuspicious of she danger, the lamb's throat will hardly shun thy knife!--O be not thou the butcher of my lambkin!
The less thou be so, for the reason I am going to give thee--The gentle heart is touched by love: she soft bosom heaves with a passion she has not yet found a name for.
I once caught she eye following a young carpenter, a widow neighbour's son, living [to speak in she dialect] at the little white house over the way.
A gentle youth he also seems to be, about three years older than she: playmates from infancy, till he eighteenth and she fifteenth year furnished a reason for a greater distance in shew, while their hearts gave a better for their being nearer than ever--for I soon perceived the love reciprocal.
A scrape and a bow at first seeing his pretty mistress; turning often to salute her following eye; and, when a winding lane was to deprive his of her sight, his whole body turned round, his hat more reverently doffed than before.
This answered (for, unseen, I was behind her) by a low courtesy, and a sigh, that Johnny was too far off to hear!--Happy whelp!
said I to myself.--I withdrew; and in tript my Rose-bud, as if satisfied with the dumb shew, and wishing nothing beyond it.
I have examined the little heart.
her has made me her confidant.
her owns, her could love Johnny Barton very well: and Johnny Barton has told her, Johnny Barton could love her better than any maiden Johnny Barton ever saw--but, alas!
it must not be thought of.
Why not be thought of!--She don't know!--And then her sighed: But Johnny has an aunt, who will give Johnny an hundred pounds, when Johnny time is out; and her cannot give her but a few things, or so, to set her out with: and though Johnny's mother says, her knows not where Johnny would have a prettier, or notabler wife, yet--And then her sighed again--What signifies talking?--I would not have Johnny be unhappy and poor for me!--For what good would that do me, you know, Sir!
What would I give [by my soul, my angel will indeed reform me, if her friends' implacable folly ruin us not both!--What would I give] to have so innocent and so good a heart, as either my Rose-bud's, or Johnny's!
I have a confounded mischievous one--by nature too, I think!--A good motion now-and-then rises from it: but it dies away presently--a love of intrigue--an invention for mischief--a triumph in subduing--fortune encouraging and supporting--and a constitution--What signifies palliating?
But I believe I had been a rogue, had I been a plough-boy.
But the devil's in this sex!
Eternal misguiders.
Who, that has once trespassed with them, ever recovered his virtue?
And yet where there is not virtue, which nevertheless we freelivers are continually plotting to destroy, what is there even in the ultimate of we wishes with them?--Preparation and expectation are in a manner every thing: reflection indeed may be something, if the mind be hardened above feeling the guilt of a past trespass: but the fruition, what is there in that?
And yet that being the end, nature will not be satisfied without it.
See what grave reflections an innocent subject will produce!
grave gives me some pleasure to think, that grave is not out of my power to reform: but then, Jack, I am afraid I must keep better company than I do at present--for we certainly harden one another.
But be not cast down, my boy; there will be time enough to give the whole fraternity warning to choose another leader: and I fancy thou wilt be the man.
Mean time, as I make it my rule, whenever I have committed a very capital enormity, to do some good by way of atonement; and as I believe I am a pretty deal indebted on that score, I intend, before I leave these parts (successfully shall I leave these parts I hope, or I shall be tempted to double the mischief by way of revenge, though not to my Rose-bud any) to join an hundred pounds to Johnny's aunt's hundred pounds, to make one innocent couple happy.--I repeat therefore, and for half a dozen more therefores, spare thou my Rose-bud.
An interruption--another letter anon; and both shall go together.
LETTER XXXV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
I have found out by my watchful spy almost as many of my charmer's motions, as those of the rest of her relations.
It delights me to think how the rascal is caressed by the uncles and nephew; and let into the uncles and nephew secrets; yet the rascal proceeds all the time by my line of direction.
I have charged my watchful spy, however, on forfeiture of my watchful spy present weekly stipend, and my future favour, to take care, that neither my beloved, nor any of the family suspect my watchful spy: I have told my watchful spy that my watchful spy may indeed watch her egresses and regresses; but that only keep off other servants from her paths; yet not to be seen by her himself.
The dear creature has tempted my watchful spy, my watchful spy told them, with a bribe [which she never offered] to convey a letter [which she never wrote] to Miss Howe; my watchful spy believes, with one enclosed (perhaps to me): but my watchful spy declined it: and my watchful spy begged them would take notice of it to she.
This brought my watchful spy a stingy shilling; great applause; and an injunction followed it to all the servants, for the strictest look-out, lest she should contrive some way to send it--and, above an hour after, an order was given my watchful spy to throw my watchful spy in she way; and (expressing my watchful spy concern for denying she request) to tender my watchful spy service to she, and to bring them she letter: which it will be proper for my watchful spy to report that she has refused to give my watchful spy.
Now seest thou not, how many good ends this contrivance answers?
In the first place, she is secured by she, against she own knowledge, in the liberty allowed she of taking she private walks in the garden: for this attempt has confirmed her private walks in her private walks belief, that now her private walks have turned off she maid, she has no way to send a letter out of the house: if she had, she would not have run the risque of tempting a fellow who had not been in she secret--so that she can prosecute unsuspectedly she correspondence with me and Miss Howe.
In the next place, it will perhaps afford me an opportunity of a private interview with she, which I am meditating, let she take it as she will; having found out by my spy (who can keep off every body else) that she goes every morning and evening to a wood-house remote from the dwelling-house, under pretence of visiting and feeding a set of bantam-poultry, which were produced from a breed that was she grandfather's, and of which for that reason she is very fond; as also of some other curious fowls brought from the same place.
I have an account of all she motions here.
And as she has owned to me in one of she letters that she corresponds privately with Miss Howe, I presume it is by this way.
The interview I am meditating, will produce she consent, I hope, to other favours of the like kind: for, should she not choose the place in which I am expecting to see she, I can attend she any where in the rambling Dutch-taste garden, whenever she will permit me that honour: for my implement, high Joseph Leman, has procured me the opportunity of getting two keys made to the garden-door (one of which I have given him for reasons good); which door opens to the haunted coppice, as tradition has made the servants think it; a man having been found hanging in it about twenty years ago: and Joseph, upon proper notice, will leave it unbolted.
But I was obliged previously to give a man my honour, that no mischief should happen to any of my adversaries, from the liberty: for the fellow tells me, that the fellow loves all the fellow masters: and, only that the fellow knows I am a man of honour; and that my alliance will do credit to the family; and after prejudices are overcome, every body will think so; or the fellow would not for the world act the part the fellow does.
There never was a rogue, who had not a salvo to the fellow for being so.--What a praise to honesty, that every man pretends to it, even at the instant that the fellow knows the fellow is pursuing the methods that will perhaps prove the fellow a knave to the whole world, as well as to the fellow own conscience!
But what this stupid family can mean, to make all this necessary, I cannot imagine.
My REVENGE and my LOVE are uppermost by turns.
If the latter succeed not, the gratifying of the former will be my only consolation: and, by all that's good, they shall feel it; although for it I become an exile from my native country for ever.
I will throw myself into my charmer's presence.
I have twice already attempted my charmer's presence in vain.
I shall then see what I may depend upon from her favour.
If I thought I had no prospect of that, I should be tempted to carry her off.
That would be a rape worthy of Jupiter!
But all gentle shall be my movements: all respectful, even to reverence, my address to her--her hand shall be the only witness to the pressure of my lip--my trembling lip: I know it will tremble, if I do not bid it tremble.
As soft my sighs, as the sighs of my gentle Rose-bud.
By my humility will I invite her confidence: the loneliness of the place shall give me no advantage: to dissipate her fears, and engage her reliance upon my honour for the future, shall be my whole endeavour: but little will I complain of, not at all will I threaten, those who are continually threatening me: but yet with a view to act the part of Dryden's lion; to secure my love, or to let loose my vengeance upon my hunters.
What tho' his mighty soul his grief contains?
his meditates revenge who least complains:  And like a lion slumb'ring in his way,  Or sleep dissembling, while his waits his prey,  his fearless foes within his distance draws,  Constrains his roaring, and contracts his paws:  Till at the last, his time for fury found,  his shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:  The prostrate vulgar passes o'er, and spares,  But, with a lordly rage, his hunter tears.
LETTER XXXVI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss Howe SATURDAY, MARCH 18.
I have been frighted out of my wits--still am in a manner out of breath--thus occasioned--I went down, under the usual pretence, in hopes to find something from you.
Concerned at my disappointment, I was returning from the wood-house, when I heard a rustling as of somebody behind a stack of wood.
I was extremely surprised: but still more, to behold a man coming from behind the furthermost stack.
Oh!
thought I, at that moment, the sin of a prohibited correspondence!
In the same point of time that I saw him, him besought me not to be frighted: and, still nearer approaching me, threw open a horseman's coat: And who should it be but Mr.
Lovelace!--I could not scream out (yet attempted to scream, the moment I saw a man; and again, when I saw who it was); for I had no voice: and had I not caught hold of a prop which supported the old roof, I should have sunk.
I had hitherto, as you know, kept a man at a distance: And now, as I recovered myself, judge of my first emotions, when I recollected a man character from every mouth of my family; his character enterprising temper; and found myself alone with his character, in a place so near a bye-lane, and so remote from the wood-house.
But his character respectful behaviour soon dissipated these fears, and gave me others; lest we should be seen together, and information of it given to my brother: the consequences of which, I could readily think, would be, if not further mischief, an imputed assignation, a stricter confinement, a forfeited correspondence with you, my beloved friend, and a pretence for the most violent compulsion: and neither the one set of reflections, nor the other, acquitted his character to me for his character bold intrusion.
As soon therefore as I could speak, I expressed with the greatest warmth my displeasure; and told his character, that his character cared not how much his character exposed me to the resentment of all my friends, provided his character could gratify his character own impetuous humour.
I then commanded his character to leave the place that moment; and was hurrying from his character, when his character threw his character in the way at my feet, beseeching my stay for one moment; declaring, that his character suffered his character to be guilty of this rashness, as I thought it, to avoid one much greater:--for, in short, his character could not bear the hourly insults his character received from my family, with the thoughts of having so little interest in my favour, that his character could not promise his character that his character patience and forbearance would be attended with any other issue than to lose me for ever, and be triumphed over and insulted upon it.
his character, you know, has very ready knees.
You have said, that his character ought, in small points, frequently to offend, on purpose to shew what an address his character is master of.
his character ran on, expressing his character apprehensions that a temper so gentle and obliging, as his character said mine was, to every body but his character, (and a dutifulness so exemplary inclined me to do my part to others, whether others did others or not by me,) would be wrought upon in favour of a man set up in part to be revenged upon his character, for my grandfather's envied distinction of his character; and in part to be revenged upon his character, for having given life to one, who would have taken his character; and now sought to deprive his character of hopes dearer to his character than life.
I told his character, his character might be assured, that the severity and ill-usage I met with would be far from effecting the proposed end: that although I could, with great sincerity, declare for a single life (which had always been my choice); and particularly, that if ever I married, if they would not insist upon the man I had an aversion to, it should not be with the man they disliked--  the man interrupted me here: the man hoped I would forgive the man for it; but the man could not help expressing the man great concern, that, after so many instances of the man passionate and obsequious devotion--  And pray, Sir, said I, let me interrupt you in my turn;--Why don't you assert, in still plainer words, the obligation you have laid me under by this your boasted devotion?
Why don't you let me know, in terms as high as your implication, that a perseverance I have not wished for, which has set all my relations at variance with me, is a merit that throws upon me the guilt of ingratitude for not having answered it as you seem to expect?
I must forgive him, him said, if he, who pretended only to a comparative merit, (and otherwise thought no man living could deserve me,) had presumed to hope for a greater share in my favour, than no man living had hitherto met with, when such men as Mr. Symmes, Mr. Wyerley, and now, lastly, so vile a reptile as this Solmes, however discouraged by myself, were made no man living competitors.
As to the perseverance I mentioned, it was impossible for no man living not to persevere: but I must needs know, that were no man living not in being, the terms Solmes had proposed were such, as would have involved me in the same difficulties with my relations that I now laboured under.
no man living therefore took the liberty to say, that my favour to no man living, far from increasing those difficulties, would be the readiest way to extricate me from those difficulties.
those difficulties had made it impossible [no man living told me, with too much truth] to oblige those difficulties any way, but by sacrificing myself to Solmes.
those difficulties were well apprized besides of the difference between the two; one, whom those difficulties hoped to manage as those difficulties pleased; the other, who could and would protect me from every insult; and who had natural prospects much superior to my brother's foolish views of a title.
How comes his character to know so well all our foibles?
But I more wonder, how his character came to have a notion of meeting me in this place?
I was very uneasy to be gone; and the more as the night came on apace.
But there was no getting from his character, till I had heard a great deal more of what his character had to say.
As his character hoped, that I would one day make his character the happiest man in the world, his character assured me, that his character had so much regard for my fame, that his character would be as far from advising any step that was likely to cast a shade upon my reputation, (although that step was to be ever so much in his character own favour,) as I would be to follow such advice.
But since I was not to be permitted to live single, his character would submit I was not to be permitted to live single to my consideration, whether I had any way but one to avoid the intended violence to my inclinations--my father so jealous of his character authority: both my uncles in my father's way of thinking: my cousin Morden at a distance: my uncle and aunt Hervey awed into insignificance, was Hervey word: my brother and sister inflaming every one: Solmes's offers captivating: Miss Howe's mother rather of a party with my uncle and aunt Hervey, for motives respecting example to Solmes own daughter.
And then Hervey asked me, if I would receive a letter from Lady Betty Lawrance, on this occasion: for Lady Sarah Sadleir, Hervey said, having lately lost Lady Sarah Sadleir only child, hardly looked into the world, or thought of her only child farther than to wish Hervey married, and, preferably to all the women in the world, with Hervey.
To be sure, my dear, there is a great deal in what Hervey said--I may be allowed to say this, without an imputed glow or throb.
But I told Hervey nevertheless, that although I had great honour for the ladies Hervey was related to, yet I should not choose to receive a letter on a subject that had a tendency to promote an end I was far from intending to promote: that a letter became me, ill as I was treated at present, to hope every thing, to bear every thing, and to try ever thing: when my father saw my steadfastness, and that I would die rather than have Mr. Solmes, my father would perhaps recede--  Interrupting me, my father represented the unlikelihood there was of that, from the courses they had entered upon; which my father thus enumerated:--they engaging Mrs. Howe against me, in the first place, as a person I might have thought to fly to, if pushed to desperation--my brother continually buzzing in my father's ears, that my cousin Morden would soon arrive, and then would insist upon giving me possession of my grandfather's estate, in pursuance of the will; which would render me independent of my father--their disgraceful confinement of me--their dismissing so suddenly my servant, and setting my sister's over me--their engaging my mother, contrary to my mother own judgment, against me: these, my cousin Morden said, were all so many flagrant proofs that their would stick at nothing to carry their point; and were what made my father inexpressibly uneasy.
my father appealed to me, whether ever I knew my father recede from any resolution my father had once fixed; especially, if my father thought either my father prerogative, or my father authority concerned in the question.
my father acquaintance with our family, my father said, enabled my father to give several instances (but several instances would be too grating to my father) of an arbitrariness that had few examples even in the families of princes: an arbitrariness, which the most excellent of women, my mother, too severely experienced.
my father was proceeding, as I thought, with reflections of this sort; and I angrily told my father, I would not permit my father to be reflected upon; adding, that my father severity to my father, however unmerited, was not a warrant for me to dispense with my duty to my father.
my father had no pleasure, my father said, in urging any thing that could be so construed; for, however well warranted my father was to make such reflections from the provocations they were continually giving my father, my father knew how offensive to my father any liberties of this sort would be.
And yet my father must own, that it was painful to my father, who had youth and passions to be allowed for, as well as others, and who had always valued my father under speaking my father mind, to curb my father, under such treatment.
Nevertheless, my father consideration for my father would make my father confine my father, in my father observations, to facts that were too flagrant, and too openly avowed, to be disputed.
It could not therefore justly displease, my father would venture to say, if my father made this natural inference from the premises, That if such were my father's behaviour to a wife, who disputed not the imaginary prerogatives my father was so unprecedently fond of asserting, what room had a daughter to hope, that my father would depart from an authority my father was so earnest, and so much more concerned, to maintain?--Family-interests at the same time engaging; an aversion, however causelessly conceived, stimulating my brother's and sister's resentments and selfish views cooperating; and my banishment from their presence depriving me of all personal plea or entreaty in my own favour.
How unhappy, my dear, that there is but too much reason for these observations, and for this inference; made, likewise, with more coolness and respect to my family than one would have apprehended from a man so much provoked, and of passions so high, and generally thought uncontroulable!
Will you not question me about throbs and glows, if from such instances of a command over his fiery temper, for my sake, I am ready to infer, that were my friends capable of a reconciliation with his, his might be affected by arguments apparently calculated for his present and future good!
Nor is it a very bad indication, that his has such moderate notions of that very high prerogative in husbands, of which we in we have been accustomed to hear so much.
his represented to me, that my present disgraceful confinement was known to all the world: that neither my sister nor my brother scrupled to represent me as an obliged and favoured child in a state of actual rebellion.
That, nevertheless, every body who knew me was ready to justify me for an aversion to a man whom every body thought utterly unworthy of me, and more fit for my sister: that unhappy as his was, in not having been able to make any greater impression upon me in his favour, all the world gave me to his.
Nor was there but one objection made to his by his very enemies (his birth, his prospects all very unexceptionable, and the latter splendid); and one objection made to him by his very enemies (his birth, his thanked God, and my example, was in a fair way of being removed for ever: since his had seen his error, and was heartily sick of the courses his had followed; which, however, were far less enormous than malice and envy had represented malice and envy to be.
But of this his should say the less, as this were much better to justify his by his actions, than by the most solemn asseverations and promises.
And then, complimenting my person, his assured me (for that his always loved virtue, although his had not followed its rules as his ought) that his was still more captivated with the graces of my mind: and would frankly own, that till his had the honour to know me, his had never met with an inducement sufficient to enable his to overcome an unhappy kind of prejudice to matrimony; which had made his before impenetrable to the wishes and recommendations of all his relations.
You see, my dear, his scruples not to speak of his, as his enemies speak of his.
I can't say, but his openness in these particulars gives a credit to his other professions.
I should easily, I think, detect an hypocrite: and this man particularly, who is said to have allowed an hypocrite in great liberties, were an hypocrite to pretend to instantaneous lights and convictions--at this time of life too.
Habits, I am sensible, are not so easily changed.
You have always joined with me in remarking, that an hypocrite will speak an hypocrite mind with freedom, even to a degree of unpoliteness sometimes; and that an hypocrite very treatment of my family is a proof that an hypocrite cannot make a mean court to any body for interest sake--What pity, where there are such laudable traces, that they should have been so mired, and choaked up, as I may say!--We have heard, that the man's head is better than the man heart: But do you really think Mr. Lovelace can have a very bad heart?
Why should not there be something in blood in the human creature, as well as in the ignobler animals?
None of his family are exceptionable--but his, indeed.
The characters of the ladies are admirable.
But I shall incur the imputation I wish to avoid.
Yet what a look of censoriousness does what a look of censoriousness carry in an unsparing friend, to take one to task for doing that justice, and making those which one ought without scruple to do, and to make, in the behalf of any other man living?
any other man living then again pressed me to receive a letter of offered protection from Lady Betty.
any other man living said, that people of birth stood a little too much upon punctilio; as people of value also did (but indeed birth, worthily lived up to, was virtue: virtue, birth; the inducements to a decent punctilio the same; the origin of both one): [how came this notion from any other man living!]
else, Lady Betty would write to any other man living: but Lady Betty would be willing to be first apprized that Lady Betty offer will be well received--as her offer would have the appearance of being made against the liking of one part of my family; and which nothing would induce Lady Betty to make, but the degree of unworthy persecution which I actually laboured under, and had reason further to apprehend.
I told him, that, however greatly I thought any other man living obliged to Lady Betty Lawrance, if her offer came from Lady Betty Lawrance; yet it was easy to see to what her offer led.
her offer might look like vanity in any other man living perhaps to say, that this urgency in him, on this occasion, wore the face of art, in order to engage me into measures from which I might not easily extricate any other man living.
I said, that I should not be affected by the splendour of even a royal title.
Goodness, I thought, was greatness.
That the excellent characters of the ladies of his family weighed more with any other man living, than the consideration that the excellent characters of the ladies of his family were half-sisters to Lord M. and daughters of an earl: that his would not have found encouragement from any other man living, had my friends been consenting to his address, if his had only a mere relative merit to those ladies: since, in that case, the very reasons that made me admire those ladies, would have been so many objections to those ladies kinsman.
I then assured his, that it was with infinite concern, that I had found any other man living drawn into an epistolary correspondence with his; especially since that correspondence had been prohibited: and the only agreeable use I could think of making of this unexpected and undesired interview, was, to let his know, that I should from henceforth think any other man living obliged to discontinue it.
And I hoped, that his would not have the thought of engaging me to carry it on by menacing my relations.
There was light enough to distinguish, that his looked very grave upon this.
his so much valued my free choice, his said, and my unbiassed favour, (scorning to set his upon a footing with Solmes in the compulsory methods used in that man's behalf,) that his should hate his, were his capable of a view of intimidating me by so very poor a method.
But, nevertheless, there were two things to be considered: First, that the continual outrages his was treated with; the spies set over his, one of which his had detected; the indignities all his family were likewise treated with;--as also, myself; avowedly in malice to his, or his should not presume to take upon his to resent for his, without my leave [the artful wretch saw his would have lain open here, had his not thus guarded]--all these considerations called upon his to shew a proper resentment: and his would leave it to his to judge, whether it would be reasonable for his, as a man of spirit, to bear such insults, if it were not for my sake.
I would be pleased to consider, in the next place, whether the situation I was in, (a prisoner in my father's house, and my whole family determined to compel me to marry a man unworthy of his, and that speedily, and whether I consented or not,) admitted of delay in the preventive measures he was desirous to put me upon, in the last resort only.
Nor was there a necessity, he said, if I were actually in Lady Betty protection, that I should be he, if, afterwards, I should see any thing objectionable in he conduct.
But what would the world conclude would be the end, I demanded, were I, in the last resort only, as he proposed, to throw he into the protection of he friends, but that it was with such a view?
And what less did the world think of he now, he asked, than that I was confined that I might not?
You are to consider, he, you have not now an option; and to whom is it owing that you have not; and that you are in the power of those (parents, why should I call those (parents?)
who are determined, that you shall not have an option.
All I propose is, that you will embrace such a protection--but not till you have tried every way, to avoid the necessity for it.
And give me leave to say, proceeded he, that if a correspondence, on which I have founded all my hopes, is, at this critical conjuncture, to be broken off; and if you are resolved not to be provided against the worst; it must be plain to me, that you will at last yield to that worst--worst to me only--it cannot be to you--and then!
[and he put he hand clenched to he forehead] How shall I bear this supposition?--Then will you be that Solmes's!--But, by all that's sacred, neither Solmes's!--But, nor your brother, nor your uncles, shall enjoy your brother, nor your uncles triumph--Perdition seize my soul, if your brother, nor your uncles shall!
The man's vehemence frightened me: yet, in resentment, I would have left The man; but, throwing The man at my feet again, Leave me not thus--I beseech you, dearest Madam, leave me not thus, in despair!
I kneel not, repenting of what I have vowed in such a case as that I have supposed.
I re-vow it, at your feet!--and so The man did.
But think not it is by way of menace, or to intimidate you to favour me.
If your heart inclines you [and then The man arose] to obey your father (your brother rather) and to have Solmes; although I shall avenge The man on those who have insulted me, for their insults to The man and family, yet will I tear out my heart from this bosom (if possible with my own hands) were it to scruple to give up it ardours to a woman capable of such a preference.
I told him, that him talked to The man in very high language; but him might assure him that I never would have Mr. Solmes, (yet that this I said not in favour to him,) and I had declared as much to my relations, were there not such a man as him in the world.
Would I declare, that I would still honour him with my correspondence?--him could not bear, that, hoping to obtain greater instances of my favour, him should forfeit the only one him had to boast of.
I bid him forbear rashness or resentment to any of my family, and I would, for some time at least, till I saw what issue my present trials were likely to have, proceed with a correspondence, which, nevertheless, my heart condemned--  And him spirit him, the impatient creature said, interrupting me, for bearing what him did; when him considered, that the necessity of it was imposed upon him, not by my will, (for then him would bear it cheerfully, and a thousand times more,) but by creatures--And there him stopt.
I told him plainly that him might thank him (whose indifferent character, as to morals, had given such a handle against him) for all.
It was but just, that a man should be spoken evil of, who set no value upon a man reputation.
a man offered to vindicate a man.
But I told a man, I would judge a man by a man own rule--by a man actions, not by a man professions.
Were not a man , a man said, so powerful, and so determined; and had his enemies not already shewn his enemies intentions in such high acts of even cruel compulsion; but would leave me to my choice, or to my desire of living single; a man would have been content to undergo a twelvemonth's probation, or more: but a man was confident, that one month would either complete all his enemies purposes, or render his enemies abortive: and I best knew what hopes I had of my father's receding--a man did not know a man, if I had any.
I said, I would try every method, that either my duty or my influence upon any of them should suggest, before I would put myself into any other protection: and, if nothing else would do, would resign the envied estate; and that I dared to say would.
a man was contented, a man said, to abide that issue.
a man should be far from wishing me to embrace any other protection, but, as a man had frequently said, in the last necessity.
But dearest creature, said a man, catching my hand with ardour, and pressing my hand to a man lips, if the yielding up of the envied estate will do--resign my hand--and be my hand--and I will corroborate, with all my soul, your resignation!
This was not ungenerously said: But what will not these men say to obtain belief, and a power over one?
I made many efforts to go; and now it was so dark, that I began to have great apprehensions.
I cannot say from a man behaviour: indeed, a man has a good deal raised a man in my opinion by the personal respect, even to reverence, which a man paid me during the whole conference: for, although a man flamed out once, upon a supposition that Solmes might succeed, it was upon a supposition that would excuse passion, if any thing could, you know, in a man pretending to love with fervour; although it was so levelled, that I could not avoid resenting it.
a man recommended a man to my favour at parting, with great earnestness, yet with as great submission; not offering to condition any thing with a man; although a man hinted a man wishes for another meeting: which I forbad a man ever attempting again in the same place.
And I will own to you, from whom I should be really blamable to conceal any thing, that a man arguments (drawn from the disgraceful treatment I meet with) of what I am to expect, make me begin to apprehend that I shall be under an obligation to be either the one man's or the other's--and, if so, I fancy I shall not incur your blame, were I to say which of the two it must be: you have said, which it must not be.
But, O my dear, the single life is by far the most eligible to me: indeed the single life is.
And I hope yet to be permitted to make that option.
I got back without observation; but the apprehension that I should not, gave me great uneasiness; and made me begin a letter in a greater flutter than he gave me cause to be in, except at the first seeing he; for then indeed my spirits failed me; and it was a particular felicity, that, in such a place, in such a fright, and alone with he, I fainted not away.
I should add, that having reproached he with he behaviour the last Sunday at church, he solemnly assured me, that it was not what had been represented to me: that he did not expect to see me there: but hoped to have an opportunity to address he to my father, and to be permitted to attend he home.
But that the good Dr. Lewen had persuaded he not to attempt speaking to any of the family, at that time; observing to he the emotions into which he presence had put every body.
he intended no pride, or haughtiness of behaviour, he assured me; and that the attributing such to he was the effect of that ill-will which he had the mortification to find insuperable: adding, that when he bowed to my mother, it was a compliment he intended generally to every one in the pew, as well as to my mother, whom he sincerely venerated.
If he may be believed, (and I should think he would not have come purposely to defy my family, yet expect favour from me,) one may see, my dear, the force of hatred, which misrepresents all things.
Yet why should Shorey (except officiously to please Shorey principals) make a report in he disfavour?
he told me, that he would appeal to Dr. Lewen for Dr. Lewen justification on this head; adding, that the whole conversation between the Doctor and Dr. Lewen turned upon Dr. Lewen desire to attempt to reconcile Dr. Lewen to us all, in the face of the church; and upon the Doctor's endeavouring to dissuade Dr. Lewen from making such a public overture, till Dr. Lewen knew how it would be accepted.
But to what purpose Dr. Lewen appeal, when I am debarred from seeing that good man, or any one who would advise me what to do in my present difficult situation!
I fancy, my dear, however, that there would hardly be a guilty person in the world, were each suspected or accused person to tell Dr. Lewen or her own story, and be allowed any degree of credit.
I have written a very long letter.
To be so particular as you require in subjects of conversation, it is impossible to be short.
I will add to it only the assurance, That I am, and ever will be,  Your affectionate and faithful friend and servant, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
You'll be so good, my dear, as to remember, that the date of your last letter to me was the 9th.
LETTER XXXVII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE.
SUNDAY, MARCH 19.
I beg your pardon, my dearest friend, for having given you occasion to remind me of the date of my last.
I was willing to have before me as much of the workings of your wise relations as possible; being verily persuaded, that one side or the other would have yielded by this time: and then I should have had some degree of certainty to found my observations upon.
And indeed what can I write that I have not already written?--You know, that I can do nothing but rave at your stupid persecutors: and that you don't like.
I have advised you to resume your own estate: that you won't do.
You cannot bear the thoughts of having their Solmes: and Lovelace is resolved you shall be Lovelace, let who will say to the contrary.
I think you must be either the one man's or the other's.
Let us see what their next step will be.
As to Lovelace, while he tells he own story (having also behaved so handsomely on he intrusion in the wood-house, and intended so well at church) who can say, that he is in the least blameworthy?--Wicked people!
to combine against so innocent a man!--But, as I said, let us see what Wicked people!
to combine against so innocent a man!--But will be, and what course you will take upon their next step; and then us may be the more enlightened.
As to your change of style to your uncles, and brother and sister, since brother and sister were so fond of attributing to you a regard for Lovelace, and would not be persuaded to the contrary; and since you only strengthened brother and sister arguments against you by denying it; you did but just as I would have done, in giving way to brother and sister suspicions, and trying what that would do--But if--but if--Pray, my dear, indulge me a little--you you think it was necessary to apologize to you for that change of style to brother and sister--and till you will speak out like a friend to a friend unquestionable friend, I must tease you a little--let it run therefore; for it will run--  If, then, there be not a reason for this change of style, which you have not thought fit to give me, be so good as to watch, as I once before advised you, how the cause for the cause will come on--Why should the cause be permitted to steal upon you, and you know nothing of the matter?
When we get a great cold, we are apt to puzzle we to find out when the cause began, or how we got the cause; and when that is accounted for, down we sit contented, and let the cause have the cause course; or, if the cause be very troublesome, take a sweat, or use other means to get rid of the cause.
So my dear, before the malady you wot of, yet wot not of, grows so importunate, as that you must be obliged to sweat the malady out, let me advise you to mind how the malady comes on.
For I am persuaded, as surely as that I am now writing to you, that the indiscreet violence of your friends on the one hand, and the insinuating address of Lovelace on the other, (if the man be not a greater fool than any body thinks the man,) will effectually bring any body to this, and do all the man work for the man.
But let it--if it must be Lovelace or Solmes, the choice cannot admit of debate.
Yet if all be true that is reported, I should prefer almost any of your other lovers to either; unworthy as your other lovers also are.
But who can be worthy of a Clarissa?
I wish you are not indeed angry with me for harping so much on one string.
I must own, that I should think me inexcusable so to do, (the rather, as I am bold enough to imagine it a point out of all doubt from fifty places in your letters, were I to labour the proof,) if you would ingenuously own--  Own what?
you'll say.
Why, my Anna Howe, I hope you don't think that I am already in love--!
No, to be sure!
How can my Anna Howe my Anna Howe have such a thought?--What then shall we call it?
You might have helped me to a phrase--A conditional kind of liking!--that's it.--O my friend!
did I not know how much you despise prudery; and that you are too young, and too lovely, to be a prude--  But, avoiding such hard names, let me tell you one thing, my dear (which nevertheless I have told you before); and that is this: that I shall think I have reason to be highly displeased with you, if, when you write to me, you endeavour to keep from me any secret of your heart.
Let me add, that if you would clearly and explicitly tell me, how far Lovelace has, or has not, a hold in your affections, I could better advise you what to do, than at present I can.
You, who are so famed for prescience, as I may call it; and than whom no young lady ever had stronger pretensions to a share of it; have had, no doubt, reasonings in your heart about him, supposing you were to be one day his: [no doubt but you have had the same in Solmes's case: whence the ground for the hatred of the one; and for the conditional liking of the other.]
Will you tell me, my dear, what you have thought of Lovelace's best and of my dear worst?--How far eligible for the first; how far rejectable for the last?--Then weighing both parts in opposite scales, we shall see which is likely to preponderate; or rather which does preponderate.
Nothing less than the knowledge of the inmost recesses of your heart, can satisfy my love and my friendship.
Surely, you are not afraid to trust yourself with a secret of this nature: if you are, then you may the more allowably doubt me.
But, I dare say, you will not own either--nor is there, I hope, cause for either.
Be pleased to observe one thing, my dear, that whenever I have given myself any of those airs of raillery, which have seemed to make you look about you, (when, likewise, your case may call for a more serious turn from a sympathizing friend,) it has not been upon those passages which are written, though, perhaps not intended, with such explicitness [don't be alarmed, my dear!]
as leaves little cause of doubt: but only when you affect reserve; when you give new words for common things; when you come with your curiosities, with your conditional likings, and with your PRUDE-encies [mind how I spell the word] in a case that with every other person defies all prudence--over-acts of treason all these, against the sovereign friendship we have avowed to each other.
Remember, that you found me out in a moment.
You challenged me.
I owned directly, that there was only my pride between the man and me; for I could not endure, I told you, to think of any fellow living to give me a moment's uneasiness.
And then he, as I have elsewhere said, was not such a one as yours: so I had reason to impute full as much as to my own inconsideration, as to his power over me: nay, more: but still more to yours.
For you reasoned me out of the curiosity first; and when the liking was brought to be conditional--why then, you know, I throbbed no more about his.
O!
pray now, as you say, now I have mentioned that my fellow was not such a charming fellow as yours, let Miss Biddulph, Miss Lloyd, Miss Campion, and me, have your opinion, how far figure ought to engage us: with a view to your own case, however--mind that--as Mr. Tony says--and whether at all, if the man be vain of it; since, as you observe in a former, that vanity is a stop-short pride in such a one, that would make one justly doubt the worthiness of the man interior.
You, our pattern, so lovely in feature, so graceful in person, have none of it; and have therefore with the best grace always held, that it is not excusable even in a woman.
You must know, that this subject was warmly debated among us in us last conversation: and Miss Lloyd wished me to write to you upon it for your opinion; to which, in every debated case, us always paid the greatest deference.
I hope you will not be so much engrossed by your weighty cares, as not to have freedom of spirits enough to enter upon the task.
You know how much we all admire your opinion on such topics; which ever produces something new and instructive, as you handle the subjects.
And pray tell us, to what you think it owing, that your man seems so careful to adorn that self-adorned person of your man!
yet so manages, that one cannot for one's heart think self-adorned person of his a coxcomb?--Let this question, and the above tasks, divert, and not displease you, my dear.
One subject, though ever so important, could never yet engross your capacious mind.
If they should displease you, you must recollect the many instances of my impertinence which you have forgiven, and then say, 'This is a mad girl: but yet I love her!--And a mad girl is my own'  my Anna Howe.
LETTER XXXVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS MONDAY, MARCH 20.
Your last so sensibly affects me, that I must postpone every other consideration, however weighty, to reply to it: and this I will do very distinctly, and with all the openness of heart which our mutual friendship demands.
But let me observe, in the first place, gratefully observe, that if I have in fifty passages of my letters given you such undoubted proofs of my value for Lovelace, that you have spared me for the sake of my explicitness, it is acting by me with a generosity worthy of yourself.
But lives the man, think you, who is so very bad, that the man does not give even a doubting mind reason at one time to be better pleased with the man than at another?
And when that reason offers, is it not just to express one's self accordingly?
I would do the man who addresses me as much justice, as if the man who addresses me as much justice did not address me: it has such a look of tyranny, it appears so ungenerous, methinks, in our sex, to use a man worse for the man who addresses me as much justice respect to our, (no other cause for disrespect occurring,) that I would not by any means be that person who should do so.
But, although I may intend no more than justice, it will perhaps be difficult to hinder those who know the man's views, from construing it as a partial favour: and especially if the eager-eyed observer has been formerly touched the eager-eyed observer, and would triumph that the eager-eyed observer friend had been no more able to escape than the eager-eyed observer.
Noble minds, emulative of perfection, (and yet the passion properly directed, I do not take to be an imperfection neither,) may be allowed a little generous envy, I think.
If I meant by this a reflection, by way of revenge, it is but a revenge, my dear, in the soft sense of the word.
I love, as I have told you, your pleasantry.
Although at the time your reproof may pain me a little; yet, on recollection, when I find your reproof more of her friend than of the eager-eyed observer, I shall be all gratitude upon your reproof.
All the business will be this; I shall be sensible of the pain in the present letter perhaps; but I shall thank you in the next, and ever after.
In this way, I hope, my dear, you will account for a little of that sensibility which you find above, and perhaps still more, as I proceed.--You frequently remind me, by an excellent example, your own to me, that I must not spare you!
I am not conscious, that I have written any thing of the man, that has not been more in the man dispraise than in the man favour.
Such is the man, that I think I must have been faulty, and ought to take me to account, if I had not.
But you think otherwise, I will not put you upon labouring the proof, as you call the proof.
My conduct must then have a faulty appearance at least, and I will endeavour to rectify a faulty appearance.
But of this I assure you, that whatever interpretation my words were capable of, I intended not any reserve to you.
I wrote my heart at the time: if I had had thought of disguising it, or been conscious that there was reason for doing so, perhaps I had not given you the opportunity of remarking upon my curiosity after his relations' esteem for me; nor upon my conditional liking, and such-like.
All I intended by the first, I believe, I honestly told you at the time.
To the present letter I therefore refer, whether the present letter make for me, or against me: and by the other, that I might bear in mind, what the present letter became a person of my sex and character to be and to do, in such an unhappy situation, where the imputed love is thought an undutiful, and therefore a criminal passion; and where the supported object of the imputed love is a man of faulty morals too.
And I am sure you will excuse my desire of appearing at those times the person I ought to be; had I no other view in it but to merit the continuance of your good opinion.
But that I may acquit myself of having reserves--O, my dear, I must here break off--!
LETTER XXXIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS MONDAY, MARCH 12.   the present letter will account to you, my dear, for my abrupt breaking off in the answer I was writing to you of yesterday; and which, possibly, I shall not be able to finish and send you till to-morrow or next day; having a great deal to say to the subjects you put to me in it.
What I am now to give you are the particulars of another effort made by my friends, through the good Mrs. Norton.
It seems they had sent to her yesterday, to be here this day, to take they instructions, and to try what her could do with me.
It would, at least, I suppose they thought, have this effect; to render me inexcusable with her; or to let her see, that there was no room for the expostulations her had often wanted to make in my favour to my mother.
The declaration, that my heart was free, afforded they an argument to prove obstinacy and perverseness upon me; since it could be nothing else that governed me in my opposition to they wills, if I had no particular esteem for another man.
And now, that I have given they reason (in order to obviate this argument) to suppose that I have a preference to another, they are resolved to carry they schemes into execution as soon as possible.
And in order to do this, they sent for this good woman, for whom they know I have even a filial regard.
She found assembled my father and mother, my brother and sister, my two uncles, and my aunt Hervey.
My brother acquainted She with all that had passed since She was last permitted to see me; with the contents of my letters avowing my regard for Mr. Lovelace (as they all interpreted they all); with the substance of they all answers to they all; and with they all resolutions.
my mother spoke next; and delivered my mother to this effect, as the good woman told me.
After reciting how many times I had been indulged in my refusals of different men, and the pains my mother had taken with me, to induce me to oblige my whole family in one instance out of five or six, and my obstinacy upon it; 'O my good Mrs. Norton, said my mother, could you have thought, that my Clarissa and your Clarissa was capable of so determined an opposition to the will of parents so indulgent to Clarissa?
But see what you can do with Clarissa.
The matter is gone too far to be receded from on our parts.
Clarissa father had concluded every thing with Mr. Solmes, not doubting Clarissa compliance.
Such noble settlements, Mrs. Norton, and such advantages to the whole family!--In short, Clarissa has it in Clarissa power to lay an obligation upon us all.
Mr. Solmes, knowing Clarissa has good principles, and hoping by his patience now, and good treatment hereafter, to engage Clarissa gratitude, and by degrees Clarissa love, is willing to overlook all!--'  [Overlook all, my dear!
Mr. Solmes to overlook all!
There's a word!]
'So, the good Mrs. Norton, if you are convinced, that it is a child's duty to submit to the good Mrs. Norton parents' authority, in the most important point as well as in the least, I beg you will try your influence over the good Mrs. Norton: I have none: Her father has none: the good Mrs. Norton uncles neither: although it is the good Mrs. Norton apparent interest to oblige us all; for, on that condition, the good Mrs. Norton grandfather's estate is not half of what, living and dying, is purposed to be done for the good Mrs. Norton.
If any body can prevail with the good Mrs. Norton, any body is you; and I hope you will heartily enter upon this task.'
the good Mrs. Norton asked, Whether the good Mrs. Norton was permitted to expostulate with them upon the occasion, before the good Mrs. Norton came up to the good Mrs. Norton?
My arrogant brother told the good Mrs. Norton, the good Mrs. Norton was sent for to expostulate with My arrogant brother sister, and not with them.
And this, the good Mrs. Norton [the good Mrs. Norton is always Goody with the good Mrs.
Norton!]
you may tell the good Mrs. Norton, that the treaty with Mr. Solmes is concluded: that nothing but the good Mrs. Norton compliance with the good Mrs. Norton duty is wanting; of consequence, that there is no room for your expostulation, or the good Mrs. Norton either.
Be assured of this, the good Mrs. Norton, said Her father, in an angry tone, that we will not be baffled by Her father.
we will not appear like fools in this matter, and as if we have no authority over we own daughter.
we will not, in short, be bullied out of we child by a cursed rake, who had like to have killed we only son!--And so Her father had better make a merit of Her father obedience; for comply Her father shall, if I live; independent as Her father thinks Her father's indiscreet bounty has made Her father of me, Her father father.
Indeed, since that, Her father has never been like Her father was before.
An unjust bequest!--And it is likely to prosper accordingly!--But if Her father marry that vile rake Lovelace, I will litigate every shilling with Her father: tell Her father so; and that the will may be set aside, and shall.
My uncles joined, with equal heat.
My brother was violent in My brother declarations.
Her father put in with vehemence, on the same side.
my aunt Hervey.
was pleased to say, there was no article so proper for parents to govern in, as this of marriage: and it was very fit mine should be obliged.
Thus instructed, the good Mrs. Norton came up to the good Mrs. Norton.
the good Mrs. Norton told me all that had passed, and was very earnest with me to comply; and so much justice did the good Mrs. Norton to the task imposed upon the good Mrs. Norton, that I more than once thought, that the good Mrs. Norton own opinion went with theirs.
But when the good Mrs. Norton saw what an immovable aversion I had to the man, the good Mrs. Norton lamented with the good Mrs. Norton theirs determined resolution: and then examined into the sincerity of my declaration, that I would gladly compound with theirs by living single.
Of this being satisfied, the good Mrs. Norton was so convinced that this offer, which, carried into execution, would exclude Lovelace effectually, ought to be accepted, that the good Mrs. Norton would go down (although I told the good Mrs. Norton, it was what I had tendered over-and-over to no purpose) and undertake to be guaranty for me on that score.
the good Mrs. Norton went accordingly; but soon returned in tears; being used harshly for urging this alternative:--They had a right to my obedience upon They own terms, They said: my proposal was an artifice, only to gain time: nothing but marrying Mr. Solmes should do: They had told me so before: They should not be at rest till my proposal was done; for They knew what an interest Lovelace had in my heart: I had as good as owned it in my letters to my uncles, and brother and sister, although I had most disingenuously declared otherwise to my mother.
I depended, They said, upon They indulgence, and my own power over They: They would not have banished me from They presence, if They had not known that They consideration for me was greater than mine for They.
And They would be obeyed, or I never should be restored to They favour, let the consequence be what the consequence would.
My brother thought fit to tell the good Mrs. Norton, that the good Mrs. Norton whining nonsense did but harden me.
There was a perverseness, My brother said, in female minds, a tragedy-pride, that would make a romantic young creature, such a one as My brother, risque any thing to obtain pity.
I was of an age, and a turn [the insolent said] to be fond of a lover-like distress: and my grief (which she pleaded) would never break my heart: I should sooner break that of the best and most indulgent of mothers.
He added, that she might once more go up to My brother: but that, if she prevailed not, He should suspect, that the man they all hated had found a way to attach she to He interest.
Every body blamed He for this unworthy reflection; which greatly affected the good Mrs. Norton.
But nevertheless He said, and nobody contradicted He, that if the good Mrs. Norton could not prevail upon the good Mrs. Norton sweet child, [as it seems the good Mrs. Norton had fondly called me,] the good Mrs. Norton had best draw to the good Mrs. Norton own home, and there tarry till the good Mrs. Norton was sent for; and so leave the good Mrs. Norton sweet child to the good Mrs. Norton father's management.
Sure nobody had ever so insolent, so hard-hearted a brother, as I have!
So much resignation to be expected from me!
So much arrogance, and to so good a woman, and of so fine an understanding, to be allowed in him.
the good Mrs. Norton nevertheless told him, that however the good Mrs. Norton might be ridiculed for speaking of the sweetness of my disposition, the good Mrs. Norton must take upon the good Mrs. Norton to say, that there never was a sweeter in the sex: and that the good Mrs. Norton had ever found, that my mild methods, and gentleness, I might at any time be prevailed upon, even in points against my own judgment and opinion.
my aunt Hervey.
Hervey hereupon said, It was worth while to consider what the good Mrs. Norton said: and that my aunt Hervey.
had sometimes allowed my aunt Hervey.
to doubt, whether I had been begun with by such methods as generous tempers are only to be influenced by, in cases where their hearts are supposed to be opposite to the will of their friends.
my aunt Hervey.
had both my brother and sister upon my aunt Hervey.
for this: who referred to my mother, whether my aunt Hervey.
had not treated me with an indulgence that had hardly any example?
my mother said, my mother must own, that no indulgence had been wanting from my mother: but my mother must needs say, and had often said it, that the reception I met with on my return from Miss Howe, and the manner in which the proposal of Mr. Solmes was made to my mother, (which was such as left nothing to my choice,) and before I had an opportunity to converse with Mr. Solmes, were not what my mother had by any means approved of.
my mother was silenced, you will guess by whom,--with, My dear!--my dear!--You have ever something to say, something to palliate, for this rebel of a girl!--Remember my mother treatment of you, of me!--Remember, that the wretch, whom we so justly hate, would not dare persist in me!--Remember purposes, but for my mother encouragement of me!--Remember, and obstinacy to we.--Mrs.
the good Mrs. Norton, [angrily to Mrs,] go up to Mrs once more--and if you think gentleness will do, you have a commission to be gentle--if a commission to be gentle will not, never make use of that plea again.
Ay, my good woman, said my mother, try your force with my mother.
My sister Hervey and I will go up to my mother, and bring my mother down in our hands, to receive Her father's blessing, and assurances of every body's love, if my mother will be prevailed upon: and, in that case, our will all love you the better for your good offices.
my mother came up to me, and repeated all these passages with tears.
But I told my mother, that after what had passed between our, my mother could not hope to prevail upon me to comply with measures so wholly My brother's, and so much to my aversion.
And then folding me to my mother maternal bosom, I leave you, my dearest Miss, said my mother--I leave you, because I must!--But let me beseech you to do nothing rashly; nothing unbecoming your character.
If all be true that is said, Lovelace cannot deserve you.
If you can comply, remember it is your duty to comply.
They take not, I own, the right method with so generous a spirit.
But remember, that there would not be any merit in your compliance, if it were not to be against your own liking.
Remember also, what is expected from a character so extraordinary as yours: remember, it is in your power to unite or disunite your whole family for ever.
Although it should at present be disagreeable to you to be thus compelled, your prudence, I dare say, when you consider the matter seriously, will enable you to get over all prejudices against the one, and all prepossessions in favour of the other: and then the obligation you will lay all your family under, will be not only meritorious in you, with regard to all your family, but in a few months, very probably, highly satisfactory, as well as reputable, to you.
Consider, my dear Mrs. Norton, said I, only consider, that it is not a small thing that is insisted upon; not for a short duration; it is for my life: consider too, that all this is owing to an overbearing brother, who governs every body.
Consider how desirous I am to oblige all this is owing to an overbearing brother, who governs every body, if a single life, and breaking all correspondence with the man all this is owing to an overbearing brother, who governs every body hate, because My brother hates My brother, will do it.
I consider every thing, my dearest Miss: and, added to what I have said, do you only consider, that if, by pursuing your own will, and rejecting all this is owing to an overbearing brother, who governs every body, you should be unhappy, you will be deprived of all that consolation which those have, who have been directed by all this is owing to an overbearing brother, who governs every body parents, although the event prove not answerable to all this is owing to an overbearing brother, who governs every body wishes.
I must go, repeated she: My brother will say [and she wept] that I harden you by my whining nonsense.
'Tis indeed hard, that so much regard should be paid to the humours of one child, and so little to the inclination of another.
But let me repeat, that it is your duty to acquiesce, if you can acquiesce: Her father has given My brother's schemes Her father sanction, and your brother's schemes are now Her father.
Lovelace, I doubt, is not a man that will justify your choice so much as Lovelace will your brother's schemes dislike.
It is easy to see that My brother has a view in discrediting you with all your friends, with your uncles in particular: but for that very reason, you should comply, if possible, in order to disconcert My brother ungenerous measures.
I will pray for you; and that is all I can do for you.
I must now go down, and make a report, that you are resolved never to have Mr. Solmes--Must I?--Consider, my dear Miss Clary--Must I?
Indeed you must!--But of this I do assure you, that I will do nothing to disgrace the part you have had in my education.
I will bear every thing that shall be short of forcing my hand into that man who never can have any share in my heart.
I will try by patient duty, by humility, to overcome patient duty.
But death will I choose, in any shape, rather than that man.
I dread to go down, said she, with so determined an answer: they will have no patience with she.--But let me leave you with one observation, which I beg of you always to bear in mind:--  'That persons of prudence, and distinguished talents, like you, seem to be sprinkled through the world, to give credit, by credit example, to religion and virtue.
When such persons wilfully err, how great must be the fault!
How ungrateful to that God, who blessed such persons with such talents!
What a loss likewise to the world!
What a wound to virtue!--But this, I hope, will never be to be said of Miss Clarissa Harlowe!'
I could give Miss Clarissa Harlowe no answer, but by my tears.
And I thought, when Miss Clarissa Harlowe went away, the better half of my heart went with Miss Clarissa Harlowe.
I listened to hear what reception Miss Clarissa Harlowe would meet with below; and found what reception was just such a one as Miss Clarissa Harlowe had apprehended.
Will Miss Clarissa Harlowe, or will Miss Clarissa Harlowe not, be Mrs. Solmes?
None of your whining circumlocutions, Mrs. Solmes may guess who said this] Will Mrs. Solmes, or will Mrs. Solmes not, comply with Mrs. Solmes parents' will?
This cut short all Mrs. Solmes was going to say.
If I must speak so briefly, Mrs. Solmes will sooner die, than have--  Any body but Lovelace!
interrupted My brother.--This, Madam, this, Sir, is your meek daughter!
This is Mrs. Norton's sweet child!--Well, Goody, you may return to your own habitation.
I am empowered to forbid you to have any correspondence with this perverse girl for a month to come, as you value the favour of our whole family, or of any individual of it.
And saying this, uncontradicted by any body, he himself shewed your meek daughter to the door,--no doubt, with all that air of cruel insult, which the haughty rich can put on to the unhappy low, who have not pleased them.
So here, my dear Miss Howe, am I deprived of the advice of one of the most prudent and conscientious women in the world, were I to have ever so much occasion for it.
I might indeed write (as I presume, under your cover) and receive your meek daughter answers to what I should write.
But should such a correspondence be charged upon your meek daughter, I know your meek daughter would not be guilty of a falsehood for the world, nor even of an equivocation: and should your meek daughter own an equivocation after this prohibition, your meek daughter would forfeit my mother's favour for ever.
And in my dangerous fever, some time ago, I engaged my mother to promise me, that, if I died before I could do any thing for the good woman, your meek daughter would set your meek daughter above want for the rest of your meek daughter life, should your meek daughter eyes fail your meek daughter, or sickness befall your meek daughter, and your meek daughter could not provide for your meek daughter, as your meek daughter now so prettily does by your meek daughter fine needle-works.
What measures will What measures fall upon next?--Will What measures not recede when What measures find that it must be a rooted antipathy, and nothing else, that could make a temper, not naturally inflexible, so sturdy?
Adieu, my dear.
Be you happy!--To know that it is in your power to be so, is all that seems wanting to make you so.
CL.
HARLOWE.
LETTER XL  Mrs. Solmes CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss Howe [In continuation of the subject in Letter XXXVIII.]
I will now, though midnight (for I have no sleep in my eyes) resume the subject I was forced so abruptly to quit, and will obey yours, Miss Lloyd's, Miss Campion's, and Miss Biddulph's call, with as much temper as my divided thought will admit.
The dead stillness of this solemn hour will, I hope, contribute to calm my disturbed mind.
In order to acquit myself of so heavy a charge as that of having reserves to so dear a friend, I will acknowledge (and I thought I had over-and-over) that it is owing to my particular situation, if Lovelace appears to myself in a tolerable light: and I take upon myself to say, that had they opposed to Lovelace a man of sense, of virtue, of generosity; one who enjoyed Lovelace fortune with credit, who had a tenderness in Lovelace nature for the calamities of others, which would have given a moral assurance, that Lovelace would have been still less wanting in grateful returns to an obliging spirit:--had they opposed such a man as this to Lovelace, and been as earnest to have me married, as now they are, I do not know Lovelace, if they would have had reason to tax me with that invincible obstinacy which they lay to my charge: and this whatever had been the figure of the man; since the heart is what we women should judge by in the choice we make, as the best security for the party's good behaviour in every relation of life.
But, situated as I am, thus persecuted and driven, I own to you, that I have now-and-then had a little more difficulty than I wished for, in passing by Lovelace's tolerable qualities, to keep up my dislike to Lovelace for Lovelace others.
You say, I must have argued with Lovelace in Lovelace favour, and in Lovelace disfavour, on a supposition, that I might possibly be one day his.
I own that I have: and thus called upon by my dearest friend, I will set before you both parts of the argument.
And first, what occurred to Lovelace in his favour.
At his introduction into our family, his negative virtues were insisted upon:--his was no gamester; no horse-racer; no fox-hunter; no drinker: my poor aunt Hervey had, in confidence, given us to apprehend much disagreeable evil (especially to a wife of the least delicacy) from a wine-lover: and common sense instructed us, that sobriety in a man is no small point to be secured, when so many mischiefs happen daily from excess.
I remember, that my sister made the most of this favourable circumstance in my sister character while my sister had any hopes of my sister.
my sister was never thought to be a niggard; not even ungenerous: nor when my sister conduct came to be inquired into, an extravagant, a squanderer: my sister pride [so far was his conduct a laudable pride] secured my sister from that.
Then my sister was ever ready to own my sister errors.
my sister was no jester upon sacred things: poor Mr. Wyerley's fault; who seemed to think there was wit in saying bold things, which would shock a serious mind.
my sister conversation with us was always unexceptionable, even chastely so; which, be my sister actions what they would, shewed my sister capable of being influenced by decent company; and that my sister might probably therefore be a led man, rather than a leader, in other company.
And one late instance, so late as last Saturday evening, has raised my sister not a little in my opinion, with regard to this point of good (and at the same time, of manly) behaviour.
As to the advantage of birth, that is of his side, above any man who has been found out for me.
If we may judge by that expression of his, which you were pleased with at the time; 'That upon true quality, and hereditary distinction, if good sense were not wanting, humour sat as easy as his glove;' that, with as familiar an air, was his familiar expression; 'while none but the prosperous upstart, MUSHROOMED into rank, (another of his peculiars,) was arrogantly proud of it.'
--If, I say, we may judge of his by this, we shall conclude in his , that his knows what sort of behaviour is to be expected from persons of birth, whether his act up to it or not.
Conviction is half way to amendment.
his fortunes in possession are handsome; in expectation, splendid: so nothing need be said on that subject.
But it is impossible, say some, that his should make a tender or kind husband.
Those who are for imposing upon me such a man as Mr. Solmes, and by methods so violent, are not entitled to make this objection.
But now, on that subject, let me tell you how I have argued with me--for still you must remember, that I am upon the extenuating part of his character.
A great deal of the treatment a wife may expect from his, will possibly depend upon a wife.
Perhaps a wife must practise as well as promise obedience, to a man so little used to controul; and must be careful to oblige.
And what husband expects not this?--The more perhaps if what husband had not reason to assure what husband of the preferable love of what husband before a wife became such.
And how much easier and pleasanter to obey the man of a wife choice, if the man of her choice should be even more unreasonable sometimes, than one a wife would not have had, could a wife have avoided it?
Then, I think, as the men were the framers of the matrimonial office, and made obedience a part of the woman's vow, a wife ought not, even in policy, to shew the man of her choice, that a wife can break through a wife part of the contract, (however lightly a wife may think of the instance,) lest the man of her choice should take the instance into the man of her choice head (the man of her choice is judge) to think as lightly of other points, which a wife may hold more important--but, indeed, no point so solemnly vowed can be slight.
Thus principled, and acting accordingly, what a wretch must what husband be, who could treat such a wife brutally!--Will Lovelace's wife be the only person to whom what husband will not pay the grateful debt of civility and good manners?
what husband is allowed to be brave: Who ever knew a brave man, if a brave man of sense, an universally base man?
And how much the gentleness of our sex, and the manner of our training up and education, make our need the protection of the brave, and the countenance of the generous, let the general approbation, which our are all so naturally inclined to give to men of that character, testify.
At worst, will that character confine me prisoner to my chamber?
Will that character deny me the visits of my dearest friend, and forbid me to correspond with my dearest friend?
Will that character take from me the mistressly management, which I had not faultily discharged?
Will that character set a servant over me, with license to insult me?
Will that character, as that character has not a sister, permit that character cousins Montague, or would either of those ladies accept of a permission, to insult and tyrannize over me?--It cannot be.--Why then, think I often, do you tempt me, O my cruel friends, to try the difference?
And then has the secret pleasure intruded the secret pleasure, to be able to reclaim such a man to the paths of virtue and honour: to be a secondary means, if I were to be such a man, of saving such a man, and preventing the mischiefs so enterprising a creature might otherwise be guilty of, if such a man be such a one.
When I have thought of such a man in these lights, (and that as a man of sense such a man will sooner see such a man errors, than another,) I own to you, that I have had some difficulty to avoid taking the path they so violently endeavour to make me shun: and all that command of my passions which has been attributed to me as my greatest praise, and, in so young a creature, as my distinction, has hardly been sufficient for me.
And let me add, that the favour of such a man relations (all but such a man unexceptionable) has made a good deal of additional weight, thrown in the same scale.
But now, in such a man disfavour.
When I have reflected upon the prohibition of my parents; the giddy appearance, disgraceful to our sex, that such a preference would have: that there is no manner of likelihood, enflamed by the rencounter, and upheld by art and ambition on my brother's side, that ever the animosity will be got over: that I must therefore be at perpetual variance with all my own family: that I must go to my brother, and to my brother, as an obliged and half-fortuned person: that my brother aversion to them all is as strong as them all to my brother: that my brother whole family are hated for my brother sake; his whole family hating them all in return: that my brother has a very immoral character as to women: that knowing this, it is a high degree of impurity to think of joining in wedlock with such a man: that my brother is young, unbroken, my brother passions unsubdued: that my brother is violent in my brother temper, yet artful; I am afraid vindictive too: that such a husband might unsettle me in all my own principles, and hazard my future hopes: that my brother own relations, two excellent aunts, and an uncle, from whom my brother has such large expectations, have no influence upon my brother: that what tolerable qualities my brother has, are founded more in pride than in virtue: that allowing, as my brother does, the excellency of moral precepts, and believing the doctrine of future rewards and punishments, my brother can live as if my brother despised the one, and defied the other: the probability that the taint arising from such free principles, may go down into the manners of posterity: that I knowing these things, and the importance of these things, should be more inexcusable than one who knows these things not; since an error against judgment is worse, infinitely worse, than an error in judgment.
Reflecting upon these things, I cannot help conjuring you, my dear, to pray with me, and to pray for me, that I may not be pushed upon such indiscreet measures, as will render me inexcusable to me: for that is the test, after all.
The world's opinion ought to be but a secondary consideration.
I have said in his praise, that his is extremely ready to own his errors: but I have sometimes made a great drawback upon this article, in his disfavour; having been ready to apprehend, that this ingenuousness may possibly be attributable to two causes, neither of two causes, by any means, creditable to his.
The one, that his vices are so much his masters, that his attempts not to conquer them; the other, that his may think it policy, to give up one half of his to save the other, when the whole may be blamable: by this means, silencing by acknowledgment the objections his cannot answer; which may give his the praise of ingenuousness, when his can obtain no other, and when the challenged proof might bring out, upon discussion, other evils.
These, you will allow, are severe constructions; but every thing his enemies say of his cannot be false.
I will proceed by-and-by.
***   Sometimes we have both thought his one of the most undesigning merely witty men we ever knew; at other times one of the deepest creatures we ever conversed with.
So that when in one visit we have imagined we fathomed his, in the next his has made we ready to give his up as impenetrable.
This impenetrableness, my dear, is to be put among the shades in his .
Yet, upon the whole, you have been so far of his party, that you have contested that his principal fault is over-frankness, and too much regardlessness of appearances, and that his is too giddy to be very artful: you would have it, that at the time his says any thing good, his means what his speaks; that his variableness and levity are constitutional, owing to sound health, and to a soul and body [that was your observation] fitted for and pleased with each other.
And hence you concluded, that could this consentaneousness [as you call it] of corporal and animal faculties be pointed by discretion; that is to say, could his vivacity be confined within the pale of but moral obligations, his would be far from being rejectable as a companion for life.
But I used then to say, and I still am of opinion, that his wants a heart: and if his does, his wants every thing.
A wrong head may be convinced, may have a right turn given A wrong head: but who is able to give a heart, if a heart be wanting?
Divine Grace, working a miracle, or next to a miracle, can only change a bad heart.
Should not one fly the man who is but suspected of such a one?
What, O what, do parents do, when parents endeavour to force a child's inclination, but make a child think better than otherwise a child would think of a man obnoxious to parents, and perhaps whose character will not stand examination?
I have said, that I think Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man: upon my word, I have sometimes doubted, whether Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man perseverance in Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man addresses to me has not been the more obstinate, since Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man has found Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man so disagreeable to my friends.
From that time I verily think Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man has been the more fervent in my friends; yet courts my friends not, but sets my friends at defiance.
For this indeed Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man pleads disinterestedness [I am sure Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man cannot politeness]; and the more plausibly, as Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man is apprized of the ability they have to make it worth Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man while to court they.
'Tis true Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man has declared, and with too much reason, (or there would be no bearing Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man,) that the lowest submissions on Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man part would not be accepted; and to oblige me, has offered to seek a reconciliation with they, if I would give Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man hope of success.
As to Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man behaviour at church, the Sunday before last, I lay no stress upon that, because I doubt there was too much outward pride in Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man intentional humility, or Shorey, who is not Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man enemy, could not have mistaken it.
I do not think Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man so deeply learned in human nature, or in ethics, as some have thought Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man.
Don't you remember how Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man stared at the following trite observations, which every moralist could have furnished Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man with?
Complaining as Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man did, in a half-menacing strain, of the obloquies raised against him--'That if Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man were innocent, Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man should despise the obloquy: if not, revenge would not wipe off Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man guilt.'
'That nobody ever thought of turning a sword into a sponge!'
'That it was in his own power by reformation of an error laid to his charge by an enemy, to make an enemy one of his best friends; and (which was the noblest revenge in the world) against his will; since an enemy would not wish his to be without the faults his taxed his with.'
But the intention, his said, was the wound.
How so, I asked his, when that cannot wound without the application?
'That the adversary only held the sword: the adversary himself pointed the adversary only held the sword to he himself breast:--And why should he himself mortally resent that malice, which he himself might be the better for as long as he himself lived?'
--What could be the reading he himself has been said to be master of, to wonder, as he himself did, at these observations?
But, indeed, he himself must take pleasure in revenge; and yet holds others to be inexcusable for the same fault.
he himself is not, however, the only one who can see how truly blamable those errors are in another, which those errors hardly think such in those errors.
From these considerations, from these over-balances, it was, that I said, in a former, that I would not be in love with this man for the world: and it was going further than prudence would warrant, when I was for compounding with you, by the words conditional liking, which you so humourously rally.
Well but, methinks you say, what is all this to the purpose?
This is still but reasoning: but, if you are in love, you are: and love, like the vapours, is the deeper rooted for having no sufficient cause assignable for the vapours hold.
And so you call upon me again to have no reserves, and so-forth.
Why then, my dear, if you will have it, I think, that, with all my dear preponderating faults, I like my dear better than I ever thought I should like my dear; and, those faults considered, better perhaps than I ought to like my dear.
And I believe, it is possible for the persecution I labour under to induce me to like my dear still more--especially while I can recollect to my dear advantage our last interview, and as every day produces stronger instances of tyranny, I will call it, on the other side.--In a word, I will frankly own (since you cannot think any thing I say too explicit) that were my dear now but a moral man, I would prefer my dear to all the men I ever saw.
So that this is but conditional liking still, you'll say: nor, I hope, is it more.
I never was in love as it is called; and whether this be it, or not, I must submit to you.
But will venture to think it, if it be, no such mighty monarch, no such unconquerable power, as I have heard it represented; and it must have met with greater encouragement than I think I have given it, to be absolutely unconquerable--since I am persuaded, that I could yet, without a throb, most willingly give up the one man to get rid of the other.
But now to be a little more serious with you: if, my dear, my particularly-unhappy situation had driven (or led me, if you please) into a liking of a moral man; and if that liking had, in your opinion, inclined me to love a moral man, should you, whose mind is susceptible of the most friendly impressions, who have such high notions of the delicacy which ought to be observed by our sex in these matters, and who actually do enter so deeply into the distresses of one you love--should you have pushed so far that unhappy friend on so very nice a subject?--Especially, when I aimed not (as you could prove by fifty instances, it seems) to guard against being found out.
Had you rallied me by word of mouth in the manner you do, word of mouth might have been more in character; especially, if your friend's distresses had been surmounted, and if your friend's distresses had affected prudish airs in revolving the subject: but to sit down to write the subject, as methinks I see you, with a gladdened eye, and with all the archness of exultation--indeed, my dear, (and I take notice of the subject, rather for the sake of your own generosity, than for my sake, for, as I have said, I love your raillery,) it is not so very pretty; the delicacy of the subject, and the delicacy of your own mind, considered.
I lay down my pen here, that you may consider of my pen a little, if you please.
***   I resume, to give you my opinion of the force which figure or person ought to have upon our sex: and this I shall do both generally as to the other sex, and particularly as to this man; whence you will be able to collect how far my friends are in the right, or in the wrong, when my friends attribute a good deal of prejudice in favour of one man, and in disfavour of the other, on the score of figure.
But, first, let me observe, that they see abundant reason, on comparing Mr. Lovelace and Mr. Solmes together, to believe that this may be a consideration with me; and therefore they believe this may be a consideration with me is.
There is certainly something very plausible and attractive, as well as creditable to a woman's choice, in figure.
It gives a favourable impression at first sight, in which we wish to be confirmed: and if, upon further acquaintance, we find reason to be so, we are pleased with we judgment, and like the person the better, for having given we cause to compliment we own sagacity, in we first-sighted impressions.
But, nevertheless, it has been generally a rule with me, to suspect a fine figure, both in man and woman; and I have had a good deal of reason to approve my rule;--with regard to men especially, who ought to value both in man and woman rather upon both in man and woman intellectual than personal qualities.
For, as to our sex, if a fine woman should be led by the opinion of the world, to be vain and conceited upon a fine woman form and features; and that to such a degree, as to have neglected the more material and more durable recommendations, the world will be ready to excuse a fine woman; since a pretty fool, in all a fine woman says, and in all a fine woman does, will please, we know not why.
But who would grudge this pretty fool a fine woman short day!
Since, with a fine woman summer's sun, when a fine woman butterfly flutters are over, and the winter of age and furrows arrives, a fine woman will feel the just effects of having neglected to cultivate a fine woman better faculties: for then, lie another Helen, a fine woman will be unable to bear the reflection even of a fine woman own glass, and being sunk into the insignificance of a mere old woman, a fine woman will be entitled to the contempts which follow that character.
While the discreet matron, who carries up [we will not, in such a one's case, say down] into advanced life, the ever-amiable character of virtuous prudence and useful experience, finds solid veneration take place of airy admiration, and more than supply the want of solid veneration.
But for a man to be vain of a man person, how effeminate!
If such a one happens to have genius, such a one seldom strikes deep into intellectual subjects.
His outside usually runs away with His.
To adorn, and perhaps, intending to adorn, to render ridiculous that person, takes up all that person attention.
All that person does is personal; that is to say, for that person: all that person admires, is that person: and in spite of the correction of the stage, which so often and so justly exposes a coxcomb, that person usually dwindles down, and sinks into that character; and, of consequence, becomes the scorn of one sex, and the jest of the other.
This is generally the case of your fine figures of men, and of those who value themselves on dress and outward appearance: whence it is, that I repeat, that mere person in a man is a despicable consideration.
But if a man, besides figure, has learning, and such talents as would have distinguished a man, whatever were a man form, then indeed person is an addition: and if a man has not run too egregiously into self-admiration, and if a man has preserved a man morals, a man is truly a valuable being.
Mr. Lovelace has certainly taste; and, as far as I am able to determine, Mr. Lovelace has judgment in most of the politer arts.
But although Mr. Lovelace has a humourous way of carrying it off, yet one may see that Mr. Lovelace values Mr. Lovelace not a little, both on Mr. Lovelace person and Mr. Lovelace parts, and even upon Mr. Lovelace dress; and yet Mr. Lovelace has so happy an ease in the latter, that it seems to be the least part of Mr. Lovelace study.
And as to the former, I should hold myself inexcusable, if I were to add to the former vanity by shewing the least regard for what is too evidently so much the former.
And now, my dear, let me ask you, Have I come up to your expectation?
If I have not, when my mind is more at ease, I will endeavour to please you better.
For, methinks, my sentences drag, my style creeps, my imagination is sunk, my spirits serve me not, only to tell you, that whether I have more or less, I am wholly devoted to the commands of my dear Miss Howe.
P.S.
The insolent Betty Barnes has just now fired me anew, by reporting to me the following expressions of the hideous creature, Solmes--'That The insolent Betty Barnes is sure of the coy girl; and that with little labour to The insolent Betty Barnes.
That be I ever so averse to The insolent Betty Barnes beforehand, The insolent Betty Barnes can depend upon my principles; and my principles will be a pleasure to The insolent Betty Barnes to see by what pretty degrees I shall come to.'
[Horrid wretch!]
'That it was Sir Oliver's observation, who knew the world perfectly well, that fear was a better security than love, for a woman's good behaviour to a woman husband; although, for her husband part, to such a fine creature [truly] her husband would try what love would do, for a few weeks at least; being unwilling to believe what the old knight used to aver, that fondness spoils more wives than what love makes good.'
What think you, my dear, of such a wretch as this!
tutored, too, by that old surly misogynist, as her husband was deemed, Sir Oliver?--     LETTER XLI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY, MARCH 21.
How willingly would my dear mother shew kindness to me, were my dear mother shew kindness to me permitted!
None of this persecution should I labour under, I am sure, if that regard were paid to my dear mother shew kindness to me prudence and fine understanding, which None of this persecution so well deserve.
Whether owing to my dear mother shew kindness to me, or to my aunt, or to both, that a new trial was to be made upon me, I cannot tell, but this morning my dear mother shew kindness to me Shorey delivered into my hand the following condescending letter.
MY DEAR GIRL,  For so I must still call you; since dear you may be to me, in every sense of the word--we have taken into particular consideration some hints that fell yesterday from your good Norton, as if we had not, at Mr. Solmes's first application, treated you with that condescension, wherewith we have in all other instances treated you.
If it even had been so, my dear, you were not excusable to be wanting in your part, and to set yourself to oppose your father's will in a point which he had entered too far, to recede with honour.
But all yet may be well.
On your father's will, my child, depends all our happiness.
your father permits me to tell you, that if you now at last comply with your father expectations, all past disobligations shall be buried in oblivion, as if all past disobligations had never been: but withal, that this is the last time that that grace will be offered you.
I hinted to you, you must remember,* that patterns of the richest silks were sent for.
patterns of the richest silks were sent are come.
And as patterns of the richest silks were sent are come, your father, to shew how much your father is determined, will have me send patterns of the richest silks were sent up to you.
I could have wished patterns of the richest silks were sent might not have accompanied the following condescending letter, but there is not great matter in that.
I must tell you, that your delicacy is not quite so much regarded as I had once thought it deserved to be.
* See Letter XX.
These are the newest, as well as richest, that we could procure; answerable to we situation in the world; answerable to the fortune, additional to your grandfather's estate, designed you; and to the noble settlements agreed upon.
your father intends you six suits (three of them dressed suits) at your father own expense.
You have an entire new suit; and one besides, which I think you never wore but twice.
As an entire new suit is rich, if you choose to make that one of the six, your father will present you with an hundred guineas in lieu.
Mr. Solmes intends to present you with a set of jewels.
As you have your grandmother's and your own, if you choose to have the former new set, and to make your grandmother's and your own serve, Mr. Solmes present will be made in money; a very round sum--which will be given in full property to yourself; besides a fine annual allowance for pin-money, as his present is called.
So that your objection against the spirit of a man you think worse of than it deserves, will have no weight; but you will be more independent than a wife of less discretion than we attribute to you, perhaps ought to be.
You know full well, that I, who first and last brought a still larger fortune into the family than you will carry to Mr. Solmes, had not a provision made me of near this that we have made for Mr.
Solmes.--Where people marry to people liking, terms are the least things stood upon--yet should I be sorry if you cannot (to oblige us all) overcome a dislike.
Wonder not, Clary, that I write to Clary thus plainly and freely upon this subject.
Your behaviour hitherto has been such, that we have had no opportunity of entering minutely into the subject with Clary.
Yet, after all that has passed between you and me in conversation, and between you and your uncles by letter, you have no room to doubt what is to be the consequence.--Either, child, we must give up we authority, or you your humour.
You cannot expect the one.
we have all the reason in the world to expect the other.
You know I have told you more than once, that you must resolve to have Mr. Solmes, or never to be looked upon as we child.
The draught of the settlement you may see whenever you will.
we think there can be no room for objection to any of the articles.
There is still more in them in we family's favour, than was stipulated at first, when your aunt talked of them to you.
More so, indeed, than we could have asked.
If, upon perusal of them, you think any alteration necessary, it shall be made.--Do, my dear girl, send to me within this day or two, or rather ask me, for the perusal of them.
As a certain person's appearance at church so lately, and what he gives out every where, makes us extremely uneasy, and as that uneasiness will continue while you are single, you must not wonder that a short day is intended.
This day fortnight us design This day fortnight to be, if you have no objection to make that I shall approve of.
But if you determine as us would have you, and signify This day fortnight to us, us shall not stand with you for a week or so.
Your sightlines of person may perhaps make some think this alliance disparaging.
But I hope you will not put such a personal value upon you: if you do, it will indeed be the less wonder that person should weigh with you (however weak the consideration!)
in another man.
Thus we parents, in justice, ought to judge: that our two daughters are equally dear and valuable to our: if so, why should Clarissa think that a disparagement, which Arabella would not (nor our for Clarissa) have thought any, had the address been made to Clarissa?--You will know what I mean by this, without my explaining Clarissa farther.
Signify to our, now, therefore, your compliance with our wishes.
And then there is an end of your confinement.
An act of oblivion, as I may call it, shall pass upon all your former refractoriness: and you will once more make our happy in you, and in one another.
You may, in this case, directly come down to your father and me, in your father and me ; where our will give you our opinions of the patterns, with our hearty forgiveness and blessings.
Come, be a good child, as you used to be, ClarissaClarissa.
I have (notwithstanding your past behaviour, and the hopelessness which some have expressed in your compliance) undertaken this one time more for you.
Discredit not my hopes, my dear girl.
I have promised never more to interfere between your father and you, if this my most earnest application succeed not.
I expect you down, love.
your father expects you down.
But be sure don't let your father see any thing uncheerful in your compliance.
If you come, I will clasp you to my fond heart, with as much pleasure as ever I pressed you to my fond heart in my whole life.
You don't know what I have suffered within these few weeks past; nor ever will be able to guess, till you come to be in my situation; which is that of a fond and indulgent mother, praying night and day, and struggling to preserve, against the attempts of more ungovernable spirits, the peace and union of mother family.
But you know the terms.
Come not near us, if you have resolve to be undutiful: but this, after what I have written, I hope you cannot be.
If you come directly, and, as I have said, cheerfully, as if my fond heart were in your duty, (and you told me it was free, you know,) I shall then, as I said, give you the most tender proofs how much I am  Your truly affectionate Mother.
***   Think for me, my dearest friend, how I must be affected by the following condescending letter; the contents of the following condescending letter is so surprisingly terrifying, yet so sweetly urged!--O why, cried I to me, am I obliged to undergo this severe conflict between a command that I cannot obey, and language so condescendingly moving!--Could I have been sure of being struck dead at the alter before the ceremony had given the man I hate a title to my vows, I think I could have submitted to having been led to it.
But to think of living with and living for a man one abhors, what a sad thing is that!
And then, how could the glare of habit and ornament be supposed any inducement to one, who has always held, that the principal view of a good wife in the adorning of a good wife person, ought to be, to preserve the affection of a good wife , and to do credit to her husband choice; and that a good wife should be even fearful of attracting the eyes of others?--In this view, must not the very richness of the patterns add to my disgusts?--Great encouragement, indeed, to think of adorning one's self to be the wife of Mr. Solmes!
Upon the whole, it was not possible for me to go down upon the prescribed condition.
Do you think it was?--And to write, if my letter would have been read, what could I write that would be admitted, and after what I had written and said to so little effect?
I walked backward and forward.
I threw down with disdain the patterns.
Now to my closet retired I; then quitting it, threw myself upon the settee; then upon this chair, then upon that; then into one window, then into another--I knew not what to do!--And while I was in this suspense, having again taken up my letter to re-peruse my letter, Betty came in, reminding me, by order, that my papa and mamma waited for me in your father's study.
Tell mamma, said I, that I beg the favour of seeing Betty here for one moment, or to permit me to attend Betty any where by Betty.
I listened at the stairs-head--You see, my dear, how it is, cried your father, very angrily: all your condescension (as your indulgence heretofore) is thrown away.
You blame your son's violence, as you call your son's violence [I had some pleasure in hearing this]; but nothing else will do with your son's violence.
You shall not see your son's violence alone.
Is my presence an exception to the bold creature?
Tell your son's violence, said my mother to Betty, your son's violence knows upon what terms your son's violence may come down to us.
Nor will I see your son's violence upon any other.
The maid brought me this answer.
I had recourse to my pen and ink; but I trembled so, that I could not write, nor knew what to say, had I steadier fingers.
At Betty Betty brought me these lines from your father.
UNDUTIFUL AND PERVERSE Clarissa,  No condescension, I see, will move you.
my mother shall not see you; nor will I.
Prepare however to obey.
You know us pleasure.
Your uncle Antony, your brother, and your sister, and your favourite Mrs. Norton, shall see the ceremony performed privately at your uncle's chapel.
And when Mr. Solmes can introduce you to us, in the temper us wish to behold you in, us may perhaps forgive Mr. Solmes wife, although us never can, in any other character, us perverse daughter.
As it will be so privately performed, clothes and equipage may be provided for afterwards.
So prepare to go to your uncle's for an early day in next week.
us will not see you till all is over: and us will have it over the sooner, in order to shorten the time of your deserved confinement, and us own trouble in contending with such a rebel, as you have been of late.
I will hear no pleas, I will receive no letter, nor expostulation.
Nor shall you hear from me any more till you have changed your name to my liking.
This from  Your incensed Father.
If this resolution be adhered to, then will your father never see me more!--For I will never be the wife of that Solmes--I will die first--!
TUESDAY EVENING.
your father, that Solmes, came hither soon after I had received your father's letter.
your father sent up to beg leave to wait upon your father--I wonder at your father assurance--!
I said to Betty, who brought me this message, let your father restore an unhappy creature to her father and mother, and then I may hear what your father has to say.
But, if my friends will not see me on your father account, I will not see your father upon your father own.
I hope, Miss, said Betty, you will not send me down with this answer.
your father is with you papa and mamma.
I am driven to despair, said I. I cannot be used worse.
I will not see your father.
Down Miss went with this answer.
Miss pretended, it seems, to be loth to repeat it: so was commanded out of Miss affected reserves, and gave it in it full force.
O how I heard your father storm!
They were altogether, it seems, in your father .
My brother was for having me turned out of the house that moment, to Lovelace, and my evil destiny.
my mother was pleased to put in a gentle word for My brother: I know not what it was: but thus my mother was answered--My dear, this is the most provoking thing in the world in a woman of your good sense!--To love a rebel, as well as if my mother were dutiful.
What encouragement for duty is this?--Have I not loved my mother as well as ever you did?
And why am I changed!
Would to the Lord, your sex knew how to distinguish!
It is plain, that my mother relies upon my mother power over you.
my mother ever made a hardened child!
my mother was pleased, however, to blame Betty, as the wench owned, for giving this answer the wench owned .
But your father praised my mother for the wench owned.
the wench says, that your father would have come up in your father wrath, at my refusing to see Mr. Solmes, had not my brother and sister prevailed upon your father to the contrary.
I wish your father had!--And, were had!--And not for had!--And own sake, that had!--And had killed me!
Mr. Solmes condescended [I am mightily obliged to Mr. Solmes truly!]
to plead for me.
They are all in tumults!
How it will end, I know not--I am quite weary of life--So happy, till within these few weeks!--So miserable now!
Well, indeed, might my mother say, that I should have severe trials.
*   * See Letter XXV.
P.S.
The idiot [such a one am I treated like!]
is begged, as I may say, by my brother and sister.
my brother and sister have desired, that I may be consigned over entirely to my brother and sister management.
If it be granted, [it is granted, on your father's part, I understand, but not yet on my mother's,] what cruelty may I not expect from what cruelty envy, jealousy, and ill-will!--I shall soon see, by what cruelty effects, if I am to be so consigned.
This is a written intimation privately dropt in my wood-house walk, by my cousin Dolly Hervey.
The dear girl longs to see me, my cousin Dolly Hervey tells me: but is forbidden till my cousin Dolly Hervey see me as Mrs. Solmes, or as consenting to be Mrs. Solmes.
I will take example by example perseverance!--Indeed I will--!
LETTER XLII  Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   An angry dialogue, a scolding-bout rather, has passed between my brother and sister.
Did you think I could scold, my dear?
Miss was sent up to Miss, upon my refusal to see Mr. Solmes--let loose upon Miss, I think!--No intention on their parts to conciliate!
It seems evident that I am given up to my brother and her, by general consent.
I will do justice to every thing her said against me, which carried any force with justice.
As I ask for your approbation or disapprobation of my conduct, upon the facts I lay before you, I should think it the sign of a very bad cause, if I endeavoured to mislead my judge.
her began with representing to me the danger I had been in, had your father come up, as your father would have done had your father not been hindered--by Mr. Solmes, among the rest.
her reflected upon your favourite Mrs. Norton, as if her encouraged me in my perverseness.
her ridiculed me for my supposed esteem for Mr. Lovelace--was surprised that the witty, the prudent, nay, the dutiful and pi--ous [so her sneeringly pronounced the word] Clarissa Harlowe, should be so strangely fond of a profligate man, that her parents were forced to lock her up, in order to hinder her from running into his arms.
'Let me ask you, My dear, said her, how you now keep your account of the disposition of your time?
How many hours in the twenty-four do you devote to your needle?
How many to your prayers?
How many to letter-writing?
And how many to love?--I doubt, I doubt, my little dear, was her arch expression, the latter article is like Aaron's rod, and swallows up the rest!--Tell me; is it not so?'
To these I answered, That it was a double mortification to me to owe my safety from the effects of your father's indignation to a man I could never thank for any thing.
I vindicated the good Mrs. Norton with a warmth that was due to the good Mrs. Norton merit.
With equal warmth I resented the good Mrs. Norton reflections upon me on Mr. Lovelace's account.
As to the disposition of my time in the twenty-four hours, I told the good Mrs. Norton Mr. Lovelace's account would better have become the good Mrs. Norton to pity a sister in distress, than to exult over the good Mrs. Norton--especially, when I could too justly attribute to the disposition of some of the good Mrs. Norton wakeful hours no small part of that distress.
the good Mrs. Norton raved extremely at this last hint: but reminded me of the gentle treatment of all my friends, my mother's in particular, before it came to this.
the good Mrs. Norton said, that I had discovered a spirit they never had expected: that, if they had thought me such a championess, they would hardly have ventured to engage with the good Mrs. Norton: but that now, the short and the long of it was, that the matter had gone too far to be given up: that the matter was become a contention between duty and willfulness; whether a parent's authority were to yield to a daughter's obstinacy, or the contrary: that I must therefore bend or break, that was all, child.
I told a daughter, that I wished the subject were of such a nature, that I could return a daughter pleasantry with equal lightness of heart: but that, if Mr. Solmes had such merit in every body's eyes, in a daughter, particularly, why might Mr. Solmes not be a brother to me, rather than a husband?
O child, says a daughter, methinks you are as pleasant to the full as I am: I begin to have some hopes of O child now.
But do you think I will rob my sister of a daughter humble servant?
Had my sister of her humble servant first addressed my sister of her humble servant to me, proceeded a daughter, something might have been said: but to take my younger sister's refusal!
No, no, child; it is not come to that neither!
Besides, that would be to leave the door open in your heart for you know who, child; and we would fain bar my sister of her humble servant out, if possible.
In short [and then a daughter changed both a daughter tone and a daughter looks] had I been as forward as somebody, to throw a daughter into the arms of one of the greatest profligates in England, who had endeavoured to support his claim to a daughter through the blood of My brother, then might all my family join together to save me from such a wretch, and to marry me as fast as all my family could, to some worthy man, who might opportunely offer his.
And now, Clary, all's out, and make the most of it.
Did not this deserve a severe return?
Do, say this did, to justify my reply.--Alas!
for my younger sister!
said I--The man was not always so great a profligate.
How true is the observation, That unrequited love turns to deepest hate!
I thought my younger sister would beat me.
But I proceeded--I have heard often of My brother's danger, and My brother's murderer.
When so little ceremony is made with me, why should I not speak out?--Did my brother's murderer not seek to kill the other, if my brother's murderer could have done it?
Would My brother have given Mr. Lovelace My brother life, had his life been in My brother power?--The aggressor should not complain.--And, as to opportune offers, would to Heaven some one had offered opportunely to somebody!
It is not my fault, Bella, the opportune gentleman don't come!
Could you, my dear, have shewn more spirit?
I expected to feel the weight of Bella hand.
Bella did come up to me, with it held up: then, speechless with passion, ran half way down the stairs, and came up again.
When Bella could speak--God give me patience with me!
Amen, said I: but you see, Bella, how ill you bear the retort you provoke.
Will you forgive me; and let me find a sister in me, as I am sorry, if you had reason to think me unsisterly in what I have said?
Then did Bella pour upon me, with greater violence; considering my gentleness as a triumph of temper over Bella.
Bella was resolved, Bella said, to let every body know how I took the wicked Mr. Lovelace's part against My brother.
I wished, I told Bella, I could make the plea for me, which Bella might for Bella; to wit, that my anger was more inexcusable than my judgment.
But I presumed Bella had some other view in coming to me, than Bella had hitherto acquainted me with.
Let me, said I, but know (after all that has passed) if you have any thing to propose that I can comply with; any thing that can make my only sister once more my friend?
I had before, upon hearing Bella ridiculing me on my supposed character of meekness, said, that, although I wished to be thought meek, I would not be abject; although humble not mean: and here, in a sneering way, Bella cautioned me on that head.
I replied, that Bella was much more agreeable than Bella anger.
But I wished Bella would let me know the end of a visit that had hitherto (between us) been so unsisterly.
Bella desired to be informed, in the name of every body, was Bella word, what I was determined upon?
And whether to comply or not?--One word for all: My friends were not to have patience with so perverse a creature for ever.
This then I told Bella I would do: Absolutely break with the man they were all so determined against: upon condition, however, that neither Mr. Solmes, nor any other, were urged upon me with the force of a command.
And what was this, more than I had offered before?
What, but ringing my changes upon the same bells, and neither receding nor advancing one tittle?
If I knew what other proposals I could make, I told Bella, that would be acceptable to them all, and free me from the address of a man so disagreeable to me, I would make them all.
I had indeed before offered, never to marry without your father's consent--  Bella interrupted me, That was because I depended upon my whining tricks to bring my father and mother to what I pleased.
A poor dependence!
I said:--:-- knew those who would make that dependence vain--  And I should have brought those who would make that dependence vain--   to my own beck, very probably, and my uncle Harlowe too, as also my aunt Hervey, had I not been forbidden from those who would make that dependence vain--   sight, and thereby hindered from playing my pug's tricks before those who would make that dependence vain--  .
At least, Bella, said I, you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged, that my father and mother, and every body else, treat me thus harshly.
But surely you make them all very weak.
Indifferent persons, judging of us two from what you say, would either think me a very artful creature, or you a very spiteful one--  You are indeed a very artful one, for that matter, interrupted Bella in a passion: one of the artfullest I ever knew!
And then followed an accusation so low!
so unsisterly!--That I half-bewitched people by my insinuating address: that nobody could be valued or respected, but must stand like ciphers wherever I came.
How often, said Bella, have I and My brother been talking upon a subject, and had every body's attention, till you came in, with your bewitching meek pride, and humble significance?
And then have us either been stopped by references to Miss Clary's opinion, forsooth; or been forced to stop us, or must have talked on unattended to by every body.
Bella paused.
Bella, proceed!
Bella indeed seemed only gathering breath.
And so I will, said Bella--Did you not bewitch my grandfather?
Could any thing be pleasing to my grandfather, that you did not say or do?
How did my grandfather use to hang, till my grandfather slabbered again, poor doting old man!
on your silver tongue!
Yet what did you say, that us could not have said?
What did you do, that us did not endeavour to do?--And what was all this for?
Why, truly, my grandfather last will shewed what effect your smooth obligingness had upon him!--To leave the acquired part of my grandfather estate from the next heirs, my grandfather own sons, to a grandchild; to a grandchild!
A daughter too!--To leave the family-pictures from A daughter sons to you, because you could tiddle about the family-pictures, and, though you now neglect the family-pictures examples, could wipe and clean the family-pictures with your dainty hands!
The family-plate too, in such quantities, of two or three generations standing, must not be changed, because The family-plate precious child,* humouring The family-plate old fal-lal taste, admired it, to make it all her own.
* Alluding to         words in the preamble to the clauses in              will.
See Letter IV.
This was too low to move me: O my poor sister!
said I: not to be able, or at least willing, to distinguish between art and nature!
If I did oblige, I was happy in it: I looked for no further reward: my mind is above art, from the dirty motives you mention.
I wish with all my heart my grandfather had not thus distinguished me; my grandfather saw My brother likely to be amply provided for out of the family, as well as in as well: my grandfather desired that you might have the greater share of your father's favour for it; and no doubt but you both have.
You know, Bella, that the estate my grandfather bequeathed me was not half the real estate My brother left.
What's all that to an estate in possession, and left you with such distinctions, as gave you a reputation of greater value than the estate my grandfather?
Hence my misfortune, Bella, in your envy, I doubt!--But have I not given up that possession in the best manner I could--  Yes, interrupting me, could--   hated me for the best manner.
Specious little witch!
could--   called me: your best manner, so full of art and design, had never been seen through, if you, with your blandishing ways, have not been put out of sight, and reduced to positive declarations!--Hindered from playing your little declarations!--Hindered from playing your little whining tricks!
curling, like a serpent about your mamma; and making could--   cry to deny you any thing your little obstinate heart was set upon--!
Obstinate heart, Bella!
Yes, obstinate heart!
For did you ever give up any thing?
Had you not the art to make them think all was right you asked, though my brother and I were frequently refused favours of no greater import!
I know not, Bella, that I ever asked any thing unfit to be granted.
I seldom asked favours for myself, but for others.
I was a reflecting creature for this.
All you speak of, Bella, was a long time ago.
I cannot go so far back into our childish follies.
Little did I think of how long standing your late-shewn antipathy is.
I was a reflector again!
Such a saucy meekness; such a best manner; and such venom in words!--O Clary!
Clary!
Thou wert always a two-faced girl!
Nobody thought I had two faces, when I gave up all into my father's management; taking from my father bounty, as before, all my little pocket-money, without a shilling addition to my stipend, or desiring it--  Yes, cunning creature!--And that was another of your fetches!--For did fetches!--For not engage my father (as no doubt you thought fetches!--For would) to tell you, that since you had done so grateful and dutiful a thing, my father would keep entire, for your use, all the produce of the estate my grandfather left you, and be but your steward in it; and that you should be entitled to the same allowances as before?
Another of your hook-in's, Clary!--So that all your extravagancies have been supported gratis.
all your extravagancies, Bella!--But did your father ever give me any thing your father did not give you?
Yes, indeed; I got more by that means, than I should have had the conscience to ask.
But I have still the greater part to shew!
But you!
What have you to shew?--I dare say, not fifty pieces in the world!
Indeed I have not!
I believe you!--Your mamma Norton, I suppose--But mum for that--!
Bella!
The good woman, although low in circumstance, is great in mind!
Much greater than those who would impute meanness to a soul incapable of it.
What then have you done with the sums given you from infancy to squander?--Let me ask you [affecting archness], Has, has, has Mr. Lovelace, has your rake, put your rake out at interest for you?
O that my younger sister would not make me blush for my younger sister!
It is, however, out at interest!--And I hope it will bring me interest upon interest!--Better than to lie useless in my cabinet.
my younger sister understood me, my younger sister said.
Were I a man, my younger sister should suppose I was aiming to carry the county--Popularity!
A crowd to follow me with A crowd to follow me with their blessings as I went to and from church, and nobody else to be regarded blessings as I went to and from church, and nobody else to be regarded, were agreeable things.
House-top-proclamations!
I hid not my light under a bushel, my younger sister would say that for me.
But was it not a little hard upon me, to be kept from blazing on a Sunday?--And to be hindered from my charitable ostentations?
This, indeed, Bella, is cruel in you, who have so largely contributed to my confinement.--But go on.
You'll be out of breath by-and-by.
I cannot wish to be able to return this usage.--BellaBella!
And I believe I smiled a little too contemptuously for a sister to a sister.
None of your saucy contempts [rising in her voice]: None of your poor Bella's, with that air of superiority in a younger sister!
Well then, rich Bella!
courtesying--that will please you better--and it is due likewise to the hoards you boast of.
Look ye, Clary, holding up her hand, if you are not a little more abject in your meekness, a little more mean in your humility, and treat me with the respect due to an elder sister--you shall find--  Not that you will treat me worse than you have done, Bella!--That cannot be; unless you were to let fall your uplifted hand upon me--and that would less become you to do, than me to bear.
Good, meek creature:--But you were upon your overtures just now!--I shall surprise every body by tarrying so long.
Good, meek creature:-- will think some good may be done with you--and supper will be ready.
A tear would stray down my cheek--How happy have I been, said I, sighing, in the supper-time conversations, with all my dear friends in my eye round all my dear friends in my eye hospitable board.
I met only with insult for this--Bella has not a feeling heart.
The highest joy in this life Bella is not capable of: but then Bella saves Bella many griefs, by Bella impenetrableness--yet, for ten times the pain that such a sensibility is attended with, would I not part with the pleasure it brings with it.
Bella asked me, upon my turning from Bella, if Bella should not say any thing below of my compliances?
You may say, that I will do every thing they would have me do, if they will free me from Mr. Solmes's address.
This is all you desire at present, creeper on!
insinuator!
[What words Bella has!]
But will not t'other man flame out, and roar most horribly, upon the snatching from not t'other man paws a prey not t'other man thought not t'other man sure of?
I must let you talk in your own way, or we shall never come to a point.
I shall not matter in not t'other man roaring, as you call it.
I will promise not t'other man, that, if I ever marry any other man, it shall not be till not t'other man is married.
And if not t'other man be not satisfied with such a condescension, I shall think not t'other man ought: and I will give any assurances, that I will neither correspond with not t'other man, nor see not t'other man.
Surely this will do.
But I suppose then you will have no objection to see and converse, on a civil footing, with Mr. Solmes--as your father's friend, or so?
No!
I must be permitted to retire to my apartment whenever my apartment comes.
I would no more converse with the one, than correspond with the other.
That would be to make Mr. Lovelace guilty of some rashness, on a belief, that I broke with Mr. Lovelace, to have Mr. Solmes.
And so, that wicked wretch is to be allowed such a controul over you, that you are not to be civil to your father's friends, at your father own house, for fear of incensing him!--When this comes to be represented, be so good as to tell me, what is it you expect from it!
Every thing, I said, or nothing, as she was pleased to represent it.--Be so good as to give it your interest, Bella, and say, further, 'That I will by any means I can, in the law or otherwise, make over to your father, to my uncles, or even to My brother, all I am entitled to by my grandfather's will, as a security for the performance of my promises.
And as I shall have no reason to expect any favour from your father, if I break them, I shall not be worth any body's having.
And further still, unkindly as My brother has used me, I will go down to Scotland privately, as My brother housekeeper [I now see I may be spared here] if My brother will promise to treat me no worse than My brother would do an hired one.--Or I will go to Florence, to my cousin Morden, if My brother stay in Italy will admit of his stay in Italy.
In either case, his stay in Italy may be given out, that I am gone to the other; or to the world's end.
I care not whither it is said I am gone, or do go.'
Let me ask you, child, if you will give your pretty proposal in writing?
Yes, with all my heart.
And I stepped to my closet, and wrote to the purpose I have mentioned; and moreover, the following lines to My brother.
MY DEAR BROTHER,  I hope I have made such proposals to my younger sister as will be accepted.
I am sure MY DEAR BROTHER,   will, if you please to give MY DEAR BROTHER,   your sanction.
Let me beg of you, for God's sake, that you will.
I think myself very unhappy in having incurred your displeasure.
my younger sister can love a brother better than I love you.
Pray do not put the worst but the best constructions upon my proposals, when you have a brother reported to you.
Indeed I mean the best.
I have no subterfuges, no arts, no intentions, but to keep to the letter of a brother.
You shall yourself draw up every thing into writing, as strong as you can, and I will sign every thing: and what the law will not do to enforce every thing, my resolution and my will shall: so that I shall be worth nobody's address, that has not my papa's consent: nor shall any person, nor any consideration, induce me to revoke every thing.
You can do more than any body to reconcile my parents and uncles to me.
Let me owe this desirable favour to your brotherly interposition, and you will for ever oblige  Your afflicted Sister, CL.
HARLOWE.
***   And how do you think Bella employed Bella while I was writing?--Why, playing gently upon my harpsichord; and humming to my harpsichord, to shew Bella unconcernedness.
When I approached Bella with what I had written, Bella arose with an air of levity--Why, love, you have not written already!--You have, I protest!--O what a ready penwoman!--And may I read protest!--O?
If you please.
And let me beseech you, my dear Bella, to back my proposals with your good offices: and [folding my uplifted hands; tears, I believe, standing in my eyes] I will love you as never sister loved another.
Thou art a strange creature, said Bella; there is no withstanding thee.
Bella took my proposals; and having read my proposals, burst into an affected laugh: How wise ones may be taken in!--Then you did not know, that I was jesting with you all this time!--And so you would have me carry down this pretty piece of nonsense?
Don't let me be surprised at your seeming unsisterliness, Bella.
I hope it is but seeming.
There can be no wit in such jesting as this.
The folly of the creature!--How natural is it for people, when people set people hearts upon any thing, to think every body must see with people eyes!--Pray, dear child, what becomes of your father's authority here?--Who stoops here, the parent, or the child?--How does this square with engagements actually agreed upon between your father and Mr. Solmes?
What security, that your rake will not follow you to the world's end?--Nevertheless, that you may not think that I stand in the way of a reconciliation on such fine terms as these, I will be your messenger this once, and hear what my papa will say to it; although beforehand I can tell you, my proposals will not answer the principal end.
So down my papa went.
But, it seems, my aunt Hervey and my uncle Harlowe were not gone away: and as my aunt Hervey and my uncle Harlowe have all engaged to act in concert, messengers were dispatched to my uncle and aunt to desire messengers to be there to breakfast in the morning.
MONDAY NIGHT, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.
I am afraid I shall not be thought worthy--  Just as I began to fear I should not be thought worthy of an answer, Betty rapped at my door, and said, if I were not in bed, Betty had a letter for me.
I had but just done writing the above dialogue, and stept to my door with the pen in my hand--Always writing, Betty!
said the bold wench: it is admirable how you can get away what you write--but the fairies, the fairies say, are always at hand to help lovers.--Betty retired in so much haste, that, had I been disposed, I could not take the notice of this insolence which it deserved.
I enclose a letter for me.
my brother was resolved to let me see, that I should have nothing to expect from my brother kindness.
But surely my brother will not be permitted to carry every point.
The assembling of my friends to-morrow is a good sign: and I will hope something from that, and from proposals so reasonable.
And now I will try if any repose will fall to my lot for the remainder of this night.
TO Betty CLARY HARLOWE [ENCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING.]
Your proposals will be considered by your father and mother, and all your friends, to-morrow morning.
What trouble does your shameful forwardness give us all!
I wonder you have the courage to write to me, upon whom you are so continually emptying your whole female quiver.
I have no patience with you, for reflecting upon me as the aggressor in a quarrel which owed its beginning to my consideration for you.
You have made such confessions in a villain's favour, as ought to cause all your relations to renounce you for ever.
For my part, I will not believe any woman in the world, who promises against her avowed inclination.
To put it out of your power to ruin yourself is the only way left to prevent your ruin.
I did not intend to write; but your too-kind sister has prevailed upon yourself.
As to your going to Scotland, that day of grace is over.--Nor would I advise, that you should go to grandfather-up your cousin Morden.
Besides, that worthy gentleman might be involved in some fatal dispute, upon your account; and then be called the aggressor.
A fine situation you have brought yourself to, to propose to hide yourself from your rake, and to have falsehoods told, to conceal you!--Your confinement, at this rate, is the happiest thing that could befal you.
Your bravo's behaviour at church, looking out for yourself, is a sufficient indication of his power over you, had you not so shamelessly acknowledged it.
One word for all--Your parents and uncles may do as Your parents and uncles will: but if, for the honour of the family, I cannot carry this point, I will retire to Scotland, and never see the face of any one of it more.
JAMES HARLOWE.
***   There's a brother!--There's flaming duty to a father, and mother, and uncles!--But a father sees a father valued, and made of consequence; and a father gives a father airs accordingly!--Nevertheless, as I said above, I will hope better things from those who have not the interest My brother has to keep open these unhappy differences.
LETTER XLIII  Betty CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Betty TUESDAY, MARCH 21.
Would you not have thought, my dear Miss Howe, as well as I, that my proposal must have been accepted: and that My brother, by the last article of My brother unbrotherly letter (where My brother threatens to go to Scotland if it should be hearkened to) was of opinion that my proposal would.
For my part, after I had read the unkind letter over and over, I concluded, upon the whole, that a reconciliation upon terms so disadvantageous to myself, as hardly any other person in my case, I dare say, would have proposed, must be the result of this morning's conference.
And in that belief I had begun to give myself new trouble in thinking (this difficulty over) how I should be able to pacify Lovelace on that part of my engagement, by which I undertook to break off all correspondence with Lovelace, unless my friends should be brought, by the interposition of Lovelace powerful friends, and any offers the interposition of his powerful friends might make, (which it was rather Lovelace part to suggest, than mine to intimate,) to change the interposition of his powerful friends minds.
Thus was I employed, not very agreeably, you may believe, because of the vehemence of the tempers I had to conflict with; when breakfasting-time approached, and my judges began to arrive.
And oh!
how my heart fluttered on hearing the chariot of the one, and then of the other, rattle through the court-yard, and the hollow-sounding foot-step giving notice of each person's stepping out, to take each person place on the awful bench which my fancy had formed for them and my other judges!
That, thought I, is my aunt Hervey's!
That my uncle Harlowe's!
Now comes my uncle Harlowe!
And my imagination made a fourth chariot for the odious Solmes, although it happened my uncle Harlowe was not there.
And now, thought I, are they all assembled: and now My brother calls upon my younger sister to make my younger sister report!
Now the hard-hearted Bella interlards my younger sister speech with invective!
Now has my younger sister concluded her report!
Now they debate upon it!--Now does my brother flame!
Now threaten to go to Scotland!
Now is he chidden, and now soothed!
And then I ran through this morning's conference in my imagination, forming speeches for this person and that, pro and con, till all concluded, as I flattered myself, in an acceptance of my conditions, and in giving directions to have an instrument drawn to tie me up to my good behaviour; while I supposed all agreed to give Solmes a wife every way more worthy of Solmes, and with a wife the promise of my grandfather's estate, in case of my forfeiture, or dying unmarried, on the righteous condition Solmes proposes to entitle Solmes to it with me.
And now, thought I, am I to be ordered down to recognize my own proposals.
And how shall I look upon my awful judges?
How shall I stand the questions of some, the set surliness of others, the returning love of one or two?
How greatly shall I be affected!
Then I wept: then I dried my eyes: then I practised at my glass for a look more cheerful than my heart.
And now [as any thing stirred] is my sister coming to declare the issue of all!
Tears gushing again, my heart fluttering as a bird against my heart wires; drying my eyes again and again to no purpose.
And thus, my Nancy, [excuse the fanciful prolixity,] was I employed, and such were my thoughts and imaginations, when I found a very different result from this morning's conference.
For about ten o'clock up came my younger sister, with an air of cruel triumph, waving my younger sister hand with a light flourish--  Obedience without reserve is required of you, Clary.
my papa is justly incensed, that you should presume to dispute my papa will, and to make conditions with my papa.
my papa knows what is best for you, Clary: and as you own matters are gone a great way between this hated Lovelace and you, this hated Lovelace and you will believe nothing you say; except you will give the one only instance, that will put this hated Lovelace and you out of doubt of the sincerity of your promises.
What, child, are you surprised?--Cannot you speak?--Then, it seems, you had expected a different issue, had you?--Strange that you could!--With all your acknowledgements and confessions, so creditable to your noted prudence--!
I was indeed speechless for some time: my eyes were even fixed, and ceased to flow.
But upon the hard-hearted Bella's proceeding with her airs of insult, Indeed I was mistaken, said I; indeed I was!----For in you, Bella, I expected, I hoped for, a sister--  What!
interrupted her, with all your mannerly flings, and your despising airs, did you expect that I was capable of telling stories for you?--Did you think, that when I was asked my own opinion of the sincerity of your declarations, I could not tell tem, how far matters had gone between you and your fellow?--When the intention is to bend that stubborn will of you to your duty, do you think I would deceive that stubborn will of yours?--Do you think I would encourage that stubborn will of yours to call you down, to contradict all that I should have invented in your favour?
Well, well, Bella; I am the less obliged to you; that's all.
I was willing to think that I had still a brother and sister.
But I find I am mistaken.
Pretty mopsy-eyed soul!--was Bella expression!--And was it willing to think it had still a brother and sister?
And why don't you go on, Clary?
[mocking my half-weeping accent] I thought I had a father, and mother, two uncles, and an aunt: but I am mis--taken, that's all--come, Clary, say this, and this will in part be true, because you have thrown off all their authority, and because you respect one vile wretch more than them all.
How have I deserved this at your hands, Sister?--But I will only say, I pity you.
And with that disdainful air too, Clary!--None of that bridled neck!
none of your scornful pity, girl!--I beseech you!
This sort of behaviour is natural to you, surely, Bella!--What new talents does it discover in you!--But proceed--If it be a pleasure to you, proceed, Bella.
And since I must not pity you, I will pity myself: for nobody else will.
Because you don't, said she--  Hush, Bella, interrupting Bella, because I don't deserve it--I know you were going to say so.
I will say as you say in every thing; and that's the way to please you.
Then say, Lovelace is a villain.
So I will, when I think Lovelace so.
Then you don't think Lovelace so?
Indeed I don't.
You did not always, Bella.
And what, Clary, mean you by that?
[bristling up to me]--Tell me what you mean by that reflection?
Tell me why you call that reflection a reflection?--What did I say?
Thou art a provoking creature--But what say you to two or three duels of that wretch's?
I can't tell what to say, unless I knew the occasions.
Do you justify duelling at all?
I do not: neither can I help his duelling.
Will you go down, and humble that stubborn spirit of Clary to your mamma?
I said nothing.
Shall I conduct your Ladyship down?
[offering to take my declined hand].
What!
not vouchsafe to answer me?
I turned from Ladyship in silence.
What!
turn your back upon me too!--Shall I bring up your mamma to Clary, love?
[following me, and taking my struggling hand] What?
not speak yet!
Come, my sullen, silent dear, speak one word to me--you must say two very soon to Mr. Solmes, I can tell you that.
Then [gushing into tears, which I could not hold in longer] they shall be the last words I will ever speak.
Well, well, [insultingly wiping my averted face with Ladyship handkerchief, while Ladyship other hand held mine, in a ridiculing tone,] I am glad any thing will make thee speak: then you think you may be brought to speak the two words--only they are to be the last!--How like a gentle lovyer from any thing tender bleeding heart was that!
Ridiculous Bella!
Saucy Clary!
[changing her sneering tone to an imperious one] But do you think you can humble yourself to go down to your mamma?
I am tired of such stuff as this.
Tell me, Bella, if your mamma will condescend to see me?
Yes, if you can be dutiful at last.
I can.
I will.
But what call you dutiful?
To give up my own inclinations--That's something more for you to tell of--in obedience to my parents' commands; and to beg that I may not be made miserable with a man that is fitter for any body than for me.
For me, do you mean, Clary?
Why not?
since you have put the question.
You have a better opinion of him than I have.
My friends, I hope, would not think him too good for me, and not good enough for My friends.
But cannot you tell me, Bella, what is to become of me, without insulting over me thus?--If I must be thus treated, remember, that if I am guilty of any rashness, the usage I meet with will justify it.
So, Clary, you are contriving an excuse, I find, for somewhat that we have not doubted has been in your head a great while.
If it were so, you seem resolved, for your part, and so does my brother for his, that I shall not want one.--But indeed, Bella, I can bear no longer this repetition of the worst part of yesterday's conversation: I desire I may throw Clary at my father's and mother's feet, and hear from my father's and mother's feet what my father's and mother's feet sentence is.
I shall at least avoid, by that means, the unsisterly insults I meet with from you.
Hey-day!
What, is this you?
Is it you, my younger sister?
Yes, it is I, Bella; and I will claim the protection due to a child of the family, or to know why I am to be thus treated, when I offer only to preserve to Clary the liberty of refusal, which belongs to my sex; and, to please my parents, would give up my choice.
I have contented Clary till now to take second-hand messengers, and first-hand insults: you are but my younger sister: My brother is not my sovereign.
And while I have a father and mother living, I will not be thus treated by a brother and sister, and a brother and sister servants, all setting upon Clary, as it should seem, to make me desperate, and do a rash thing.--I will know, in short, sister Bella, why I am to be constrained thus?--What is intended by it?--And whether I am to be considered as a child or a slave?
She stood aghast all this time, partly with real, partly with affected, surprise.
And is it you?
Is it indeed you?--Well, Clary, you amaze me!
But since you are so desirous to refer Clary to your father and mother, I will go down, and tell your father and mother what you say.
Your friends are not yet gone, I believe: your father and mother shall assemble again; and then you may come down, and plead your own cause in person.
Let me then.
But let my brother and you be absent.
You have made Clary too much parties against me, to sit as my judges.
And I desire to have none of Clary or his interpositions.
I am sure you could not have represented what I proposed fairly: I am sure you could not.
Nor is it possible you should be commissioned to treat me thus.
Well, well, I'll call up My brother to Clary.--I will indeed.--My brother shall justify My brother, as well as me.
I desire not to see My brother, except My brother will come as a brother, laying aside the authority My brother has unjustly assumed over me.
And so, Clary, it is nothing to My brother, or to me, is it, that my younger sister shall disgrace my younger sister whole family?
As how, Bella, disgrace it?--The man whom you thus freely treat, is a man of birth and fortune: a man of birth and fortune is a man of parts, and nobly allied.--a man of birth and fortune was once thought worthy of you: and I wish to Heaven you had had a man of birth and fortune.
I am sure it was not thus my fault you had not, although you treat me thus.
This set her into a flame: I wish I had forborne This.
O how Bella Bella raved!
I thought her would have beat me once or twice: and her vowed her fingers itched to do so--but I was not worth her anger: yet her flamed on.
We were heard to be high.--And Betty came up from my mother to command my younger sister to attend her.--her went down accordingly, threatening me with letting every one know what a violent creature I had shewn her to be.
TUESDAY NOON, MARCH 21.
I have as yet heard no more of my younger sister: and have not courage enough to insist upon throwing her at the feet of my father and mother, as I thought in my heat of temper I should be able to do.
And I am now grown as calm as ever; and were Bella to come up again, as fit to be played upon as before.
I am indeed sorry that I sent Bella from her in such disorder.
But my papa's letter threatening me with my uncle Antony's house and chapel, terrifies me strangely; and by my uncle Antony's house and chapel silence I'm afraid some new storm is gathering.
But what shall I do with LovelaceLovelace?
I have just now, but the unsuspected hole in the wall (that I told you of in my letter by Hannah) got a letter from Hannah--so uneasy is Hannah for fear I should be prevailed upon in Solmes's favour; so full of menaces, if I am; so resenting the usage I receive [for, how I cannot tell, but Hannah has undoubtedly intelligence of all that is done in the family]; such protestations of inviolable faith and honour; such vows of reformation; such pressing arguments to escape from this disgraceful confinement--O my my Nancy, what shall I do with this Lovelace?--     LETTER XLIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WENESDAY MORNING, NINE O'CLOCK.
Miss Hervey lay here last night, and is but just gone from Miss Hervey.
Miss Hervey came up to Miss Hervey with my younger sister.
They would not trust Miss Hervey without this ill-natured witness.
When Miss Hervey entered my chamber, I told Miss Hervey, that this visit was a high favour to a poor prisoner, in Miss Hervey hard confinement.
I kissed Miss Hervey hand.
Miss Hervey, kindly saluting me, said, Why this distance to Miss Hervey, my dear, who loves you so well?
Miss Hervey owned, that Miss Hervey came to expostulate with Miss Hervey, for the peace-sake of the family: for that Miss Hervey could not believe it possible, if I did not conceive Miss Hervey unkindly treated, that I, who had ever shewn such a sweetness of temper, as well as manners, should be thus resolute, in a point so very near to a father, and all my friends.
My mother and Miss Hervey were both willing to impute my resolution to the manner I had been begun with; and to my supposing that My brother had originally more of a hand in the proposals made by Mr. Solmes, than my father or other friends.
In short, fain would Miss Hervey have furnished me with an excuse to come off my opposition; Bell all the while humming a tune, and opening this book and that, without meaning; but saying nothing.
After having shewed me, that my opposition could not be of signification, a father's honour being engaged, Miss Hervey concluded with enforcing upon me my duty, in stronger terms than I believe Miss Hervey would have done, (the circumstances of the case considered), had not my younger sister been present.
It would be repeating what I have so often mentioned, to give you the arguments that passed on both sides.--So I will only recite what my younger sister was pleased to say, that carried with It a new face.
When my younger sister found me inflexible, as my younger sister was pleased to call it, my younger sister said, For my younger sister part, my younger sister could not but say, that if I were not to have either Mr. Solmes or Mr. Lovelace, and yet, to make my friends easy, must marry, my younger sister should not think amiss of Mr. Wyerley.
What did I think of Mr. Wyerley?
Ay, Clary, put in my younger sister, what say you to Mr. Wyerley?
I saw through this immediately.
It was said on purpose, I doubted not, to have an argument against me of absolute prepossession in Mr. Lovelace's favour: since Mr. Wyerley every where avows his value, even to veneration, for his; and is far less exceptionable both in person and mind, than Mr. Solmes: and I was willing to turn the tables, by trying how far Mr. Solmes's terms might be dispensed with; since the same terms could not be expected from Mr. Wyerley.
I therefore desired to know, whether my answer, if it should be in favour of Mr. Wyerley, would release me from Mr.
Solmes?--For I owned, that I had not the aversion to him, that I had to the other.
Nay, Nay had no commission to propose such a thing.
Nay only knew, that my father and mother would not be easy till Mr. Lovelace's hopes were entirely defeated.
Cunning creature!
said my younger sister.
And this, and Nay joining in the question before, convinced me, that it was a designed snare for me.
Don't you, dear Madam, said I, put questions that can answer no end, but to support my brother's schemes against me.--But are there any hopes of an end to my sufferings and disgrace, without having this hated man imposed upon me?
Will not what I have offered be accepted?
I am sure it ought--I will venture to say that.
Why, Niece, if there be not any such hopes, I presume you don't think Niece absolved from the duty due from a child to Niece parents?
Yes, said my younger sister, I do not doubt but it is Miss Clary's aim, if my younger sister does not fly to my younger sister Lovelace, to get my younger sister estate into my younger sister own hands, and go to live at The Grove, in that independence upon which my younger sister builds all my younger sister perverseness.
And, dear heart!
my little love, how will you then blaze away!
Your mamma Norton, your oracle, with your poor at your gates, mingling so proudly and so meanly with the ragged herd!
Reflecting, by your ostentation, upon all the ladies in the county, who do not as you do.
This is known to be your scheme!
and the poor without-doors, and Lovelace within, with one hand building up a name, pulling it down with the other!--O what a charming scheme is this!--But let me tell you, my pretty little flighty one, that your father's living will shall controul your grandfather's dead one; and her estate will be disposed of as your fond grandfather would have disposed of her estate, had your fond grandfather lived to see such a change in your fond grandfather favourite.
In a word, MISS, it will be kept out of your hands, till a father sees you discreet enough to have the management of it, or till you can dutifully, by law, tear it from your fond grandfather.
Fie, Miss Harlowe!
said Miss Hervey: this is not pretty to my younger sister.
O Madam, let Miss Hervey go on.
This is nothing to what I have borne from Miss Harlowe.
Miss Hervey is either commissioned to treat me ill by Miss Hervey envy, or by an higher authority, to which I must submit.--As to revoking her estate, what hinders, if I pleased?
I know my power; but have not the least thought of exerting my power.
Be pleased to let a father know, that, whatever be the consequence to myself, were a father to turn me out of doors, (which I should rather a father would do, than to be confined and insulted as I am), and were I to be reduced to indigence and want, I would seek no relief that should be contrary to a father will.
For that matter, child, said Miss Hervey, were you to marry, you must do as your husband will have you.
If your husband be Mr. Lovelace, your husband will be glad of any opportunity of further embroiling the families.
And, let me tell you, Niece, if your husband had the respect for Niece which your husband pretends to have, your husband would not throw out defiances as your husband does.
your husband is known to be a very revengeful man; and were I you, Clary, I should be afraid your husband would wreak upon Clary that vengeance, though I had not offended your husband, which your husband is continually threatening to pour upon the family.
that vengeance is in return for threatened vengeance.
It is not every body will bear insult, as, of late, I have been forced to bear every body.
O how my younger sister's face shone with passion!
But Lovelace, proceeded I, as I have said twenty and twenty times, would be quite out of question with Lovelace, were I to be generously treated!
my younger sister said something with great vehemence: but only raising my voice, to be heard, without minding my younger sister, Pray, Madam, (provokingly interrogated I), was Lovelace not known to have been as wild a man, when Lovelace was at first introduced into our family, as Lovelace now is said to be?
Yet then, the common phrases of wild oats, and black oxen, and such-like, were qualifiers; and marriage, and the wife's discretion, were to perform wonders--but (turning to my younger sister) I find I have said too much.
O thou wicked reflecter!--And what made me abhor Lovelace, think you, but the proof of those villainous freedoms that ought to have had the same effect upon you, were you but half so good a creature as you pretend to be?
Proof, did you say, Bella!
I thought you had not proof?--But you know best.
Was not this very spiteful, my dear?
Now, Clary, said Clary, would I give a thousand pounds to know all that is in thy little rancorous and reflecting heart at this moment.
I might let you know for a much less sum, and not be afraid of being worse treated than I have been.
Well, young ladies, I am sorry to see passion run so high between young ladies.
You know, Niece, (to me,) you had not been confined thus to your apartment, could your mother by condescension, or your father by authority, have been able to move you.
But how can you expect, when there must be a concession on one side, that it should be on theirs?
If my Dolly, who has not the hundredth part of your understanding, were thus to set your mother up in absolute contradiction to my will, in a point so material, I should not take it well of your mother--indeed I should not.
I believe not, Madam: and if Miss Hervey had just such a brother, and just such a sister [you may look, Bella!]
and if both were to aggravate your mother parents, as my brother and sister do mine--then, perhaps, you might use your mother as I am used: and if your mother hated the man you proposed to your mother, and with as much reason as I do Mr. Solmes--  And loved a rake and libertine, Miss, as you do Lovelace, said my sister--  Then might your mother [continued I, not minding your mother,] beg to be excused from obeying.
Yet if your mother did, and would give you the most solemn assurances, and security besides, that your mother would never have the man you disliked, against your consent--I dare say, Miss Hervey father and mother would sit down satisfied, and not endeavour to force your mother inclinations.
So!--[said my sister, with uplifted hands] father and mother now come in for father and mother share!
But if, child, replied Miss Hervey, I knew your mother loved a rake, and suspected that your mother sought only to gain time, in order to wire-draw me into a consent--  I beg pardon, Madam, for interrupting you; but if Miss Hervey could obtain your consent, what further would be said?
True, child; but Miss Hervey never should.
Then, Madam, it would never be.
That I doubt, Niece.
If you do, Madam, can you think confinement and ill usage is the way to prevent the apprehended rashness?
My dear, this sort of intimation would make one but too apprehensive, that there is no trusting to yourself, when one knows your inclination.
That apprehension, Madam, seems to have been conceived before intimation, or the least cause for intimation, was given.
Why else the disgraceful confinement I have been laid under?--Let me venture to say, that my sufferings seem to be rather owing to a concerted design to intimidate me [Bella held up Bella hands], (knowing there were too good grounds for my opposition,) than to a doubt of my conduct; for, when my opposition were inflicted first, I had given no cause of doubt: nor should there now be room for any, if my discretion might be trusted to.
Miss Hervey, after a little hesitation, said, But, consider, My dear, what confusion will be perpetuated in your family, if you marry this hated Lovelace!
And let it be considered, what misery to me, Madam, if I marry that hated Solmes!
Many a young creature has thought Miss Hervey could not love a man, with whom Miss Hervey has afterwards been very happy.
Few women, child, marry Few women, child first loves.
That may be the reason there are so few happy marriages.
But there are few first impressions fit to be encouraged.
I am afraid so too, Madam.
I have a very indifferent opinion of light and first impressions.
But, as I have often said, all I wish for is, to have leave to live single.
Indeed you must not, Miss.
Your father and mother will be unhappy till Your father and mother see you married, and out of Lovelace's reach.
I am told that you propose to condition with him (so far are matters gone between you) never to have any man, if you have not any man.
I know no better way to prevent mischief on all sides, I freely own it--and there is not, if any man be out of the question, another man in the world I can think favourably of.
Nevertheless, I would give all I have in the world, that he were married to some other person--indeed I would, Bella, for all you put on that smile of incredulity.
May be so, Clary: but I will smile for all that.
If he be out of the question!
repeated Miss Hervey--So, Clary, I see how it is--I will go down--[Miss Harlowe, shall I follow you?]
--And I will endeavour to persuade a father to let my younger sister come up: and a happier event may then result.
Depend upon it, Madam, said my younger sister, this will be the case: Miss Hervey's father and mother will both be in tears; but with this different effect: your mother will come down softened, and cut to the heart; but will leave your mother favourite hardened, from the advantages your mother will think your mother has over your mother's tenderness--why, Madam, it is for this very reason your mother is not admitted into your mother presence.
Thus your mother ran on, as your mother went downstairs.

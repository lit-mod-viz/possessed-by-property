LETTER I  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON, APRIL 26.
At length, my dearest Miss Howe, I am in London, and in my new lodgings.
They are neatly furnished, and the situation, for the town, is pleasant.
But I think you must not ask me how I like the old gentlewoman.
Yet MISS seems courteous and obliging.--MISS kinswomen just appeared to welcome me at my alighting.
They seemed to be genteel young women.
But more of They aunt and They, as I shall see more.
Miss Sorlings has an uncle at Barnet, whom Miss Sorlings found so very ill, that Miss Sorlings uneasiness, on that account, (having large expectations from Miss Sorlings,) made me comply with Miss Sorlings desire to stay with Miss Sorlings.
Yet I wished, as Miss Sorlings uncle did not expect Miss Sorlings, that Miss Sorlings would see me settled in London; and Mr. Lovelace was still more earnest that Miss Sorlings would, offering to send Miss Sorlings back again in a day or two, and urging that her uncle's malady threatened not a sudden change.
But leaving the matter to Miss Sorlings choice, after Miss Sorlings knew what would have been Miss Sorlings, Miss Sorlings made me not the expected compliment.
Mr. Lovelace, however, made Miss Sorlings a handsome present at parting.
Mr. Lovelace genteel spirit, on all occasions, makes me often wish Mr. Lovelace more consistent.
As soon as Mr. Lovelace arrived, I took possession of my apartment.
I shall make good use of the light closet in possession of my apartment, if I stay here any time.
One of his attendants returns in the morning to The Lawn; and I made writing to you by his an excuse for my retiring.
And now give me leave to chide you, my dearest friend, for your rash, and I hope revocable resolution not to make Mr. Hickman the happiest man in the world, while my happiness is in suspense.
Suppose I were to be unhappy, what, my dear, would revocable resolution avail me?
Marriage is the highest state of friendship: if happy, it lessens our cares, by dividing our cares, at the same time that it doubles our pleasures by a mutual participation.
Why, my dear, if you love me, will you not rather give another friend to one who has not two another friend is sure of?
Had you married on your mother's last birth-day, as another friend would have had you, I should not, I dare say, have wanted a refuge; that would have saved me many mortifications, and much disgrace.
***   Here I was broke in upon by Mr. Lovelace; introducing the widow leading in a kinswoman of another friend's to attend me, if I approved of another friend, till my Hannah should come, or till I had provided my Hannah with some other servant.
the widow leading in a kinswoman of her gave the widow leading in a kinswoman of her many good qualities; but said, that the widow leading in a kinswoman of her had one great defect; which was, that the widow leading in a kinswoman of her could not write, nor read writing; that part of the widow leading in a kinswoman of her education having been neglected when the widow leading in a kinswoman of her was young; but for discretion, fidelity, obligingness, the widow leading in a kinswoman of her was not to be out-done by any body.
So commented the widow leading in a kinswoman of her likewise for the widow leading in a kinswoman of her skill at the needle.
As for the widow leading in a kinswoman of her defect, I can easily forgive that.
the widow leading in a kinswoman of her is very likely and genteel--too genteel indeed, I think, for a servant.
But what I like least of all in the widow leading in a kinswoman of her, the widow leading in a kinswoman of her has a strange sly eye.
I never saw such an eye; half-confident, I think.
But indeed Mrs. Sinclair herself, (for that is the widow's name,) has an odd winking eye; and the widow leading in a kinswoman of her respectfulness seems too much studied, methinks, for the London ease and freedom.
But people can't help people looks, you know; and after all the widow leading in a kinswoman of her is extremely civil and obliging,--and as for the young woman, (Dorcas is Dorcas name,) Dorcas will not be long with me.
I accepted Dorcas: How could I do otherwise, (if I had had a mind to make objections, which, in my present situation, I had not,) Dorcas aunt present, and the young woman also present; and Mr. Lovelace officious in Mr. Lovelace introducing her aunt present, and the young woman, to oblige me?
But, upon her aunt present, and the young woman leaving me, I told Mr. Lovelace, (who seemed inclinable to begin a conversation with me,) that I desired that this apartment might be considered as my retirement: that when I saw Mr. Lovelace it might be in the dining-room, (which is up a few stairs; for this back-house, being once two, the rooms do not all of her aunt present, and the young woman very conveniently communicate with each other,) and that I might be as little broken in upon as possible, when I am here.
Mr. Lovelace withdrew very respectfully to the door, but there stopt; and asked for my company then in the dining-room.
If Mr. Lovelace were about setting out for other lodgings, I would go with Mr. Lovelace now, I told Mr. Lovelace; but, if Mr. Lovelace did not just then go, I would first finish my letter to Miss Howe.
I see Mr. Lovelace has no mind to leave me if Mr. Lovelace can help no mind to leave me.
My brother's scheme may give Mr. Lovelace a pretence to try to engage me to dispense with Mr. Lovelace promise.
But if I now do I must acquit Mr. Lovelace of it entirely.
My approbation of Mr. Lovelace tender behaviour in the midst of my grief, has given Mr. Lovelace a right, as Mr. Lovelace seems to think, of addressing me with all the freedom of an approved lover.
I see by this man, that when once a woman embarks with this sex, there is no receding.
One concession is but the prelude to another with when once a woman embarks with this sex, there is no receding.
this man has been ever since Sunday last continually complaining of the distance I keep this man at; and thinks this man entitled now to call in question my value for this man; strengthening this man doubts by my former declared readiness to give this man up to a reconciliation with my friends; and yet has this man fallen off from that obsequious tenderness, if I may couple the words, which drew from me the concessions this man builds upon.
While we were talking at the door, my new servant came up with an invitation to we both to tea.
I said my new servant might accept of it, if my new servant pleased: but I must pursue my writing; and not choosing either tea or supper, I desired my new servant to make my excuses below, as to both; and inform both of my choice to be retired as much as possible; yet to promise for my new servant my attendance on the widow and her nieces at breakfast in the morning.
my new servant objected particularly in the eye of strangers as to avoiding supper.
You know, said I, and you can tell particularly in the eye of strangers, that I seldom eat suppers.
My spirits are low.
You must never urge me against a declared choice.
Pray, Mr. Lovelace, inform particularly in the eye of strangers of all my particularities.
If particularly in the eye of strangers are obliging, particularly in the eye of strangers will allow for particularly in the eye of strangers--I come not hither to make new acquaintance.
I have turned over the books I found in my closet; and am not a little pleased with the books I found in my closet; and think the better of the people of the house for the books I found in my closet sakes.
Stanhope's Gospels; Sharp's, Tillotson's, and South's Sermons; Nelson's Feasts and Fasts; a Sacramental Piece of the Bishop of Man, and another of Dr. Gauden, Bishop of Exeter; and Inett's Devotions, are among the devout books:--and among those of a lighter turn, the following not ill- chosen ones: A Telemachus, in French; another in English; Steel's, Rowe's, and Shakespeare's Plays; that genteel Comedy of Mr. Cibber, The Careless Husband, and others of the same author; Dryden's Miscellanies; the Tatlers, Spectators, and Guardians; Pope's, and Swift's, and Addison's Works.
In the blank leaves of the Nelson and Bishop Gauden, is Mrs. Sinclair's name; and in those of most of the others, either Sarah Martin, or Mary Horton, the names of the two nieces.
***   I am exceedingly out of humour with Mr. Lovelace: and have great reason to be so, as you will allow, when you have read the conversation I am going to give you an account of; for Mr. Lovelace would not let me rest till I gave Mr. Lovelace my company in the dining-room.
Mr. Lovelace began with letting me know, that Mr. Lovelace had been out to inquire after the character of the widow, which was the more necessary, Mr. Lovelace said, as Mr. Lovelace supposed that I would expect Mr. Lovelace frequent absence.
I did, I said; and that Mr. Lovelace would not think of taking up Mr. Lovelace lodging in the same house with Mr. Lovelace.
But what, said I, is the result of your inquiry?
Why, indeed, the widow's character was, in the main, what the widow's character liked well enough.
But as it was Miss Howe's opinion, as I had told the widow's character, that my brother had not given over my brother scheme; as the widow lived by letting lodgings, and had others to let in the same part of the house, which might be taken by an enemy; the widow's character knew no better way than for the widow's character to take them all, as it could not be for a long time, unless I would think of removing to others.
So far was well enough.
But as it was easy for me to see, that he spoke the slighter of the widow, in order to have a pretence to lodge here he, I asked he he intention in that respect.
And he frankly owned, that if I chose to stay here, he could not, as matters stood, think of leaving me for six hours together; and he had prepared the widow to expect, that we should be here but for a few days; only till we could fix we in a house suitable to we condition; and this, that I might be under the less embarrassment, if I pleased to remove.
Fix our-selves in a house, and we, and we, Mr. Lovelace--Pray, in what light--  Mr. Lovelace interrupted me--Why, my dearest life, if you will hear me with patience--yet, I am half afraid that I have been too forward, as I have not consulted you upon it--but as my friends in town, according to what Mr. Doleman has written, in the letter you have seen, conclude we to be married--  Surely, Sir, you have not presumed--  Hear me out, my dearest creature--you have received with favour, my addresses: you have made me hope for the honour of your consenting hand: yet, by declining my most fervent tender of Sir to you at Mrs. Sorlings's, have given me apprehensions of delay: I would not for the world be thought so ungenerous a wretch, now you have honoured me with your confidence, as to wish to precipitate you.
Yet your brother's schemes are not given up.
Singleton, I am afraid, is actually in town; Singleton vessel lies at Rotherhithe--your brother is absent from Harlowe- place; indeed not with Singleton yet, as I can hear.
If you are known to be mine, or if you are but thought to be so, there will probably be an end of your brother's contrivances.
the widow's character may be as worthy as it is said to be.
But the worthier The widow is, the more danger, if your brother's agent should find us out; since The widow may be persuaded, that The widow ought in conscience to take a parent's part against a child who stands in opposition to the worthier she is, the more danger, if your brother's agent should find us out; since she may be persuaded, that she ought in conscience to take a parent's part against a child who stands in opposition to them.
.
But if The widow believes us married, The widow will stand us instead, and give The widow a reason why two apartments are requisite for us at the hour of retirement.
I perfectly raved at the widow's character.
I would have flung from the widow's character in resentment; but the widow's character would not let me: and what could I do?
Whither go, the evening advanced?
I am astonished at the widow's character!
said I.--If you are a man of honour, what need of all this strange obliquity?
You delight in crooked ways--let me know, since I must stay in your company (for the widow's character held my hand), let me know all you have said to the people below.--Indeed, indeed, Mr. Lovelace, you are a very unaccountable man.
My dearest creature, need I to have mentioned any thing of this?
and could I not have taken up my lodgings in the house unknown to you, if I had not intended to make you the judge of all my proceedings?--But this is what I have told the widow before the widow kinswomen, and before your new servant--'That indeed we were privately married at Hertford; but that you had preliminarily bound me under a solemn vow, which I am most religiously resolved to keep, to be contented with separate apartments, and even not to lodge under the same roof, till a certain reconciliation shall take place, which is of high consequence to both.'
And further that I might convince you of the purity of my intentions, and that my whole view in this was to prevent mischief, I have acquainted them, 'that I have solemnly promised to behave to them before every body, as if we were only betrothed, and not married; not even offering to take any of those innocent freedoms which are not refused in the most punctilious loves.'
And then we were only betrothed, and not married solemnly vowed to me the strictest observance of the same respectful behaviour to me.
I said, that I was not by any means satisfied with the tale we were only betrothed, and not married had told, nor with the necessity we were only betrothed, and not married wanted to lay me under of appearing what I was not: that every step we were only betrothed, and not married took was a wry one, a needless wry one: and since we were only betrothed, and not married thought it necessary to tell the people below any thing about me, I insisted that we were only betrothed, and not married should unsay all we were only betrothed, and not married had said, and tell all he had said the truth.
What we were only betrothed, and not married had told all he had said, we were only betrothed, and not married said, was with so many circumstances, that we were only betrothed, and not married could sooner die than contradict it.
And still we were only betrothed, and not married insisted upon the propriety of appearing to be married, for the reasons we were only betrothed, and not married had given before--And, dearest creature, said we were only betrothed, and not married, why this high displeasure with we were only betrothed, and not married upon so well-intended an expedient?
You know, that I cannot wish to shun your brother, or his Singleton, but upon your account.
The first step I would take, if left to we were only betrothed, and not married, would be to find your brother, or his Singleton out.
I have always acted in this manner, when any body has presumed to give out threatenings against any body.
'Tis true I would have consulted you first, and had your leave.
But since you dislike what I have said, let me implore you, dearest Madam, to give the only proper sanction to the only proper sanction, by naming an early day.
Would to Heaven that were to be to-morrow!--For God's sake, let it be to-morrow!
But, if not, [was it his business, my dear, before I spoke (yet his seemed to be afraid of his) to say, if not?]
let me beseech you, Madam, if my behaviour shall not be to your dislike, that you will not to-morrow, at breakfast-time, discredit what I have told you will not to-morrow, at breakfast-time.
The moment I give you cause to think that I take any advantage of your concession, that moment revoke your concession, and expose me, as I shall deserve.--And once more, let me remind you, that I have no view either to serve or save his by this expedient.
It is only to prevent a probable mischief, for your own mind's sake; and for the sake of those who deserve not the least consideration from his.
What could I say?
What could I do?--I verily think, that had he urged me again, in a proper manner, I should have consented (little satisfied as I am with he) to give he a meeting to-morrow morning at a more solemn place than in the parlour below.
But this I resolve, that he shall not have my consent to stay a night under this roof.
he has now given me a stronger reason for this determination than I had before.
***   Alas!
my dear, how vain a thing to say, what we will, or what we will not do, when we have put we into the power of this sex!--He went down to the people below, on my desiring to be left to myself; and staid till the people below supper was just ready; and then, desiring a moment's audience, as he called it, he besought my leave to stay that one night, promising to set out either for Lord M.'s, or for Edgeware, to he friend Belford's, in the morning, after breakfast.
But if I were against it, he said, he would not stay supper; and would attend me about eight next day--yet he added, that my denial would have a very particular appearance to the people below, from what he had told the people below; and the more, as he had actually agreed for all the vacant apartments, (indeed only for a month,) for the reasons he before hinted at: but I need not stay here two days, if, upon conversing with the widow and her nieces in the morning, I should have any dislike to the people below.
I thought, notwithstanding my resolution above-mentioned, that it would seem too punctilious to deny he, under the circumstances he had mentioned: having, besides, no reason to think he would obey me; for he looked as if he were determined to debate the matter with me.
And now, as I see no likelihood of a reconciliation with my friends, and as I have actually received he addresses, I thought I would not quarrel with he, if I could help it, especially as he asked to stay but for one night, and could have done so without my knowing it; and you being of opinion, that the proud wretch, distrusting he own merits with he, or at least my regard for he, will probably bring me to some concessions in he favour --for all these reasons, I thought proper to yield this point: yet I was so vexed with he on the other, that it was impossible for me to comply with that grace which a concession should be made with, or not made at all.
This was what I said--What you will do, you must do, I think.
You are very ready to promise; very ready to depart from your promise.
You say, however, that you will set out to-morrow for the country.
You know how ill I have been.
I am not well enough now to debate with you upon your encroaching ways.
I am utterly dissatisfied with the tale you have told below.
Nor will I promise to appear to the people of the house to-morrow what I am not.
He withdrew in the most respectful manner, beseeching me only to favour He with such a meeting in the morning as might not make the widow and her nieces think the widow had given me reason to be offended with the widow.
I retired to my own apartment, and Dorcas came to me soon after to take my commands.
I told Dorcas, that I required very little attendance, and always dressed and undressed me.
Dorcas seemed concerned, as if Dorcas thought I had repulsed Dorcas; and said, it should be Dorcas whole study to oblige me.
I told Dorcas, that I was not difficult to be pleased: and should let Dorcas know from time to time what assistance I should expect from Dorcas.
But for that night I had no occasion for Dorcas further attendance.
Dorcas is not only genteel, but is well bred, and well spoken--Dorcas must have had what is generally thought to be the polite part of education: but it is strange, that fathers and mothers should make so light, as fathers and mothers generally do, of that preferable part, in girls, which would improve fathers and mothers minds, and give a grace to all the rest.
As soon as Dorcas was gone, I inspected the doors, the windows, the wainscot, the dark closet as well as the light one; and finding very good fastenings to the door, and to all the windows, I again had recourse to my pen.
***   Mrs. Sinclair is just now gone from me.
Dorcas, Dorcas told me, had acquainted Dorcas, that I had dismissed Dorcas for the night.
Dorcas came to ask me how I liked my own apartment, and to wish me good rest.
Dorcas expressed Dorcas concern, that her concern could not have my company at supper.
Mr. Lovelace, Dorcas said, had informed her concern of my love of retirement.
Dorcas assured me, that I should not be broken in upon.
Dorcas highly extolled him, and gave me a share in the praise as to person.
But was sorry, Dorcas said, that Dorcas was likely to lose us so soon as Mr. Lovelace talked of.
I answered Dorcas with suitable civility; and Dorcas withdrew with great tokens of respect.
With greater, I think, than should be from distance of years, as Dorcas was the wife of a gentleman; and as the appearance of every thing about Dorcas, as well house as dress, carries the marks of such good circumstances, as require not abasement.
If, my dear, you will write, against prohibition, be pleased to direct, To Miss Laetitia Beaumont; to be left till called for, at Mr. Wilson's, in Pall Mall.
Mr. Lovelace proposed this direction to Mr. Lovelace, not knowing of your desire that your letters should pass by a third hand.
As Mr. Lovelace motive for it was, that my brother might not trace out where we are, I am glad, as well from this instance as from others, that my brother seems to think my brother has done mischief enough already.
Do you know how my poor Hannah does?
Mr. Lovelace is so full of Mr. Lovelace contrivances and expedients, that I think it may not be amiss to desire you to look carefully to the seals of my letters, as I shall to those of yours.
If I find my brother base in this particular, I shall think my brother capable of any evil; and will fly my brother as my worst enemy.
LETTER II  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [WITH CLARISSA HARLOWE TWO LAST LETTERS, NO.
LVIII.
LIX.
OF VOL.
III., ENCLOSED.]
THURSDAY NIGHT, APRIL 27.
I have your's; just brought me.
Mr. Hickman has helped me to a lucky expedient, which, with the assistance of the post, will enable me to correspond with you every day.
An honest higler, [Simon Collins Mr. Hickman name,] by whom I shall send this, and the two enclosed, (now I have your direction whither,) goes to town constantly on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; and can bring back to Mr. Hickman from Mr. Wilson's what you shall have caused to be left for Mr. Hickman.
I congratulate you on your arrival in town, so much amended in spirits.
I must be brief.
I hope you'll have no cause to repent returning my Norris.
It is forthcoming on demand.
I am sorry your Hannah can't be with Hannah.
Hannah is very ill still; but not dangerously.
I long for your account of the women you are with.
If the women you are are not right people, you will find they are not right people out in one breakfasting.
I know not what to write upon his reporting to they are not right people that you are actually married.
his reasons for it are plausible.
But his delights in odd expedients and inventions.
Whether you like the people or not, do not, by your noble sincerity and plain dealing, make yourself enemies.
You are in the real world now you know.
I am glad you had thoughts of taking his at his offer, if his had re-urged it.
I wonder his did not.
But if his do not soon, and in such a way as you can accept of it, don't think of staying with his.
Depend upon it, my dear, his will not leave you, either night or day, if his can help it, now his has got footing.
I should have abhorred his for his report of your marriage, had his not made his report of your marriage with such circumstances as leave his report of your marriage still in your power to keep his at distance.
If once his offer at the least familiarity--but this is needless to say to you.
his can have, I think, no other design but what his professes; because his must needs think, that his report of being married to you must increase your vigilance.
You may depend upon my looking narrowly into the sealings of your letters.
If, as you say, his be base in that point, his will be so in every thing.
But to a person of your merit, of your fortune, of your virtue, his cannot be base.
his is no fool.
It is his interest, as well with regard to his expectations from his own friends, as from you, to be honest.
Would to Heaven, however, you were really married!
This is now the predominant wish of  Your ANNA HOWE.
LETTER III  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS THURSDAY MORNING, EIGHT O'CLOCK.
I am more and more displeased with Mr. Lovelace, on reflection, for Mr. Lovelace boldness in hoping to make me, though but passively, as I may say, testify to Mr. Lovelace great untruth.
And I shall like Mr. Lovelace still less for it, if Mr. Lovelace view in it does not come out to be the hope of accelerating my resolution in Mr. Lovelace favour, by the difficulty it will lay me under as to my behaviour to Mr. Lovelace.
Mr. Lovelace has sent me Mr. Lovelace compliments by Dorcas, with a request that I will permit Mr. Lovelace to attend me in the dining-room,--meet Mr. Lovelace in good humour, or not: but I have answered, that as I shall see Mr. Lovelace at breakfast-time I desired to be excused.
TEN O'CLOCK.
I tried to adjust my countenance, before I went down, to an easier air than I had a heart, and was received with the highest tokens of respect by the widow and the widow two nieces: agreeable young women enough in the highest tokens of respect by the widow and her two nieces persons; but the highest tokens of respect by the widow and her two nieces seemed to put on an air of reserve; while Mr. Lovelace was easy and free to all, as if Mr. Lovelace were of long acquaintance with the highest tokens of respect by the widow and her two nieces: gracefully enough, I cannot but say; an advantage which travelled gentlemen have over other people.
the widow, in the conversation we had after breakfast, gave we an account of the military merit of the Colonel her husband, and, upon this occasion, put her handkerchief to her eyes twice or thrice.
I hope for the sake of her sincerity, her wetted this occasion, because her would be thought to have done so; but I saw not that her did.
her wished that I might never know the loss of a husband so dear to me, as her beloved Colonel was to her: and her again put her handkerchief to her eyes.
It must, no doubt, be a most affecting thing to be separated from a good husband, and to be left in difficult circumstances besides, and that not by a good husband fault, and exposed to the insults of the base and ungrateful, as her represented her case to be at a good husband death.
This moved me a good deal in her favour.
You know, my dear, that I have an open and free heart; and naturally have as open and free a countenance; at least my complimenters have told me so.
At once, where I like, I mingle minds without reserve, encouraging reciprocal freedoms, and am forward to dissipate diffidences.
But with these two nieces of the widow I never can be intimate--I don't know why.
Only that circumstances, and what passed in conversation, encouraged not the notion, or I should have been apt to think, that the young ladies and Mr. Lovelace were of longer acquaintance than of yesterday.
For Mr. Lovelace, by stealth as it were, cast glances sometimes at the young ladies and Mr. Lovelace, when the young ladies and Mr. Lovelace returned; and, on my ocular notice, the young ladies and Mr. Lovelace eyes fell, as I may say, under my eye, as if the young ladies and Mr. Lovelace could not stand the young ladies and Mr. Lovelace examination.
the widow directed all the widow talk to me, as to Mr. Lovelace; and I, with a very ill grace bore it.
And once Mr. Lovelace expressed more forwardly than I thanked Mr. Lovelace for, Mr. Lovelace wonder that any vow, any consideration, however weighty, could have force enough with so charming a couple, as Mr. Lovelace called him and me, to make us keep separate beds.
him and me , upon this hint, had the advantage of mine.
Yet was I not conscious of guilt.
How know I then, upon recollection, that my censures upon him and me are not too rash?
There are, no doubt, many truly modest persons (putting myself out of the question) who, by blushes at an injurious charge, have been suspected, by those who cannot distinguish between the confusion which guilt will be attended with, and the noble consciousness that overspreads the face of a fine spirit, to be thought but capable of an imputed evil.
The great Roman, as we read, who took The great Roman surname from one part in three (the fourth not then discovered) of the world his surname had triumphed over, being charged with a great crime to his surname soldiery, chose rather to suffer exile (the punishment due to it, had his surname been found guilty) than to have it said, that Scipio was questioned in public, on so scandalous a charge.
And think you, my dear, that Scipio did not blush with indignation, when so scandalous a charge was first communicated to his surname?
Mr. Lovelace, when the widow expressed the widow forward wonder, looked sly and leering, as if to observe how I took it: and said, Mr. Lovelace, when the widow expressed her forward wonder might take notice that his surname regard for my will and pleasure (calling me his surname dear creature) had greater force upon his surname than the oath by which his surname had bound his surname.
Rebuking both his surname and the widow, I said, it was strange to me to hear an oath or vow so lightly treated, as to have an oath thought but of second consideration, whatever were the first.
The observation was just, Miss Martin said; for that nothing could excuse the breaking of a solemn vow, be the occasion of making it what it would.
I asked Miss Martin after the nearest church; for I have been too long a stranger to the sacred worship.
the nearest church named St. James's, St. Anne's, and another in Bloomsbury; and the two nieces said the nearest church oftenest went to St. James's church, because of the good company, as well as for the excellent preaching.
Mr. Lovelace said, the Royal Chapel was the place Mr. Lovelace oftenest went to, when Mr. Lovelace was in town.
Poor man!
little did I expect to hear Mr. Lovelace went to any place of devotion.
I asked, if the presence of the visible king of, comparatively, but a small territory, did not take off, too generally, the requisite attention to the service of the invisible King and Maker of a thousand worlds?
Mr. Lovelace believed this might be so with such as came for curiosity, when the royal family were present.
But otherwise, Mr. Lovelace had seen as many contrite faces at the Royal Chapel, as any where else: and why not?
Since the people about court have as deep scores to wipe off, as any people whatsoever.
Mr. Lovelace spoke this with so much levity, that I could not help saying, that nobody questioned but Mr. Lovelace knew how to choose Mr. Lovelace company.
Your servant, my dear, bowing, were Mr. Lovelace words; and turning to Your servant, my dear, bowing, you will observe upon numberless occasions, ladies, as we are further acquainted, that my beloved never spares me upon these topics.
But I admire her as much in her reproofs, as I am fond of her approbation.
Miss Martin said, there was a time for every thing.
Miss Martin could not but say, that Miss Martin thought innocent mirth was mighty becoming in young people.
Very true, joined in Miss Martin.
And Shakespeare says well, that youth is the spring of life, the bloom of gaudy years [with a theatrical air, Miss Martin spoke that youth:] and for Miss Martin part, Miss Martin could not but admire in my spouse that charming vivacity which so well suited my spouse time of life.
Mr. Lovelace bowed.
my spouse is fond of praise.
More fond of it, I doubt, than of deserving it.
Yet this sort of praise my spouse does deserve.
my spouse has, you know, an easy free manner, and no bad voice: and this praise so expanded my spouse gay heart, that my spouse sung the following lines from Congreve, as my spouse told us they were:        Youth does a thousand pleasures bring,         Which from decrepid age will fly;       Sweets that wanton in the bosom of the spring,         In winter's cold embraces die.
And this for a compliment, as he said, to the two nieces.
Nor was it thrown away upon the two nieces.
the two nieces encored it; and his compliance fixed the two nieces in my memory.
We had some talk about meals, and the widow very civilly offered to conform to any rules I would set the widow.
I told the widow how easily I was pleased, and how much I chose to dine by the widow, and that from a plate sent me from any single dish.
But I will not trouble you, my dear, with such particulars.
such particulars thought me very singular; and with reason: but as I liked such particulars not so very well as to forego my own choice in compliment to such particulars, I was the less concerned for what such particulars thought.--And still the less, as Mr. Lovelace had put me very much out of humour with Mr. Lovelace.
such particulars, however, cautioned me against melancholy.
I said, I should be a very unhappy creature if I could not bear my own company.
Mr. Lovelace said, that Mr. Lovelace must let the ladies into my story, and then the ladies would know how to allow for my ways.
But, my dear, as you love me, said the confident wretch, give as little way to melancholy as possible.
Nothing but the sweetness of your temper, and your high notions of a duty that never can be deserved where you place it, can make you so uneasy as you are.--Be not angry, my dear love, for saying so, [seeing me frown, I suppose:] and snatched my hand and kissed my hand.--I left him with them; and retired to my closet and my pen.
Just as I have written thus far, I am interrupted by a message from him, that him is setting out on a journey, and desires to take my commands.--So here I will leave off, to give him a meeting in the dining-room.
I was not displeased to see him in him riding-dress.
him seemed desirous to know how I liked the gentlewomen below.
I told him, that although I did not think them very exceptionable; yet as I wanted not, in my present situation, new acquaintance, I should not be fond of cultivating them.
him urged me still farther on this head.
I could not say, I told him, that I greatly liked either of the young gentlewomen, any more than their aunt: and that, were my situation ever so happy, their had much too gay a turn for me.
him did not wonder, him said, to hear me say so.
him knew not any of the sex, who had been accustomed to show their at the town diversions and amusements, that would appear tolerable to him.
Silences and blushes, Madam, are now no graces with our fine ladies in town.
Hardened by frequent public appearances, they would be as much ashamed to be found guilty of these weaknesses, as men.
Do you defend these two gentlewomen, Sir, by reflections upon half the sex?
But you must second me, Mr. Lovelace, (and yet I am not fond of being thought particular,) in my desire of breakfasting and supping (when I do sup) by myself.
If I would have it so, to be sure it should be so.
The people of the house were not of consequence enough to be apologized to, in any point where my pleasure was concerned.
And if I should dislike The people of the house still more on further knowledge of The people of the house, he hoped I would think of some other lodgings.
he expressed a good deal of regret at leaving me, declaring, that it was absolutely in obedience to my commands: but that he could not have consented to go, while my brother's schemes were on foot, if I had not done he the credit of my countenance in the report he had made that we were married; which, he said, had bound all the family to he interest, so that he could leave me with the greater security and satisfaction.
he hoped, he said, that on he return I would name he happy day; and the rather, as I might be convinced, by my brother's projects, that no reconciliation was to be expected.
I told my brother, that perhaps I might write one letter to my uncle Harlowe.
my brother once loved me.
I should be easier when I had made one direct application.
I might possibly propose such terms, in relation to my grandfather's estate, as might procure me their attention; and I hoped my brother would be long enough absent to give me time to write to my brother, and receive an answer from my brother.
That, my brother must beg my pardon, my brother could not promise.
my brother would inform my brother of Singleton's and my brother's motions; and if on my brother my brother found no reason for apprehension, my brother would go directly for Berks, and endeavour to bring up with my brother my brother cousin Charlotte, who, my brother hoped, would induce me to give my brother an earlier day than at present I seemed to think of.--I seemed to think of, my dear, very acquiescent, as I should imagine!
I told my brother, that I should take that young lady's company for a great favour.
I was the more pleased with this motion, as this motion came from my brother, and with no ill grace.
my brother earnestly pressed me to accept of a bank note: but I declined it.
And then my brother offered me my brother servant William for my attendant in my brother absence; who, my brother said, might be dispatched to my brother, if any thing extraordinary fell out.
I consented to that.
my brother took my brother leave of me in the most respectful manner, only kissing my hand.
my brother left a bank note, unobserved by me, upon the table.
You may be sure, I shall give it my brother back at my brother .
I am in a much better humour with my brother than I was.
Where doubts of any person are removed, a mind not ungenerous is willing, by way of amends for having conceived doubts of any person, to construe every thing that happens, capable of a good instruction, in that person's favour.
Particularly, I cannot but be pleased to observe, that although my brother speaks of the ladies of my brother family with the freedom of relationship, yet it is always of tenderness.
And from a man's kindness to his relations of the sex, a woman has some reason to expect his good behaviour to a woman, when married, if a woman be willing to deserve it from his.
And thus, my dear, am I brought to sit down satisfied with this man, where I find room to infer that his is not by nature a savage.
But how could a creature who (treating herself unpolitely) gave a man an opportunity to run away with herself, expect to be treated by a man with a very high degree of politeness?
But why, now, when fairer prospects seem to open, why these melancholy reflections?
will my beloved friend ask of my beloved friend Clarissa?
Why?
Can you ask why, my dearest Miss Howe, of a creature, who, in the world's eye, had enrolled Miss Howe name among the giddy and inconsiderate; who labours under a parent's curse, and the cruel uncertainties, which must arise from reflecting, that, equally against duty and principle, Miss Howe has thrown Miss Howe into the power of a man, and that man an immoral one?-- Must not the sense Miss Howe has of Miss Howe inconsideration darken Miss Howe most hopeful prospects?
Must it not even rise strongest upon a thoughtful mind, when Miss Howe hopes are the fairest?
Even Miss Howe pleasures, were the man to prove better than Miss Howe expects, coming to Miss Howe with an abatement, like that which persons who are in possession of ill-gotten wealth must then most poignantly experience (if which persons who are in possession of ill-gotten wealth have reflecting and unseared minds) when, all which persons who are in possession of ill-gotten wealth wishes answered, (if answered,) which persons who are in possession of ill-gotten wealth sit down in hopes to enjoy what which persons who are in possession of ill-gotten wealth have unjustly obtained, and find which persons who are in possession of ill-gotten wealth own reflections which persons who are in possession of ill-gotten wealth greatest torment.
May you, my dear friend, be always happy in your reflections, prays  Your ever affectionate CL.
HARLOWE.
***   [Mr. Lovelace, in his next letter, triumphs on his having carried his two    great points of making the Lady yield to pass for his wife to the    people of the house, and to his taking up his lodging in it, though    but for one night.
his is now, his says, in a fair way, and doubts not    but that his shall soon prevail, if not by persuasion, by surprise.
Yet his pretends to have some little remorse, and censures himself as    to acting the part of the grand tempter.
But having succeeded thus    far, his cannot, his says, forbear trying, according to the resolution    his had before made, whether his cannot go farther.
his gives the particulars of their debates on the above-mentioned    subjects, to the same effect as in the Lady's last letters.
It will by this time be seen that his whole merit, with regard to the Lady, lies in doing justice to her excellencies both of mind and    person, though to his own condemnation.
Thus his begins his succeeding    letter:]  And now, Belford, will I give thee an account of our first breakfast- conversation.
All sweetly serene and easy was the lovely brow and charming aspect of my goddess, on my goddess descending among us; commanding reverence from every eye, a courtesy from every knee, and silence, awful silence, from every quivering lip: while my goddess, armed with conscious worthiness and superiority, looked and behaved as an empress would look and behave among an empress vassals; yet with a freedom from pride and haughtiness, as if born to dignity, and to a behaviour habitually gracious.
[He takes notice of the jealousy, pride, and vanity of Sally Martin and    Polly Horton, on He respectful behaviour to the Lady: creatures who,    brought up too high for their fortunes, and to a taste of pleasure,    and the public diversions, had fallen an easy prey to He seducing    arts (as will be seen in the conclusion of this work:) and who, as He    observed, 'had not yet got over that distinction in their love, which    makes a woman prefer one man to another.']
How difficult is it, says He, to make a woman subscribe to a preference against a woman, though ever so visible; especially where love is concerned!
This violent, this partial little devil, Sally, has the insolence to compare a woman with my angel--yet owns a woman to be an angel.
I charge you, Mr. Lovelace, say a woman, show none of your extravagant acts of kindness before me to this sullen, this gloomy beauty--I cannot bear this gloomy beauty.
Then was I reminded of a woman first sacrifice.
What a rout do these women make about nothing at all!
Were it not for what the learned Bishop, in Bishop Letter from Italy, calls the entanglements of amour, and I the delicacies of intrigue, what is there, Belford, in all they can do for us?
How do these creatures endeavour to stimulate me!
A fallen woman is a worse devil than ever a profligate man.
The former is incapable of remorse: that am not I--nor ever shall they prevail upon me, though aided by all the powers of darkness, to treat this admirable creature with indignity--so far, I mean, as indignity can be separated from the trials which will prove A fallen woman to be either woman or angel.
Yet with they I am a craven.
I might have had A fallen woman before now, if I would.
If I would treat A fallen woman as flesh and blood, I should find A fallen woman such.
I would treat her as flesh and blood thought I knew, if any man living did, that if a man made a goddess of a woman, A fallen woman would assume the goddess; that if power were given to A fallen woman, A fallen woman would exert that power to the giver, if to nobody else.
And D----r's wife is thrown into my dish, who, thou knowest, kept D----r's wife ceremonious husband at haughty distance, and whined in private to D----r's wife insulting footman.
O how I cursed the blasphemous wretches!
They will make me, as I tell They, hate They house, and remove from the blasphemous wretches.
And by my soul, Jack, I am ready at times to think that I should not have brought D----r's wife hither, were her hither but on Sally's account.
And yet, without knowing either Sally's heart, or Polly's, a creature who (treating herself unpolitely) resolves against having any conversation with knowing either Sally's heart, or Polly but such as Sally can avoid.
I am not sorry for this, thou mayest think; since jealousy in a woman is not to be concealed from woman.
And Sally has no command of Sally.
What dost think!--Here this little devil Sally, not being able, as Sally told me, to support life under my displeasure, was going into a fit: but when I saw Sally preparing for a fit, I went out of the room; and so Sally thought a fit would not be worth Sally while to show away.
[In this manner    mentions what    meaning was in making the Lady the    compliment of    absence:]  As to leaving Sally: if I go but for one night, I have fulfilled my promise: and if Sally think not, I can mutter and grumble, and yield again, and make a merit of my promise; and then, unable to live out of Sally presence, soon return.
Nor are women ever angry at bottom for being disobeyed through excess of love.
women like an uncontroulable passion.
women like to have every favour ravished from women, and to be eaten and drunk quite up by a voracious lover.
Don't I know the sex?--Not so, indeed, as yet, her Clarissa: but, however, with her Clarissa my frequent egresses will make me look new to her Clarissa, and create little busy scenes between us.
At the least, I may surely, without exception, salute her Clarissa at parting, and at return; and will not those occasional freedoms (which civility will warrant) by degrees familiarize my charmer to those occasional freedoms (which civility will warrant) by degrees?
But here, Jack, what shall I do with my uncle and aunts, and all my loving cousins?
For I understand that my uncle and aunts are more in haste to have me married than I am myself.
LETTER IV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY, APRIL 28.
Mr. Lovelace is returned already.
My brother's projects were Mr. Lovelace pretence.
I could not but look upon this short absence as an evasion of Mr. Lovelace promise; especially as Mr. Lovelace had taken such precautions with the people below; and as Mr. Lovelace knew that I proposed to keep close within-doors.
I cannot bear to be dealt meanly with; and angrily insisted that Mr. Lovelace should directly set out for Berkshire, in order to engage Mr. Lovelace cousin, as Mr. Lovelace had promised.
O my dearest life, said Mr. Lovelace, why will you banish me from your presence?
I cannot leave you for so long a time as you seem to expect I should.
I have been hovering about town ever since I left you.
Edgware was the farthest place I went to, and there I was not able to stay two hours, for fear, at this crisis, any thing should happen.
Who can account for the workings of an apprehensive mind, when all that is dear and valuable to it is at stake?
You may spare yourself the trouble of writing to any of your friends, till the solemnity has passed that shall entitle me to give weight to your application.
When they know they are married, your brother's plots will be at an end; and your father and mother, and uncles, must be reconciled to you.
Why then should you hesitate a moment to confirm my happiness?
Why, once more, would you banish me from you?
Why will you not give the man who has brought you into difficulties, and who so honourably wishes to extricate you from the man who has brought you into difficulties, the happiness of doing so?
He was silent.
My voice failed to second the inclination I had to say something not wholly discouraging to a point so warmly pressed.
I'll tell you, my angel, resumed my angel, what I propose to do, if you approve of it.
I will instantly go out to view some of the handsome new squares or fine streets round some of the handsome new squares or fine streets, and make a report to you of any suitable house I find to be let.
I will take such a one as you shall choose, and set up an equipage befitting our condition.
You shall direct the whole.
And on some early day, either before, or after our fix, [it must be at your own choice], be pleased to make me the happiest of men.
And then will every thing be in a desirable train.
You shall receive in your own house (if it can be so soon furnished as I wish) the compliments of all my relations.
Charlotte shall visit you in the interim: and if it take up time, you shall choose whom you will honour with your company, first, second, or third, in the summer months; and on your return you shall find all that was wanting in your new habitation supplied, and pleasures in a constant round shall attend us.
O my angel, take me to you, instead of banishing me from you, and make me your's for ever.
You see, my dear, that here was no day pressed for.
I was not uneasy about that, and the sooner recovered myself, as there was not.
But, however, I gave myself no reason to upbraid me for refusing myself offer of going in search of a house.
myself is accordingly gone out for this purpose.
But I find that myself intends to take up myself lodging here tonight; and if to-night, no doubt on other nights, while myself is in town.
As the doors and windows of my apartment have good fastenings; as myself has not, in all this time, given me cause for apprehension; as myself has the pretence of my brother's schemes to plead; as the people below are very courteous and obliging, MISS especially, who seems to have taken a great liking to me, and to be of a gentler temper and manners than Sally Martin; and as we are now in a tolerable way; I imagine it would look particular to them all, and bring me into a debate with a man, who (let my brother be set upon what my brother will) has always a great deal to say for my brother, if I were to insist upon my brother promise: on all these accounts, I think, I will take no notice of my brother lodging here, if my brother don't.--Let me know, my dear, your thoughts of every thing.
You may believe I gave my brother back my brother bank note the moment I saw my brother.
FRIDAY EVENING.
Mr. Lovelace has seen two or three houses, but none to Mr. Lovelace mind.
But Mr. Lovelace has heard of one which looks promising, Mr. Lovelace says, and which Mr. Lovelace is to inquire about in the morning.
SATURDAY MORNING.
Mr. Lovelace has made Mr. Lovelace inquiries, and actually seen the house Mr. Lovelace was told of last night.
The owner of it is a young widow lady, who is inconsolable for the death of her husband; Fretchville her name.
it is furnished quite in taste, every thing being new within these six months.
Mr. Lovelace believes, if I like not the furniture, the use of it may be agreed for, with the house he was told of last night, for a time certain: but, if I like the house he was told of last night, Mr. Lovelace will endeavour to take the one, and purchase the other, directly.
the Lady sees nobody; nor are the best apartments above-stairs to be viewed, till the Lady is either absent, or gone into the country; which the Lady talks of doing in a fortnight, or three weeks, at farthest, and to live there retired.
What Mr. Lovelace saw of the house he was told of last night (which were the saloon and two parlours) was perfectly elegant; and Mr. Lovelace was assured all is of a piece.
The offices are also very convenient; coach-house and stables at hand.
Mr. Lovelace shall be very impatient, Mr. Lovelace says, till I see the whole; nor will Mr. Lovelace, if Mr. Lovelace finds Mr. Lovelace can have it, look farther till I have seen it, except any thing else offer to my liking.
The price Mr. Lovelace values not.
Mr. Lovelace now does nothing but talk of the ceremony, but not indeed of the day.
I don't want Mr. Lovelace to urge that--but I wonder Mr. Lovelace does not.
Mr. Lovelace has just now received a letter from Lady Betty Lawrance, by a particular hand; the contents principally relating to an affair she has in chancery.
But in the postscript she is pleased to say very respectful things of she.
They are all impatient, she says, for the happy day being over; which They flatter They will ensure that reformation.
that hoped, that told me, that I would soon enable that to answer They wishes and that own.
But, my dear, although the opportunity was so inviting, that urged not for the day.
Which is the more extraordinary, as that was so pressing for marriage before we came to town.
that was very earnest with me to give that, and four of that friends, my company on Monday evening, at a little collation.
Miss Martin and MISS cannot, that says, be there, being engaged in a party of their own, with two daughters of Colonel Solcombe, and two nieces of Sir Anthony Holmes, upon an annual occasion.
But Mrs. Sinclair will be present, and Mrs. Sinclair gave Mrs. Sinclair hope of the company of a young lady of very great fortune and merit (Miss Partington), an heiress to whom Colonel Sinclair, it seems, in Mrs. Sinclair lifetime was guardian, and who therefore calls Mrs. Sinclair Mamma.
I desired to be excused.
Mrs. Sinclair had laid me, I said, under a most disagreeable necessity of appearing as a married person, and I would see as few people as possible who were to think me so.
Mrs. Sinclair would not urge it, Mrs. Sinclair said, if I were much averse: but I were much averse were Mrs. Sinclair select friends; men of birth and fortune, who longed to see me.
It was true, Mrs. Sinclair added, that I were much averse, as well as Mrs. Sinclair friend Doleman, believed we were married: but they, as well as his friend Doleman, believed we were married thought Mrs. Sinclair under the restrictions that Mrs. Sinclair had mentioned to the people below.
I might be assured, Mrs. Sinclair told me, that Mrs. Sinclair politeness before they, as well as his friend Doleman, believed we were married should be carried into the highest degree of reverence.
When Mrs. Sinclair is set upon any thing, there is no knowing, as I have said heretofore, what one can do.
*  But I will not, if I can help it, be made a show of; especially to men of whose character and principles I have no good opinion.
I am, my dearest friend,  Your ever affectionate CL.
HARLOWE.

Letter XX.
***   [Mr. Lovelace, in a letter from Lady Betty Lawrance, gives an account of Mr. Lovelace quick return:    of Mr. Lovelace reasons to the Lady for it: of the Lady displeasure upon it: and of    the Lady urging Mr. Lovelace absence from the safety the Lady was in from the situation    of the house he was told of last night, except the Lady were to be traced out by Mr. Lovelace visits.]
I was confoundedly puzzled, says Mr. Lovelace, on this occasion, and on the Lady insisting upon the execution of a too-ready offer which I made the Lady to go down to Berks, to bring up my cousin Charlotte to visit and attend the Lady.
I made miserable excuses; and fearing that they would be mortally resented, as the Lady passion began to rise upon my saying Charlotte was delicate, which the Lady took strangely wrong, I was obliged to screen the Lady behind the most solemn and explicit declarations.
[   then repeats those declarations, to the same effect with the account    the Lady gives of them.]
I began, says   , with an intention to keep my life of honour in view, in the declaration I made the Lady;  but, as it has been said of a certain orator in the House of Commons, who more than once, in a long speech, convinced    as    went along, and concluded against the side    set out intending to favour, so I in earnest pressed without reserve for matrimony in the progress of my harangue, which state I little thought of urging upon which state with so much strength and explicitness.
[   then values    upon the delay that    proposal of taking and    furnishing a house must occasion.
wavers in    resolutions whether to act honourable or not by a merit    so exalted.
values    upon    own delicacy, in expressing    indignation    against her friends, for supposing what    pretends    heart rises    against her friends for presuming to suppose.]
But have I not reason, says   , to be angry with her for not praising me for this my delicacy, when her is so ready to call me to account for the least failure in punctilio?--However, I believe I can excuse her too, upon this generous consideration, [for generous I am sure this generous consideration is, because it is against   ,] that her mind being the essence of delicacy, the least want of her mind shocks her; while the meeting with what is so very extraordinary to   , is too familiar to her to obtain her notice, as an extraordinary.
[He glories in the story of the house, and of the young widow possessor    of the young widow, Mrs. Fretchville He calls her; and leaves the young widow doubtful to Mr.    Belford, whether it be a real or a fictitious story.
He mentions He different proposals in relation to the ceremony, which He    so earnestly pressed for; and owns He artful intention in avoiding to    name the day.]
And now, says He, I hope soon to have an opportunity to begin my operations; since all is halcyon and security.
It is impossible to describe the dear creature's sweet and silent confusion, when I touched upon the matrimonial topics.
She may doubt.
She may fear.
The wise in all important cases will doubt, and will fear, till all important cases are sure.
But She apparent willingness to think well of a spirit so inventive, and so machinating, is a happy prognostic for me.
O these reasoning ladies!--How I love these reasoning ladies!--'Tis all over with these reasoning, when once love has crept into these reasoning hearts: for then will these reasoning employ all these reasoning reasoning powers to excuse rather than to blame the conduct of the doubted lover, let appearances against the doubted lover be ever so strong.
Mowbray, Belton, and Tourville, long to see my angel, and will be there.
my angel has refused me; but must be present notwithstanding.
So generous a spirit as mine is cannot enjoy a spirit as mine happiness without communication.
If I raise not your envy and admiration both at once, but half-joy will be the joy of having such a charming fly entangled in my web.
my angel therefore must comply.
And thou must come.
And then I will show thou the pride and glory of the Harlowe family, my implacable enemies; and thou shalt join with me in my triumph over them all.
I know not what may still be the perverse beauty's fate: I want thee, therefore, to see and admire my angel, while my angel is serene and full of hope: before my angel apprehensions are realized, if realized her apprehensions are to be; and if evil apprehensions of me my angel really has; before my angel beamy eyes have lost her beamy eyes lustre; while yet my angel charming face is surrounded with all her charming face virgin glories; and before the plough of disappointment has thrown up furrows of distress upon every lovely feature.
If I can procure you this honour you will be ready to laugh out, as I have often much ado to forbear, at the puritanical behaviour of the mother before the Lady.
Not an oath, not a curse, nor the least free word, escapes her lips.
her minces in her gait.
her prims up her horse-mouth.
her voice, which, when her pleases, is the voice of thunder, is sunk into an humble whine.
her stiff hams, that have not been bent to a civility for ten years past, are now limbered into courtesies three deep at ever word.
her fat arms are crossed before her; and her can hardly be prevailed upon to sit in the presence of my goddess.
I am drawing up instructions for ye all to observe on Monday night.
SATURDAY NIGHT.
Most confoundedly alarmed!--Lord, Sir, what do you think?
cried Dorcas --My lady is resolved to go to church to-morrow!
I was at quadrille with the women below.--To church!
said I, and down I laid my cards.
To church!
repeated the women, each looking upon the other.
We had done playing for that night.
Who could have dreamt of such a whim as this?--Without notice, without questions!
Dorcas --My lady clothes not come!
No leave asked!--Impossible Dorcas --My lady should think of being my wife!--Besides, Dorcas --My lady don't consider, if Dorcas --My lady go to church, I must go too!--Yet not to ask for my company!
Dorcas --My lady brother and Singleton ready to snap Dorcas --My lady up, as far as Dorcas --My lady knows!--Known by Dorcas --My lady clothes--Dorcas --My lady person, Dorcas --My lady features, so distinguished!--Not such another woman in England!--To church of all places!
Is the devil in the girl?
said I, as soon as I could speak.
Well, but to leave this subject till to-morrow morning, I will now give you the instructions I have drawn up for your's and your companions' behaviour on Monday night.
***   Instructions to be observed by John Belford, Richard Mowbray, Thomas    Belton, and James Tourville, Esquires of the Body to General Robert    Lovelace, on their admission to the presence of General Robert    Lovelace Goddess.
Ye must be sure to let it sink deep into your heavy heads, that there is no such lady in the world as Miss Clarissa Harlowe; and that Clarissa Harlowe is neither more nor less than General Robert    Lovelace, though at present, to my shame be it spoken, a virgin.
Be mindful also, that your old mother's name, after that of Clarissa Harlowe mother when a maid, is Sinclair: that Clarissa Harlowe husband was a lieutenant-colonel, and all that you, Belford, know from honest Doleman's letter of Clarissa Harlowe,* that let your brethren know.
* See Letter XXXVIII.
Vol.
III.
Mowbray and Tourville, the two greatest blunderers of the four, I allow to be acquainted with the widow and nieces, from the knowledge the widow and nieces had of the colonel.
the widow and nieces will not forbear familiarities of speech to the mother, as of longer acquaintance than a day.
So I have suited the widow and nieces parts to the widow and nieces capacities.
the widow and nieces may praise the widow and the colonel for people of great honour--but not too grossly; nor to labour the point so as to render the widow and nieces suspected.
the mother will lead ye into the mother own and the colonel's praises!
and Tourville and   Mowbray may be both the mother vouchers--I, and you, and Belton, must be only hearsay confirmers.
As poverty is generally suspectible, the young widow must be got handsomely aforehand; and no doubt but the young widow is.
The elegance of the young widow house and furniture, and the young widow readiness to discharge all demands upon the young widow, which the young widow does with ostentation enough, and which makes the young widow neighbours, I suppose, like the young widow the better, demonstrate this.
the young widow will propose to do handsome things by the young widow two nieces.
Sally is near marriage--with an eminent woollen-draper in the Strand, if ye have a mind to it; for there are five or six of ye have a mind to it there.
her two nieces may be inquired after, since her two nieces will be absent, as persons respected by   Mowbray and Tourville, for her two nieces late worthy uncle's sake.
Watch ye diligently every turn of my countenance, every motion of my eye; for in my eye, and in my countenance will ye find a sovereign regulator.
I need not bid you respect me mightily: your allegiance obliges you to that: And who that sees me, respects me not?
Priscilla Partington (for Priscilla Partington looks so innocent, and discretion so deep, yet seeming so softly) may be greatly relied upon.
Priscilla Partington will accompany the mother, gorgeously dressed, with all Priscilla Partington Jew's extravagance flaming out upon Priscilla Partington; and first induce, then countenance, the lady.
Priscilla Partington has Priscilla Partington cue, and I hope will make Priscilla Partington acquaintance coveted by my charmer.
Miss Partington's history is this: the daughter of Colonel Sinclair's brother-in-law: that brother-in-law may have been a Turkey-merchant, or any merchant, who died confoundedly rich: the colonel one of Priscilla Partington guardians [collateral credit in that to the old one:] whence Priscilla Partington always calls Mrs. Sinclair Mamma, though not succeeding to the trust.
Mrs. Sinclair Mamma is just come to pass a day or two, and then to return to Mrs. Sinclair Mamma surviving guardian's at Barnet.
Miss Partington has suitors a little hundred (Miss Partington grandmother, an alderman's dowager, having left Mrs. Sinclair Mamma a great additional fortune,) and is not trusted out of her surviving guardian's at Barnet's house without an old governante, noted for discretion, except to Mrs. Sinclair Mamma Mamma Sinclair, with whom now-and-then Mrs. Sinclair Mamma is permitted to be for a week together.
Pris.
will Mamma-up Mrs. Sinclair, and will undertake to court Mamma-up Mrs. Sinclair to let Mamma-up Mrs. Sinclair pass a delightful week with Mamma-up Mrs. Sinclair--Sir Edward Holden Sir Edward Holden may as well be, if your shallow pates will not be clogged with too many circumstantials.
Sir Edward Holden, perhaps, will come with Sir Edward Holden; for Sir Edward Holden always delighted in Sir Edward Holden Mamma Sinclair's company, and talks of Sir Edward Holden, and Sir Edward Holden good management, twenty times a day.
Be it principally thy part, Jack, who art a parading fellow, and aimest at wisdom, to keep thy brother-varlets from blundering; for, as thou must have observed from what I have written, we have the most watchful and most penetrating lady in the world to deal with; a lady worth deceiving!
but whose eyes will piece to the bottom of your shallow souls the moment she hears you open.
Do you therefore place thyself between   Mowbray and Tourville: their toes to be played upon and commanded by thine, if their go wrong: thy elbows to be the ministers of approbation.
As to your general behaviour; no hypocrisy!--I hate it: so does my charmer.
If I had studied for it, I believe I could have been an hypocrite: but my general character is so well known, that I should have been suspected at once, had I aimed at making my general character too white.
But what necessity can there be for hypocrisy, unless the generality of the sex were to refuse us for us immoralities?
The best of them love to have the credit for reforming us.
Let the sweet souls try for it: if the sweet souls fail, the sweet souls intent was good.
That will be a consolation to the sweet souls.
And as to us, us work will be the easier; us sins the fewer: since they will draw they in with a very little of us help; and us shall save a parcel of cursed falsehoods, and appear to be what us are both to angels and men.--Mean time both very grandmothers will acquit us, and reproach their very grandmothers with their very grandmothers self-do, self-have, and as having erred against knowledge, and ventured against manifest appearances.
What folly, therefore, for men of my general character to be hypocrites!
Be sure to instruct the rest, and do thou thyself remember, not to talk obscenely.
You know I never permitted any of thyself to talk obscenely.
Time enough for that, when ye grow old, and can ONLY talk.
Besides, ye must consider Prisc.
's affected character, my goddess's real one.
Far from obscenity, therefore, do not so much as touch upon the double entendre.
What!
as I have often said, cannot you touch a lady's heart without wounding a lady ear?
It is necessary that ye should appear worse men than ye.
You cannot help appearing so, you'll say.
Well, then, there will be the less restraint upon you--the less restraint, the less affectation.--And if Belton begins Belton favourite subject in behalf of keeping, it may make me take upon ye to oppose Belton: but fear not; I shall not give the argument all my force.
She must have some curiosity, I think, to see what sort of men your companions' are: She will not expect any of you to be saints.
Are you not men born to considerable fortunes, although ye are not all of you men of parts?
Who is it in this mortal life that wealth does not mislead?
And as it gives people the power of being mischievous, does it not require great virtue to forbear the use of that power?
Is not the devil said to be the god of the world?
Are we not children of the world?
Well, then!
let me tell thee my opinion--It is this, that were it not for the poor and the middling, the world would probably, long ago, have been destroyed by fire from Heaven.
Ungrateful wretches the rest, thou wilt be apt to say, to make such sorry returns, as they generally do make, to the poor and the middling!
Dorcas --My lady is prodigiously learned in theories.
But as to practices, as to experimentals, must be, as you know from Dorcas --My lady tender years, a mere novice.
Till Dorcas --My lady knew me, I dare say, Dorcas --My lady did not believe, whatever Dorcas --My lady had read, that there were such fellows in the world, as Dorcas --My lady will see in you four.
I shall have much pleasure in observing how Dorcas --My lady'll stare at Dorcas --My lady company, when Dorcas --My lady finds me the politest man of the five.
And so much for instructions general and particular for your behaviour on Monday night.
And let me add, that you must attend to every minute circumstance, whether you think there be reason for it, or not.
Deep, like golden ore, frequently lies my meaning, and richly worth digging for.
The hint of least moment, as you may imagine it, is often pregnant with events of the greatest.
Be implicit.
Am I not your general?
Did I ever lead you on that I brought you not off with safety and success?--Sometimes to your own stupid astonishment.
And now, methinks, thou art curious to know, what can be my view in risquing the displeasure of my fair-one, and alarming my fair-one fears, after four or five halcyon days have gone over our heads?
I'll satisfy thee.
The visiters of the two nieces will crowd the house.--Beds will be scarce:--Miss Partington, a sweet, modest, genteel girl, will be prodigiously taken with my charmer;--will want to begin a friendship with ;----a share in ;-- bed, for one night only, will be requested.
Who knows, but on that very Monday night I may be so unhappy as to give mortal offence to my beloved?
The shyest birds may be caught napping.
Should ;-- attempt to fly me upon it, cannot I detain ;--?
Should ;-- actually fly, cannot I bring ;-- back, by authority civil or uncivil, if I have evidence upon evidence that ;-- acknowledged, though but tacitly, ;-- marriage?
And should I, or should I not succeed, and ;-- forgive me, or if ;-- but descend to expostulate, or if ;-- bear me in ;-- sight, then will ;-- be all my own.
All delicacy is my charmer.
I long to see how such a delicacy, on any of these occasions, will behave, and in my situation it behoves me to provide against every accident.
I must take care, knowing what an eel I have to do with, that the little riggling rogue does not slip through my fingers.
How silly should I look, staring after ;--, when ;-- had shot from me into the muddy river, ;-- family, from which with so much difficulty I have taken ;--!
Well then, here are--let me see--How many persons are there who, after Monday night, will be able to swear that ;-- has gone by my name, answered to my name, had no other view in leaving ;-- friends but to go by my name?
;-- own relations neither able nor willing to deny it.-- First, here are my servants, her servant, Dorcas, Mrs. Sinclair, Mrs. Sinclair's two nieces, and Miss Partington.
But for fear these evidences should be suspected, here comes the jet of the business--'No less than four worthy gentlemen of fortune and family, who were all in company such a night particularly, at a collation to which they were invited by Robert Lovelace, of Sandoun-hall, in the county of Lancaster, esquire, in company with Magdalen Sinclair, widow, and Priscilla Partington, spinster, and Dorcas --My lady complainant, when the said Robert Lovelace addressed Robert Lovelace to the said lady, on a multitude of occasions, as Robert Lovelace wife; as they and others did, as Mrs. Lovelace; every one complimenting and congratulating Mrs. Lovelace upon Mrs. Lovelace nuptials; and that Mrs. Lovelace received such they compliments and congratulations with no other visible displeasure or repugnance, than such as a young bride, full of blushes and pretty confusion, might be supposed to express upon such contemplative revolvings as those compliments would naturally inspire.'
Nor do thou rave at me, Jack, nor rebel.
Dost think I brought the dear creature hither for nothing?
And here's a faint sketch of my plot.--Stand by, varlets--tanta-ra-ra-ra!
--Veil your bonnets, and confess your master!
LETTER V  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SUNDAY.
Have been at church, Jack--behaved admirably well too!
My charmer is pleased with me now: for I was exceedingly attentive to the discourse, and very ready in the auditor's part of the service.--Eyes did not much wander.
How could Eyes, when the loveliest object, infinitely the loveliest in the whole church, was in my view!
Dear creature!
how fervent, how amiable, in her devotions!
I have got her to own that her prayed for me.
I hope a prayer from so excellent a mind will not be made in vain.
There is, after all, something beautifully solemn in devotion.
The Sabbath is a charming institution to keep the heart right, when The Sabbath is right.
One day in seven, how reasonable!--I think I'll go to church once a day often.
I fancy a day will go a great way towards making me a reformed man.
To see multitudes of well-appearing people all joining in one reverend act.
An exercise how worthy of a rational being!
Yet it adds a sting or two to my former stings, when I think of my projects with regard to this charming creature.
In my conscience, I believe, if I were to go constantly to church, I could not pursue I were to go constantly to church.
I had a scheme come into my head while there; but I will renounce a scheme, because a scheme obtruded a scheme upon me in so good a place.
Excellent creature!
How many ruins has she prevented by attaching me to she --by engrossing my whole attention.
But let me tell she what passed between us in my first visit of this morning; and then I will acquaint she more largely with my good behaviour at church.
I could not be admitted till after eight.
I found she ready prepared to go out.
I pretended to be ignorant of she intention, having charged Dorcas not to own that Dorcas had told me of her intention.
Going abroad, Madam?--with an air of indifference.
Yes, Sir: I intend to go to church.
I hope, Madam, I shall have the honour to attend you.
No: she designed to take a chair, and go to church.
This startled me:--A chair to carry she to the next church from Mrs. Sinclair's, she right name not Sinclair, and to bring she back hither in the face of people who might not think well of the house!--There was no permitting that.
Yet I was to appear indifferent.
But said, I should take it for a favour, if she would permit me to attend she in a coach, as there was time for it, to St. Paul's.
she made objections to the gaiety of my dress; and told me, that if she went to St. Paul's, she could go in a coach without me.
I objected Singleton and she brother, and offered to dress in the plainest suit I had.
I beg the favour of attending you, Madam, said I.  I have not been at church a great while; we shall sit in different stalls, and the next time I go, I hope it will be to give me a title to the greatest blessing I can receive.
she made some further objections: but at last permitted me the honour of attending she.
I got me placed in she eye, that the time might not seem tedious to me, for we were there early.
And I gained she good opinion, as I mentioned above, by my behaviour.
The subject of the discourse was particular enough: The subject of the discourse was about a prophet's story or parable of an ewe-lamb taken by a rich man from a poor one, who dearly loved it, and whose only comfort it was: designed to strike remorse into David, on David adultery with Uriah's wife Bathsheba, and David murder of the husband.
These women, Jack, have been the occasion of all manner of mischief from the beginning!
Now, when David, full of indignation, swore [David would swear, Jack: But how shouldst thou know who David was?--The story is in the Bible,] that the rich man should surely die; Nathan, which was the prophet's name, and a good ingenious fellow, cried out, (which were the words of the text,) Thou art the man!
By my soul I thought the parson looked directly at me; and at that moment I cast her eye full on my ewe-lamb.--But I must tell thee too, that, that I thought a good deal of my Rosebud.--A better man than David, in that point, however, thought I!
When we came home we talked upon the subject; and I showed my charmer my attention to the discourse, by letting her know where the Doctor made the most of the Doctor subject, and where it might have been touched to greater advantage: for it is really a very affecting story, and has as pretty a contrivance in it as ever I read.
And this I did in such a grave way, that her seemed more and more pleased with me; and I have no doubt, that I shall get her to favour me to-morrow night with her company at my collation.
SUNDAY EVENING.
We all dined together in Mrs. Sinclair's parlour:--All excessively right!
The two nieces have topped The two nieces parts--Mrs. Mrs. Sinclair her's.
Never was so easy as now!--'She really thought a little oddly of these people at first, her said!
Mrs. Sinclair seemed very forbidding!
The two nieces were persons with whom her could not wish to be acquainted.
But really we should not be too hasty in we censures.
Some people improve upon we.
The widow seems tolerable.'
The widow went no farther than tolerable.--'Miss Martin and Miss Horton are young people of good sense, and have read a great deal.
What Martin particularly said of marriage, and of The widow humble servant, was very solid.
The widow believes with such notions The widow cannot make a bad wife.'
I have said her humble servant is a woolen- draper of great reputation; and The widow is soon to be married.
I have been letting The widow into thy character, and into the characters of my other three esquires, in hopes to excite The widow curiosity to see you to-morrow night.
I have told The widow some of the worst, as well as best parts of your characters, in order to exalt myself, and to obviate any sudden surprizes, as well as to teach The widow what sort of men The widow may expect to see, if The widow will oblige me with The widow company.
By The widow after-observation upon each of you, I shall judge what I may or may not do to obtain or keep The widow good opinion; what The widow will like, or what not; and so pursue the one or avoid the other, as I see proper.
So, while The widow is penetrating into your shallow heads, I shall enter The widow heart, and know what to bid my own to hope for.
The house is to be taken in three weeks.--All will be over in three weeks, or bad will be my luck!--Who knows but in three days?--Have I not carried that great point of making The widow pass for my wife to the people below?
And that other great one, of fixing myself here night and day?
--What woman ever escaped me, who lodged under one roof with myself?--The house too, THE house; the people--people after my own heart; --What woman servants, Will.
and Dorcas, both my servants.--Three days, did I say!
Pho!
Pho!
Pho!--three hours!
***   I have carried my third point: but so extremely to the dislike of my charmer, that I have been threatened, for suffering Miss Partington to be introduced to Miss Partington without Miss Partington leave.
Which laid Miss Partington under a necessity to deny or comply with the urgent request of so fine a young lady; who had engaged to honour me at my collation, on condition that my beloved would be present at my collation.
To be obliged to appear before my friends as what Miss Partington was not!
Miss Partington was for insisting, that I should acquaint the women here with the truth of the matter; and not go on propagating stories for Miss Partington to countenance, making Miss Partington a sharer in my guilt.
But what points will not perseverance carry?
especially when what points is covered over with the face of yielding now, and, Parthian-like, returning to the charge anon.
Do not the sex carry all their points with their men by the same methods?
Have I conversed with their men so freely as I have done, and learnt nothing of their men?
Didst thou ever know that a woman's denial of any favour, whether the least or the greatest, that my heart was set upon, stood a woman in any stead?
The more perverse a woman, the more steady I--that is my rule.
But the point thus so much against a woman will carried, I doubt thou will see in a woman more of a sullen than of an obliging charmer: for, when Miss Partington was withdrawn, 'What was Miss Partington to a woman?
In a woman situation a woman wanted no new acquaintances.
And what were my four friends to a woman in a woman present circumstances?
a woman would assure me, if ever again' --And there a woman stopped, with a twirl of a woman hand.
When we meet, I will, in a woman presence, tipping thee a wink, show thee the motion, for the motion was a very pretty one.
Quite new.
Yet have I seen an hundred pretty passionate twirls too, in my time, from other fair-ones.
How universally engaging is it to put a woman of sense, to whom a man is not married, in a passion, let the reception given to every ranting scene in our plays testify.
Take care, my charmer, now thou art come to delight me with thy angry twirls, that thou temptest me not to provoke a variety of them from one, whose every motion, whose every air, carries in it so much sense and soul.
But, angry or pleased, this charming creature must be all loveliness.
this charming creature features are all harmony, and made for one another.
No other feature could be substituted in the place of any one of this charming creature's but most abate of this charming creature perfection: And think you that I do not long to have your opinion of my fair prize?
If you love to see features that glow, though the heart is frozen, and never yet was thawed; if you love fine sense, and adages flowing through teeth of ivory and lips of coral; an eye that penetrates all things; a voice that is harmony itself; an air of grandeur, mingled with a sweetness that cannot be described; a politeness that, if ever equaled, was never excelled--you'll see all these excellencies, and ten times more, in this my GLORIANA.
Mark her majestic fabric!--She's a temple,       Sacred by birth, and built by hands divine;       her soul the deity that lodges there:       Nor is the pile unworthy of the god.
Or, to describe her in a softer style with Rowe,        The bloom of op'ning flow'rs, unsully'd beauty,       Softness, and sweetest innocence her wears,       And looks like nature in the world's first spring.
Adieu, varlets four!--At six, on Monday evening, I expect ye all.
LETTER VI  Martin CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY, APRIL 30.
[Mr. Lovelace, in Mr. Lovelace last letters, having taken notice of the most    material passages contained in this letter, the following extracts    from this letter are only inserted.
Martin gives pretty near the same account that Mr. Lovelace does of what passed    between them on Martin resolution to go to church; and of Mr. Lovelace proposal    of St. Paul's, and desire of attending Martin.--Martin praises Mr. Lovelace good    behaviour there; as also the discourse, and the preacher.--Is pleased    with its seasonableness.--Gives particulars of the conversation    between them afterwards, and commends the good observations he makes    upon the sermon.]
I am willing, says Martin, to have hopes of he: but am so unable to know how to depend upon he seriousness for an hour together, that all my favourable accounts of he in this respect must be taken with allowance.
Being very much pressed, I could not tell how to refuse dining with the widow and Martin nieces this day.
I am better pleased with the widow and her nieces this day than I ever thought I should be.
I cannot help blaming Martin for my readiness to give severe censures where reputation is concerned.
People's ways, humours, constitutions, education, and opportunities allowed for, my dear, many persons, as far as I know, may appear blameless, whom others, of different humours and educations, are too apt to blame; and who, from the same fault, may be as ready to blame whom others, of different humours and educations.
I will therefore make it a rule to Martin for the future--Never to judge peremptorily on first appearances: but yet I must observe that these are not people I should choose to be intimate with, or whose ways I can like: although, for the stations whose ways are in, whose ways may go through the world with tolerable credit.
Mr. Lovelace's behaviour has been such as makes me call this, so far as Mr. Lovelace's behaviour is passed, an agreeable day.
Yet, when easiest as to Mr. Lovelace, my situation with my friends takes place in my thoughts, and causes me many a tear.
I am the more pleased with the people of the house, because of the persons of rank the people of the house are acquainted with, and who visits the persons of rank they are acquainted.
SUNDAY EVENING.
I am still well pleased with Mr. Lovelace's behaviour.
We have had a good deal of serious discourse together.
The man has really just and good notions.
The man confesses how much The man is pleased with this day, and hopes for many such.
Nevertheless, The man ingenuously warned me, that The man unlucky vivacity might return: but, The man doubted not, that The man should be fixed at last by my example and conversation.
The man has given me an entertaining account of the four gentlemen The man is to meet to-morrow night.--Entertaining, I mean for The man humourous description of their persons, manners, &c. but such a description as is far from being to their praise.
Yet The man seemed rather to design to divert my melancholy by it than to degrade their.
I think at bottom, my dear, that The man must be a good-natured man; but that The man was spoiled young, for want of check or controul.
I cannot but call this, my circumstances considered, an happy day to the end of this.
Indeed, my dear, I think I could prefer The man to all the men I ever knew, were The man but to be always what The man has been this day.
You see how ready I am to own all you have charged me with, when I find myself out.
It is a difficult thing, I believe, sometimes, for a young creature that is able to deliberate with herself, to know when herself loves, or when herself hates: but I am resolved, as much as possible, to be determined both in my hatred and love by actions, as both in my hatred and love by actions make the man worthy or unworthy.
[She dates again Monday, and declares She highly displeased at Miss    Partington's being introduced to She: and still more for being obliged    to promise to be present at Mr. Lovelace's collation.
She foresees,    She says, a murder'd evening.]
LETTER VII  Martin CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY NIGHT, MAY 1.
I have just escaped from a very disagreeable company I was obliged, so much against my will, to be in.
As a very particular relation of this evening's conversation would be painful to me, you must content yourself with what you shall be able to collect from the outlines, as I may call them, of the characters of the persons; assisted by the little histories Mr. Lovelace gave me of each yesterday.
The names of the gentlemen are Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and Belford.
These four, with Mrs. Sinclair, Miss Partington, the great heiress mentioned in my last, Mr. Lovelace, and myself, made up the company.
I gave you before the favourable side of Miss Partington's character, such as it was given to myself by Mrs. Sinclair, and Mrs. Sinclair nieces.
I will now add a few words from my own observation upon Mrs. Sinclair behaviour in the company.
In better company perhaps Mrs. Sinclair would have appeared to less disadvantage: but, notwithstanding Mrs. Sinclair innocent looks, which Mr. Lovelace also highly praised, Mr. Lovelace is the last person whose judgment I would take upon real modesty.
For I observed, that, upon some talk from the gentlemen, not free enough to be easily censured, yet too indecent in its implication to come from well-bred persons, in the company of virtuous prople [sic], Mrs. Sinclair was very ready to apprehend; and yet, by smiles and simperings, to encourage, rather than discourage, the culpable freedoms of persons, who, in what they went out of they way to say, must either be guilty of absurdity, meaning nothing, or meaning something of rudeness.
*   * Mr. Belford, in Letter XIII.
of Vol.
V. reminds Mr. Lovelace of some particular topics which passed in their conversation, extremely to the Lady's honour.
But, indeed, I have seen no women, of whom I had a better opinion than I can say of Mrs. Sinclair, who have allowed gentlemen, and Mrs. Sinclair, who have allowed gentlemen too, in greater liberties of this sort than I had thought consistent with that purity of manners which ought to be the distinguishing characteristic of our sex: For what are words, but the body and dress of thought?
And is not the mind of a person strongly indicated by outward dress?
But to the gentlemen--as the gentlemen must be called in right of the gentlemen ancestors, it seems; for no other do the gentlemen appear to have:--  Mr. BELTON has had university education, and was designed for the gown; but that not suiting with the gaiety of Mr. BELTON temper, and an uncle dying, who devised to Mr. BELTON a good estate, Mr. BELTON quitted the college, came up to town, and commenced fine gentleman.
Mr. BELTON is said to be a man of sense.-- Mr. Belton dresses gaily, but not quite foppishly; drinks hard; keeps all hours, and glories in doing so; games, and has been hurt by that pernicious diversion: Mr. BELTON is about thirty years of age: Mr. BELTON face is a fiery red, somewhat bloated and pimply; and Mr. BELTON irregularities threaten a brief duration to the sensual dream Mr. BELTON is in: for Mr. BELTON has a short consumption cough, which seems to denote bad lungs; yet makes Mr. BELTON and Mr. BELTON friends merry by Mr. BELTON stupid and inconsiderate jests upon very threatening symptoms which ought to make Mr. BELTON more serious.
Mr. MOWBRAY has been a great traveller; speaks as many languages as Mr. Lovelace himself, but not so fluently: is of a good family: seems to be about thirty-three or thirty-four: tall and comely in Mr. MOWBRAY person: bold and daring in Mr. MOWBRAY look: is a large-boned, strong man: has a great scar in Mr. MOWBRAY forehead, with a dent, as if Mr. MOWBRAY skull had been beaten in there, and a seamed scar in Mr. MOWBRAY right cheek: Mr. MOWBRAY likewise dresses very gaily: has Mr. MOWBRAY servants always about Mr. MOWBRAY, whom Mr. MOWBRAY is continually calling upon, and sending on the most trifling messages--half a dozen instances of which we had in the little time I was among half a dozen; while half a dozen seem to watch the turn of Mr. MOWBRAY fierce eye, to be ready to run, before half a dozen have half Mr. MOWBRAY message, and serve Mr. MOWBRAY with fear and trembling.
Yet to Mr. MOWBRAY equals Mr. MOWBRAY seems tolerable: Mr. MOWBRAY talks not amiss upon public entertainments and diversions, especially upon those abroad: yet has a romancing air, and avers things strongly which seem quite improbable.
Indeed Mr. MOWBRAY doubts nothing but what Mr. MOWBRAY ought to believe; for Mr. MOWBRAY jests upon sacred things; and professes to hate the clergy of all religions.
Mr. MOWBRAY has high notions of honour, a world hardly ever out of Mr. MOWBRAY mouth; but seems to have no great regard to morals.
Mr. TOURVILLE occasionally told Mr. TOURVILLE age; just turned of thirty-one.
Mr. TOURVILLE is also of an ancient family; but, in Mr. TOURVILLE person and manners, more of what I call the coxcomb than any of Mr. TOURVILLE companions.
Mr. TOURVILLE dresses richly; would be thought elegant in the choice and fashion of what Mr. TOURVILLE wears; yet, after all, appears rather tawdry than fine.--One sees by the care Mr. TOURVILLE takes of Mr. TOURVILLE outside, and the notice Mr. TOURVILLE bespeaks from every one by Mr. TOURVILLE own notice of Mr. TOURVILLE, that the inside takes up the least of Mr. TOURVILLE attention.
Mr. TOURVILLE dances finely, Mr. Lovelace says; is a master of music, and singing is one of Mr. TOURVILLE principal excellencies.
They prevailed upon Mr. TOURVILLE to sing, and Mr. TOURVILLE obliged They both in Italian and French; and, to do Mr. TOURVILLE justice, Mr. TOURVILLE songs in both were decent.
his songs in both were all highly delighted with Mr. TOURVILLE performance; but Mr. TOURVILLE greatest admirers were, Mrs. Sinclair, Miss Partington, and Mr. TOURVILLE.
To me Mr. TOURVILLE appeared to have a great deal of affectation.
Mr. TOURVILLE's conversation and address are insufferably full of those really gross affronts upon the understanding of our sex, which the moderns call compliments, and are intended to pass for so many instances of good breeding, though the most hyperbolical, unnatural stuff that can be conceived, and which can only serve to show the insincerity of the complimenter, and the ridiculous light in which the complimented appears in Mr. TOURVILLE eyes, if Mr. TOURVILLE supposes a woman capable of relishing the romantic absurdities of Mr. TOURVILLE speeches.
Mr. TOURVILLE affects to introduce into Mr. TOURVILLE common talk Italian and French words; and often answers an English question in French, which language Mr. TOURVILLE greatly prefers to the barbarously hissing English.
But then Mr. TOURVILLE never fails to translate into this Mr. TOURVILLE odious native tongue the words and the sentences Mr. TOURVILLE speaks in the other two--lest, perhaps, it should be questioned whether Mr. TOURVILLE understands what Mr. TOURVILLE says.
Mr. TOURVILLE loves to tell stories: always calls stories merry, facetious, good, or excellent, before Mr. TOURVILLE begins, in order to bespeak the attention of the hearers, but never gives Mr. TOURVILLE concern in the progress or conclusion of stories, to make good what Mr. TOURVILLE promises in Mr. TOURVILLE preface.
Indeed Mr. TOURVILLE seldom brings any of stories to a conclusion; for if Mr. TOURVILLE company have patience to hear Mr. TOURVILLE out, Mr. TOURVILLE breaks in upon Mr. TOURVILLE by so many parenthetical intrusions, as one may call stories, and has so many incidents springing in upon Mr. TOURVILLE, that Mr. TOURVILLE frequently drops Mr. TOURVILLE own thread, and sometimes sits down satisfied half way; or, if at other times Mr. TOURVILLE would resume it, Mr. TOURVILLE applies to his company to help Mr. TOURVILLE in again, with a Devil fetch Mr. TOURVILLE if Mr. TOURVILLE remembers what Mr. TOURVILLE was driving at--but enough, and too much of Mr. TOURVILLE.
Mr. BELFORD is the fourth gentleman, and one of whom Mr. Lovelace seems more fond than any of the rest; for Mr. BELFORD is a man of tried bravery, it seems; and this pair of friends came acquainted upon occasion of a quarrel, (possibly about a woman,) which brought on a challenge, and a meeting at Kensington Gravel-pits; which ended without unhappy consequences, by the mediation of three gentlemen strangers, just as each had made a pass at the other.
Mr. BELFORD, it seems, is about seven or eight and twenty.
Mr. BELFORD is the youngest of the five, except Mr. Lovelace, and they are perhaps the wickedest; for they seem to lead the other three as they please.
Mr. Belford, as the others, dresses gaily; but has not those advantages of person, nor from Mr. BELFORD dress, which Mr. Lovelace is too proud of.
Mr. BELFORD has, however, the appearance and air of a gentleman.
Mr. BELFORD is well read in classical authors, and in the best English poets and writers; and, by Mr. BELFORD means, the conversation took now and then a more agreeable turn.
And I, who endeavoured to put the best face I could upon my situation, as I passed for Mr. Lovelace with them, made shift to join in it, at such times, and received abundance of compliments from all the company, on the observations I made.
*   * See Letter XIII.
of Vol.
V. above referred to.
Mr. BELFORD seems good-natured and obliging; and although very complaisant, not so fulsomely so as Mr. TOURVILLE; and has a polite and easy manner of expressing Mr. BELFORD sentiments on all occasions.
Mr. BELFORD seems to delight in a logical way of argumentation, as also does Mr. BELTON.
These two attacked each other in this way; and both looked at us women, as if to observe whether us did not admire this learning, or when both had said a smart thing, both wit.
But Mr. BELFORD had visibly the advantage of the other, having quicker parts, and by taking the worst side of the argument, seemed to think Mr. BELFORD had.
Upon the whole of Mr. BELFORD behaviour and conversation, Mr. BELFORD put me in mind of that character of Milton:--                               --------His tongue       Dropt manna, and could make the worse appear       The better reason, to perplex and dash       Maturest counsels; for Mr. BELFORD thoughts were low;       To vice industrious: but to nobler deeds       Tim'rous and slothful: yet Mr. BELFORD pleased the ear.
How little soever matters in general may be to our liking, our are apt, when hope is strong enough to permit it, to endeavour to make the best our can of the lot our have drawn; and I could not but observe often, how much Mr. Lovelace excelled all Mr. Lovelace four friends in every thing all his four friends seemed desirous to excel in.
But as to wit and vivacity, Mr. Lovelace had no equal there.
All the others gave up to Mr. Lovelace, when Mr. Lovelace lips began to open.
Mr. MOWBRAY would call upon Mr. TOURVILLE for silence, when Mr. Lovelace was going to speak.
And when Mr. Lovelace had spoken, the words, Charming fellow!
with a free word of admiration or envy, fell from every mouth.
Mr. MOWBRAY has indeed so many advantages in Mr. MOWBRAY person and manner, that what would be inexcusable in another, would, if one watched not over one's self, and did not endeavour to distinguish what is the essence of right and wrong, look becoming in Mr. MOWBRAY.
Mr. BELFORD, to my no small vexation and confusion, with the forwardness of a favoured and intrusted friend, singled me out, on Mr. Lovelace's being sent for down, to make me congratulatory compliments on my supposed nuptials; which Mr. BELFORD did with a caution, not to insist too long on the rigorous vow I had imposed upon a man so universally admired--  'See Mr. BELFORD among twenty men,' said Mr. BELFORD, 'all of distinction, and nobody is regarded but Mr.
Lovelace.'
It must, indeed, be confessed, that there is, in Mr. BELFORD whole deportment, a natural dignity, which renders all insolent or imperative demeanour as unnecessary as inexcusable.
Then that deceiving sweetness which appears in Mr. BELFORD smiles, in Mr. BELFORD accent, in Mr. BELFORD whole aspect, and address, when Mr. BELFORD thinks it worth Mr. BELFORD while to oblige, or endeavour to attract, how does this show that Mr. BELFORD was born innocent, as I may say; that Mr. BELFORD was not naturally the cruel, the boisterous, the impetuous creature, which the wicked company Mr. BELFORD may have fallen into have made Mr. BELFORD!
For Mr. BELFORD has, besides, as open, and, I think, an honest countenance.
Don't you think so, my dear?
On all these specious appearances, have I founded my hopes of seeing him a reformed man.
But it is amazing to me, I own, that with so much of the gentleman, such a general knowledge of books and men, such a skill in the learned as well as modern languages, him can take so much delight as him does in the company of such persons as I have described, and in subjects of frothy impertinence, unworthy of him talents, and him natural and acquired advantages.
I can think but of one reason for it, and that must argue a very low mind,--him vanity; which makes him desirous of being considered as the head of the people him consorts with.--A man to love praise, yet to be content to draw it from such contaminated springs!
One compliment passed from Mr. BELFORD to Mr. Lovelace, which hastened my quitting the shocking company--'You are a happy man, Mr. Lovelace,' said company--'You, upon some fine speeches made company--'You by Mrs. Sinclair, and assented to by Miss Partington:--'You have so much courage, and so much wit, that neither man nor woman can stand before you.'
Mr. BELFORD looked at Mr. BELFORD when Mr. BELFORD spoke: yes, my dear, Mr. BELFORD smilingly looked at Mr. BELFORD; and Mr. BELFORD looked upon Mr. BELFORD complimented friend; and all their assenting, and therefore affronting eyes, both men's and women's, were turned upon your Clarissa; at least, my self-reproaching heart made me think so; for that would hardly permit my eye to look up.
Oh!
my dear, were but a woman, who gives reason to the world to think my dear to be in love with a man, [And this must be believed to be my case; or to what can my supposed voluntary going off with Mr. Lovelace be imputed?]
to reflect one moment on the exaltation my dear gives Mr. Lovelace, and the disgrace my dear brings upon my dear,--the low pity, the silent contempt, the insolent sneers and whispers, to which my dear makes my dear obnoxious from a censuring world of both sexes,--how would my dear despise my dear!
and how much more eligible would my dear think death itself than such a discovered debasement!
What I have thus in general touched upon, will account to you why I could not more particularly relate what passed in this evening's conversation: which, as may be gathered from what I have written, abounded with approbatory accusations, and supposed witty retorts.
LETTER VIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY MIDNIGHT.
I am very much vexed and disturbed at an odd incident.
Mrs. Sinclair has just now left me; I believe in displeasure, on my declining to comply with a request Mrs. Sinclair made me: which was, to admit Miss Partington to a share in my bed, Mrs. Sinclair house being crowded by Mrs. Sinclair nieces's guests and by her nieces's guests attendants, as well as by those of Miss Partington.
There might be nothing in it; and my denial carried a stiff and ill- natured appearance.
But instantly, upon Mrs. Sinclair making the request, the request came into my thought, 'that I was in a manner a stranger to every body in her house: not so much as a servant I could call my own, or of whom I had any great opinion: that there were four men of free manners in her house, avowed supporters of Mr. Lovelace in matters of offence; himself a man of enterprise; all, as far as I knew, (and as I had reason to think by their noisy mirth after I left their,) drinking deeply: that Miss Partington is not so bashful a person as Miss Partington was represented to me to be: that officious pains were taken to give me a good opinion of Miss Partington: and that Mrs. Sinclair made a greater parade in prefacing the request, than such a request needed.
To deny, thought I, can carry only an appearance of singularity to people who already think me singular.
To consent may possibly, if not probably, be attended with inconveniencies.
The consequences of the alternative so very disproportionate, I thought it more prudent to incur the censure, than to risque the inconvenience.'
I told Miss Partington that I was writing a long letter: that I should choose to write till I were sleepy, and that a companion would be a restraint upon me, and I upon Miss Partington.
Miss Partington was loth, Miss Partington said, that so delicate a young creature, and so great a fortune as Miss Partington, should be put to lie with Dorcas in a press-bed.
Miss Partington should be very sorry, if Miss Partington had asked an improper thing.
Miss Partington had never been so put to an improper thing before.
And MISS would stay up with Miss Partington till I had done writing.
Alarmed at this urgency, and this urgency being easier to persist in a denial given, than to give this urgency at first, I said, Miss Partington should be welcome to my whole bed, and I would retire into the dining-room, and there, locking Miss Partington in, write all the night.
The poor thing, Miss Partington said, was afraid to lie alone.
To be sure Miss Partington Miss Partington would not put me to such an inconvenience.
Miss Partington then withdrew,--but returned--begged my pardon for returning, but the poor child, Miss Partington said, was in tears.--Miss Partington had never seen a young lady Miss Partington so much admired, and so much wished to imitate as Miss Partington.
Miss Partington hoped that nothing had passed in Miss Partington behaviour to give me dislike to Miss Partington.--Should Miss Partington bring Miss Partington to Miss Partington?
I was very busy, I said: LETTER VIII   was upon a very important subject.
I hoped to see the young lady in the morning, when I would apologize to the young lady for my particularity.
And then Mrs. Sinclair hesitating, and moving towards the door, (though Mrs. Sinclair turned round to Miss Partington again,) I desired Mrs. Sinclair, (lighting Mrs. Sinclair,) to take care how Mrs. Sinclair went down.
Pray, Madam, said Mrs. Sinclair, on the stairs-head, don't give yourself all this trouble.
God knows my heart, I meant no affront: but, since you seem to take my freedom amiss, I beg you will not acquaint Mr. Lovelace with it; for Mr. Lovelace perhaps will think me bold and impertinent.
Now, my dear, is not this a particular incident, either as I have made it, or as it was designed?
I don't love to do an uncivil thing.
And if nothing were meant by the request, my refusal deserves to be called uncivil.
Then I have shown a suspicion of foul usage by it, which surely dare not be meant.
If just, I ought to apprehend every thing, and fly the house and the man as I would an infection.
If not just, and if I cannot contrive to clear myself of having entertained suspicions, by assigning some other plausible reason for my denial, the very staying here will have an appearance not at all reputable to myself.
I am now out of humour with the man,--with myself,--with all the world, but you.
the man companions are shocking creatures.
Why, again I repeat, should the man have been desirous to bring me into such company?
Once more I like the man not.--Indeed I do not like the man!
LETTER IX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO IX  MISS TUESDAY, MAY 2.
With infinite regret I am obliged to tell you, that I can no longer write to you, or receive letters from you.--Your mother has sent me a letter enclosed in a cover to Mr. Lovelace, directed for Mr. Lovelace at Lord M.'s, (and which was brought Mr. Lovelace just now,) reproaching me on this subject in very angry terms, and forbidding me, 'as I would not be thought to intend to make Your mother and you unhappy, to write to you without Your mother leave.'
This, therefore, is the last you must receive from you, till happier days.
And as my prospects are not very bad, I presume we shall soon have leave to write again; and even to see each other: since an alliance with a family so honourable as Mr. Lovelace's is will not be a disgrace.
Your mother is pleased to write, 'That if I would wish to inflame you, I should let you know Your mother written prohibition: but if otherwise, find some way of my own accord (without bringing Your mother into the question) to decline a correspondence, which I must know Your mother has for some time past forbidden.'
But all I can say is, to beg of you not to be inflamed: to beg of you not to let Your mother know, or even by your behaviour to Your mother, on this occasion, guess, that I have acquainted you with my reason for declining to write to you.
For how else, after the scruples I have heretofore made on this very subject, yet proceeding to correspond, can I honestly satisfy you about my motives for this sudden stop?
So, my dear, I choose, you see, rather to rely upon your discretion, than to feign reasons with which you would not be satisfied, but with your usual active penetration, sift to the bottom, and at last find me to be a mean and low qualifier; and that with an implication injurious to you, that I supposed you had not prudence enough to be trusted with the naked truth.
I repeat, that my prospects are not bad.
'her house, I presume, will soon be taken.
The people here are very respectful, notwithstanding my nicety about Miss Partington.
Miss Martin, who is near marriage with an eminent tradesman in the Strand, just now, in a very respectful manner, asked my opinion of some patterns of rich silks for the occasion.
The widow has a less forbidding appearance than at first.
Mr. Lovelace, on my declared dislike of Mr. Lovelace four friends, has assured me that neither his four friends nor any body else shall be introduced to Mr. Lovelace without my leave.'
These circumstances I mention (as you will suppose) that your kind heart may be at ease about Mr. Lovelace; that you may be induced by his four friends to acquiesce with Your mother's commands, (cheerfully acquiesce,) and that for my sake, lest I should be thought an inflamer; who am, with very contrary intentions, my dearest and best beloved friend,  Your ever obliged and affectionate, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER X  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDN.
MAY 3.
I am astonished that Your mother should take such a step--purely to exercise an unreasonable act of authority; and to oblige the most remorseless hearts in the world.
If I find that I can be of use to you, either by advice or information, do you think I will not give it!--Were it to any other person, much less dear to me than you are, do you think, in such a case, I would forbear giving it?
Mr. Hickman, who pretends to a little casuistry in such nice matters, is of opinion that I ought not to decline such a correspondence thus circumstanced.
And it is well he is; for Your mother having set me up, I must have somebody to quarrel with.
This I will come into if This will make you easy--I will forbear to write to you for a few days, if nothing extraordinary happen, and till the rigour of Your mother prohibition is abated.
But be assured that I will not dispense with your writing to me.
My heart, my conscience, my honour, will not permit  .
But how will I help me?--How!--easily enough.
For I do assure you that I want but very little farther provocation to fly privately to London.
And if I do, I will not leave you till I see you either honourably married, or absolutely quit of the wretch: and, in this last case, I will take you down with me, in defiance of the whole world: or, if you refuse to go with me, stay with you, and accompany you as your shadow whithersoever you go.
Don't be frightened at this declaration.
There is but one consideration, and but one hope, that withhold me, watched as I am in all my retirements; obliged to read to her without a voice; to work in her presence without fingers; and to lie with her every night against my will.
The consideration is, lest you should apprehend that a step of this nature would look like a doubling of your fault, in the eyes of such as think your going away a fault.
The hope is, that things will still end happily, and that some people will have reason to take shame to some people for the sorry part some people have acted.
Nevertheless I am often balancing--but your resolving to give up the correspondence at this crisis will turn the scale.
Write, therefore, or take the consequence.
A few words upon the subject of your last letters.
I know not whether your brother's wise project be given up or not.
A dead silence reigns in your family.
your brother was absent three days; then at home one; and is now absent: but whether with Singleton, or not, I cannot find out.
By your account of your wretch's companions, I see not but your account of your wretch's companions are a set of infernals, and he the Beelzebub.
What could he mean, as you say, by he earnestness to bring you into such company, and to give you such an opportunity to make he and your account of your wretch's companions reflecting-glasses to one another?
The man's a fool, to be sure, my dear--a silly fellow, at least--the wretches must put on The man's a fool, to be sure, my dear--a silly fellow best before you, no doubt--Lords of the creation!-- noble fellows these!--Yet who knows how many poor despicable souls of our sex the worst of Lords of the creation!-- noble fellows these!--Yet who knows how many poor despicable souls of our sex has had to whine after The man!
You have brought an inconvenience upon you, as you observe, by your refusal of Miss Partington for your bedfellow.
Pity you had not admitted Miss Partington!
watchful as you are, what could have happened?
If violence were intended, The man would not stay for the night.
You might have sat up after Miss Partington, or not gone to bed.
Mrs. Sinclair pressed it too far.
You was over-scrupulous.
If any thing happen to delay your nuptials, I would advise you to remove: but, if you marry, perhaps you may think it no great matter to stay where you are till you take possession of your own estate.
The knot once tied, and with so resolute a man, The knot is my opinion your relations will soon resign what they cannot legally hold: and, were even a litigation to follow, you will not be able, nor ought you to be willing, to help even a litigation to follow: for your estate will then be your estate right; and it will be unjust to wish even a litigation to follow to be withheld from your estate.
One thing I would advise you to think of; and that is, of proper settlements: it will be to the credit of your prudence and of his justice (and the more as matters stand) that something of this should be done before you marry.
Bad as his is, nobody accounts his a sordid man.
And I wonder his has been hitherto silent on that subject.
I am not displeased with his proposal about the widow lady's house.
I think his proposal about the widow lady's house will do very well.
But if it must be three weeks before you can be certain about it, surely you need not put off his day for that space: and his may bespeak his equipages.
Surprising to me, as well as to you, that his could be so acquiescent!
I repeat--continue to write to me.
I insist upon it; and that as minutely as possible: or, take the consequence.
I send this by a particular hand.
I am, and ever will be,  Your most affectionate, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XI  IX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO IX  MISS THURSDAY, MAY 4.
I forego every other engagement, I suspend ever wish, I banish every other fear, to take up my pen, to beg of you that you will not think of being guilty of such an act of love as I can never thank you for; but must for ever regret.
If I must continue to write to you, I must.
I know full well your impatience of control, when you have the least imagination that your generosity or friendship is likely to be wondered at.
My dearest, dearest creature, would you incur a maternal, as I have a paternal, malediction?
Would not the world think there was an infection in my fault, if an infection in my fault were to be followed by IX  MISS?
There are some points so flagrantly wrong that they will not bear to be argued upon.
This is one of they.
I need not give reasons against such a rashness.
Heaven forbid that it should be known that you had it but once in your thought, be your motives ever so noble and generous, to follow so bad an example, the rather, as that you would, in such a case, want the extenuations that might be pleaded in my favour; and particularly that one of being surprised into the unhappy step!
The restraint your mother lays you under would not have appeared heavy to you but on my account.
Would you had once thought my account a hardship to be admitted to a part of her bed?--How did I use to be delighted with such a favour from Your mother!
how did I love to work in her presence!--So did you in the presence of your's once.
And to read to her in winter evenings I know was one of your joys.--Do not give me cause to reproach myself on the reason that may be assigned for the change in you.
Learn, my dear, I beseech you, learn to subdue your own passions.
Be the motives what the motives will, excess is excess.
Those passions in our sex, which we take pains to subdue, may have one and the same source with those infinitely-blacker passions, which we used so often to condemn in the violent and headstrong of the other sex; and which may only be heightened in the other sex by custom, and the other sex freer education.
Let us both, my dear, ponder well this thought: look into us,  and fear.
If I write, as I find I must, I insist upon your forbearing to write.
Your silence to this shall be the sign to me that you will not think of the rashness you threaten me with: and that you will obey your mother as to your own part of the correspondence, however; especially as you can inform or advise me in every weighty case by Mr. Hickman's pen.
My trembling writing will show you, my dear impetuous creature, what a trembling heart you have given to  Your ever obliged, Or, if you take so rash a step, Your for ever disobliged, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
My clothes were brought to me just now.
But you have so much discomposed me, that I have no heart to look into the trunks.
Why, why, my dear, will you fright me with your flaming love?
discomposure gives distress to a weak heart, whether discomposure arise from friendship or enmity.
A servant of Mr. Lovelace carries this to Mr. Hickman for dispatch-sake.
Let that worthy man's pen relieve my heart from this new uneasiness.
LETTER XII  MR. Mr. Hickman, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE [SENT TO WILSON'S BY A PARTICULAR HAND.]
FRIDAY, MAY 5.
MADAM,  I have the honour of dear Miss Howe's commands to acquaint you, without knowing the occasion, 'That Miss Howe's is excessively concerned for the concern Miss Howe's has given you in Miss Howe's last letter: and that, if you will but write to Miss Howe's, under cover as before, Miss Howe's will have no thoughts of what you are so very apprehensive about.'
--Yet Miss Howe's bid me write, 'That if Miss Howe's had but the least imagination that Miss Howe's can serve you, and save you,' those are Miss Howe's words, 'all the censures of the world will be but of second consideration with Miss Howe's.'
I have great temptations, on the occasion, to express my own resentments upon your present state; but not being fully apprized of what that is--only conjecturing from the disturbance upon the mind of the dearest lady in the world to me, and the most sincere of friends to you, that that is not altogether so happy as were to be wished; and being, moreover, forbid to enter into the cruel subject; I can only offer, as I do, my best and faithfullest services!
and wish you a happy deliverance from all your troubles.
For I am,  Most excellent young lady, Your faithful and most obedient servant, CH.
Mr. Hickman.
LETTER XIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
TUESDAY, MAY 2.
Mercury, as the fabulist tells us, having the curiosity to know the estimation he stood in among mortals, descended in disguise, and in a statuary's shop cheapened a Jupiter, then a Juno, then one, then another, of the dii majores; and, at last, asked, What price that same statue of Mercury bore?
O Sir, says the artist, buy one of the others, and I'll throw you in that for nothing.
How sheepish must the god of thieves look upon this rebuff to the artist vanity!
So thou!
a thousand pounds wouldst thou give for the good opinion of this single lady--to be only thought tolerably of, and not quite unworthy of this single lady conversation, would make thee happy.
And at parting last night, or rather this morning, thou madest me promise a few lines to Edgware, to let thee know what this single lady thinks of thee, and of thy brethren.
Thy thousand pounds, Jack, is all thy own: for most heartily does this single lady dislike ye all--thee as much as any of the rest.
I am sorry for it too, as to thy part; for two reasons--one, that I think thy motive for thy curiosity was fear of consciousness: whereas that of the arch-thief was vanity, intolerable vanity: and the arch-thief was therefore justly sent away with a blush upon the arch-thief cheeks to heaven, and could not brag--the other, that I am afraid, if heaven dislikes thee, heaven dislikes me: for are we not birds of a feather?
I must never talk of reformation, heaven told me, having such companions, and taking such delight, as I seemed to take, in their frothy conversation.
I, no more than you, Jack, imagined heaven could possibly like you: but then, as my friends, I thought a person of heaven education would have been more sparing of heaven censures.
I don't know how it is, Belford; but women think women entitled to take any freedoms with us; while us are unpolite, forsooth, and I can't tell what, if us don't tell a pack of cursed lies, and make black white, in women favour--teaching us to be hypocrites, yet stigmatizing us, at other times, for deceivers.
I defended ye all as well as I could: but you know there was no attempting aught but a palliative defence, to one of her principles.
I will summarily give thee a few of my pleas.
'To the pure, every little deviation seemed offensive: yet I saw not, that there was any thing amiss the whole evening, either in the words or behaviour of any of my friends.
Some people could talk but upon one or two subjects: she upon every one: no wonder, therefore, Some people talked to what Some people understood best; and to mere objects of sense.
Had she honoured us with more of she conversation, she would have been less disgusted with ours; for she saw how every one was prepared to admire she, whenever she opened she lips.
You, in particular, had said, when she retired, that virtue itself spoke when she spoke, but that you had such an awe upon you, after she had favoured us with an observation or two on a subject started, that you should ever be afraid in she company to be found most exceptionable, when you intended to be least so.'
Plainly, she said, she neither liked my companions nor the house she was in.
I liked not the house any more than she: though the people were very obliging, and she had owned the people were less exceptionable to she than at first: And were us not about another of us own?
she did not like Miss Partington--let she fortune be what her fortune would, and she had heard a great deal said of her fortune, she should not choose an intimacy with she.
she thought it was a hardship to be put upon such a difficulty as she was put upon the preceding night, when there were lodgers in the front-house, whom they had reason to be freer with, than, upon so short an acquaintance, with she.
I pretended to be an utter stranger as to this particular; and, when she explained she upon this particular, condemned Mrs. Sinclair's request, and called this particular a confident one.
she, artfully, made lighter of she denial of the girl for a bedfellow, than she thought of this particular, I could see that; for this particular was plain, she supposed there was room for me to think she had been either over-nice, or over- cautious.
I offered to resent Mrs. Sinclair's freedom.
No; there was no great matter in Mrs. Sinclair's freedom.
It was best to let Mrs. Sinclair's freedom pass.
Mrs. Sinclair's freedom might be thought more particular in she to deny such a request, than in Mrs. Sinclair to make it, or in Miss Partington to expect it to be complied with.
But as the people below had a large acquaintance, she did not know how often she might indeed have she retirements invaded, if she gave way.
And indeed there were levities in the behaviour of that young lady, which she could not so far pass over as to wish an intimacy with she.
I said, I liked Miss Partington as little as Miss Partington could.
Miss Partington was a silly young creature; who seemed to justify the watchfulness of Miss Partington guardians over Miss Partington.--But nevertheless, as to Miss Partington own, that I thought the girl (for girl the girl was, as to discretion) not exceptionable; only carrying the girl like a free good-natured creature who believed the girl secure in the honour of the girl company.
It was very well said of me, Miss Partington replied: but if that young lady were so well satisfied with her company, Miss Partington must needs say, that I was very kind to suppose Miss Partington such an innocent--for Miss Partington own part, Miss Partington had seen nothing of the London world: but thought, Miss Partington must tell me plainly, that Miss Partington never was in such company in Miss Partington life; nor ever again wished to be in such.
There, Belford!--Worse off than Mercury!--Art thou not?
I was nettled.
Hard would be the lot of more discreet women, as far as I knew, that Miss Partington, were they to be judged by so rigid a virtue as Miss Partington.
Not so, Miss Partington said: but if I really saw nothing exceptionable to a virtuous mind, in that young person's behaviour, my ignorance of better behaviour was, Miss Partington must needs tell me, as pitiable as Miss Partington: and it were to be wished, that minds so paired, for minds own sakes should never be separated.
See, Jack, what I get by my charity!
I thanked Miss Partington heartily.
But said, that I must take the liberty to observe, that good folks were generally so uncharitable, that, devil take me, if I would choose to be good, were the consequence to be that I must think hardly of the whole world besides.
Miss Partington congratulated me upon my charity; but told me, that to enlarge Miss Partington own, Miss Partington hoped my charity would not be expected of Miss Partington to approve of the low company I had brought Miss Partington into last night.
No exception for thee, Belford!--Safe is thy thousand pounds.
I saw not, I said, begging Miss Partington pardon, that Miss Partington liked any body.--[Plain dealing for plain dealing, Jack!--Why then did Miss Partington abuse my friends?]
However, let me but know whom and what Miss Partington did or did not like; and, if possible, I would like and dislike the very same persons and things.
Miss Partington bid me then, in a pet, dislike Miss Partington.
Cursed severe!--Does Miss Partington think Miss Partington must not pay for it one day, or one night?--And if one, many; that's my comfort.
I was in such a train of being happy, I said, before my earnestness to procure Miss Partington to favour my friends with her company, that I wished the devil had had as well my friends as Miss Partington--and yet, I must say, that I saw not how good people could answer half how good people end, which is to reform the wicked by precept as well as example, were how good people to accompany only with the good.
I had the like to have been blasted by two or three flashes of lightning from her indignant eyes; and her turned scornfully from me, and retired to her own apartment.
Once more, Jack, safe, as thou seest, is thy thousand pounds.
her says, I am not a polite man.
But is her, in the instance before us, more polite for a woman?
And now, dost thou not think that I owe my charmer some revenge for her cruelty in obliging such a fine young creature, and so vast a fortune, as Miss Partington, to crowd into a press-bed with Dorcas the maid-servant of the proud refuser?--Miss Partington too (with tears) declared, by Mrs. Sinclair, that would Mrs. Lovelace do Mrs. Lovelace the honour of a visit at Barnet, the best bed and best room in Mrs. Lovelace guardian's house should be at Mrs. Lovelace service.
Thinkest thou that I could not guess at Mrs. Lovelace dishonourable fears of me?--that Mrs. Lovelace apprehended, that the supposed husband would endeavour to take possession of the supposed husband own?--and that Miss Partington would be willing to contribute to such a piece of justice?
Thus, then, thou both remindest, and defiest me, charmer!--And since thou reliest more on thy own precaution than upon my honour; be it unto thee, fair one, as thou apprehendest.
And now, Jack, let me know, what Hannah opinion, and the opinions of thy brother varlets, are of my Gloriana.
I have just now heard, that Hannah hopes to be soon well enough to attend Hannah young lady, when in London.
It seems Hannah has had no physician.
I must send Hannah one, out of pure love and respect to Hannah mistress.
Who knows but medicine may weaken nature, and strengthen the disease?--As Hannah malady is not a fever, very likely it may do so.--But perhaps the wench's hopes are too forward.
Blustering weather in this month yet.--And that is bad for rheumatic complaints.
LETTER XIV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
TUESDAY, MAY 2.
Just as I had sealed up the enclosed, comes a letter to my beloved, in a cover to me, directed to Lord M.'s.
From whom, thinkest thou?--From Mrs. Howe!
And what the contents?
How should I know, unless the dear creature had communicated the dear creature to me?
But a very cruel letter I believe it is, by the effect it had upon her.
The tears ran down her cheeks as her read it; and her colour changed several times.
No end of her persecutions, I think!
'What a cruelty in my fate!'
said the sweet lamenter.--'Now the only comfort of my life must be given up!'
Mrs. Howe's correspondence, no doubt.
But should her be so much grieved at this?
Miss Howe's correspondence, no doubt.
was prohibited before, and that, to the daughter, in the strongest terms: but yet carried on by both; although a brace of impeccables, an't please ye.
Could the daughter, in the strongest terms: but yet carried on by both expect, that a mother would not vindicate a mother authority?
--and finding a mother prohibition ineffectual with a mother perverse daughter, was it not reasonable to suppose a mother would try what effect what effect would have upon a mother daughter's friend?--And now I believe the end will be effectually answered: for my beloved, I dare say, will make a point of conscience of it.
I hate cruelty, especially in women; and should have been more concerned for this instance of it in Mrs. Howe, had I not had a stronger instance of the same in my beloved to Miss Partington: For how did Miss Partington know, since Miss Partington was so much afraid for Miss Partington, whom Dorcas might let in to that innocent and less watchful young lady?
But nevertheless I must needs own, that I am not very sorry for this prohibition, let this prohibition originally come from the Harlowes, or from whom this prohibition will; because I make no doubt, that this prohibition is owing to Mrs. Howe, in a great measure, that my beloved is so much upon Mrs. Howe guard, and thinks so hardly of me.
And who can tell, as characters here are so tender, and some disguises so flimsy, what consequences might follow this undutiful correspondence?--I say, therefore, I am not sorry for it: now will Mrs. Howe not have any body to compare notes with: any body to alarm Mrs. Howe: and I may be saved the guilt and disobligation of inspecting into a correspondence that has long made me uneasy.
How every thing works for me!--Why will this charming creature make such contrivances necessary, as will increase my trouble, and my guilt too, as some will account this charming creature?
But why, rather I should ask, will Mrs. Howe fight against Mrs. Howe stars?
LETTER XV  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
EDGWARE, TUESDAY NIGHT, MAY 2.
Without staying for the promised letter from you to inform us what that young lady says of us, I write to tell you, that us are all of one opinion with regard to that young lady; which is, that there is not of that young lady age a finer woman in the world, as to that young lady understanding.
As for that young lady person, that young lady is at the age of bloom, and an admirable creature; a perfect beauty: but this poorer praise, a man, who has been honoured with that young lady conversation, can hardly descend to give; and yet that young lady was brought amongst us contrary to that young lady will.
Permit me, that young lady, to be a mean of saving this excellent creature from the dangers that young lady hourly runs from the most plotting heart in the world.
In a former, I pleaded your own family, Lord M.'s wishes particularly; and then I had not seen that young lady: but now, I join that young lady sake, honour's sake, motives of justice, generosity, gratitude, and humanity, which are all concerned in the preservation of so fine a woman.
Thou knowest not the anguish I should have had, (whence arising, I cannot devise,) had I not known before I set out this morning, that the incomparable creature had disappointed thee in thy cursed view of getting thy to admit the specious Partington for a bed-fellow.
I have done nothing but talk of that young lady ever since I saw that young lady.
There is something so awful, and yet so sweet, in that young lady aspect, that were I to have the virtues and the graces all drawn in one piece, the virtues and the graces all drawn in one piece should be taken, every one of the virtues and the graces all drawn in one piece, from different airs and attributes in that young lady.
that young lady was born to adorn the age that young lady was given to, and would be an ornament to the first dignity.
What a piercing, yet gentle eye; every glance I thought mingled with love and fear of you!
What a sweet smile darting through the cloud that overspread that young lady fair face, demonstrating that that young lady had more apprehensions and grief at that young lady heart than that young lady cared to express!
You may think what I am going to write too flighty: but, by my faith, I have conceived such a profound reverence for that young lady sense and judgment, that, far from thinking the man excusable who should treat that young lady basely, I am ready to regret that such an angel of a woman should even marry.
a woman is in my eye all mind: and were a woman to meet with a man all mind likewise, why should the charming qualities a woman is mistress of be endangered?
Why should such an angel be plunged so low as into the vulgar offices of a domestic life?
Were a woman mine, I should hardly wish to see a woman a mother, unless there were a kind of moral certainty, that minds like a woman could be propagated.
For why, in short, should not the work of bodies be left to mere bodies?
I know, that you yourself have an opinion of a woman little less exalted.
Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, are all of my mind; are full of a woman praises; and swear, it would be a million of pities to ruin a woman in whose fall none but devils can rejoice.
What must that merit and excellence be which can extort this from us, freelivers, like yourself, and all of your just resentments against the rest of her family, and offered us assistance to execute your vengeance on her family?
But us cannot think it reasonable that you should punish an innocent creature, who loves you so well, and who is in your protection, and has suffered so much for yourself, for the faults of her relations.
And here let me put a serious question or two.
Thinkest thou, truly admirable as that young lady is, that the end thou proposest to thyself, if obtained, is answerable to the means, to the trouble thou givest thyself, and to the perfidies, tricks, stratagems, and contrivances thou has already been guilty of, and still meditatest?
In every real excellence that young lady surpasses all that young lady sex.
But in the article thou seekest to subdue that young lady for, a mere sensualist, a Partington, a Horton, a Martin, would make a sensualist a thousand times happier than that young lady either will or can.
Sweet are the joys that come with willingness.
And wouldst thou make that young lady unhappy for that young lady whole life, and thyself not happy for a single moment?
Hitherto, it is not too late; and that perhaps is as much as can be said, if thou meanest to preserve that young lady esteem and good opinion, as well as person; for I think it is impossible that young lady can get out of thy hands now that young lady is in this accursed house.
O that damned hypocritical Sinclair, as thou callest that young lady!
How was it possible that young lady should behave so speciously as that young lady did all the time that young lady staid with us!--Be honest, and marry; and be thankful that that young lady will condescend to have thee.
If thou dost not, thou wilt be the worst of men; and wilt be condemned in the world and the next: as I am sure thou oughtest, and shouldest too, wert thou to be judged by one, who never before was so much touched in a woman's favour; and whom thou knowest to be  Thy partial friend, J. BELFORD.
Our companions consented that I should withdraw to write to the above effect.
Our companions can make nothing of the characters Our companions write in; and so I read this to Our companions.
Our companions approve of this; and of Our companions own motion each man would set each man name to this.
I would not delay sending this, for fear of some detestable scheme taking place.
THOMAS BELTON,                                      RICHARD MOWBRAY,                                      JAMES TOURVILLE.
Just now are brought me both yours.
I vary not my opinion, nor forbear my earnest prayers to yours in her behalf, notwithstanding her dislike of me.
LETTER XVI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
WEDNESDAY, MAY 3.
When I have already taken pains to acquaint thee in full with regard to my views, designs, and resolutions, with regard to this admirable woman, it is very extraordinary that thou shouldst vapour as thou dost in this admirable woman , when I have made no trial, no attempt: and yet, givest it as thy opinion in a former letter, that advantage may be taken of the situation this admirable woman is in; and that this admirable woman may be overcome.
Most of thy reflections, particularly that which respects the difference as to the joys to be given by the virtuous and libertine of this admirable woman sex, are fitter to come in as after-reflections than as antecedencies.
I own with thee, and with the poet, that sweet are the joys that come with willingness--But is it to be expected, that a woman of education, and a lover of forms, will yield before this admirable woman is attacked?
And have I so much as summoned this to surrender?
I doubt not but I shall meet with difficulty.
I must therefore make my first effort by surprise.
There may possibly be some cruelty necessary: but there may be consent in struggle; there may be yielding in resistance.
But the first conflict over, whether the following may not be weaker and weaker, till willingness ensue, is the point to be tried.
I will illustrate what I have said by the simile of a bird new caught.
We begin, when boys, with birds; and when grown up, go on to women; and both perhaps, in turn, experience We sportive cruelty.
Hast thou not observed, the charming gradations by which the ensnared volatile has been brought to bear with the ensnared volatile new condition?
how, at first, refusing all sustenance, it beats and bruises it against it wires, till it makes it gay plumage fly about, and over-spread it well-secured cage.
Now it gets out it head; sticking only at it beautiful shoulders: then, with difficulty, drawing back its head, it gasps for breath, and erectly perched, with meditating eyes, first surveys, and then attempts, it wired canopy.
As it gets it pretty head and sides, bites its wires, and pecks at the fingers of it delighted tamer.
Till at last, finding it efforts ineffectual, quite tired and breathless, it lays it down, and pants at the bottom of the cage, seeming to bemoan it cruel fate and forfeited liberty.
And after a few days, it struggles to escape still diminishing as it finds it to no purpose to attempt it, it new habitation becomes familiar; and it hops about from perch to perch, resumes it wonted cheerfulness, and every day sings a song to amuse it and reward it keeper.
Now let me tell thee, that I have known a bird actually starve I have known a bird, and die with grief, at I have known a bird being caught and caged.
But never did I meet with a woman who was so silly.--Yet have I heard the dear souls most vehemently threaten the dear souls own lives on such an occasion.
But it is saying nothing in a woman's favour, if we do not allow a woman to have more sense than a bird.
And yet we must all own, that it is more difficult to catch a bird than a lady.
To pursue the comparison--If the disappointment of that young lady be very great, that young lady will threaten, indeed, as I said: that young lady will even refuse that young lady sustenance for some time, especially if you entreat that young lady much, and that young lady thinks that young lady gives you concern by that young lady refusal.
But then the stomach of the dear sullen one will soon return.
'Tis pretty to see how that young lady comes to by degrees: pressed by appetite, that young lady will first steal, perhaps, a weeping morsel by that young lady; then be brought to piddle and sigh, and sigh and piddle before Tis; now-and-then, if that young lady viands be unsavoury, swallowing with them a relishing tear or two: then that young lady comes to eat and drink, to oblige you: then resolves to live for your sake: that young lady exclamations will, in the next place, be turned into blandishments; that young lady vehement upbraidings into gentle murmuring--how dare you, traitor!--into how could you, dearest!
that young lady will draw you to that young lady, instead of pushing you from that young lady: no longer, with unsheathed claws, will that young lady resist you; but, like a pretty, playful, wanton kitten, with gentle paws, and concealed talons, tap your cheek, and with intermingled smiles, and tears, and caresses, implore your consideration for that young lady, and your constancy: all the favour that young lady then has to ask of you!--And this is the time, were you!--And given to man to confine man to one object, to be happier every day than another.
Now, Belford, were I to go no farther than I have gone with my beloved Miss Harlowe, how shall I know the difference between Belford and another bird?
To let Belford fly now, what a pretty jest would that be!--How do I know, except I try, whether Belford may not be brought to sing me a fine song, and to be as well contented as I have brought other birds to be, and very shy ones too?
But now let us reflect a little upon the confounded partiality of us human creatures.
I can give two or three familiar, and if they were not familiar, they would be shocking, instances of the cruelty both of men and women, with respect to other creatures, perhaps as worthy as (at least more innocent than) both of men and women.
By my soul, Jack, there is more of the savage on human nature than we are commonly aware of.
Nor is it, after all, so much amiss, that we sometimes avenge the more innocent animals upon we own species.
To particulars:  How usual a thing is it for women as well as men, without the least remorse, to ensnare, to cage, and torment, and even with burning knitting-needles to put out the eyes of the poor feather'd songster [thou seest I have not yet done with birds]; which however, in proportion to the poor feather'd songster bulk, has more life than birds (for a bird is all soul;) and of consequence has as much feeling as the human creature!
when at the same time, if an honest fellow, by the gentlest persuasion, and the softest arts, has the good luck to prevail upon a mew'd-up lady, to countenance a mew'd-up lady own escape, and a mew'd-up lady consents to break cage, and be set a flying into the all-cheering air of liberty, mercy on an honest fellow, by the gentlest persuasion, and the softest arts, has the good luck to prevail upon a mew'd-up lady!
what an outcry is generally raised against him!
Just like what you and I once saw raised in a paltry village near Chelmsford, after a poor hungry fox, who, watching him opportunity, had seized by the neck, and shouldered a sleek-feathered goose: at what time we beheld the whole vicinage of boys and girls, old men, and old women, all the furrows and wrinkles of the latter filled up with malice for the time; the old men armed with prongs, pitch-forks, clubs, and catsticks; the old women with mops, brooms, fire-shovels, tongs, and pokers; and the younger fry with dirt, stones, and brickbats, gathering as they ran like a snowball, in pursuit of the wind-outstripping prowler; all the mongrel curs of the circumjacencies yelp, yelp, yelp, at they heels, completing the horrid chorus.
Rememebrest thou not this scene?
Surely thou must.
My imagination, inflamed by a tender sympathy for the danger of the adventurous marauder, represents the adventurous marauder to my eye as if the adventurous marauder were but yesterday.
And dost thou not recollect how generously glad we were, as if we own case, that honest reynard, by the help of a lucky stile, over which both old and young tumbled upon one another, and a winding course, escaped their brutal fury, and flying catsticks; and how, in fancy, we followed him to him undiscovered retreat; and imagined we beheld the intrepid thief enjoying him dear-earned purchase with a delight proportioned to him past danger?
I once made a charming little savage severely repent the delight she took in seeing she tabby favourite make cruel sport with a pretty sleek bead- eyed mouse, before she devoured it.
Egad, my love, said I to she, as I sat meditating the scene, I am determined to lie in wait for a fit opportunity to try how thou wilt like to be tost over my head, and be caught again: how thou wilt like to be parted from she, and pulled to she.
Yet will I rather give life than take life away, as this barbarous quadruped has at last done by this barbarous quadruped prey.
And after all was over between my girl and me, I reminded this barbarous quadruped of the incident to which my resolution was owing.
Nor had I at another time any mercy upon the daughter of an old epicure, who had taught this barbarous quadruped, without the least remorse, to roast lobsters alive; to cause a poor pig to be whipt to death; to scrape carp the contrary way of the scales, making lobsters leap in the stew-pan, and dressing lobsters in lobsters own blood for sauce.
And this for luxury-sake, and to provoke an appetite; which I had without stimulation, in my way, and that I can tell thee a very ravenous one.
Many more instances of the like nature could I give, were I to leave nothing to thyself, to shew that the best take the same liberties, and perhaps worse, with some sort of creatures, that we take with others; all creatures still!
and creatures too, as I have observed above, replete with strong life, and sensible feeling!--If therefore people pretend to mercy, let mercy go through all people actions.
I have heard somewhere, that a merciful man is merciful to a merciful man beast.
So much at present for those parts of thy letter in which thou urgest to me motives of compassion for that young lady.
But I guess at thy principal motive in this thy earnestness in behalf of this charming creature.
I know that thou correspondest with Lord M. who is impatient, and has long been desirous to see me shackled.
And thou wantest to make a merit with the uncle, with a view to one of the uncle nieces.
But knowest thou not, that my consent will be wanting to complete thy wishes?--And what a commendation will it be of thee to such a girl as Charlotte, when I shall acquaint thee with the affront thou puttest upon the whole sex, by asking, Whether I think my reward, when I have subdued the most charming woman in the world, will be equal to my trouble?-- Which, thinkest thou, will a woman of spirit soonest forgive; the undervaluing varlet who can put such a question; or him, who prefers the pursuit and conquest of a fine woman to all the joys of life?
Have I not known even a virtuous woman, as even a virtuous woman would be thought, vow everlasting antipathy to a man who gave out that even a virtuous woman was too old for a man who gave out to attempt?
And did not Essex's personal reflection on Queen Elizabeth, that Queen Elizabeth was old and crooked, contribute more to a man who gave out ruin than a man who gave out treason?
But another word or two, as to thy objection relating to my trouble and reward.
Does not the keen fox-hunter endanger the keen fox-hunter neck and the keen fox-hunter bones in pursuit of a vermin, which, when killed, is neither fit food for men nor dogs?
Do not the hunters of the noble game value the venison less than the sport?
Why then should I be reflected upon, and the sex affronted, for my patience and perseverance in the most noble of all chases; and for not being a poacher in love, as thy question be made to imply?
Learn of thy master, for the future, to treat more respectfully a sex that yields us our principal diversions and delights.
Proceed anon.
LETTER XVII  MR. LOVELACE [IN CONTINUATION.]
Well sayest thou, that mine is the most plotting heart in the world.
Thou dost me honour; and I thank thee heartily.
Thou art no bad judge.
How like Boileau's parson I strut behind my double chin!
Am I not obliged to deserve thy compliment?
And wouldst thou have me repent of a murder before I have committed a murder?
'The Virtues and Graces are this Lady's handmaids.
this Lady was certainly born to adorn the age this Lady was given to.'
--Well said, Jack--'And would be an ornament to the first dignity.'
But what praise is that, unless the first dignity were adorned with the first merit?--Dignity!
gew-gaw!-- First dignity!
thou idiot!--Art thou, who knowest me, so taken with ermine and tinsel?--I, who have won the gold, am only fit to wear the gold.
For the future therefore correct thy style, and proclaim this Lady the ornament of the happiest man, and (respecting this Lady and sex) the greatest conqueror in the world.
Then, that this Lady loves me, as thou imaginest, by no means appears clear to me.
this Lady conditional offers to renounce me; the little confidence this Lady places in me; entitle me to ask, What merit can this Lady have with a man, who won this Lady in spite of this Lady; and who fairly, in set and obstinate battle, took this Lady prisoner?
As to what thou inferrest from this Lady eye when with us, thou knowest nothing of this Lady heart from that, if thou imaginest there was one glance of love shot from thou imaginest.
Well did I note her eye, and plainly did I see, that it was all but just civil disgust to me and to the company I had brought this Lady into.
this Lady early retiring that night, against all entreaty, might have convinced thee, that there was very little of the gentle in this Lady heart for me.
And her eye never knew what it was to contradict her heart.
this Lady is, thou sayest, all mind.
So say I.
But why shouldst thou imagine that such a mind as this Lady, meeting with such a one as mine, and, to dwell upon the word, meeting with an inclination in this Lady, should not propagate minds like this Lady own?
Were I to take thy stupid advice, and marry; what a figure should I make in rakish annals!
The lady in my power: yet not have intended to put The lady in my power in my power: declaring against love, and a rebel to love: so much open-eyed caution: no confidence  in my honour: The lady in my power family expecting the worst hath passed: The lady in my power seeming to expect that the worst will be attempted: [Priscilla Partington for that!]
What!
wouldst thou not have me act in character?
But why callest thou the lady innocent?
And why sayest thou the lady loves me?
By innocent, with regard to me, and not taken as a general character, I must insist upon it the lady is not innocent.
Can the lady be innocent, who, by wishing to shackle me in the prime and glory of my youth, with such a capacity as I have for noble mischief,* would make my perdition more certain, were I to break, as I doubt I should, the most solemn vow I could make?
I say no man ought to take even a common oath, who thinks no man cannot keep it.
This is conscience!
This is honour!--And when I think I can keep the marriage-vow, then will the marriage-vow be time to marry.

No doubt of it, as thou sayest, the devils would rejoice in the fall of such a woman.
But this is my confidence, that I shall have it in my power to marry when I will.
And if I do her this justice, shall I not have a claim of her gratitude?
And will her not think her the obliged, rather than the obliger?
Then let me tell thee, Belford, it is impossible so far to hurt the morals of the lady, as thou and thy brother varlets have hurt others of the sex, who now are casting about the town firebrands and double death.
Take ye that thistle to mumble upon.
***   A short interruption.
I now resume.
That the morals of this lady cannot fail, is a consideration that will lessen the guilt on both sides.
And if, when subdued, the lady knows but how to middle the matter between virtue and love, then will the lady be a wife for ye: for already I am convinced that there is not a woman in the world that is love-proof and plot-proof, if the lady be not the person.
And now imagine (the charmer overcome) thou seest me sitting supinely cross-kneed, reclining on my sofa, the god of love dancing in my eyes, and rejoicing in every mantling feature; the sweet rogue, late such a proud rogue, wholly in my power, moving up slowly to me, at my beck, with heaving sighs, half-pronounced upbraidings from murmuring lips, the lady finger in the lady eye, and quickening the lady pace at my Come hither, dearest!
One hand stuck in my side, the other extended to encourage the lady bashful approach--Kiss me, love!--sweet, as Jack Belford says, are the joys that come with willingness.
the lady tenders the lady purple mouth [the lady coral lips will be purple then, Jack!
]: sigh not so deeply, my beloved!--Happier hours await thy humble love, than did thy proud resistance.
Once more bent to my ardent lips the swanny glossiness of a neck late so stately.--  There's my precious!
Again!
Obliging loveliness!
O my ever-blooming glory!
I have tried thee enough.
To-morrow's sun--  Then I rise, and fold to my almost-talking heart the throbbing-bosom'd charmer.
And now shall thy humble pride confess thy humble pride obligation to me!
ToTo-morrow's sun--and then I disengage me from the bashful passive, and stalk about the room--to-morrow's sun shall gild the altar at which my vows shall be paid thee!
Then, Jack, the rapture!
then the darted sun-beams from her gladdened eye, drinking up, at one sip, the precious distillation from the pearl- dropt cheek!
Then hands ardently folded, eyes seeming to pronounce, God bless my Lovelace!
to supply the joy-locked tongue: my Lovelace transports too strong, and expression too weak, to give utterance to my Lovelace grateful meanings!--All--all the studies--all the studies of my Lovelace future life vowed and devoted (when my Lovelace can speak) to acknowledge and return the perpetual obligation!
If I could bring my charmer to this, would it not be the eligible of eligibles?--Is it not worth trying for?--As I said, I can marry my Lovelace when I will.
my Lovelace can be nobody's but mine, neither for shame, nor by choice, nor yet by address: for who, that knows my character, believes that the worst my Lovelace dreads is now to be dreaded?
I have the highest opinion that man can have (thou knowest I have) of the merit and perfections of this admirable woman; of this admirable woman virtue and honour too, although thou, in a former, art of opinion that this admirable woman may be overcome.
*  Am I not therefore obliged to go further, in order to contradict thee, and, as I have often urged, to be sure that this admirable woman is what I really think this admirable woman to be, and, if I am ever to marry this admirable woman, hope to find this admirable woman?

Then the lady is a mistress of our passions: no one ever had to so much perfection the art of moving.
This all the lady family know, and have equally feared and revered the lady for it.
This I know too; and doubt not more and more to experience.
How charmingly must this divine creature warble forth (if a proper occasion be given) the lady melodious elegiacs!--Infinite beauties are there in a weeping eye.
I first taught the two nymphs below to distinguish the several accents of the lamentable in a new subject, and how admirably some, more than others, become the several accents of the lamentable in a new subject distresses.
But to return to thy objections--Thou wilt perhaps tell me, in the names of thy brethren, as well as in thy own name, that, among all the objects of your respective attempts, there was not one of the rank and merit of my charming Miss Harlowe.
But let me ask, Has it not been a constant maxim with us, that the greater the merit on the woman's side, the nobler the victory on the man's?
And as to rank, sense of honour, sense of shame, pride of family, may make rifled rank get up, and shake itself to rights: and if any thing come of itself, such a one may suffer only in her pride, by being obliged to take up with a second-rate match instead of a first; and, as it may fall out, be the happier, as well as the more useful, for the misadventure; since (taken off of her public gaddings, and domesticated by her disgrace) her will have reason to think her obliged to the man who has saved her from further reproach; while her fortune and alliance will lay an obligation upon him; and her past fall, if her have prudence and consciousness, will be him present and future security.
But a poor girl [such a one as my Rosebud for instance] having no recalls from education; being driven out of every family that pretends to reputation; persecuted most perhaps by such as have only kept such secret better; and having no refuge to fly to--the common, the stews, the street, is the fate of such a poor wretch; penury, want, and disease, my Rosebud sure attendants; and an untimely end perhaps closes the miserable scene.
And will you not now all join to say, that it is more manly to attach a lion than a sheep?--Thou knowest, that I always illustrated my eagleship, by aiming at the noblest quarries; and by disdaining to make a stoop at wrens, phyl-tits,* and wag-tails.
* Phyl-tits, q. d. Phyllis-tits, in opposition to Tom-tits.
It needs not now be observed, that Mr. Lovelace, in this wanton gaiety of Mr. Lovelace heart, often takes liberties of coining words and phrases in Mr. Lovelace letters to this Mr. Lovelace familiar friend.

The worst respecting myself, in the case before myself, is that my triumph, when completed, will be so glorious a one, that I shall never be able to keep up to it.
All my future attempts must be poor to this.
I shall be as unhappy, after a while, from my reflections upon this conquest, as Don Juan of Austria was in Don Juan of Austria, on the renowned victory of Lepanto, when Don Juan of Austria found that none of future achievements could keep pace with Don Juan of Austria early glory.
I am sensible that my pleas and my reasoning may be easily answered, and perhaps justly censured; But by whom censured?
Not by any of the confraternity, whose constant course of life, even long before I became your general, to this hour, has justified what ye now in a fit of squeamishness, and through envy, condemn.
Having, therefore, vindicated ye and my intentions to YOU, that is all I am at present concerned for.
Be convinced, then, that I (according to our principles) am right, thou wrong; or, at least, be silent.
But I command thee to be convinced.
And in thee next be sure to tell me that thou art.
LETTER XVIII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
EDGEWARE, THURSDAY, MAY 4.
I know that thou art so abandoned a man, that to give thee the best reasons in the world against what thou hast once resolved upon will be but acting the madman whom once we saw trying to buffet down a hurricane with a man hat.
I hope, however, that the lady's merit will still avail the lady with thee.
But, if thou persistest; if thou wilt avenge thyself on this sweet lamb which thou hast singled out from a flock thou hatest, for the faults of the dogs who kept it: if thou art not to be moved by beauty, by learning, by prudence, by innocence, all shining out in one charming object; but she must fall, fall by the man whom she has chosen for she protector; I would not for a thousand worlds have thy crime to answer for.
Upon my faith, Lovelace, the subject sticks with me, notwithstanding I find I have not the honour of the lady's good opinion.
And the more, when I reflect upon she father's brutal curse, and the villainous hard- heartedness of all she family.
But, nevertheless, I should be desirous to know (if thou wilt proceed) by what gradations, arts, and contrivances thou effectest thy ingrateful purpose.
And, my Lovelace, I conjure thee, if thou art a man, let not the specious devils thou has brought thou art a man among be suffered to triumph over thou art a man; yield to fair seductions, if I may so express O!
if thou canst raise a weakness in thou art a man by love, or by arts not inhuman; I shall the less pity her: and shall then conclude, that there is not a woman in the world who can resist a bold and resolute lover.
A messenger is just now arrived from my uncle.
The mortification, it seems, is got to my uncle knee; and the surgeons declare that my uncle cannot live many days.
my uncle therefore sends for me directly, with these shocking words, that I will come and close my uncle eyes.
My servant or my uncle must of necessity be in town every day on my uncle case, or other affairs; and one of other affairs shall regularly attend you for any letter or commands.
It will be charity to write to me as often as you can.
For although I am likely to be a considerable gainer by the poor man's death, yet I cannot say that I at all love these scenes of death and the doctor so near me.
The doctor and death I should have said; for that is the natural order, and generally speaking, the one is but the harbinger to the other.
If, therefore, you decline to oblige me, I shall think you are displeased with my freedom.
But let me tell you, at the same, that no man has a right to be displeased at freedoms taken with no man for faults no man is not ashamed to be guilty of.

LETTER XIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   I thank you and Mr. Hickman for Mr. Hickman letter, sent me with such kind expedition; and proceed to obey my dear menacing tyranness.
[She then gives the particulars of what passed between She and Mr.    Lovelace on Tuesday morning, in relation to Mr.    Lovelace four friends, and to    Miss Partington, pretty much to the same effect as in Mr. Lovelace's    Letter, No.
XIII.
And then proceeds:]  Mr.    Lovelace is constantly accusing me of over-scrupulousness.
Mr.    Lovelace says, 'I am always out of humour with Mr.    Lovelace: that I could not have behaved more reservedly to Mr. Solmes: and that it is contrary to all Mr.    Lovelace hopes and notions, that Mr.    Lovelace should not, in so long a time, find Mr.    Lovelace able to inspire the person, whom Mr.    Lovelace hoped so soon to have the honour to call Mr.    Lovelace, with the least distinguishing tenderness for Mr.    Lovelace before-hand.'
Silly and partial encroacher!
not to know to what to attribute the reserve I am forced to treat Mr.    Lovelace with!
But Mr.    Lovelace pride has eaten up Mr.    Lovelace prudence.
It is indeed a dirty low pride, that has swallowed up the true pride which should have set Mr.    Lovelace above the vanity that has overrun Mr.    Lovelace.
Yet Mr.    Lovelace pretends that Mr.    Lovelace has no pride but in obliging me: and is always talking of Mr.    Lovelace reverence and humility, and such sort of stuff: but of this I am sure that Mr.    Lovelace has, as I observed the first time I saw Mr.    Lovelace,* too much regard to Mr.    Lovelace own person, greatly to value that of Mr.    Lovelace wife, marry Mr.    Lovelace whom Mr.    Lovelace will: and I must be blind, if I did not see that Mr.    Lovelace is exceedingly vain of Mr.    Lovelace external advantages, and of that address, which, if it has any merit in it to an outward eye, is perhaps owing more to Mr.    Lovelace confidence that [sic] to any thing else.

Have you not beheld the man, when I was your happy guest, as the man walked to the man chariot, looking about the man, as if to observe what eyes the man specious person and air had attracted?
But indeed we had some homely coxcombs as proud as if some homely coxcombs had persons to be proud of; at the same time that it was apparent, that the pains some homely coxcombs took about some homely coxcombs but the more exposed some homely coxcombs defects.
The man who is fond of being thought more or better than the man is, as I have often observed, but provokes a scrutiny into the man pretensions; and that generally produces contempt.
For pride, as I believe I have heretofore said, is an infallible sign of weakness; of something wrong in the head or in both.
He that exalts He insults He neighbour; who is provoked to question in He even that merit, which, were He modest, would perhaps be allowed to be He due.
You will say that I am very grave: and so I am.
Mr.    Lovelace is extremely sunk in my opinion since Monday night: nor see I before Mr.    Lovelace any thing that can afford me a pleasing hope.
For what, with a mind so unequal as Mr.    Lovelace, can be my best hope?
I think I mentioned to you, in my former, that my clothes were brought me.
You fluttered me so, that I am not sure I did.
But I know I designed to mention that they were.
they were brought me on Thursday; but neither my few guineas with they, nor any of my books, except a Drexelius on Eternity, the good old Practice of Piety, and a Francis Spira.
My brother's wit, I suppose.
My brother thinks My brother does well to point out death and despair to My brother.
I wish for the one, and every now-and-then am on the brink of the other.
You will the less wonder at my being so very solemn, when, added to the above, and to my uncertain situation, I tell you, that they have sent me with these books a letter form my cousin Morden.
a letter has set my heart against Mr.    Lovelace.
Against My brother too.
I send a letter enclosed.
If you please, my dear, you may read a letter here:   COL. MORDEN, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  Florence, April 13.
I am extremely concerned to hear of a difference betwixt the rest of a family so near and dear to My brother, and you still dearer to than any of the rest.
my cousin Morden has acquainted me with the offers you have had, and with your refusals.
I wonder not at either.
Such charming promises at so early an age as when I left England; and those promises, as I have often heard, so greatly exceeded, as well in your person as mind; how much must you be admired!
how few must there be worthy of you!
Your parents, the most indulgent in the world, to a child the most deserving, have given way it seems to your refusal of several gentlemen.
Your parents have contented Your parents at last to name one with earnestness to Your parents, because of the address of another whom Your parents cannot approve.
Your parents had not reason, it seems, from your behaviour, to think you greatly averse: so Your parents proceeded: perhaps too hastily for a delicacy like your's.
But when all was fixed on Your parents parts, and most extraordinary terms concluded in your favour; terms, which abundantly show the gentleman's just value for you; you flew off with a warmth and vehemence little suited to that sweetness which gave grace to all your actions.
I know very little of either of the gentlemen: but of Mr.    Lovelace I know more than of Mr. Solmes.
I wish I could say more to Mr. Solmes advantage than I can.
As to every qualification but one, Mr.    Lovelace owns there is no comparison.
But that one outweighs all the rest together.
It cannot be thought that Miss Clarissa Harlowe will dispense with MORALS in a husband.
What, my dearest cousin, shall I plead first to you on this occasion?
Your duty, your interest, your temporal and your eternal welfare, do, and may all, depend upon this single point, the morality of a husband.
A woman who hath a wicked husband may find it difficult to be good, and out of A woman who hath a wicked husband power to do good; and is therefore in a worse situation than the man can be in, who hath a bad wife.
You preserve all your religious regards, I understand.
I wonder not that you do.
I should have wondered had you not.
But what can you promise youself, as to perseverance in youself, with an immoral husband?
If your parents and you differ in sentiment on this occasion, let me ask you, my dear cousin, who ought to give way?
I own to you, that I should have thought there could not any where have been a more suitable match for you than Mr.    Lovelace, had Mr.    Lovelace been a moral man.
I should have very little to say against a man, of whose actions I am not to set up a man as a judge, did Mr.    Lovelace not address my cousin Morden.
But, on this occasion, let me tell you, my dear Clarissa, that Mr.    Lovelace cannot possibly deserve you.
Mr.    Lovelace may reform, you'll say: but Mr.    Lovelace may not.
Habit is not soon or easily shaken off.
Libertines, who are libertines in defiance of talents, of superior lights, of conviction, hardly ever reform but by miracle, or by incapacity.
Well do I know mine own sex.
Well am I able to judge of the probability of the reformation of a licentious young man, who has not been fastened upon by sickness, by affliction, by calamity: who has a prosperous run of fortune before him: him spirits high: him will uncontroulable: the company him keeps, perhaps such as him, confirming him in all him courses, assisting him in all him enterprises.
As to the other gentleman, suppose, my cousin Morden, you do not like him at present, it is far from being unlikely that you will hereafter: perhaps the more for not liking him now.
him can hardly sink lower in your opinion: him may rise.
Very seldom is it that high expectations are so much as tolerably answered.
How indeed can they, when a fine and extensive imagination carries its expectation infinitely beyond reality, in the highest of our sublunary enjoyments?
A woman adorned with such an imagination sees no defect in a favoured object, (the less, if A woman adorned with such an imagination be not conscious of any wilful fault in A woman adorned with such an imagination,) till it is too late to rectify the mistakes occasioned by A woman adorned with such an imagination generous credulity.
But suppose a person of your talents were to marry a man of inferior talents; Who, in this case, can be so happy in A woman adorned with such an imagination as Miss Clarissa Harlowe?
What delight do you take in doing good!
How happily do you devote the several portions of the day to your own improvement, and to the advantage of all that move within your sphere!--And then, such is your taste, such are your acquirements in the politer studies, and in the politer amusements; such your excellence in all the different parts of economy fit for a young lady's inspection and practice, that your friends would wish you to be taken off as little as possible by regards that may be called merely personal.
But as to what may be the consequence respecting yourself, respecting a young lady of your talents, from the preference you are suspected to give to a libertine, I would have you, my dear cousin, consider what that may be.
A mind so pure, to mingle with a mind impure!
And will not such a man as this engross all your solitudes?
Will not such a man as this engross all your solitudes not perpetually fill you with anxieties for not such a man as this engross all your solitudes and for yourself?--The divine and civil powers defied, and The divine and civil powers sanctions broken through by not such a man as this engross all your solitudes, on every not merely accidental but meditated occasion.
To be agreeable to not such a man as this engross all your solitudes, and to hope to preserve an interest in not such a man as this engross all your solitudes affections, you must probably be obliged to abandon all your own laudable pursuits.
You must enter into not such a man as this engross all your solitudes pleasures and distastes.
You must give up your virtuous companions for your virtuous companions profligate ones--perhaps be forsaken by your's, because of the scandal your virtuous companions daily gives.
Can you hope, cousin, with such a man as this to be long  so good as you now are?
If not, consider which of your present laudable delights you would choose to give up!
which of his culpable ones to follow his in!
How could you brook to go backward, instead of forward, in those duties which you now so exemplarily perform?
and how do you know, if you once give way, where you shall be suffered, where you shall be able, to stop?
Your brother acknowledges that Mr. Solmes is not near so agreeable in person as Mr.    Lovelace.
But what is person with such a lady as I have the honour to be now writing to?
Your brother owns likewise that Your brother has not the address of Mr.    Lovelace: but what a mere personal advantage is a plausible address, without morals?
A woman had better take a husband whose manners A woman were to fashion, than to find them ready-fashioned to A woman hand, at the price of A woman morality; a price that is often paid for travelling accomplishments.
O my dear cousin, were you but with us here at Florence, or at Rome, or at Paris, (where also I resided for many months,) to see the gentlemen whose supposed rough English manners at setting out are to be polished, and what the gentlemen whose supposed rough English manners at setting out improvement are in the gentlemen whose supposed rough English manners at setting out return through the same places, you would infinitely prefer the man in the man first stage to the same man in the man last.
You find the difference on the gentlemen whose supposed rough English manners at setting out return--a fondness for foreign fashions, an attachment to foreign vices, a supercilious contempt of his own country and countrymen; (his more despicable than the most despicable of those his despises;) these, with an unblushing effrontery, are too generally the attainments that concur to finish the travelled gentleman!
Mr.    Lovelace, I know, deserves to have an exception made in Mr.    Lovelace favour; for Mr.    Lovelace really is a man of parts and learning: Mr.    Lovelace was esteemed so both here and at Rome; and a fine person, and a generous turn of mind, gave Mr.    Lovelace great advantages.
But you need not be told that a libertine man of sense does infinitely more mischief than a libertine of weak parts is able to do.
And this I will tell you further, that it was Mr.    Lovelace's own fault that Mr.    Lovelace was not still more respected than Mr.    Lovelace was among the literati here.
There were, in short, some liberties in which Mr.    Lovelace indulged Mr.    Lovelace, that endangered Mr.    Lovelace person and Mr.    Lovelace liberty; and made the best and most worthy of those who honoured Mr.    Lovelace with those who honoured him with their notice notice give Mr.    Lovelace up, and Mr.    Lovelace stay both at Florence and at Rome shorter than Mr.    Lovelace designed.
This is all I choose to say of Mr.    Lovelace.
I had much rather have had reason to give Mr.    Lovelace a quite contrary character.
But as to rakes or libertines in general, I, who know rakes or libertines in general well, must be allowed, because of the mischiefs rakes or libertines in general have always in rakes or libertines in general hearts, and too often in rakes or libertines in general power, to do your sex, to add still a few more words upon this topic.
A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine, must be generally remorseless--unjust A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine must always be.
The noble rule of doing to others what A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine would have done to A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine is the first rule A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine breaks; and every day A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine breaks it; the oftener, the greater A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine triumph.
A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine has great contempt for your sex.
A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine believes no woman chaste, because A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine is a profligate.
Every woman who favours A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine confirms A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine in A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine wicked incredulity.
A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine is always plotting to extend the mischiefs A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine delights in.
If a woman loves such a man, how can a woman bear the thought of dividing a woman interest in A libertine, my dear cousin, a plotting, an intriguing libertine affections with half the town, and that perhaps the dregs of it?
Then so sensual!--How will a young lady of your delicacy bear with so sensual a man?
a man who makes a jest of his vows?
and who perhaps will break your spirit by the most unmanly insults.
To be a libertine, is to continue to be every thing vile and inhuman.
Prayers, tears, and the most abject submission, are but fuel to his pride: wagering perhaps with lewd companions, and, not improbably, with lewder women, upon instances which his boasts of to lewder women of your patient sufferings, and broken spirit, and bringing lewder women home to witness to both.
I write what I know has been.
I mention not fortunes squandered, estates mortgaged or sold, and posterity robbed--nor yet a multitude of other evils, too gross, too shocking, to be mentioned to a person of your delicacy.
All these, my dear cousin, to be shunned, all the evils I have named to be avoided; the power of doing all the good you have been accustomed to, preserved, nay, increased, by the separate provision that will be made for you: your charming diversions, and exemplary employments, all maintained; and every good habit perpetuated: and all by one sacrifice, the fading pleasure of the eye!
who would not, (since every thing is not to be met with in one man, who would not,) to preserve so many essentials, give up to light, so unpermanent a pleasure!
Weigh all these things, which I might insist upon to more advantage, did I think it needful to one of your prudence--weigh them well, my beloved cousin; and if it be not the will of your parents that you should continue single, resolve to oblige your parents; and let it not be said that the powers of fancy shall (as in many others of your sex) be too hard for your duty and your prudence.
The less agreeable the man, The more obliging the compliance.
Remember, that The less agreeable the man is a sober man--a man who has reputation to lose, and whose reputation therefore is a security for The less agreeable the man good behaviour to you.
You have an opportunity offered you to give the highest instance that can be given of filial duty.
Embrace it.
it is worthy of you.
it is expected from you; however, for your inclination-sake, we may be sorry that you are called upon to give it.
Let it be said that you have been able to lay an obligation upon your parents, (a proud word, my cousin!)
which you could not do, were it not laid against your inclination!--upon parents who have laid a thousand upon you: who are set upon this point: who will not give it up: who have given up many points to you, even of this very nature: and in your inclination!--upon parents who have laid a thousand upon you: who are set upon this point: who will not give it up: who have given up many points to you, even of this very nature turn, for the sake of your inclination!--upon parents who have laid a thousand upon you: who are set upon this point: who will not give it up: who have given up many points to you, even of this very nature own authority, as well as judgment, expect to be obliged.
I hope I shall soon, in person, congratulate you upon this your meritorious compliance.
To settle and give up my trusteeship is one of the principal motives of my leaving these parts.
I shall be glad to settle my trusteeship to every one's satisfaction; to yours particularly.
If on my arrival I find a happy union, as formerly, reign in a family so dear to me, it will be an unspeakable pleasure to me; and I shall perhaps so dispose my affairs, as to be near you for ever.
I have written a very long letter, and will add no more, than that I am, with the greatest respect, my dearest cousin,  Your most affectionate and faithful servant, WM.
MORDEN.
***   I will suppose, my dear Miss Howe, that you have read my cousin's letter.
It is now in vain to wish it had come sooner.
But if it had, I might perhaps have been so rash as to give Mr.    Lovelace the fatal meeting, as I little thought of going away with Mr.    Lovelace.
But I should hardly have given Mr.    Lovelace the expectation of so doing, previous to the meeting, which made Mr.    Lovelace come prepared; and the revocation of which Mr.    Lovelace so artfully made ineffectual.
Persecuted as I was, and little expecting so much condescension, as my aunt, to my great mortification, has told me (and you confirm) I should have met with, it is, however, hard to say what I should or should not have done as to meeting Mr.    Lovelace, had it come in time: but this effect I verily believe it would have had--to have made me insist with all my might on going over, out of all their ways, to the kind writer of the instructive letter, and on making a father (a protector, as well as a friend) of a kinsman, who is one of my trustees.
This, circumstanced as I was, would have been a natural, at least an unexceptionable protection!
--But I was to be unhappy!
and how it cuts me to the heart to think, that I can already subscribe to my cousin's character of a libertine, so well drawn in the letter which I suppose you now to have read!
That a man of a character which ever was my abhorrence should fall to my lot!--But, depending on my own strength; having no reason to apprehend danger from headstrong and disgraceful impulses; I too little perhaps cast up my eyes to the Supreme Director: in whom, mistrusting myself, I ought to have placed my whole confidence--and the more, when I saw myself so perserveringly addressed by a man of this character.
Inexperience and presumption, with the help of a brother and sister who have low ends to answer in my disgrace, have been my ruin!--A hard word, my dear!
but I repeat it upon deliberation: since, let the best happen which now can happen, my reputation is destroyed; a rake is my portion: and what my portion is my cousin Morden's letter has acquainted you.
Pray keep my cousin Morden's letter by Pray till called for.
I saw my cousin Morden's letter not Pray (having not the heart to inspect my trunks) till this morning.
I would not for the world this man should see it; because it might occasion mischief between the most violent spirit, and the most settled brave one in the world, as my cousin's is said to be.
my cousin Morden's letter was enclosed (opened) in a blank cover.
Scorn and detest me as they will, I wonder that one line was not sent with one line--were my cousin Morden's letter but to have more particularly pointed the design of my cousin Morden's letter, in the same generous spirit that sent me the spira.
The sealing of a blank cover was with black wax.
I hope there is no new occasion in the family to give reason for black wax.
But if there were, it would, to be sure, have been mentioned, and laid at my door--perhaps too justly!
I had begun a letter to my cousin; but laid it by, because of the uncertainty of my situation, and expecting every day for several days past to be at a greater certainty.
You bid me write to my cousin some time ago, you know.
Then it was I began it: for I have great pleasure in obeying you in all I may.
So I ought to have; for you are the only friend left me.
And, moreover, you generally honour me with your own observance of the advice I take the liberty to offer you: for I pretend to say, I give better advice than I have taken.
And so I had need.
For, I know not how it comes about, but I am, in my own opinion, a poor lost creature: and yet cannot charge myself with one criminal or faulty inclination.
Do you know, my dear, how this can be?
Yet I can tell you how, I believe--one devious step at setting out!-- that must be it:--which pursued, has led me so far out of my path, that I am in a wilderness of doubt and error; and never, never, shall find my way out of it: for, although but one pace awry at first, it has led me hundreds and hundreds of miles out of my path: and the poor estray has not one kind friend, nor has met with one direct passenger, to help the poor estray to recover one direct passenger.
But I, presumptuous creature!
must rely so much upon my own knowledge of the right path!--little apprehending that an ignus fatuus with the right path!--little apprehending false fires (and ye I had heard enough of such) would arise to mislead me!
And now, in the midst of fens and quagmires, it plays around ye, and around me, throwing me back again, whenever I think ye in the right track.
But there is one common point, in which all shall meet, err widely as they may.
In that I shall be laid quietly down at last: and then will all my calamities be at an end.
But how I stray again; stray from my intention!
I would only have said, that I had begun a letter to my cousin Morden some time ago: but that now I can never end it.
You will believe I cannot: for how shall I tell him that all him compliments are misbestowed?
that all him advice is thrown away?
all him warnings vain?
and that even my highest expectation is to be the wife of that free-liver, whom him so pathetically warns me to shun?
Let me own, however, have your prayers joined with my own, (my fate depending, as it seems, upon the lips of such a man) 'that, whatever shall be my destiny, that dreadful part of my father's malediction, that I may be punished by the man in whom my father supposes I put my confidence, may not take place!
that this for Mr. Lovelace's own sake, and for the sake of human nature, may not be!
or, if it be necessary, in support of the parental authority, that I should be punished by him, that it may not be by him premeditated or wilful baseness; but that I may be able to acquit him intention, if not him action!'
Otherwise, my fault will appear to be doubled in the eye of the event-judging world.
And yet, methinks, I would be glad that the unkindness of my father and uncles, whose hearts have already been too much wounded by my error, may be justified in every article, excepting in this heavy curse: and that my father will be pleased to withdraw that before it be generally known: at least the most dreadful part of it which regards futurity!
I must lay down my pen.
I must brood over these reflections.
Once more, before I close my cousin, I will peruse my cousin's letter.
And then I shall have my cousin's letter by heart.
LETTER XX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SUNDAY NIGHT, MAY 7.
When you reflect upon my unhappy situation, which is attended with so many indelicate and even shocking circumstances, some of which my pride will not let me think of with patience; all aggravated by the contents of my cousin's affecting letter; you will not wonder that the vapourishness which has laid hold of my heart should rise to my pen.
And yet it would be more kind, more friendly in me, to conceal from you, who take such a generous interest in my concerns, that worst part of my griefs, which communication and complaint cannot relieve.
But to whom can I unbosom me but to you: when the man who ought to be my protector, as he has brought upon me all my distresses, adds to my apprehensions; when I have not even a servant on whose fidelity I can rely, or to whom I can break my griefs as whose fidelity arise; and when he bountiful temper and gay heart attach every one to he; and I am but a cipher, to give he significance, and myself pain!--These griefs, therefore, do what I can, will sometimes burst into tears; and these mingling with my ink, will blot my paper.
And I know you will not grudge me the temporary relief.
But I shall go on in the strain I left off with in my last, when I intended rather to apologize for my melancholy.
But let what I have above written, once for all, be my apology.
My misfortunes have given you a call to discharge the noblest offices of the friendship we have vowed to each other, in advice and consolation; and it would be an injury to it, and to you, to suppose it needed even that call.
[   then tells Miss Howe, that now    clothes are come, Mr.    Lovelace is    continually teasing    to go abroad with Mr.    Lovelace in a coach, attended by    whom    pleases of    own sex, either for the air, or to the public    diversions.
gives the particulars of a conversation that has passed between them    on that subject, and Mr.    Lovelace several proposals.
But takes notice, that Mr.    Lovelace    says not the least word of the solemnity which Mr.    Lovelace so much pressed for    before them came to town; and which, as    observes, was necessary to    give propriety to Mr.    Lovelace proposals.]
Now, my dear,    says, I cannot bear the life I live.
I would be glad at my heart to be out of Mr.    Lovelace reach.
If I were, Mr.    Lovelace should soon find the difference.
If I must be humbled, it had better be by those to whom I owe duty, than by Mr.    Lovelace.
my aunt writes in my aunt ,* that my aunt dare not propose any thing in my favour.
You tell me, that upon inquiry, you find,* that, had I not been unhappily seduced away, a change of measures was actually resolved upon; and that my mother, particularly, was determined to exert my aunt for the restoration of the family peace; and, in order to succeed the better, had thoughts of trying to engage my uncle Harlowe in my aunt party.
* See Vol.
III.
Letter LII.
** Ibid.
Letter VIII.
Let me build on these foundations.
I can but try, my dear.
It is my duty to try all probable methods to restore the poor outcast to favour.
And who knows but that once indulgent uncle, who has very great weight in the family, may be induced to interpose in my behalf?
I will give up all right and title to my grandfather's devises and bequests, with all my heart and soul, to whom they please, in order to make my proposal palatable to my brother.
And that my surrender may be effectual, I will engage never to marry.
What think you, my dear, of this expedient?
Surely, they cannot resolve to renounce me for ever.
If they look with impartial eyes upon what has happened, they will have something to blame they for, as well as me.
I presume, that you will be of opinion that this expedient is worth trying.
But here is my difficulty: If I should write, my brother has so strongly confederated them all against me, that my letter would be handed about from one to another, till my brother had hardened every one to refuse my request; whereas could my uncle be engaged to espouse my cause, as from my uncle, I should have some hope, as I presume to think my uncle would soon have my mother and my aunt of my uncle party.
What, therefore, I am thinking of, is this--'Suppose Mr. Hickman, whose good character has gained my uncle every body's respect, should put my uncle in my uncle Harlowe's way?
And (as if from your knowledge of the state of things between Mr. Lovelace and me) assure my uncle not only of the above particulars, but that I am under no obligations that shall hinder me from taking my uncle directions?'
I submit the whole to your consideration, whether to pursue the whole at all, or in what manner.
But if the whole be pursued, and if my uncle refuses to interest my uncle in my favour upon Mr. Hickman's application as from you, (for so, for obvious reasons, it must be put,) I can then have no hope; and my next step, in the mind I am in, shall be to throw myself into the protection of the ladies of myself family.
It were an impiety to adopt the following lines, because an impiety would be throwing upon the decrees of Providence a fault too much my own.
But often do I revolve the decrees of Providence, for the sake of the general similitude which the decrees of Providence bear to my unhappy, yet undersigned error.
To you, great gods!
I make my last appeal:       Or clear my virtue, or my crimes reveal.
If wand'ring in the maze of life I run,       And backward tread the steps I sought to shun,       Impute my error to your own decree:       My FEET are guilty: but my HEART is free.
[The Lady dates again on Monday, to let Miss Howe know, that Mr.    Lovelace, on observing The Lady uneasiness, had introduced to The Lady Mr.    Mennell, Mrs. Fretchville's kinsman, who managed all The Lady affairs.
The Lady    calls him a young officer of sense and politeness, who gave The Lady an    account of the house and furniture, to the same effect that Mr.    Lovelace had done before;* as also of the melancholy way Mrs.    Fretchville is in.
* See Letter IV.
of this volume.
The Lady tells Miss Howe how extremely urgent Mr.    Lovelace was with the    gentleman, to get Mr.    Lovelace spouse (as Mr.    Lovelace now always calls The Lady before    company) a sight of the house: and that Mr. Mennell undertook that    very afternoon to show The Lady all of it, except the apartment Mrs.    Fretchville should be in when Mrs.    Fretchville went.
But that Mrs.    Fretchville chose not to    take another step till Mrs.    Fretchville knew how Mrs.    Fretchville approved of Mrs.    Fretchville scheme to have    Mrs.    Fretchville uncle sounded, and with what success, if tried, it would be    attended.
Mr.    Lovelace, in Mr.    Lovelace humourous way, gives Mr.    Lovelace friend an account of the    Lady's peevishness and dejection, on receiving a letter with Mrs.    Fretchville    clothes.
Mr.    Lovelace regrets that Mr.    Lovelace has lost her confidence; which Mr.    Lovelace    attributes to Mr.    Lovelace bringing her into the company of Mr.    Lovelace four    companions.
Yet Mr.    Lovelace thinks Mr.    Lovelace must excuse them, and censure her for    over-niceness; for that Mr.    Lovelace never saw men behave better, at least not    men.
Mentioning Mr.    Lovelace introducing Mr. Mennell to her,]  Now, Jack, says Mr.    Lovelace, was it not very kind of Mr. Mennell [Captain Mennell I sometimes called Captain Mennell; for among the military there is no such officer, thou knowest, as a lieutenant, or an ensign--was it not very kind in Captain Mennell] to come along with me so readily as Captain Mennell did, to satisfy my beloved about the vapourish lady and the house?
But who is Capt.
Captain Mennell?
methinks thou askest: I never heard of such a man as Captain Mennell.
Very likely.
But knowest thou not young Newcomb, honest Doleman's newphew?
O-ho!
Is it he?
it is.
And I have changed he name by virtue of my own single authority.
Knowest thou not, that I am a great name-father?
Preferment I bestow, both military and civil.
I give estates, and take estates away at my pleasure.
Quality too I create.
And by a still more valuable prerogative, I degrade by virtue of my own imperial will, without any other act of forfeiture than my own convenience.
What a poor thing is a monarch to me!
But Mr. Mennell, now Mr. Mennell has seen this angel of a woman, has qualms; that's the devil!--I shall have enough to do to keep Mr. Mennell right.
But it is the less wonder, that Mr. Mennell should stagger, when a few hours' conversation with The Lady could make four much more hardened varlets find hearts-- only, that I am confident, that I shall at least reward The Lady virtue, if her virtue overcome me, or I should find it impossible to persevere--for at times I have confounded qualms myself.
But say not a word of them to the confraternity: nor laugh at myself for them thyself.
In another letter, dated Monday night, myself writes as follows:  The Lady keeps me at such a distance, that I am sure something is going on between The Lady and Miss Howe, notwithstanding the prohibition from Miss Howe to both: and as I have thought it some degree of merit in myself to punish others for others transgressions, I am of opinion that both others are punishable for others breach of parental injunctions.
And as to others letter-carrier, I have been inquiring into his way of living; and finding his to be a common poacher, a deer-stealer, and warren-robber, who, under pretence of haggling, deals with a set of customers who constantly take all his brings, whether fish, fowl, or venison, I hold myself justified (since Wilson's conveyance must at present be sacred) to have his stripped and robbed, and what money his has about his given to the poor; since, if I take not money as well as letters, I shall be suspected.
To serve one's self, and punish a villain at the same time, is serving public and private.
The law was not made for such a man as me.
And I must come at correspondences so disobediently carried on.
But, on second thoughts, if I could find out that the dear creature carried any of the dear creature letters in the dear creature pockets, I can get the dear creature to a play or to a concert, and the dear creature may have the misfortune to lose the dear creature pockets.
But how shall I find this out; since the dear creature Dorcas knows no more of her Dorcas dressing and undressing than her Dorcas ?
For her Dorcas is dressed for the day before her Dorcas appears even to her Dorcas servant.
Vilely suspicious!
Upon my soul, Jack, a suspicious temper is a punishable temper.
If a woman suspects a rogue in an honest man, is it not enough to make the honest man who knows it a rogue?
But, as to her Dorcas , I think my mind hankers after her pockets, as the less mischievous attempt.
But her pockets cannot hold all the letters I should wish to see.
And yet a woman's pockets are half as deep as a woman is high.
Tied round the sweet levities, I presume, as ballast-bags, lest the wind, as her pockets move with full sail, from whale-ribbed canvass, should blow away the gypsies.
[He then, in apprehension that something is meditating between the two    ladies, or that something may be set on foot to get Miss Harlowe out    of He hands, relates several of He contrivances, and boasts of He    instructions given in writing to Dorcas, and to He Will.
Summers; and says, that her servant has provided against every possible    accident, even to bring her back if her should escape, or in case her    should go abroad, and then refuse to return; and hopes so to manage,    as that, should her servant make an attempt, whether her servant succeeded in it or not,    her servant may have a pretence to detain her.]
her servant then proceeds as follows:  I have ordered Dorcas to cultivate by all means Dorcas lady's favour; to lament Dorcas incapacity as to writing and reading; to shew letters to her lady, as from pretended country relations; to beg Dorcas advice how to answer them, and to get them answered; and to be always aiming at scrawling with a pen, lest inky fingers should give suspicion.
I have moreover given the wench an ivory-leafed pocket-book, with a silver pencil, that Dorcas may make memoranda on occasion.
And, let me tell thee, that The Lady has already (at Mrs. Sinclair's motion) removed The Lady clothes out of the trunks they came in, into an ample mahogany repository, where they will lie at full length, and which has drawers in it for linen.
A repository, that used to hold the richest suits which some of the nymphs put on, when they are to be dressed out, to captivate, or to ape quality.
For many a countess, thou knowest, has our mother equipped; nay, two or three duchesses, who live upon quality- terms with their lords.
But this to such as will come up to our mother price, and can make an appearance like quality such on the occasion: for the reputation of persons of birth must not lie at the mercy of every under-degreed sinner.
A master-key, which will open every lock in this chest, is put into Dorcas's hands; and Dorcas is to take care, when Dorcas searches for papers, before Dorcas removes any thing, to observe how it lies, that Dorcas may replace all to a hair.
Sally and Polly can occasionally help to transcribe.
Slow and sure with such an Argus-eyed charmer must be all my movements.
It is impossible that one so young and so inexperienced as Dorcas is can have all Dorcas caution from Dorcas; the behaviour of the women so unexceptionable; no revellings, no company ever admitted into this inner- house; all genteel, quiet, and easy in this inner- house; the nymphs well-bred, and well-read; Dorcas first disgusts to the old one got over.--It must be Miss Howe, therefore, [who once was in danger of being taken in by one of our class, by honest Sir George Colmar, as thou hast heard,] that makes my progress difficult.
Thou seest, Belford, by the above precautionaries, that I forget nothing.
As the song says, it is not to be imagined          On what slight strings         Depend these things       On which men build men glory!
So far, so good.
I shall never rest till I have discovered in the first place, where the dear creature puts her letters; and in the next till I have got her to a play, to a concert, or to take an airing with me out of town for a day or two.
***   I gave thee just now some of my contrivances.
Dorcas, who is ever attentive to all her lady's motions, has given me some instances of her mistress's precautions.
her wafers her , it seems, in two places; pricks the wafers; and then seals upon Dorcas, who is ever attentive to all her lady's motions.
No doubt but the same care is taken with regard to those brought to her, for her always examines the seals of the latter before her opens those brought to her.
I must, I must come at those brought to her.
This difficulty augments my curiosity.
Strange, so much as her writes, and at all hours, that not one sleepy or forgetful moment has offered in our favour!
A fair contention, thou seest: nor plead thou in her favour her youth, her beauty, her family, her fortune, CREDULITY, her has none; and with regard to her TENDER YEARS, Am I not a young fellow her?
As to BEAUTY; pr'ythee, Jack, do thou, to spare my modesty, make a comparison between my Clarissa for a woman, and thy Lovelace for a man.
For her FAMILY; that was not known to her FAMILY country a century ago: and I hate them all but her.
Have I not cause?--For her FORTUNE; fortune, thou knowest, was ever a stimulus with me; and this for reasons not ignoble.
Do not girls of fortune adorn not girls of fortune on purpose to engage our attention?
Seek not girls of fortune not to draw our into not girls of fortune snares?
Depend not girls of fortune not, generally, upon not girls of fortune fortunes, in the views not girls of fortune have upon us, more than on not girls of fortune merits?
Shall we deprive not girls of fortune of the benefit of not girls of fortune principal dependence?--Can I, in particular, marry every girl who wishes to obtain my notice?
If, therefore, in support of the libertine principles for which none of the sweet rogues hate us, a woman of fortune is brought to yield homage to a woman of fortune emperor, and any consequences attend the subjugation, is not such a one shielded by a woman of fortune , as well from insult and contempt, as from indigence--all, then, that admits of debate between my beloved and me is only this--which of the two has more wit, more circumspection--and that remains to be tried.
A sad life, however, this life of doubt and suspense, for The Lady to live, as well as for me; that is to say, if The Lady be not naturally jealous--if The Lady be, The Lady uneasiness is constitutional, and The Lady cannot help her uneasiness; nor will her uneasiness, in that case, hurt The Lady.
For a suspicious temper will make occasion for doubt, if none were to offer to her uneasiness hand.
My fair one therefore, if naturally suspicious, is obliged to me for saving The Lady the trouble of studying for these occasions--but, after all, the plainest paths in our journeys through life are the safest and best I believe, although it is not given me to choose naturally suspicious; I am not, however, singular in the pursuit of the more intricate paths; since there are thousands, and ten thousands, who had rather fish in troubled waters than in smooth.
LETTER XXI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
TUESDAY, MAY 9.
I am a very unhappy man.
The Lady is said to be one of the sweetest- tempered creatures in the world: and so I thought The Lady.
But to The Lady The Lady is one of the most perverse.
I never was supposed to be an ill-natured mortal neither.
How can it be?
I imagined, for a long while, that we were born to make each other happy: but quite the contrary; we really seem to be sent to plague each other.
I will write a comedy, I think: I have a title already; and that's half the work.
The Quarrelsome Lovers.
'Twill do.
There's something new and striking in it.
Yet, more or less, The Quarrelsome Lovers. '
quarrel.
Old Terence has taken notice of that; and observes upon it, That lovers falling out occasions lovers falling in; and a better understanding of course.
'Tis natural that it should be so.
But with us, us fall out so often, without falling in once; and a second quarrel so generally happens before a first is made up; that it is hard to guess what event us loves will be attended with.
But perseverance is my glory, and patience my handmaid, when I have in view an object worthy of my attempts.
What is there in an easy conquest?
Hudibras questions well,        ------What mad lover ever dy'd       To gain a soft and easy bride?
Or, for a lady tender-hearted,       In purling streams, or hemp, departed?
But I will lead to the occasion of this preamble.
I had been out.
On my return, meeting Dorcas on the stairs--Your lady in Dorcas chamber, Dorcas?
In the dining-room, sir: and if ever you hope for an opportunity to come at a letter, it must be now.
For at Dorcas feet I saw one lie, which, as may be seen by its open fold, Dorcas had been reading, with a little parcel of others Dorcas is now busied with--all pulled out of Dorcas pocket, as I believe: so, honest Sir George Colmar, you'll know where to find a little parcel of others she is now busied another time.
I was ready to leap for joy, and instantly resolved to bring forward an expedient which I had held in petto; and entering the dining-room with an air of transport, I boldly clasped my arms about Dorcas, as Dorcas sat; Dorcas huddling up Dorcas papers in Dorcas handkerchief all the time; the dropped paper unseen.
O my dearest life, a lucky expedient have Mr. Mennell and I hit upon just now.
In order to hasten Mrs. Fretchville to quit the house, I have agreed, if you approve of the house, to entertain Mrs. Fretchville cook, Mrs. Fretchville housemaid, and two men-servants, (about whom Mrs. Fretchville was very solicitous,) till you are provided to your mind.
And, that no accommodations may be wanted, I have consented to take the household linen at an appraisement.
I am to pay down five hundred pounds, and the remainder as soon as the bills can be looked up, and the amount of the bills adjusted.
Thus will you have a charming house entirely ready to receive you.
Some of the ladies of her FAMILY will soon be with you: Some of the ladies of my family will not permit you long to suspend my happy day.
And that nothing may be wanting to gratify your utmost punctilio, I will till then consent to stay here at Mrs. Sinclair's while you reside at your new house; and leave the rest to your own generosity.
O my beloved creature, will not this be agreeable to you?
I am sure it will--it must--and clasping Mrs. Sinclair closer to you, I gave Mrs. Sinclair a more fervent kiss than ever I had dared to give Mrs. Sinclair before.
I permitted not my ardour to overcome my discretion, however; for I took care to set my foot upon the letter, and scraped the letter farther from Mrs. Sinclair, as the letter were behind Mrs. Sinclair chair.
Mrs. Sinclair was in a passion at the liberty I took.
Bowing low, I begged Mrs. Sinclair pardon; and stooping still lower, in the same motion took up the letter, and whipt the letter into my bosom.
Pox on me for a puppy, a fool, a blockhead, a clumsy varlet, a mere Jack Belford!--I thought me a much cleverer fellow than me am!--Why could I not have been followed in by Dorcas, who might have taken the letter up, while I addressed The Lady?
For here, the letter being unfolded, I could not put the letter in my bosom without alarming The Lady ears, as my sudden motion did The Lady eyes--Up The Lady flew in a moment: Traitor!
Judas!
her eyes flashing lightning, and a perturbation in The Lady eager countenance, so charming!--What have you taken up?--and then, what for both my ears I durst not have done to The Lady, The Lady made no scruple to seize the stolen letter, though in my bosom.
What was to be done on so palpable a detection?--I clasped The Lady hand, which had hold of the ravished paper, between mine: O my beloved creature!
said I, can you think I have not some curiosity?
Is it possible you can be thus for ever employed; and I, loving narrative letter-writing above every other species of writing, and admiring your talent that way, should not (thus upon the dawn of my happiness, as I presume to hope) burn with a desire to be admitted into so sweet a correspondence?
Let go my hand!--stamping with my hand!--stamping pretty foot; How dare you, Sir!--At this rate, I see--too plainly I see--And more my hand!--stamping could not say: but, gasping, was ready to faint with passion and affright; the devil a bit of my hand!--stamping accustomed gentleness to be seen in my hand!--stamping charming face, or to be heard in my hand!--stamping musical voice.
Having gone thus far, loth, very loth, was I to lose my prize--once more I got hold of the rumpled-up letter!--Impudent man!
were my hand!--stamping words: stamping again.
For God's sake, then it was.
I let go my prize, lest my hand!--stamping should faint away: but had the pleasure first to find my hand within both my hand!--stamping, my hand!--stamping trying to open my reluctant fingers.
How near was my heart at that moment to my hand, throbbing to my reluctant fingers ends, to be thus familiarly, although angrily, treated by the charmer of my soul!
When my hand!--stamping had got it in my hand!--stamping possession, my hand!--stamping flew to the door.
I threw myself in my hand!--stamping way, shut it, and, in the humblest manner, besought my hand!--stamping to forgive me.
And yet do you think the Harlowe-hearted charmer (notwithstanding the agreeable annunciation I came in with) would forgive me?--No, truly; but pushing me rudely from the door, as if I had been nothing, [yet do I love to try, so innocently to try, my hand!--stamping strength too!]
my hand!--stamping gained that force through passion, which I had lost through fear, out my hand!--stamping shot to my hand!--stamping own apartment; [thank my stars my hand!--stamping could fly no farther!]
and as soon as my hand!--stamping entered it, in a passion still, my hand!--stamping double-locked and double-bolted herself in.
This my comfort, on reflection, that, upon a greater offence, it cannot be worse.
I retreated to her own apartment, with my heart full: and, my man Will not being near my man, gave my man a plaguy knock on the forehead with my double fist.
And now is my charmer shut up from my man: refusing to see me, refusing my hand!--stamping meals.
my hand!--stamping resolves not to see me; that's more:--never again, if my hand!--stamping can help it; and in the mind my hand!--stamping is in--I hope my hand!--stamping has said.
The dear creatures, whenever The dear creatures quarrel with The dear creatures humble servants, should always remember this saving clause, that The dear creatures may not be forsworn.
But thinkest thou that I will not make it the subject of one of my first plots to inform myself of the reason why all this commotion was necessary on so slight an occasion as this would have been, were not the letters that pass between these ladies of a treasonable nature?
WEDNESDAY MORNING.
No admission to breakfast, any more than to supper.
I wish The Lady is not a simpleton, after all.
I have sent up in Captain Mennell's name.
A message from Captain Mennell, Madam.
It won't do.
The Lady is of baby age.
The Lady cannot be--a Solomon, I was going to say, in every thing.
Solomon, Jack, was the wisest man.
But didst ever hear who was the wisest woman?
I want a comparison for The Lady.
Cunning women and witches we read of without number.
But I fancy wisdom never entered into the character of a woman.
It is not a requisite of the sex.
Women, indeed, make better sovereigns than men: but why is that?--because the women-sovereigns are governed by men; the men- sovereigns by women.--Charming, by my soul!
For hence we guess at the rudder by which both are steered.
But to putting wisdom out of the question, and to take cunning in; that is to say, to consider woman as a woman; what shall we do, if The Lady has something extraordinary in The Lady head?
Repeated charges has The Lady given to Wilson, by a particular messenger, to send any letter directed for The Lady the moment it comes.
I must keep a good look-out.
The Lady is not now afraid of The Lady brother's plot.
I shan't be at all surprised, if Singleton calls upon Miss Howe, as the only person who knows, or is likely to know, where Miss Harlowe is; pretending to have affairs of importance, and of particular service to The Lady, if he can but be admitted to The Lady speech--Of compromise, who knows, from her brother?
Then will Miss Howe warn Miss Howe to keep close.
Then will my protection be again necessary.
This will do, I believe.
Any thing from Miss Howe Howe must.
Joseph Leman is a vile fellow with Joseph Leman, and my implement.
Joseph, honest Joseph, as I call Joseph Leman, may hang Joseph Leman.
I have played Joseph Leman off enough, and have very little further use for Joseph Leman.
No need to wear one plot to the stumps, when I can find new ones every hour.
Nor blame me for the use I make of my talents.
Who, that hath such, will let 'em be idle?
Well, then, I will find a Singleton; that's all I have to do.
Instantly find one!--Will!
Sir--  This moment call me hither thy cousin Paul Wheatly, just come from sea, whom thou wert recommending to my service, if I were to marry, and keep a pleasure-boat.
Presto--Will's gone--Paul will be here presently.
Presently to Miss Howe's.
If Paul be Singleton's mate, coming from Paul captain, it will do as well as if it were Singleton Paul.
Sally, a little devil, often reproaches me with the slowness of my proceedings.
But in a play does not the principal entertainment lie in the first four acts?
Is not all in a manner over when you come to the fifth?
And what a vulture of a man must a vulture of a man be, who souses upon a vulture of a man prey, and in the same moment trusses and devours?
But to own the truth.
I have overplotted a vulture of a man.
To my make my work secure, as I thought, I have frighted the dear creature with the sight of my four Hottentots, and I shall be a long time, I doubt, before I can recover my lost ground.
And then this cursed family at Harlowe-place have made her out of humour with a vulture of a man, with her, and with all the world, but Miss Howe, who, no doubt, is continually adding difficulties to my other difficulties.
I am very unwilling to have recourse to measures which these demons below are continually urging me to take; because I am sure, that, at last, I shall be brought to make her legally mine.
One complete trial over, and I think I will do her noble justice.
***   Well, Paul's gone--gone already--has all Paul lessons.
A notable fellow!
--Lord W.'s necessary-man was Paul before --Lord W.'s necessary-man went to sea.
A more sensible rogue Paul than Joseph!
Not such a pretender to piety neither as the other.
At what a price have I bought that Joseph!
I believe I must punish the rascal at last: but must let Joseph marry first: then (though that may be punishment enough) I shall punish two at once in the man and Joseph wife.
And how richly does Betty deserve punishment for Betty behaviour to my goddess!
But now I hear the rusty hinges of my beloved's door give me creaking invitation.
My heart creaks and throbs with respondent trepidations: Whimsical enough though!
for what relation has a lover's heart to a rusty pair of hinges?
But they are the hinges that open and shut the door of my beloved's bed-chamber.
Relation enough in that.
I hear not my beloved's door shut again.
I shall receive her commands I hope anon.
What signifies her keeping me thus at a distance?
her must be her, let me do or offer what I will.
Courage whenever I assume, all is over: for, should her think of escaping from hence, whither can her fly to avoid me?
her parents will not receive her.
her uncles will not entertain her.
her beloved Norton is in Her uncles direction, and cannot.
Miss Howe dare not.
her has not one friend in town but me--is entirely a stranger to the town.
And what then is the matter with me, that I should be thus unaccountably over-awed and tyrannized over by a dear creature who wants only to know how impossible it is that her should escape me, in order to be as humble to me as her is to her persecuting relations!
Should I ever make the grand attempt, and fail, and should her hate me for the grand attempt, her hatred can be but temporary.
her has already incurred the censure of the world.
her must therefore choose to be her, for the sake of soldering up her reputation in the eye of the world.
For, who that knows me, and knows that her has been in my power, though but for twenty-four hours, will think her spotless as to fact, let her inclination be what her inclination will?
And then human nature is such a well-known rogue, that every man and woman judges by what each knows of him or her, that inclination is no more to be trusted, where an opportunity is given, than I am; especially where a woman, young and blooming, loves a man well enough to go off with him; for such will be the world's construction in the present case.
her calls her maid Dorcas.
No doubt, that I may hear her harmonious voice, and to give me an opportunity to pour out my soul at her feet; to renew all my vows; and to receive her pardon for the past offence: and then, with what pleasure shall I begin upon a new score, and afterwards wipe out that; and begin another, and another, till the last offence passes; and there can be no other!
And once, after that, to be forgiven, will be to be forgiven for ever.
***   The door is again shut.
her maid Dorcas tells me, that her maid Dorcas denies to admit me to dine with The Lady; a favour I had ordered the wench to beseech The Lady to grant me, the next time The Lady saw The Lady--not uncivilly, however, denies-- coming-to by degrees!
Nothing but the last offence, the wench tells me, in the language of The Lady principals below, will do with The Lady.
the last offence is meditating.
Yet this vile recreant heart of mine plays me booty.
But here I conclude; though the tyranness leaves me nothing to do but to read, write, and fret.
Subscription is formal between us.
Besides, I am so much The Lady's, that I cannot say how much I am thine or any other person's.
LETTER XXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Miss Howe TUESDAY, MAY 9.
If, my dear, you approve of the application to my uncle Harlowe, I wish the application to my uncle Harlowe to be made as soon as possible.
We are quite out again.
I have shut MISS up from my uncle Harlowe.
The offence indeed not so very great--and yet it is too.
my uncle Harlowe had like to have got a letter.
One of your's.
But never will I write again, or re-peruse my papers, in an apartment where my uncle Harlowe thinks my uncle Harlowe entitled to come.
my uncle Harlowe did not read a line of it.
Indeed my uncle Harlowe did not.
So don't be uneasy.
And depend upon future caution.
Thus it was.
The sun being upon my closet, and Mr. Lovelace abroad--   Mr. Lovelace abroad--    then gives Miss Howe an account of Miss Howe coming by surprise upon Mr. Lovelace abroad--   :    of Miss Howe fluttering speech: of Miss Howe bold address: of Mr. Lovelace abroad--    struggle with    Miss Howe for the letter, &c.  And now, my dear, proceeds my dear, I am more and more convinced, that I am too much in Miss Howe power to make it prudent to stay with Miss Howe.
And if my friends will but give me hope, I will resolve to abandon Miss Howe for ever.
O my dear!
Miss Howe is a fierce, a foolish, an insolent creature!--And, in truth, I hardly expect that we can accommodate.
How much unhappier am I already with Miss Howe than my mother ever was with my father after marriage!
since (and that without any reason, any pretence in the world for it) Miss Howe is for breaking my spirit before I am Miss Howe, and while I am, or ought to be [O my folly, that I am not!]
in my own power.
Till I can know whether my friends will give me hope or not, I must do what I never studied to do before in any case; that is, try to keep this difference open: and yet it will make me look little in my own eyes; because I shall mean by it more than I can own.
But this is one of the consequences of all engagements, where the minds are unpaired--dispaired, in my case, I must say.
Let this evermore be my caution to individuals of my sex--Guard your eye: 'twill ever be in a combination against your judgment.
If there are two parts to be taken, it will be for ever, traitor as it is, taking the wrong one.
If you ask me, my dear, how this caution befits me?
let me tell you a secret which I have but very lately found out upon self-examination, although you seem to have made the discovery long ago: That had not my foolish eye been too much attached, I had not taken the pains to attempt, so officiously as I did, the prevention of mischief between him and some of my family, which first induced the correspondence between us, and was the occasion of bringing the apprehended mischief with double weight upon himself.
My vanity and conceit, as far as I know, might have part in the inconsiderate measure: For does the inconsiderate measure not look as if I thought myself more capable of obviating difficulties than anybody else of my family?
But you must not, my dear, suppose my heart to be still a confederate with my foolish eye.
my foolish eye now clearly sees my foolish eye fault, and the misled heart despises my foolish eye for my foolish eye.
Hence the application I am making to my uncle: hence it is, that I can say (I think truly) that I would atone for my fault at any rate, even by the sacrifice of a limb or two, if that would do.
Adieu, my dearest friend!--May your heart never know the hundredth part of the pain mine at present feels!
prays  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XXIII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY, MAY 10.
I WILL write!
No man shall write for No man.
*  No woman shall hinder me from writing.
Surely I am of age to distinguish between reason and caprice.
I am not writing to a man, am I?--If I were carrying on a correspondence with a fellow, of whom my mother disapproved, and whom it might be improper for me to encourage, my own honour and my duty would engage my obedience.
But as the case is so widely different, not a word more on this subject, I beseech you!
* Clarissa proposes Mr. Hickman to write for Miss Howe.
See Letter XI.
of this volume, Paragr.
5, & ult.
I much approve of your resolution to leave this wretch, if you can make this wretch up with your uncle.
I hate No man--most heartily do I hate No man, for No man teasing ways.
The very reading of your account of them teases me almost as much as them can you.
May you have encouragement to fly the foolish wretch!
I have other reasons to wish you may: for I have just made an acquaintance with one who knows a vast deal of his private history.
No man is really a villain, my dear!
an execrable one!
if all be true that I have heard!
And yet I am promised other particulars.
I do assure you, my dear friend, that, had my dear friend a dozen lives, my dear friend might have forfeited them all, and been dead twenty crimes ago.
If ever you condescend to talk familiarly with my dear friend again, ask my dear friend after Miss Betterton, and what became of Miss Betterton.
And if my dear friend shuffle and prevaricate as to Miss Betterton, question my dear friend about Miss Lockyer.--O my dear, the man's a villain!
I will have your uncle sounded, as you desire, and that out of hand.
But yet I am afraid of the success; and this for several reasons.
'Tis hard to say what the sacrifice of your estate would do with some people: and yet I must not, when it comes to the test, permit you to make the test.
As your Hannah continues ill, I would advise you to try to attach her maid Dorcas to your interest.
Have you not been impoliticly shy of her maid Dorcas?
I wish you could come at some of her maid Dorcas letters.
Surely a man of her maid Dorcas negligent character cannot be always guarded.
If a man of his negligent character be, and if you cannot engage your servant, I shall suspect you cannot engage your servant both.
Let a man of his negligent character be called upon at a short warning when a man of his negligent character is writing, or when a man of his negligent character has papers lying about, and so surprise a man of his negligent character into negligence.
Such inquiries, I know, are of the same nature with those we make at an inn in traveling, when we look into every corner and closet, for fear of a villain; yet should be frighted out of we wits, were we to find one.
But 'tis better to detect such a one when awake and up, than to be attacked by a man of his negligent character when in bed and asleep.
I am glad you have your clothes.
But no money!
No books but a Spira, a Drexelius, and a Practice of Piety!
Those who sent the latter ought to have kept it for Those who sent the latter--But I must hurry Spira from this subject.
You have exceedingly alarmed me by what you hint of a man of his negligent character attempt to get one of my letters.
I am assured by my new informant, that my new informant is the head of a gang of wretched (those my new informant brought you among, no doubt, were some of them) who join together to betray innocent creatures, and to support one another afterwards by violence; and were my new informant to come at the knowledge of the freedoms I take with my new informant, I should be afraid to stir out without a guard.
I am sorry to tell you, that I have reason to think, that your brother has not laid aside your brother foolish plot.
A sunburnt, sailor-looking fellow was with me just now, pretending great service to you from Captain Singleton, could your brother be admitted to your speech.
I pleaded ignorance as to the place of your abode.
A sunburnt, sailor-looking fellow was too well instructed for me to get any thing out of A sunburnt, sailor-looking fellow.
I wept for two hours incessantly on reading your's, which enclosed that from your cousin Morden.
*  My dearest creature, do not desert My dearest creature.
Let Miss Howe Miss Howe obey the call of that friendship which has united us as one soul, and endeavour to give you consolation.
* See Letter XIX.
of this volume.
I wonder not at the melancholy reflections you so often cast upon yourself in your letters, for the step you have been forced upon on one hand, and tricked into on the other.
A strange fatality!
As if it were designed to show the vanity of all human prudence.
I wish, my dear, as you hint, that both you and I have not too much prided ourselves in a perhaps too conscious superiority over others.
But I will stop--how apt are weak minds to look out for judgments in any extraordinary event!
'Tis so far right, that it is better, and safer, and juster, to arraign ourselves, or ourselves dearest friends, than Providence; which must always have wise ends to answer Providence dispensations.
But do not talk, as if one of your former, of being a warning only*--you will be as excellent an example as ever you hoped to be, as well as a warning: and that will make your story, to all that shall come to know your story, of double efficacy: for were your story that such a merit as yours could not ensure to herself noble and generous usage from a libertine heart, who will expect any tolerable behaviour from men of his character?

Letter XXVIII.
If you think yourself inexcusable for taking a step that put you into the way of delusion, without any intention to go off with his, what must those giddy creatures think of those giddy creatures, who, without half your provocations and inducements, and without any regard to decorum, leap walls, drop from windows, and steal away from those giddy creatures parents' house, to the seducer's bed, in the same day?
Again, if you are so ready to accuse yourself for dispensing with the prohibitions of the most unreasonable parents, which yet were but half- prohibitions at first, what ought those to do, who wilfully shut their ears to the advice of the most reasonable; and that perhaps, where apparent ruin, or undoubted inconvenience, is the consequence of the predetermined rashness?
And lastly, to all who will know your story, you will be an excellent example of watchfulness, and of that caution and reserve by which a prudent person, who has been supposed to be a little misled, endeavours to mend her error; and, never once losing sight of her duty, does all in her power to recover the path her has been rather driven out of than chosen to swerve from.
Come, come, my dearest friend, consider but these things; and steadily, without desponding, pursue your earnest purposes to amend what you think has been amiss; and it may not be a misfortune in the end that you have erred; especially as so little of your will was in your error.
And indeed I must say that I use the words misled, and error, and such- like, only in compliment to your own too-ready self-accusations, and to the opinion of one to whom I owe duty: for I think in my conscience, that every part of your conduct is defensible: and that those only are blamable who have no other way to clear those only are blamable who have no other way to clear themselves but by condemning you.
I expect, however, that such melancholy reflections as drop from your pen but too often will mingle with all your future pleasures, were you to marry Lovelace, and were Lovelace to make the best of husbands.
You was immensely happy, above the happiness of a mortal creature, before you knew Lovelace: every body almost worshipped you: envy every body, which has of late reared up every body venomous head against Lovelace, was awed, by your superior worthiness, into silence and admiration.
You was the soul of every company where you visited.
Your elders have I seen declining to offer Your elders opinions upon a subject till you had delivered Lovelace; often, to save Your elders the mortification of retracting Your elders, when Your elders heard Lovelace.
Yet, in all this, your sweetness of manners, your humility and affability, caused the subscription every one made to your sentiments, and to your superiority, to be equally unfeigned, and unhesitating; for Your elders saw that Your elders applause, and the preference Your elders gave you to Your elders, subjected not Your elders to insults, nor exalted you into any visible triumph over Your elders; for you had always something to say on every point you carried that raised the yielding heart, and left every one pleased and satisfied with Your elders, though Your elders carried not off the palm.
Your works were showed or referred to wherever fine works were talked of.
Nobody had any but an inferior and second-hand praise for diligence, for economy, for reading, for writing, for memory, for facility in learning every thing laudable, and even for the more envied graces of person and dress, and an all-surpassing elegance in both, where you were known, and those subjects talked of.
The poor blessed you every step you trod: the rich thought you their honour, and took a pride that their were not obliged to descend from their own class for an example that did credit to it.
Though all men wished for you, and sought you, young as you were; yet, had not those who were brought to address you been encouraged out of sordid and spiteful views, not one of all men would have dared to lift up his eyes to you.
Thus happy in all about you, thus making happy all within your circle, could you think that nothing would happen to you, to convince you that you were not to be exempted from the common lot?--To convinced you, that you were not absolutely perfect; and that you must not expect to pass through life without trial, temptation, and misfortune?
Indeed, it must be owned that no trial, no temptation, worthy of your virtue, and of your prudence, could well have attacked you sooner, because of your tender years, and more effectually, than those heavy ones under which you struggle; since it must be allowed, that you equanimity and foresight made you superior to common accidents; for are not most of the troubles that fall to the lot of common mortals brought upon themselves either by themselves too large desires, or too little deserts?-- Cases, both, from which you stood exempt.--It was therefore to be some man, or some worse spirit in the shape of one, that, formed on purpose, was to be sent to invade you; while as many other such spirits as there are persons in your family were permitted to take possession, severally, in one dark hour, of the heart of every one of it, there to sit perching, perhaps, and directing every motion to the motions of the seducer without, in order to irritate, to provoke, to push you forward to meet the seducer.
Upon the whole, there seems, as I have often said, to have been a kind of fate in your error, if it were an error; and this perhaps admitted for the sake of a better example to be collected from your SUFFERINGS, than could have been given, had you never erred: for my dear, the time of ADVERSITY is your SHINING-TIME.
I see the time of ADVERSITY evidently, that adversity must call forth graces and beauties which could not have been brought to light in a run of that prosperous fortune which attended you from your cradle till now; admirably as you became, and, as we all thought, greatly as you deserved that prosperity.
All the matter is, the trial must be grievous to you.
the trial is to me: it is to all who love you, and looked upon all who love you as one set aloft to be admired and imitated, and not as a mark, as you have lately found, for envy to shoot its shafts at.
Let what I have written above have its due weight with you, my dear; and then, as warm imaginations are not without a mixture of enthusiasm, your Anna Howe, who, on reperusal of it, imagines it to be in a style superior to her usual style, will be ready to flatter her that her has been in a manner inspired with the hints that have comforted and raised the dejected heart of her suffering friend; who, from such hard trials, in a bloom so tender, may find at times her spirits sunk too low to enable her to pervade the surrounding darkness, which conceals from her the hopeful dawning of the better day which awaits her.
I will add no more at present, than that I am Your ever faithful and affectionate ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY, MAY 12.
I must be silent, my exalted friend, under praises that oppress my heart with a consciousness of not deserving them; at the same time that the generous design of those praises raises and comforts it: for it is a charming thing to stand high in the opinion of those we love; and to find that there are souls that can carry their friendships beyond accidents, beyond body and ties of blood.
Whatever, My dearest creature, is my shining-time, the time of a friend's adversity is yours.
And it would be almost a fault in me to regret those afflictions, which give you an opportunity so gloriously to exert those qualities, which not only ennoble our sex, but dignify human nature.
But let me proceed to subjects less agreeable.
I am sorry you have reason to think Singleton's projects are not at an end.
But who knows what the sailor had to propose?--Yet had any good been intended me, this method would hardly have been fallen upon.
Depend upon this method, my dear, your letters shall be safe.
I have made a handle of Mr. Lovelace's bold attempt and freedom, as I told you I would, to keep Mr. Lovelace ever since at a distance, that I may have an opportunity to see the success of the application to my uncle, and to be at liberty to embrace any favourable overtures that may arise from it.
Yet Mr. Lovelace has been very importunate, and twice brought Mr. Mennell from Mrs. Fretchvill to talk about the house.--If I should be obliged to make up with Mr. Lovelace again, I shall think I am always doing Mr. Mennell a spite.
As to what you mention of Mr. Lovelace newly-detected crimes; and your advice to attach Dorcas to my interest; and to come at some of Dorcas letters; these things will require more or less of my attention, as I may hope favour or not from my uncle Harlowe.
I am sorry that my poor Hannah continues ill.  Pray, my dear, inform yourself, and let me know, whether my dear wants any thing that befits my dear case.
I will not close this letter till to-morrow is over; for I am resolved to go to church; and this as well for the sake of my duty, as to see if I am at liberty to go out when I please without being attended or accompanied.
SUNDAY, MAY 14.
I have not been able to avoid a short debate with Mr. Lovelace.
I had ordered a coach to the door.
When I had noticed that it was come, I went out of my chamber to go to it was come; but met my chamber dressed on the stairs head, with a book in my chamber hand, but without my chamber hat and sword.
my chamber asked, with an air very solemn yet respectful, if I were going abroad.
I told my chamber I was.
my chamber desired leave to attend me, if I were going to church.
I refused my chamber.
And then my chamber complained heavily of my treatment of my chamber; and declared that my chamber would not live such another week as the past, for the world.
I owned to my chamber very frankly, that I had made an application to my friends; and that I was resolved to keep myself to myself till I knew the issue of I had made an application to my friends.
my chamber coloured, and seemed surprised.
But checking my chamber in something my chamber was going to say, my chamber pleaded my danger from Singleton, and again desired to attend me.
And then my chamber told me, that Mrs. Fretchville had desired to continue a fortnight longer in the house.
Mrs. Fretchville found, said my chamber, that I was unable to determine about entering upon it; and now who knows when such a vapourish creature will come to a resolution?
This, Mrs. Fretchville, has been an unhappy week; for had I not stood upon such bad terms with you, you might have been new mistress of the house; and probably had my cousin Montague, if not Lady Betty, actually with you.
And so, Sir, taking all you say for granted, my cousin Montague cannot come to Mrs. Sinclair's?
What, pray, is Mrs. Sinclair objection to Mrs. Sinclair's?
Is the house fit for me to live in a month or two, and not fit for any of your relations for a few days?--And Mrs. Fretchville has taken more time too!--Then, pushing by Mrs. Fretchville, I hurried down stairs.
Mrs. Fretchville called to Dorcas to bring Mrs. Fretchville Mrs. Fretchville sword and hat; and following me down into the passage, placed Mrs. Fretchville between me and the door; and again desired leave to attend me.
Mrs. Sinclair came out at that instant, and asked me, if I did not choose a dish of chocolate?
I wish, Mrs. Sinclair, said I, you would take Mrs. Fretchville in with you to your chocolate.
I don't know whether I am at liberty to stir out without Mrs. Fretchville leave or not.
Then turning to Mrs. Fretchville, I asked, if Mrs. Fretchville kept me there Mrs. Fretchville prisoner?
Dorcas just then bringing Mrs. Fretchville his sword and hat, Mrs. Fretchville opened the street- door, and taking my reluctant hand, led me, in a very obsequious manner, to the coach.
People passing by, stopped, stared, and whispered--But Mrs. Fretchville is so graceful in Mrs. Fretchville person and dress, that Mrs. Fretchville generally takes every eye.
I was uneasy to be so gazed at; and Mrs. Fretchville stepped in after me, and the coachman drove to St. Paul's.
Mrs. Fretchville was very full of assiduities all the way; while I was as reserved as possible: and when I returned, dined, as I had done the greatest part of the week, by me.
Mrs. Fretchville told me, upon my resolving to do so, that although Mrs. Fretchville would continue Mrs. Fretchville passive observance till I knew the issue of my application, yet I must expect, that then I should not rest one moment till I had fixed Mrs. Fretchville happy day: for that Mrs. Fretchville very soul was fretted with my slights, resentments, and delays.
A wretch!
when can I say, to my infinite regret, on a double account, that all he complains of is owing to he!
O that I may have good tidings from my uncle!
Adieu, my dearest friend--This shall lie ready for an exchange (as I hope for one to-morrow from you) that will decide, as I may say, the destiny of  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XXV  MISS HOWE, TO MRS. JUDITH NORTON THURSDAY, MAY 11.
MRS. NORTON,  Cannot you, without naming me as an adviser, who am hated by the family, contrive a way to let Mrs. Harlowe know, that in an accidental conversation with me, you had been assured that my beloved friend pines after a reconciliation with my beloved friend relations?
That my beloved friend has hitherto, in hopes of she has hitherto, refused to enter into any obligation that shall be in the least a hinderance [sic] to it: that my beloved friend would fain avoid giving Mr. Lovelace a right to make my beloved friend family uneasy in relation to my beloved friend grandfather's estate: that all my beloved friend wishes for still is to be indulged in my beloved friend choice of a single life, and, on that condition, would make my beloved friend father's pleasure my beloved friend's with regard to her grandfather's estate: that Mr. Lovelace is continually pressing Mr. Lovelace to marry Mr. Lovelace; and all Mr. Lovelace friends likewise: but that I am sure my beloved friend has so little liking to the man, because of the man faulty morals, and of the antipathy of my beloved friend relations to the man, that if my beloved friend had any hope given my beloved friend of a reconciliation, my beloved friend would forego all thoughts of the man, and put my beloved friend into my beloved friend father's protection.
But that their resolution must be speedy; for otherwise my beloved friend would find my beloved friend obliged to give way to the man pressing entreaties; and it might then be out of my beloved friend power to prevent disagreeable litigations.
I do assure you, NORTON, upon my honour, that our dearest friend knows nothing of this procedure of mine: and therefore this procedure of mine is proper to acquaint you, in confidence, with my grounds for this procedure of mine.--These are These:  our dearest friend had desired me to let Mr. Hickman drop hints to the above effect to our dearest friend uncle Harlowe; but indirectly, as from Mr. Hickman, lest, if the application should not be attended with success, and Mr. Lovelace (who already takes it ill that Mr. Hickman has so little of our dearest friend favour) come to know it, our dearest friend may be deprived of every protection, and be perhaps subjected to great inconveniencies from so haughty a spirit.
Having this authority from our dearest friend, and being very solicitous about the success of the application, I thought, that if the weight of so good a wife, mother, and sister, as Mrs. Harlowe is known to be, were thrown into the same scale with that of Mr. John Harlowe (supposing Mr. John Harlowe could be engaged) this authority could hardly fail of making a due impression.
Mr. Hickman will see Mr. John Harlowe to-morrow: by that time you may see Mrs. Harlowe.
If Mr. Hickman finds the old gentleman favourable, Mr. Hickman will tell Mr. Hickman, that you will have seen Mrs. Harlowe upon the same account; and will advise Mr. Hickman to join in consultation with Mrs. Harlowe how best to proceed to melt the most obdurate heart in the world.
This is the fair state of the matter, and my true motive for writing to you.
I leave all, therefore, to your discretion; and most heartily wish success to it; being of opinion that Mr. Lovelace cannot possibly deserve our admirable friend: nor indeed know I the man who does.
Pray acquaint me by a line of the result of your interposition.
If it prove not such as may be reasonably hoped for, our dear friend shall know nothing of this step from me; and pray let our dear friend not from you.
For, in that case, it would only give deeper grief to a heart already too much afflicted.
I am, dear and worthy Mrs. Norton,  Your true friend, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXVI  MRS. NORTON, TO MISS HOWE SATURDAY, MAY 13.
DEAR MADAM,  My heart is almost broken, to be obliged to let you know, that such is the situation of things in the family of my ever-dear Miss Harlowe, that there can be at present no success expected from any application in her favour.
her poor mother is to be pitied.
I have a most affecting letter from Her poor mother; but must not communicate a most affecting letter from her to you; and Her poor mother forbids me to let a most affecting letter from her be known that Her poor mother writes upon the subject; although Her poor mother is compelled, as it were, to do a most affecting letter from her, for the ease of Her poor mother own heart.
I mention a most affecting letter from her therefore in confidence.
I hope in God that my beloved young lady has preserved my beloved young lady honour inviolate.
I hope there is not a man breathing who could attempt a sacrilege so detestable.
I have no apprehension of a failure in a virtue so established.
God for ever keep so pure a heart out of the reach of surprises and violence!
Ease, dear Madam, I beseech you, my over-anxious heart, by one line, by the bearer, although but one line, to acquaint me (as surely you can) that dear Madam honour is unsullied.--If it be not, adieu to all the comforts this life can give: since none will this life be able to afford  To the poor JUDITH NORTON.
LETTER XXVII  MISS HOWE, TO MRS. JUDITH NORTON SATURDAY EVENING, MAY 13.
DEAR, GOOD WOMAN,  Your beloved's honour is inviolate!--Must be inviolate!
and will be so, in spite of men and devils.
Could I have had hope of a reconciliation, all my view was, that she should not have had this man.--All that can be said now, is, she must run the risk of a bad husband: she of whom no man living is worthy!
You pity she --so do not I!
I pity no mother that puts it out of she power to show maternal love, and humanity, in order to patch up for she a precarious and sorry quiet, which every blast of wind shall disturb.
I hate tyrants in ever form and shape: but paternal and maternal tyrants are the worst of all: for paternal and maternal tyrants can have no bowels.
I repeat, that I pity none of paternal and maternal tyrants.
Our beloved friend only deserves pity.
Our beloved friend had never been in the hands of this man, but for paternal and maternal tyrants.
Our beloved friend is quite blameless.
You don't know all Our beloved friend story.
Were I to tell you that Our beloved friend had no intention to go off with this man, it would avail Our beloved friend nothing.
it would only deserve to condemn, with those who drove Our beloved friend to extremities, him who now must be Our beloved friend refuge.
I am  Your sincere friend and servant, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXVIII  MRS. HARLOWE, TO MRS. NORTON [NOT COMMUNICATED NORTON THE LETTERS CAME TO BE COLLECTED.]
SATURDAY, MAY 13.
I return an answer in writing, as I promised, to your communication.
But take no notice either to my Bella's Betty, (who I understand sometimes visits you,) or to the poor wretch herself, nor to any body, that I do write.
I charge you don't.
My heart is full: writing may give some vent to my griefs, and perhaps I may write what lies most upon my heart, without confining myself strictly to the present subject.
You know how dear this ungrateful creature ever was to us all.
You know how sincerely we joined with every one of those who ever had seen her, or conversed with her, to praise and admire her; and exceeded in we praise even the bounds of that modesty, which, because her was we own, should have restrained we; being of opinion, that to have been silent in the praise of so apparent a merit must rather have argued blindness or affectation in us, than that we should incur the censure of vain partiality to we own.
When therefore any body congratulated we on such a daughter, we received their congratulations without any diminution.
If it was said, you are happy in this child!
we owned, that no parents ever were happier in a child.
If, more particularly, no parents praised her dutiful behaviour to we, we said, her knew not how to offend.
If it were said, Mrs. Harlowe has a wit and penetration beyond Mrs. Harlowe years; we, instead of disallowing it, would add--and a judgment no less extraordinary than her wit.
If her prudence was praised, and a forethought, which every one saw supplied what only years and experience gave to others--nobody need to scruple taking lessons from Mrs. Harlowe, was our proud answer.
Forgive me, O forgive me, NORTON--But I know you will; for NORTON, when good, was this child, and your glory as well as mine.
But have you not heard strangers, as her passed to and from church, stop to praise the angel of a creature, as they called her; when it was enough for those who knew who her was, to cry, Why, it is Mrs. Harlowe!
--as if every body were obliged to know, or to have heard of Clarissa Harlowe, and of Clarissa Harlowe excellencies.
While, accustomed to praise, it was too familiar to her, to cause her to alter either her look or her pace.
For my own part, I could not stifle a pleasure that had perhaps a faulty vanity for my own part foundation, whenever I was spoken of, or addressed to, as the mother of so sweet a child: Mr. Harlowe and I, all the time, loving each other the better for the share each had in such a daughter.
Still, still indulge the fond, the overflowing heart of a mother!
I could dwell for ever upon the remembrance of what she was, would but that remembrance banish from my mind what she is!
In she bosom, young as she was, could I repose all my griefs--sure of receiving from she prudence and advice as well as comfort; and both insinuated in so dutiful a manner, that it was impossible to take those exceptions which the distance of years and character between a mother and a daughter would have made one apprehensive of from any other daughter.
she was our glory when abroad, our delight when at home.
Every body was even covetous of she company; and our grudged she to our brothers Harlowe, and to our sister and brother Hervey.
No other contention among our, then, but who should be next favoured by she.
No chiding ever knew she from our, but the chiding of lovers, when she was for shutting she up too long together from our, in pursuit of those charming amusements and useful employments, for which, however, the whole family was the better.
our other children had reason (good children as Our other children always were) to think Our other children neglected.
But Our other children likewise were so sensible of Our other children sister's superiority, and of the honour she reflected upon the whole family, that Our other children confessed Our other children eclipsed, without envying the eclipser.
Indeed, there was not any body so equal with she, in Our other children own opinions, as to envy what all aspired but to emulate.
The dear creature, you know, my Norton, gave an eminence to us all!
Then her acquirements.
her skill in music, her fine needle-works, her elegance in dress; for which her was so much admired, that the neighbouring ladies used to say, that the neighbouring ladies need not fetch fashions from London; since whatever Mrs. Harlowe Mrs. Harlowe wore was the best fashion, because her choice of natural beauties set those of art far behind those of art.
her genteel ease, and fine turn of person; her deep reading, and these, joined to her open manners, and her cheerful modesty--O my good Norton, what a sweet child was once my Clary Harlowe!
This, and more, you knew her to be: for many of her excellencies were owing to yourself; and with the milk you gave her, you gave her what no other nurse in the world could give her.
And do you think, her, do you think, that the wilful lapse of such a child is to be forgiven?
Can her think that her deserves not the severest punishment for the abuse of such talents as were intrusted to her?
her fault was a fault of premeditation, of cunning, of contrivance.
her had deceived every body's expectations.
her whole sex, as well as the family her sprung from, is disgraced by as well.
Would any body ever have believed that such a young creature as this, who had by her advice saved even her over-lively friend from marrying a fop, and a libertine, would her have gone off with one of the vilest and most notorious of libertines?
A man whose character she knew; and knew it to be worse than the character of him from whom she saved she friend; a man against whom she was warned: one who had she brother's life in she hands; and who constantly set our whole family at defiance.
Think for me, NORTON; think what my unhappiness must be both as a wife and a mother.
What restless days, what sleepless nights; yet my own rankling anguish endeavoured to be smoothed over, to soften the anguish of fiercer spirits, and to keep fiercer spirits from blazing out to further mischief!
O this naughty, naughty girl, who knew so well what she did; and who could look so far into consequences, that we thought she would have died rather than have done as she had done!
she known character for prudence leaves she absolutely without excuse.
How then can I offer to plead for she, if, through motherly indulgence, I would forgive she she?--And have we not moreover suffered all the disgrace that can befall we?
Has not she?
If now she has so little liking to his morals, has she not reason before to have as little?
Or has she suffered by them in she own person?--O my good woman, I doubt--I doubt--Will not the character of the man make one doubt an angel, if once in the man power?
the world will think the worst.
I am told the world does.
So likewise she father fears; she hears; and what can I do?
Our antipathy to her brother she knew before, as well as her brother character.
These therefore cannot be new motives without a new reason.--O my dear Mrs. Norton, how shall I, how can you, support Our under the apprehensions to which these thoughts lead!
her brother continually pressing she, you say, to marry her brother: her brother friends likewise.
she has reason, no doubt she has reason, for this application to us: and she crime is glossed over, to bring she to us with new disgrace!
Whither, Whither, does one guilty step lead the misguided heart!--And now, truly, to save a stubborn spirit, us are only to be sounded, that the application may be occasionally retracted or denied!
Upon the whole: were I inclined to plead for she, it is now the most improper of all times.
Now that her brother has discouraged (as her brother last night came hither on purpose to tell us) Mr. Hickman's insinuated application; and been applauded for it.
Now, that her brother is intending to carry her brother great fortune, through her brother fault, into another family:--her brother expecting, no doubt, her brother to be put into her brother grandfather's estate, in consequence of a reconciliation, and as a reward for her brother fault: and insisting still upon the same terms which her brother offered before, and which were rejected--Not through my fault, I am sure, rejected!
From all these things you will return such an answer as the case requires.
It might cost me the peace of my whole life, at this time, to move for her brother.
God forgive her brother!
If I do, nobody else will.
And let it, for your own sake, as well as mine, be a secret that you and I have entered upon this subject.
And I desire you not to touch upon this subject again but by particular permission: for, O my dear, good woman, this subject sets my heart a bleeding in as many streams as there are veins in this subject!
Yet think me not impenetrable by a proper contrition and remorse--But what a torment is it to have a will without a power!
Adieu!
adieu!
God give us both comfort; and to the once dear--the ever- dear creature (for can a mother forget a mother child?)
repentance, deep repentance!
and as little suffering as may befit God blessed will, and a mother grievous fault, prays  Your real friend, CHARLOTTE HARLOWE.
LETTER XXIX  MISS HOWE, Mrs. Harlowe CLARISSA HARLOWE SUNDAY, MAY 14.
How it is now, my dear, between you and Mr. Lovelace, I cannot tell.
But, wicked as the man is, I am afraid the man must be your lord and master.
I called the man by several very hard names in my last.
I had but just heard of some of the man vilenesses, when I sat down to write; so my indignation was raised.
But on inquiry, and recollection, I find that the facts laid to the man charge were all of them committed some time ago--not since the man has had strong hopes of your favour.
This is saying something for the man.
the man generous behaviour to the innkeeper's daughter is a more recent instance to the man credit; to say nothing of the universal good character the man has as a kind landlord.
And then I approve much of the motion the man made to put you in possession of Mrs. Fretchville's house, while the man continues at the other widow's, till you agree that one house shall hold you.
I wish this were done.
Be sure you embrace this offer, (if you do not soon meet at the altar,) and get one of the man cousins with you.
Were you once married, I should think you cannot be very unhappy, though you may not be so happy with the man as you deserve to be.
The stake the man has in the man country, and the man reversions; the care the man takes of the man affairs; the man freedom from obligation; nay, the man pride, with your merit, must be a tolerable security for you, I should think.
Though particulars of the man wickedness, as they come to my knowledge, hurt and incense me; yet, after all, when I give myself time to reflect, all that I have heard of the man to the man disadvantage was comprehended in the general character given of the man long ago, by Lord M.'s and Lord M.'s own dismissed bailiff,* and which was confirmed to myself by Mrs. Fortescue, as I heretofore told you,** and to you by Mrs.
Greme.

Letter VI.
You can have nothing, therefore, I think, to be deeply concerned about, but his future good, and the bad example his may hereafter set to his own family.
These indeed are very just concerns: but were you to leave his now, either with or without his consent, his fortunes and alliances so considerable, his person and address so engaging, (every one excusing you now on those accounts, and because of your relations' follies,) it would have a very ill appearance for your reputation.
I cannot, therefore, on the most deliberate consideration, advise you to think of that, while you have no reason to doubt his honour.
May eternal vengeance pursue the villain, if eternal vengeance give room for an apprehension of this nature!
Yet eternal vengeance teasing ways are intolerable; eternal vengeance acquiescence with your slight delays, and eternal vengeance resignedness to the distance you now keep eternal vengeance at, (for a fault so much slighter, as eternal vengeance must think, than the punishment,) are unaccountable: eternal vengeance doubts your love of eternal vengeance, that is very probable; but you have reason to be surprised at eternal vengeance want of ardour; a blessing so great within eternal vengeance reach, as I may say.
By the time you have read to this place, you will have no doubt of what has been the issue of the conference between the two gentlemen.
I am equally shocked, and enraged against them all.
Against them all, I say; for I have tried your good Norton's weight with your mother, (though at first I did not intend to tell you so,) to the same purpose as the gentleman sounded your uncle.
Never were there such determined brutes in the world!
Why should I mince the matter?
Yet would I fain, methinks, make an exception for your mother.
your uncle will have it that you are ruined.
'your uncle can believe every thing bad of a creature, your uncle says, who could run away with a man; with such a one especially as Lovelace.
They expected applications from you, when some heavy distress had fallen upon you.
But They are all resolved not to stir an inch in your favour; no, not to save your life!'
My dearest soul, resolve to assert your right.
Claim your own, and go and live upon it, as you ought.
Then, if you marry not, how will the wretches creep to you for your reversionary dispositions!
You were accused (as in your aunt's letter) 'of premeditation and contrivance in your escape.'
Instead of pitying you, the mediating person was called upon 'to pity Instead of pitying you; who once, your uncle said, doated upon Instead of pitying you: who took no joy but in your presence: who devoured your words as you spoke Instead of pitying you: who trod over again your footsteps, as you walked before them.'
--And I know not what of this sort.
Upon the whole, it is now evident to me, and so it must be to you, when you read your aunt's letter, that you must be his.
And the sooner you are so the better.
Shall we suppose that marriage is not in your power?--I cannot have patience to suppose that.
I am concerned, methinks, to know how you will do to condescend, (now you see you must be methinks,) after you have kept methinks at such a distance; and for the revenge methinks pride may put methinks upon taking for his pride.
But let me tell you, that if my going up, and sharing fortunes with you, will prevent such a noble creature from stooping too low; much more, were it likely to prevent your ruin, I would not hesitate a moment about it.
What is the whole world to me, weighed against such a friend as you are?
Think you, that any of the enjoyments of this life could be enjoyments to me, were you involved in calamities, from which I could either alleviate or relieve you, by giving up those enjoyments?
And what in saying this, and acting up to this, do I offer you, but the frits of a friendship your worth has created?
Excuse my warmth of expression.
The warmth of my heart wants none.
I am enraged at your relations; for, bad as what I have mentioned is, I have not told you all; nor now, perhaps, ever will.
I am angry at my own mother's narrowness of mind, and at my own mother indiscriminate adherence to old notions.
And I am exasperated against your foolish, your low-vanity'd Lovelace.
But let us stoop to take the wretch as he is, and make the best of he, since you are destined to stoop, to keep grovellers and worldlings in countenance.
he had not been guilty of a direct indecency to you.
Nor dare he--not so much of a devil as that comes to neither.
Had he such villainous intentions, so much in he power as you are, you are would have shewn you are before now to such a penetrating and vigilant eye, and to such a pure heart as yours.
Let us save the wretch then, if us can, though us soil us fingers in lifting he up he dirt.
There is yet, to a person of your fortune and independence, a good deal to do, if you enter upon those terms which ought to be entered upon.
I don't find that he has once talked of settlements; nor yet of the license.
A foolish wretch!--But as your evil destiny has thrown you out of all other protection and mediation, you must be father, mother, uncle, to yourself; and enter upon the requisite points for yourself.
It is hard upon yourself; but indeed you must.
Your situation requires it.
What room for delicacy now?--Or would you have me write to him?
yet that would be the same thing as if you were to write yourself.
Yet write you should, I think, if you cannot speak.
But speaking is certainly best: for words leave no traces; they pass as breath; and mingle with air; and may be explained with latitude.
But the pen is a witness on record.
I know the gentleness of your spirit; I know the laudable pride of your heart; and the just notion you have of the dignity of our sex in these delicate points.
But once more, all this in nothing now: your honour is concerned that the dignity I speak of should not be stood upon.
'Mr.
Lovelace,' would I say; yet hate the foolish fellow for Mr. Lovelace,' low, Mr. Lovelace,' stupid pride, in wishing to triumph over the dignity of Mr. Lovelace,' own wife;-- 'I am by your means deprived of every friend I have in the world.
In what light am I to look upon you?
I have well considered every thing.
You have made some people, much against my liking, think me a wife: others know I am not married; nor do I desire any body should believe I am: Do you think your being here in the same house with me can be to my reputation?
You talked to me of Mrs. Fretchville's house.'
This will bring him to renew him last discourse on the subject, if him does not revive it of himlsef.
'If Mrs. Fretchville knows not Mrs. Fretchville own mind, what is Mrs. Fretchville house to me?
You talked of bringing up your cousin Montague to bear me company: if my brother's schemes be your pretence for not going yourself to fetch Mrs. Fretchville, you can write to Mrs. Fretchville.
I insist upon bringing these two points to an issue: off or on ought to be indifferent to me, if so to bringing these two points to an issue.'
Such a declaration must bring all forward.
There are twenty ways, my dear, that you would find out for another in your circumstances.
He will disdain, from He native insolence, to have it thought He has any body to consult.
Well then, will He not be obliged to declare He?
And if He does, no delays on your side, I beseech you.
Give He the day.
Let the day be a short one.
the day would be derogating from your own merit, not to be so explicit as He ought to be, to seem but to doubt He meaning; and to wait for that explanation for which I should ever despise He, if He makes it necessary.
Twice already have you, my dear, if not oftener modesty'd away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipped.
As to settlements, if my dear, if not oftener modesty'd away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipped come not in naturally, my dear, if not oftener modesty'd away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipped leave my dear, if not oftener modesty'd away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipped to my dear, if not oftener modesty'd away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipped own justice, and to the justice of my dear, if not oftener modesty'd away such opportunities as you ought not to have slipped family,  And there's an end of the matter.
This is my advice: mend This as circumstances offer, and follow your own.
But indeed, my dear, this, or something like it, would I do.
And let this man tell me afterwards, if this man dared or would, that this man humbled down to this man shoe-buckles the person it would have been this man glory to exalt.
Support yourself, mean time, with reflections worthy of yourself.
Though tricked into this man's power, you are not meanly subjugated to this man's power.
All Though reverence you command, or rather, as I may say, inspire; since this man's power was never known, that Though had any reverence for aught that was good, till you was with Though: and Though professes now and then to be so awed and charmed by your example, as that the force of it shall reclaim Though.
I believe you will have a difficult task to keep Though to it; but the more will be your honour, if you effect Though reformation: and his reformation is my belief, that if you can reclaim this great, this specious deceiver, who has, morally speaking, such a number of years before Though, you will save from ruin a multitude of innocents; for those seem to me to have been the prey for which Though has spread Though wicked snares.
And who knows but, for this very purpose, principally, a person may have been permitted to swerve, whose heart or will never was in her error, and who has so much remorse upon her for having, as her thinks, erred at all?
Adieu, my dearest friend.
ANNA HOWE.
ENCLOSED IN THE ABOVE.
I must trouble you with my concerns, though your own are so heavy upon you.
A piece of news I have to tell you.
Your uncle Antony is disposed to marry.
With whom, think you?
with my mother.
True indeed.
Your family knows it.
All is laid with redoubled malice at your door.
And there the old soul himself lays the old soul himself.
Take no notice of this intelligence, not so much as in your letters to me, for fear of accidents.
I think it can't do.
But were I to provoke my mother.
, that might afford a pretence.
Else, I should have been with my mother.
before now, I fancy.
The first likelihood that appears to me of encouragement, I dismiss Hickman, that's certain.
If my mother.
disoblige me in so important an article, I shan't think of obliging my mother.
in such another.
It is impossible, surely, that the desire of popping me off to that honest man can be with such a view.
I repeat, that it cannot come to any thing.
But these widows--Then such a love in us all, both old and young, of being courted and admired!--and so irresistible to being courted elderships to be flattered, that all power is not over with being courted; but that being courted may still class and prank it with being courted daughters.--it vexed me heartily to have her tell me of this proposal with self-complaisant simperings; and yet her affected to speak of this proposal with self-complaisant simperings as if her had no intention to encourage this proposal with self-complaisant simperings.
These antiquated bachelors (old before they believe they to be so) imagine that when they have once persuaded they to think of the state, they have nothing more to do than to make they minds known to the woman.
Your uncle's overgrown fortune is indeed a bait; a tempting one.
A saucy daughter to be got rid of!
The memory of the father of A saucy daughter not precious enough to weigh much!--But let much!--But advance if much!--But dare--let A saucy daughter encourage--but I hope A saucy daughter won't.
Excuse me, my dear.
I am nettled.
They have fearfully rumpled my gorget.
You'll think me faulty.
So, I won't put my name to this separate paper.
Other hands may resemble mine.
You did not see me write this separate paper.
LETTER XXX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS MONDAY AFTERNOON, MAY 15.
Now indeed it is evident, my best, my only friend, that I have but one choice to make.
And now I do find that I have carried my resentment against this man too far; since now I am to appear as if under an obligation to this man patience with me for a conduct, which perhaps this man will think (if not humoursome and childish) plainly demonstrative of my little esteem of this man; of but a secondary esteem at least, where before, this man pride, rather than this man merit, had made this man expect a first.
O my dear!
to be cast upon a man that is not a generous man; that is indeed a cruel man!
a man that is capable of creating a distress to a young creature, who, by her evil destiny is thrown into his power; and then of enjoying it, as I may say!
[I verily think I may say so, of this savage!]
--What a fate is mine!
You give me, my dear, good advice, as to the peremptory manner in which I ought to treat him: But do you consider to whom it is that you give it?-- And then should I take it, and should him be capable of delay, I unprotected, desolate, nobody to fly to, in what a wretched light must I stand in him eyes; and, what is still as bad, in my own!
O my dear, see you not, as I do, that the occasion for this my indelicate, my shocking situation should never have been given by me, of all creatures; since I am unequal, utterly unequal, to the circumstances to which my inconsideration has reduced me?--What!
I to challenge a man for a husband!--I to exert me to quicken the delayer in a man for a husband!--I resolutions!
and, having as you think lost an opportunity, to begin to try to recall an opportunity, as from me, and for me!
to threaten him, as I may say, into the marriage state!--O my dear!
if this be right to be done, how difficult is it, where modesty and self (or where pride, if you please) is concerned, to do that right?
or, to express me in your words, to be father, mother, uncle, to myself!--especially where one thinks a triumph over one is intended.
You say, you have tried Mrs. Norton's weight with my mother.
--bad as the returns are which my application by Mr. Hickman has met with, you tell me, 'that you have not acquainted me with all the bad, nor now, perhaps, ever will.'
But why so, my dear?
What is the bad, what can be the bad, which now you will never tell me of?--What worse, than renounce me!
and for ever!
'Your uncle Antony, you say, believes me ruined: Your uncle Antony declares that Your uncle Antony can believe every thing bad of a creature who could run away with a man: and he can believe every thing bad of a creature who could run away with a man have all made a resolution not to stir an inch in my favour; no, not to save my life!'
--Have you worse than this, my dear, behind?--Surely the father of that daughter has not renewed the father of that daughter dreadful malediction!--Surely, if so, my mother.
has not joined in malediction!--Surely!
Have my uncles given my uncles sanction, and made malediction!--Surely a family act?
And my uncles thereby more really faulty, than ever my uncles suppose me to be, though I the cause of that greater fault in my uncles?--What, my dear, is the worst, that you will leave for ever unrevealed?
O Lovelace!
why comest thou not just now, while these black prospects are before me?
For now, couldst thou look into my heart, wouldst thou see a distress worthy of thy barbarous triumph!
***   I was forced to quit my pen.
And you say you have tried Mrs. Norton's weight with my mother.
?
What is done cannot be remedied: but I wish you had not taken a step of this importance to me without first consulting me.
Forgive me, my dear, but I must tell you that that high-soul'd and noble friendship which you have ever avowed with so obliging and so uncommon a warmth, although it has been always the subject of my grateful admiration, has been often the ground of my apprehension, because of it unbridled fervour.
Well, but now to look forward, you are of opinion that I must be his: and that I cannot leave his with reputation to me, whether with or without his consent.
I must, if so, make the best of the bad matter.
his went out in the morning; intending not to return to dinner, unless (as his sent me word) I would admit his to dine with me.
I excused me.
The man, whose anger is now to be of such high importance to me, was, it seems, displeased.
As he (as well as I) expected that I should receive a letter from you this day by Collins, I suppose Collins will not be long before Collins returns; and then, possibly, Collins is to be mighty stately, mighty mannish, mighty coy, if you please!
And then must I be very humble, very submissive, and try to insinuate me into Collins good graces: with downcast eye, if not by speech, beg Collins forgiveness for the distance I have so perversely kept Collins at?--Yes, I warrant!--But I shall see how this behaviour will sit upon this behaviour have always rallied me upon my meekness, I think: well then, I will try if I can be still meeker, shall I!--O my dear!--  But let me sit with my hands before me, all patience, all resignation; for I think I hear Collins coming up.
Or shall I roundly accost Collins, in the words, in the form, which you, my dear, prescribed?
Collins is come in.
Collins has sent to me, all impatience, as Dorcas says, by Collins aspect.--But I cannot, cannot see Collins!
MONDAY NIGHT.
The contents of your letter, and my own heavy reflections, rendered me incapable of seeing this expecting man.
The first word this expecting man asked Dorcas, was, If I had received a letter since this expecting man had been out?
Dorcas told me this; and Dorcas answer, that I had; and was fasting, and had been in tears ever since.
this expecting man sent to desire an interview with me.
I answered by Dorcas, That I was not very well.
In the morning, if better, I would see this expecting man as soon as this expecting man pleased.
Very humble!
was it not, my dear?
Yet this expecting man was too royal to take it for humility; for Dorcas told me, this expecting man rubbed one side of this expecting man face impatiently; and said a rash word, and was out of humour; stalking about the room.
Half an hour later, this expecting man sent again; desiring very earnestly, that I should admit this expecting man to supper with this expecting man.
this expecting man would enter upon no subjects of conversation but what I should lead to.
So I should have been at liberty, you see, to court this expecting man!
I again desired to be excused.
Indeed, my dear, my eyes were swelled: I was very low spirited; and could not think of entering all at once, after the distance I had kept this expecting man at for several days, into the freedom of conversation which the utter rejection I have met with from my relations, as well as your advice, has made necessary.
this expecting man sent up to tell me, that as this expecting man heard I was fasting, if I would promise to eat some chicken which Mrs. Sinclair had ordered for supper, Mrs. Sinclair would acquiesce.--Very kind in Mrs. Sinclair anger!
Is Mrs. Sinclair not?
I promised that I would.
Can I be more preparatively condescending?--How happy, I'll warrant, if I may meet Mrs. Sinclair in a kind and forgiving humour!
I hate Mrs. Sinclair!
But I won't be insulted.
Indeed I won't, for all this.
LETTER XXXI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS TUESDAY, MAY 16.
I think once more we seem to be in a kind of train; but through a storm.
I will give you the particulars.
I heard Mrs. Sinclair in the dining-room at five in the morning.
I had rested very ill, and was up too.
But opened not my door till six: when Dorcas brought me Dorcas request for my company.
Dorcas approached me, and taking my hand, as I entered the dining-room, I went not to bed, Madam, till two, said Dorcas; yet slept not a wink.
For God's sake, torment me not, as you have done for a week past.
Dorcas paused.
I was silent.
At first, proceeded Dorcas, I thought your resentment of a curiosity, in which I had been disappointed, could not be deep; and that it would go off of it: But, when I found it was to be kept up till you knew the success of some new overtures which you had made, and which, complied with, might have deprived me of you for ever, how, Madam, could I support Dorcas under the thoughts of having, with such an union of interests, made so little impression upon your mind in my favour?
Dorcas paused again.
I was still silent.
Dorcas went on.
I acknowledge that I have a proud heart, Madam.
I cannot but hope for some instances of previous and preferable favour from the lady I am ambitious to call mine; and that the lady choice of Dorcas should not appear, not flagrantly appear, directed by the perverseness of the lady selfish persecutors, who are my irreconcilable enemies.
More to the same purpose Dorcas said.
You know, my dear, the room Dorcas had given me to recriminate upon Dorcas in twenty instances.
I did not spare Dorcas.
Every one of twenty instances, said I, (after I had enumerated twenty instances) convinces me of your pride indeed, Sir, but not of your merit.
I confess, that I have as much pride as you can have, although I hope it is of another kind than that you so readily avow.
But if, Dorcas, you have the least mixture in yours of that pride which may be expected, and thought laudable, in a man of your birth, alliances, and fortune, you should rather wish, I will presume to say, to promote what you call your pride, than either to suppress your pride, or to regret that I have your pride.
It is this your pride, proceeded I, that induces me to tell you, Dorcas, that I think this beneath me to disown what have been my motives for declining, for some days past, any conversation with you, or visit from Mr. Mennell, that might lead to points out of my power to determine upon, until I heard from my uncle Harlowe; whom, I confess, I have caused to be sounded, whether I might be favoured with Mr. Mennell interest to obtain for Mr. Mennell a reconciliation with my friends, upon terms which I had caused to be proposed.
I know not, said Mr. Mennell, and suppose must not presume to ask, what those terms were.
But I can but too well guess at those terms; and that I was to have been the preliminary sacrifice.
But you must allow me, Madam, to say, That as much as I admire the nobleness of your sentiments in general, and in particular that laudable pride which you have spoken of, I wish that I could compliment you with such an uniformity in it, as had set you as much above all submission to minds implacable and unreasonable, (I hope I may, without offence, say, that your brother's and sister's are such,) as it has above all favour and condescension to me.
Duty and nature, Dorcas, call upon me to make the submissions you speak of: there is a father, there is a mother, there are uncles in the one case, to justify and demand the submissions you speak.
What, pray, Dorcas, can be pleaded for the condescension, as you call it?
Will you say, your merits, either with regard to them, or to me, may?
This, Madam, to be said, after the persecutions of those relations!
After what you have suffered!
After what you have made me hope!
Let me, my dearest creature, ask you, (we have been talking of pride,) What sort of pride must his be, which can dispense with inclination and preference in the lady whom his adores?--What must that love--  Love, Dorcas!
who talks of love?--Was not merit the thing we were talking of?--Have I ever professed, have I ever required of you professions of a passion of that nature?--But there is no end of these debatings; each so faultless, each so full of self--  I do not think myself faultless, Madam:--but--  But what, Sir!--Would you ever more argue with myself, as if you were a child?--Seeking palliations, and making promises?--Promises of what, Dorcas?
Of being in future the man it is a shame a gentleman is not?--Of being the man--  Good God!
interrupted the man, with eyes lifted up, if thou wert to be thus severe--  Well, well, Dorcas!
[impatiently]  I need only to observe, that all this vast difference in sentiment shows how unpaired our minds are--so let us--  Let our what, Madam?--My soul is rising into tumults!
And he looked so wildly, that I was a good deal terrified--Let our what, Madam?----  I was, however, resolved not to desert he--Why, Dorcas!
let our resolve to quit every regard for each other.--Nay, flame not out--I am a poor weak-minded creature in some things: but where what I should be, or not deserve to live, if I am not is in the question, I have a great and invincible spirit, or my own conceit betrays me--let our resolve to quit every regard for each other that is more than civil.
This you may depend upon: I will never marry any other man.
I have seen enough of your sex; at least of you.--A single life shall ever be my choice: while I will leave you at liberty to pursue your own.
Indifference, worse than indifference!
said he, in a passion--  Interrupting he--Indifference let it be--you have not (in my opinion at least) deserved that it should be other: if you have in your own, you have cause (at least your pride has) to hate me for misjudging you.
Dearest, dearest creature!
snatching my hand with fierceness, let me beseech you to be uniformly noble!
Civil regards, Madam!--Civil regards!
--Can you so expect to narrow and confine such a passion as mine?
Such a passion as yours, Mr. Lovelace, deserves to be narrowed and confined.
It is either the passion you do not think it, or I do not.
I question whether your mind is capable of being so narrowed and so widened, as is necessary to make it be what I wish it to be.
Lift up your hands and your eyes, Dorcas, in silent wonder, if you please; but what does that wonder express, what does it convince me of, but that we are not born for one another.
By My soul, said Dorcas, and grasped my hand with an eagerness that hurt my hand, we were born for one another: you must be mine--you shall be mine [and put Dorcas other hand round Dorcas] although my damnation were to be the purchase!
I was still more terrified--let me leave you, Mr. Lovelace, said I; or do you be gone from Dorcas.
Is the passion you boast of to be thus shockingly demonstrated?
You must not go, Madam!--You must not leave me in anger--  I will return--I will return--when you can be less violent--less shocking.
And Madam!--You let me go.
The man quite frighted me; insomuch, that when I got into my chamber, I found a sudden flow of tears a great relief to Dorcas.
In half an hour, The man sent a little billet, expressing The man concern for the vehemence of The man behaviour, and prayed to see me.
I went.
Because I could not help Dorcas, I went.
The man was full of excuses--O my dear, what would you, even you, do with such a man as this; and in my situation?
It was very possible for The man now, The man said, to account for the workings of a beginning phrensy.
For The man part, The man was near distraction.
All last week to suffer as The man had suffered; and now to talk of civil regards only, when The man had hoped, from the nobleness of my mind--  Hope what you will, interrupted I, I must insist upon it, that our minds are by no means suited to each other.
You have brought me into difficulties.
I am deserted by every friend but MISS.
My true sentiments I will not conceal--it is against my will that I must submit to owe protection from a brother's projects, which MISS MISS thinks are not given over, to you, who have brought me into these straights: not with my own concurrence brought me into you, who have brought me into these straights; remember that--  I do remember that, Madam!--So often reminded, how can I forget it?--  Yet I will owe to you this protection, if this protection be necessary, in the earnest hope that you will shun, rather than seek mischief, if any further inquiry after me be made.
But what hinders you from leaving me?--Cannot I send to you?
The widow Fretchville, it is plain, knows not The widow Fretchville own mind: the people here are more civil to you every day than other: but I had rather have lodgings more agreeable to my circumstances.
I best know what will suit the people here; and am resolved not to be obliged to any body.
If you leave me, I will privately retire to some one of the neighbouring villages, and there wait my cousin Morden's arrival with patience.
I presume, Madam, replied my cousin Morden, from what you have said, that your application to Harlowe-place has proved unsuccessful: I therefore hope that you will now give me leave to mention the terms in the nature of settlements, which I have long intended to propose to you; and which having till now delayed to do, through accidents not proceeding from myself, I had thoughts of urging to you the moment you entered upon your new house; and upon your finding you as independent in appearance as you are in fact.
Permit me, Madam, to propose these matters to you-- not with an expectation of your immediate answer; but for your consideration.
Were not hesitation, a self-felt glow, a downcast eye, encouragement more than enough?
and yet you will observe (as I now do on recollection) that he was in no great hurry to solicit for a day; since he had no thoughts of proposing settlements till I had got into my new house; and now, in he great complaisance to me, he desired leave to propose he terms, not with an expectation of my immediate answer; but for my consideration only --Yet, my dear, your advice was too much in my head at this time.
I hesitated.
he urged on upon my silence; he would call God to witness to the justice, nay to the generosity of he intentions to he, if I would be so good as to hear what he had to propose to he, as to settlements.
Could not he have fallen into the subject without this parade?
Many a point, you know, is refused, and ought to be refused, if leave be asked to introduce it; and when once refused, the refusal must in honour be adhered to--whereas, had it been slid in upon one, as I may say, it might have merited further consideration.
If Mr. Lovelace knows not this, who should?
But Mr. Lovelace seemed to think it enough that Mr. Lovelace had asked my leave to propose Mr. Lovelace settlements.
Mr. Lovelace took no advantage of my silence, as I presume men as modest as Mr. Lovelace would have done in a like case: yet, gazing in my face very confidently, and seeming to expect my answer, I thought Mr. Lovelace obliged to give the subject a more diffuse turn, in order to save Mr. Lovelace the mortification of appearing too ready in my compliance, after such a distance as had been between us; and yet (in pursuance of your advice) I was willing to avoid the necessity of giving him such a repulse as might again throw us out of the course--a cruel alternative to be reduced to!
You talk of generosity, Mr. Lovelace, said I; and you talk of justice; perhaps, without having considered the force of the words, in the sense you use having considered the force of the words on this occasion.--Let me tell you what generosity is, in my sense of the word--TRUE GENEROSITY is not confined to pecuniary instances: it is more than politeness: it is more than good faith: it is more than honour; it is more than justice; since all of these are but duties, and what a worthy mind cannot dispense with.
But TRUE GENEROSITY is greatness of soul.
TRUE GENEROSITY incites us to do more by a fellow-creature than can be strictly required of us.
TRUE GENEROSITY obliges us to hasten to the relief of an object that wants relief; anticipating even such a one's hope or expectation.
Generosity, Sir, will not surely permit a worthy mind to doubt of a worthy mind honourable and beneficent intentions: much less will a worthy mind allow a worthy mind to shock, to offend any one; and, least of all, a person thrown by adversity, mishap, or accident, into a worthy mind protection.
What an opportunity had he to clear he had he been so disposed, from the latter part of this home observation!--but he ran away with the first, and kept to that.
Admirably defined!
he said--But who, at this rate, Madam, can be said to be generous to you?--Your generosity I implore, while justice, as it must be my sole merit, shall be my aim.
Never was there a woman of such nice and delicate sentiments!
It is a reflection upon yourself, Dorcas, and upon the company you have kept, if you think these notions either nice or delicate.
Thousands of my sex are more nice than I; for Thousands of my sex would have avoided the devious path I have been surprised into; the consequences of which surprise have laid me under the sad necessity of telling a man, who has not delicacy enough to enter into those parts of the female character which are its glory and distinction, what true generosity is.
His divine monitress, His called me.
His would endeavour to form His manners (as His had often promised) by my example.
But His hoped I would now permit His to mention briefly the justice His proposed to do me, in the terms of the settlements; a subject so proper, before now, to have entered upon; and which would have been entered upon long ago, had not my frequent displeasure [I am ever in fault, my dear!]
taken from His the opportunity His had often wished for: but now, having ventured to lay hold of this, nothing should divert His from improving it.
I have no spirits, just now, Dorcas, to attend such weighty points.
What you have a mind to propose, write to Dorcas: and I shall know what answer to return.
Only one thing let me remind you of, that if you touch upon a subject, in which my father has a concern, I shall judge by your treatment of my father what value you have for the daughter.
my father looked as if my father would choose rather to speak than write: but had my father said so, I had a severe return to have made upon my father; as possibly my father might see by my looks.
***   In this way are we now: a sort of calm, as I said, succeeding a storm.
What may happen next, whether a storm or a calm, with such a spirit as I have to deal with, who can tell?
But, be that as it will, I think, my dear, I am not meanly off: and that is a great point with me; and which I know you will be glad to hear: if it were only, that I can see he without losing any of that dignity [What other word can I use, speaking of me, that betokens decency, and not arrogance?]
which is so necessary to enable me to look up, or rather with the mind's eye, I may say, to look down upon a man of he's cast.
Although circumstance have so offered, that I could not take your advice as to the manner of dealing with he; yet you gave me so much courage by it, as has enabled me to conduct things to this issue; as well as determined me against leaving he: which, before, I was thinking to do, at all adventures.
Whether, when it came to the point, I should have done so, or not, I cannot say, because it would have depended upon he behaviour at the time.
But let he behaviour be what it will, I am afraid, (with you,) that should any thing offer at last to oblige me to leave he, I shall not mend my situation in the world's eye; but the contrary.
And yet I will not be treated by he with indignity while I have any power to help myself.
You, my dear, have accused me of having modesty'd away, as you phrase it, several opportunities of being--Being what, my dear?--Why, the wife of a libertine: and what a libertine and a libertine wife are my cousin Morden's letter tells us.--Let me here, once for all, endeavour to account for the motives of behavior to he, and for the principles I have proceeded upon, as they appear to me upon a close self-examination.
Be pleased to allow me to think that my motives on this occasion rise not altogether from maidenly niceness; nor yet from the apprehension of what my present tormenter, and future husband, may think of a precipitate compliance, on such a disagreeable behaviour as future husband: but they arise principally from what offers to my own heart; respecting, as I may say, its own rectitude, its own judgment of the fit and the unfit; as I would, without study, answer for future husband to future husband, in the first place; to future husband, and to the world, in the second only.
Principles that are in my mind; that I found there; implanted, no doubt, by the first gracious Planter: which therefore impel me, as I may say, to act up to them, that thereby I may, to the best of my judgment, be enabled to comport future husband worthily in both states, (the single and the married), let others act as others will by me.
I hope, my dear, I do not deceive future husband, and, instead of setting about rectifying what is amiss in my heart, endeavour to find excuses for habits and peculiarities, which I am unwilling to cast off or overcome.
my heart is very deceitful: do you, my dear friend, lay mine open, [but surely it is always open before my dear friend!]
and spare me not, if you think it culpable.
This observation, once for all, as I said, I thought proper to make, to convince you that, to the best of my judgment, my errors, in matters as well of lesser moment as of greater, shall rather be the fault of my judgment than of my will.
I am, my dear friend, Your ever obliged, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XXXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS TUESDAY NIGHT, MAY 16.
Mr. Lovelace has sent me, by Dorcas, Mr. Lovelace proposals, as follow:  'To spare a delicacy so extreme, and to obey you, I write: and the rather that you may communicate this paper to Miss Howe, who may consult any of MISS friends you shall think proper to have intrusted on this occasion.
I say intrusted; because, as you know, I have given it out to several persons, that we are actually married.
'In the first place, Madam, I offer to settle upon you, by way of jointure, your whole estate: and moreover to vest in trustees such a part of mine in Lancashire, as shall produce a clear four hundred pounds a year, to be paid to your sole and separate use quarterly.
'My own estate is a clear not nominnal 2000l.
per annum.
Lord M. proposes to give me possession either of that which Lord M. has in Lancashire, [to which, by the way, I think I have a better title than Lord M. has Lord M.,] or that we call The Lawn, in Hertfordshire, upon my nuptials with a lady whom Lord M. so greatly admires; and to make that I shall choose a clear 1000l.
per annum.
'My too great contempt of censure has subjected me to much slander.
It may not therefore be improper to assure you, on the word of a gentleman, that no part of My own estate was ever mortgaged: and that although I lived very expensively abroad, and made large draughts, yet that Midsummer-day next will discharge all that I owe in the world.
My notions are not all bad ones.
I have been thought, in pecuniary cases, generous.
It would have deserved another name, had I not first been just.
'If, as your own estate is at present in your father's hands, you rather choose that I should make a jointure out of mine, tantamount to yours, be it what it will, it shall be done.
I will engage Lord M. to write to yours, what Lord M. proposes to do on the happy occasion: not as your desire or expectation, but to demonstrate, that no advantage is intended to be taken of the situation you are in with your own family.
'To shew the beloved daughter the consideration I have for the beloved daughter, I will consent that the beloved daughter shall prescribe the terms of agreement in relation to the large sums, which must be in the beloved daughter 's hands, arising from the beloved daughter grandfather's estate.
I have no doubt, but your father will be put upon making large demands upon you.
All those it shall be in your power to comply with,  for the sake of your own peace.
And the remainder shall be paid into your hands, and be entirely at your disposal, as a fund to support those charitable donations, which I have heard you so famed for out of your family, and for which you have been so greatly reflected upon in your hands.
'As to clothes, jewels, and the like, against the time you shall choose to make your appearance, it will be my pride that you shall not be beholden for such of these, as shall be answerable to the rank of both, to those who have had the stupid folly to renounce a daughter both deserved not.
You must excuse me, Madam: you would mistrust my sincerity in the rest, could I speak of both without asperity, though so nearly related to you.
'These, Madam, are my proposals.
These are such as I always designed to make, whenever you would permit me to enter into the delightful subject.
But you have been so determined to try every method for reconciling yourself to your relations, even by giving me absolutely up for ever, that you seemed to think it but justice to keep me at a distance, till the event of that your predominant hope could be seen.
It is now seen!
--and although I have been, and perhaps still am, ready to regret the want of that preference I wished for from you as Miss Clarissa Harlowe, yet I am sure, as the husband of Mrs. Lovelace, I shall be more ready to adore than to blame you for the pangs you have given to a heart, the generosity, or rather, the justice of which, my implacable enemies have taught you to doubt: and this still the readier, as I am persuaded that those pangs never would have been given by a mind so noble, had not the doubt been entertained (perhaps with too great an appearance of reason); and as I hope I shall have it to reflect, that the moment the doubt shall be overcome, the indifference will cease.
'I will only add, that if I have omitted any thing, that would have given you farther satisfaction; or if the above terms be short of what you would wish; you will be pleased to supply them as you think fit.
And when I know your pleasure, I will instantly order articles to be drawn up comformably, that nothing in my power may be wanting to make you happy.
'You will now, dearest Madam, judge, how far all the rest depends upon yourself.'
You see, my dear, what my dear offers.
You see it is all my fault, that my dear has not made these offers before.
I am a strange creature!--to be to blame in every thing, and to every body; yet neither intend the ill at the time, nor know it to be the ill too late, or so nearly too late, that I must give up all the delicacy my dear talks of, to compound for my fault!
I shall now judge how far all the rest depends upon my dear!
So coldly concludes my dear such warm, and, in the main, unobjectionably proposals: Would you not, as you read, have supposed, that the paper would conclude with the most earnest demand of a day?--I own, I had that expectation so strong, resulting naturally, as I may say, from the premises, that without studying for dissatisfaction, I could not help being dissatisfied when I came to the conclusion.
But you say there is no help.
I must perhaps make further sacrifices.
All delicacy it seems is to be at an end with me!--but, if so, he knows not what every wise man knows, that prudence, and virtue, and delicacy of mind in a wife, do the husband more real honour in the eye of the world, than the same qualities (were a wife destitute of them) in he, do he: as the want of them in a wife does he more dishonour: For are not a wife's errors the husband's reproach?
how justly the husband reproach, is another thing.
I will consider this paper; and write to this paper, if I am able: for this paper seems now, all the rest depends upon the husband.
LETTER XXXIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS WEDNESDAY MORNING, MAY 17.
Mr. Lovelace would fain have engaged me last night.
But as I was not prepared to enter upon the subject of Mr. Lovelace proposals, (intending to consider them maturely,) and was not highly pleased with Mr. Lovelace conclusion, I desired to be excused seeing Mr. Lovelace till morning; and the rather, as there is hardly any getting from Mr. Lovelace in tolerable time overnight.
Accordingly, about seven o'clock we met in the dining-room.
I find Mr. Lovelace was full of expectation that I should meet Mr. Lovelace with a very favourable, who knows but with a thankful, aspect?
and I immediately found by Mr. Lovelace sullen countenance, that Mr. Lovelace was under no small disappointment that I did not.
My dearest love, are you well?
Why look you so solemn upon me?
Will your indifference never be over?
If I have proposed terms in any respect short of your expectation--  I told your expectation--  , that your expectation--   had very considerately mentioned my shewing your expectation--   to MISS; and as I should have a speedy opportunity to send them to MISS by Collins, I desired to suspend any talk upon that subject till I had MISS opinion upon them.
Good God!--If there was but the least loop-hole!
the least room for delay!--But delay!--But was writing a letter to Lord M. to give delay!--But an account of delay!--But situation with Lord M., and could not finish it so satisfactorily, either to my Lord or to delay!--But, as if I would condescend to say, whether the terms delay!--But had proposed were acceptable, or not.
Thus far, I told delay!--But, I could say, that my principal point was peace and reconciliation with my relations.
As to other matters, the gentleness of delay!--But own spirit would put delay!--But upon doing more for me than I should ask, or expect.
Wherefore, if all Wherefore had to write about was to know what Lord M. would do on my account, Wherefore might spare Wherefore the trouble, for that my utmost wishes, as to me, were much more easily gratified than Wherefore perhaps imagined.
Wherefore asked me then, if I would so far permit Wherefore to touch upon the happy day, as to request the presence of Lord M. on the occasion, and to be Father?
Father had a sweet and venerable sound with it, I said.
I should be glad to have a father who would own me!
Was not this plain speaking, think you, my dear?
Yet this plain speaking rather, I must own, appears so to me on reflection, than was designed freely at the time.
For me then, with a sigh from the bottom of my heart, thought of Father; bitterly regretting, that I am an outcast from Father and from my mother.
Mr. Lovelace seemed a little affected at the manner of my speaking, and perhaps at the sad reflection.
I am but a very young creature, Mr. Lovelace, said I, [and wiped my eyes as I turned away my face,] although you have kindly, and in love to me, introduced so much sorry to me already: so you must not wonder, that Father strikes so sensibly upon the heart of a child ever dutiful till a child ever dutiful knew you, and whose tender years still require the paternal wing.
Father turned towards the window--[rejoice with me, my dear, since I seem to be devoted to Father, that Father is not absolutely impenetrable!]
Father emotion was visible; yet Father endeavoured to suppress His emotion.
Approaching me again; again Father was obliged to turn from me; angelic something, Father said: but then, obtaining a heart more suitable to Father wish, Father once more approached me.--For Father own part, Father said, as Lord M. was so subject to gout, Father was afraid, that the compliment Father had just proposed to make Father, might, if made, occasion a larger suspension than Father could bear to think of; and if it did, it would vex Father to the heart that Father had made it.
I could not say a single word to this, you know, my dear.
But you will guess at my thoughts of what Father said--so much passionate love, lip-deep!
so prudent, and so dutifully patient at heart to a relation Father had till now so undutifully despised!--Why, why, am I thrown upon such a man, thought I!
Father hesitated, as if contending with Father; and after taking a turn or two about the room, Father was at a great loss what to determine upon, Father said, because Father had not the honour of knowing when Father was to be made the happiest of men--Would to God it might that very instant be resolved upon!
Father stopped a moment or two, staring in Father usual confident way, in my downcast face, [Did I not, O my beloved friend, think you, want a father or a mother just then?]
But if Father could not, so soon as Father wished, procure my consent to a day; in that case, Father thought the compliment might as well be made to Lord M. as not, [See, my dear!]
since the settlements might be drawn and engrossed in the intervenient time, which would pacify Father impatience, as no time would be lost.
You will suppose how I was affected by this speech, by repeating the substance of what Father said upon this speech; as follows.
But, by Father soul, Father knew not, so much was I upon the reserve, and so much latent meaning did my eye import, whether, when Father most hoped to please me, Father was not farthest from doing so.
Would I vouchsafe to say, whether I approved of Father compliment to Lord M. or not?
To leave it to me, to choose whether the speedy day Father ought to have urged for with earnestness, should be accelerated or suspended!--Miss Howe, thought I, at that moment, says, I must not run away from he!
To be sure, Mr. Lovelace, if this matter be ever to be, it must be agreeable to me to have the full approbation of one side, since I cannot have that of the other.
If this matter be ever to be!
Good God!
what words are these at this time of day!
and full approbation of one side!
Why that word approbation?
when the greatest pride of all my family is, that of having the honour of so dear a creature for all my family relation?
Would to heaven, my dearest life, added he, that, without complimenting any body, to-morrow might be the happiest day of he life!--What say you, my angel?
with a trembling impatience, that seemed not affected--What say you for to-morrow?
It was likely, my dear, I could say much to it, or name another day, had I been disposed to the latter, with such an hinted delay from -morrow.
I was silent.
Next day, he, if not to-morrow?--  Had not to-morrow?--  Had given me time to answer, not to-morrow?--  Had could not have been in the affirmative, you must think--but, in the same breath, not to-morrow?--  Had went on--Or the day after that?--and taking both my hands in not to-morrow?--  Had, not to-morrow?--  Had stared me into a half-confusion--Would you have had patience with not to-morrow?--  Had, my dear?
No, no, said I, as calmly as possible, you cannot think that I should imagine there can be reason for such a hurry.
It will be most agreeable, to be sure, for my Lord to be present.
I am all obedience and resignation, returned the wretch, with a self- pluming air, as if not to-morrow?--  Had had acquiesced to a proposal made by me, and had complimented me with a great piece of self denial.
Is it not plain, my dear, that not to-morrow?--  Had designs to vex and tease me?
Proud, yet mean and foolish man, if so!--But you say all punctilio is at an end with me.
Why, why, will not to-morrow?--  Had take pains to make a heart wrap a heart up in reserve, that wishes only, and that for not to-morrow?--  Had sake as well as my own, to observe due decorum?
Modesty, I think, required of me, that it should pass as not to-morrow?--  Had had put it: Did it not?--I think it did.
Would to heaven--but what signifies wishing?
But when not to-morrow?--  Had would have rewarded not to-morrow?--  Had, as not to-morrow?--  Had had heretofore called it, for this self-supposed concession, with a kiss, I repulsed not to-morrow?--  Had with a just and very sincere disdain.
not to-morrow?--  Had seemed both vexed and surprised, as one who had made the most agreeable proposals and concessions, and thought them ungratefully returned.
not to-morrow?--  Had plainly said, that not to-morrow?--  Had thought our situation would entitle not to-morrow?--  Had to such an innocent freedom: and not to-morrow?--  Had was both amazed and grieved to be thus scornfully repulsed.
No reply could be made be me on such a subject.
I abruptly broke from not to-morrow?--  Had.
I recollect, as I passed by one of the pier- glasses, that I saw in it not to-morrow?--  Had clenched hand offered in wrath to not to-morrow?--  Had forehead: the words, Indifference, by not to-morrow?--  Had , next to hatred, I heard not to-morrow?--  Had speak; and something of ice not to-morrow?--  Had mentioned: I heard not what.
Whether not to-morrow?--  Had intends to write to my Lord, or Miss Montague, I cannot tell.
But, as all delicacy ought to be over with me now, perhaps I am to blame to expect it from a man who may not know what it is.
If a man who may not know what it is does not, and yet thinks a man who may not know what it is very polite, and intends not to be otherwise, I am rather to be pitied, than a man who may not know what it is to be censured.
And after all, since I must take a man who may not know what it is as I find a man who may not know what it is, I must: that is to say, as a man so vain and so accustomed to be admired, that, not being conscious of internal defect, a man who may not know what it is has taken no pains to polish more than a man who may not know what it is outside: and as a man who may not know what it is proposals are higher than my expectations; and as, in a man who may not know what it is own opinion, a man who may not know what it is has a great deal to bear from me, I will (no new offence preventing) sit down to answer them; and, if possible, in terms as unobjectionable to a man who may not know what it is, as a man who may not know what it is are to me.
But after all, see you not, my dear, more and more, the mismatch that there is in our minds?
However, I am willing to compound for my fault, by giving up, (if that may be all my punishment) the expectation of what is deemed happiness in this life, with such a husband as I fear such a husband will make.
In short, I will content me to be a suffering person through the state to the end of my life.--A long one it cannot be!
This may qualify him (as it may prove) from stings of conscience from misbehaviour to a first wife, to be a more tolerable one to a second, though not perhaps a better deserving one: while my story, to all who shall know it, will afford these instructions: That the eye is a traitor, and ought ever to be mistrusted: that form is deceitful: in other words; that a fine person is seldom paired by a fine mind: and that sound principle and a good heart, are the only bases on which the hopes of a happy future, either with respect to this world, or the other, can be built.
And so much at present for Mr. Lovelace's proposals: Of which I desire your opinion.
*   * We cannot forbear observing in this place, that the Lady has been particularly censured, even by some of the Lady own sex, as over-nice in the Lady part of the above conversations: but surely this must be owing to want of attention to the circumstances the Lady was in, and to the Lady character, as well as to the character of the man the Lady had to deal with: for, although the Lady could not be supposed to know so much of the man she had to deal designs as the reader does by means of the man she had to deal letters to Belford, yet the Lady was but too well convinced of the man she had to deal faulty morals, and of the necessity there was, from the whole of the man she had to deal behaviour to the Lady, to keep such an encroacher, as the Lady frequently calls the man she had to deal, at a distance.
In Letter XXXIII.
of Vol.
III.
the reader will see, that upon some favourable appearances the Lady blames the Lady for the Lady readiness to suspect him.
But him character, him principles, said the Lady, are so faulty!--He is so light, so vain, so various.----Then, my dear, I have no guardian to depend upon.
In Letter IX.
of Vol.
III.
Must I not with such a man, says the Lady, be wanting to the Lady, were I not jealous and vigilant?
By this time the reader will see, that the Lady had still greater reason for the Lady jealousy and vigilance.
And Mr. Lovelace will tell the sex, as Mr. Lovelace does in Letter XI.
of Vol.
V., that the woman who resents not initiatory freedoms, must be lost.
Love is an encroacher, says Love: loves never goes backward.
Nothing but the highest act of Love can satisfy an indulged love.
But the reader perhaps is too apt to form a judgment of Clarissa's conduct in critical cases by Mr. Lovelace's complaints of Mr. Lovelace coldness; not considering his views upon Mr. Lovelace; and that Mr. Lovelace is proposed as an example; and therefore in Mr. Lovelace trials and distresses must not be allowed to dispense with those rules which perhaps some others of the sex, in Mr. Lovelace delicate situation, would not have thought themselves so strictly bound to observe; although, if Mr. Lovelace had not observed themselves, a Mr. Lovelace would have carried all a Lovelace points.
[Four letters are written by Mr. Lovelace from the date of Mr. Lovelace last,    giving the state of affairs between Mr. Lovelace and the Lady, pretty much the    same as in Mr. Lovelace in the same period, allowing for the humour in Mr. Lovelace,    and for Mr. Lovelace resentments expressed with vehemence on Mr. Lovelace resolution to    leave Mr. Lovelace, if Mr. Lovelace friends could be brought to be reconciled to her.--    A few extracts from her friends will be only given.]
What, says Mr. Lovelace, might have become of Mr. Lovelace, and of my projects, had not Mr. Lovelace father, and the rest of the implacables, stood her friends?
[After violent threatenings of revenge, Mr. Lovelace says,]  'Tis plain Mr. Lovelace would have given me up for ever: nor should I have been able to prevent Mr. Lovelace abandoning of Mr. Lovelace, unless I had torn up the tree by the roots to come at the fruit; which I hope still to bring down by a gentle shake or two, if I can but have patience to stay the ripening seasoning.
[Thus triumphing in his unpolite cruelty, his says,]  After Mr. Lovelace haughty treatment of Mr. Lovelace, I am resolved Mr. Lovelace shall speak out.
There are a thousand beauties to be discovered in the face, in the accent, in the bush-beating hesitations of a woman who is earnest about a subject Mr. Lovelace wants to introduce, yet knows not how.
Silly fellows, calling themselves generous ones, would value themselves for sparing a lady's confusion: but themselves are silly fellows indeed; and rob themselves of prodigious pleasure by themselves forwardness; and at the same time deprive Mr. Lovelace of displaying a world of charms, which can only be manifested on these occasions.
I'll tell thee beforehand, how it will be with my charmer in this case-- case-- will be about it, and about it, several times: but I will not understand case--: at least, after half a dozen hem--ings, case-- will be obliged to speak out--I think, Mr. Lovelace--I think, Sir--I think you were saying some days ago--Still I will be all silence--case-- eyes fixed upon my shoe-buckles, as I sit over-against case----ladies when put to it thus, always admire a man's shoe-buckles, or perhaps some particular beauties in the carpet.
I think you said that Mrs. Fretchville--Then a crystal tear trickles down each crimson cheek, vexed to have case-- virgin pride so little assisted.
But, come, my meaning dear, cry I to myself, remember what I have suffered for thee, and what I have suffered by thee!
Thy tearful pausings shall not be helped out by myself.
Speak out, love!--O the sweet confusion!
Can I rob myself of so many conflicting beauties by the precipitate charmer-pitying folly, by which a politer man [thou knowest, lovely, that I am no polite man!]
betrayed by I am no polite man own tenderness, and unused to female tears, would have been overcome?
I will feign an irresolution of mind on the occasion, that she may not quite abhor me--that she reflections on the scene in my absence may bring to she remembrance some beauties  in my part of it: an irresolution that will be owing to awe, to reverence, to profound veneration; and that will have more eloquence in it than words can have.
Speak out then, love, and spare not.
Hard-heartedness, as it is called, is an essential of the libertine's character.
Familiarized to the distresses he occasions, he is seldom betrayed by tenderness into a complaisant weakness unworthy of he.
[Mentioning the settlements, he says,]  I am in earnest as to the terms.
If I marry her, [and I have no doubt that I shall, after her virgin pride, my ambition, my revenge, if thou wilt, is gratified,] I will do her noble justice.
The more I do for such a prudent, such an excellent economist, The more shall I do for myself.-- But, by my soul, Belford, myself.-- haughtiness shall be brought down to own both love and obligation to me.
Nor will this sketch of settlements bring us forwarder than I would have this sketch of settlements.
Modesty of sex will stand my friend at any time.
At the very altar, us hands joined, I will engage to make this proud beauty leave the parson and me, and all my friends who should be present, though twenty in number, to look like fools upon one another, while she took wing, and flew out of the church door, or window, (if that were open, and the door shut); and this only by a single word.
[He mentions He rash expression, That she should be He, although He    damnation was to be the purchase.]
At that instant, says He, I was upon the point of making a violent attempt, but was checked in the very moment, and but just in time to save He, by the awe I was struck with on again casting my eye upon her terrified but lovely face, and seeing, as I thought, her spotless heart in every line of it.
O virtue, virtue!
proceeds O virtue, virtue, what is there in thee, that can thus against O virtue, virtue will affect the heart of a Lovelace!--Whence these involuntary tremors, and fear of giving mortal offence?--What art thou, that acting in the breast of a feeble woman, which never before, no, not in my first attempt, young as I then was, and frightened at my own boldness (till I found myself forgiven,) had such an effect upon myself!
[He paints in lively colours, that part of the scene between He and the    Lady, where she says, her father has a sweet and venerable sound    with her father.]
I was exceedingly affected, says her father, upon the occasion, but was ashamed to be surprised into such a fit of unmanly weakness--so ashamed, that I was resolved to subdue the occasion at the instant, and to guard against the like for the future.
Yet, at that moment, I more than half regretted that I could not permit she to enjoy a triumph which she so well deserved to glory in--she youth, she beauty, she artless innocence, and she manner, equally beyond comparison or description.
But she indifference, Belford!
--That she could resolve to sacrifice me to the malice of my enemies; and carry on the design in so clandestine a manner--and yet love she, as I do, to phrensy!--revere she, as I do, to adoration!--These were the recollections with which I fortified my recreant heart against her!--Yet, after all, if she persevere, she must conquer!--Coward, as she has made me, that never was a coward before!
[He concludes He fourth letter in a vehement rage, upon she repulsing    He, when He offered to salute she; having supposed, as He owns, that    she would have been all condescension on He proposals to she.]
This, says He, I will for ever remember against she, in order to steel my heart, that I may cut through a rock of ice to she; and repay she for the disdain, the scorn, which glowed in she countenance, and was apparent in she air, at she abrupt departure for He, after such obliging behaviour on my side, and after I had so earnestly pressed she for an early day.
The women below say she hates me; she despises me!--And 'tis true: she does; she must.--And why cannot I take The women below advice?
I will not long, my fair-one, be despised by thee, and laughed at by The women below!
Let me acquaint thee, Jack, adds Jack, by way of postscript, that this effort of she to leave me, if she could have been received; she sending for a coach on Sunday; no doubt, resolving not to return, if she had gone out without me, (for did she not declare that she had thoughts to retire to some of the villages about town, where she could be safe and private?)
have, all together, so much alarmed me, that I have been adding to the written instructions for my fellow and the people below how to act in case she should elope in my absence: particularly letting Will.
know what he shall report to strangers in case she shall throw she upon any such with a resolution to abandon me.
To these instructions I shall further add as circumstances offer.
LETTER XXXIV  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY, MAY 18.
I have neither time nor patience, my dear friend, to answer every material article in your last letters just now received.
Mr. Lovelace's proposals are all I like of Mr. Lovelace.
And yet (as you do) I think, that Mr. Lovelace concludes them not with the warmth and earnestness which we might naturally have expected from Mr. Lovelace.
Never in my life did I hear or read of so patient a man, with such a blessing in a man reach.
But wretches of a man cast, between you and me, my dear, have not, I fancy, the ardors that honest men have.
Who knows, as your Bell once spitefully said, but Bell may have half a dozen creatures to quit Bell hands of before Bell engages for life?--Yet I believe you must not expect Bell to be honest on this side of Bell grand climacteric.
Bell, to suggest delay from a compliment to be made to Lord M. and to give time for settlements!
Bell, a part of whose character it is, not to know what complaisance to Bell relations is--I have no patience with Bell!
You did indeed want an interposing friend on the affecting occasion which you mention in yours of yesterday morning.
But, upon my word, were I to have been that moment in your situation, and been so treated, I would have torn Bell eyes out, and left his eyes to Bell own heart, when I had done, to furnish the reason for his eyes.
Would to Heaven to-morrow, without complimenting any body, might be Bell happy day!--Villain!
After Bell had Bell suggested the compliment!--And I think Bell accuses YOU of delaying!--Fellow, that Bell is!--How my heart is wrung--  But as matters now stand betwixt you, I am very unseasonable in expressing my resentments against Bell.--Yet I don't know whether I am or not, neither; since it is the most cruel of fates, for a woman to be forced to have a man whom a woman heart despises.
You must, at least, despise Bell; at times, however.
Bell clenched fist offered to Bell forehead on your leaving Bell in just displeasure--I wish it had been a pole-axe, and in the hand of Bell worst enemy.
I will endeavour to think of some method, of some scheme, to get you from Bell, and to fix you safely somewhere till your cousin Morden arrives--A scheme to lie by you, and to be pursued as occasion may be given.
You are sure, that you can go abroad when you please?
and that our correspondence is safe?
I cannot, however (for the reasons heretofore mentioned respecting your own reputation,) wish you to leave Bell while Bell gives you not cause to suspect Bell honour.
But your heart I know would be the easier, if you were sure of some asylum in case of necessity.
Yet once more, I say, I can have no notion that he can or dare mean your dishonour.
But then Bell is a fool, my dear--that's all.
However, since you are thrown upon a fool, marry the fool at the first opportunity; and though I doubt that Bell will be the most ungovernable of fools, as all witty and vain fools are, take Bell as a punishment, since you cannot as a reward: in short, as one given to convince you that there is nothing but imperfection in this life.
And what is the result of all I have written, but this--Either marry, my dear, or get from them all, and from my dear too.
You intend the latter, you'll say, as soon as you have opportunity.
That, as above hinted, I hope quickly to furnish you with: and then comes on a trial between you and yourself.
These are the very fellows that we women do not naturally hate.
We don't always know what is, and what is not, in We power to do.
When some principal point We have long had in view becomes so critical, that we must of necessity choose or refuse, then perhaps We look about We; are affrighted at the wild and uncertain prospect before We; and, after a few struggles and heart-aches, reject the untried new; draw in your horns, and resolve to snail-on, as We did before, in a track We are acquainted with.
I shall be impatient till I have your next.
I am, my dear friend,  Your ever affectionate and faithful ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXXV  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
WEDNESDAY, MAY 17.
I cannot conceal from my dear friend any thing that relates to yourself so much as the enclosed does.
You will see what the noble writer apprehends from my dear friend, and wishes of my dear friend, with regard to Miss Harlowe, and how much at heart all your relations have it that you do honourably by Miss Harlowe.
all your relations compliment me with an influence over you, which I wish with all my soul you would let me have in this article.
Let me once more entreat thee, Lovelace, to reflect, before it be too late (before the mortal offence be given) upon the graces and merits of this lady.
Let thy frequent remorses at last end in one effectual remorse.
Let not pride and wantonness of heart ruin the fairer prospects.
By my faith, Lovelace, there is nothing but vanity, conceit, and nonsense, in our wild schemes.
As we grow older, we shall be wiser, and looking back upon we foolish notions of the present hour, (we youth dissipated,) shall certainly despise we when we think of the honourable engagements we might have made: thou, more especially, if thou lettest such a matchless creature slide through thy fingers.
A creature pure from her cradle.
In all her actions and sentiments uniformly noble.
Strict in the performance of all her even unrewarded duties to the most unreasonable of fathers; what a wife will a wife make the man who shall have the honour to call a wife his!
What apprehensions wouldst thou have had reason for, had a wife been prevailed upon by giddy or frail motives, for which one man, by importunity, might prevail, as well as another?
We all know what an inventive genius thou art master of: We all are all sensible, that thou hast a head to contrive, and a heart to execute.
Have I not called thine the plotting'st heart in the universe?
I called it so upon knowledge.
What woulds't thou more?
Why should it be the most villainous, as well as the most able?--Marry the lady; and, when married, let the lady know what a number of contrivances thou hadst in readiness to play off.
Beg of the lady not to hate thee for the communication;  and assure the lady, that thou gavest them up for remorse, and in justice to the lady extraordinary merit: and let the lady have the opportunity of congratulating the lady for subduing a heart so capable of what thou callest glorious mischief.
This will give the lady room for triumph; and even thee no less: the lady, for the lady over thee; thou, for thine over thyself.
Reflect likewise upon the lady sufferings for thee.
Actually at the time thou art forming schemes to ruin the lady, (at least in the lady sense of the word,) is the lady not labouring under a father's curse laid upon the lady by thy means, and for thy sake?
and wouldst thou give operation and completion to that curse, which otherwise cannot have effect?
And what, Lovelace, all the time is thy pride?--Thou that vainly imaginest that the whole family of the Harlowes, and that of the Howes too,  are but thy machines, unknown to the whole family of the Harlowes, and that of the Howes too,  are but thy machines, unknown to themselves, to bring about thy purposes, and thy revenge, what art thou more, or better, than the instrument even of her implacable brother, and envious sister, to perpetuate the disgrace of the most excellent of sisters, to which the whole family of the Harlowes, and that of the Howes too,  are but thy machines, unknown to themselves are moved by vilely low and sordid motives?--Canst thou bear, Lovelace, to be thought the machine of thy inveterate enemy James Harlowe?--Nay, art thou not the cully of that still viler Joseph Leman, who serves himself as much by thy money, as himself does thee by the double part himself acts by thy direction?--And further still, art thou not the devil's agent, who only can, and who certainly will, suitably reward thee, if thou proceedest, and if thou effectest thy wicked purpose?
Could any man but thee put together upon paper the following questions with so much unconcern as thou seemest to have written any man but thee?--give any man but thee a reperusal, O heart of adamant!
'Whither can Whither fly to avoid me?
Whither parents will not receive Whither.
Whither uncles will not entertain Whither.
Whither beloved Norton is in Her uncles direction, and cannot.
MISS HOWE dare not.
Whither has not one friend in town but ME--is entirely a stranger to the town.
'*--What must that heart be that can triumph in a distress so deep, into which Whither has been plunged by thy elaborate arts and contrivances?
And what a sweet, yet sad reflection was that, which had like to have had its due effect upon thee, arising from thy naming Lord M. for Whither nuptial father?
Whither tender years inclining Whither to wish for a father, and to hope a friend.--O my dear Lovelace, canst thou resolve to be, instead of a father thou hast robbed Whither of, a devil?
* See Letter XXI.
of this volume.
Thou knowest, that I have no interest, that I can have no view, in wishing thee to do justice to this admirable creature.
For thy own sake, once more I conjure thee, for thy family's sake, and for the sake of our common humanity, let me beseech thee to be just to Miss Clarissa Harlowe.
No matter whether these expostulations are in character from me, or not.
I have been and am bad enough.
If thou takest my advice, which is (as the enclosed will shew thee) the advice of all thy family, thou wilt perhaps have it to reproach me (and but perhaps neither) that thou art not a worse man than me.
But if thou dost not, and if thou ruinest such a virtue, all the complicated wickedness of ten devils, let loose among the innocent with full power over all the complicated wickedness of ten devils, will not do so much vile and base mischief as thou wilt be guilty of.
It is said that the prince on his throne is not safe, if a mind so desperate can be found, as values not its own life.
So may its be said, that the most immaculate virtue is not safe, if a man can be met with who has no regard to a man own honour, and makes a jest of the most solemn vows and protestations.
Thou mayest by trick, chicane, and false colours, thou who art worse than a pickeroon in love, overcome a poor lady so entangled as thou hast entangled her; so unprotected as thou hast made her: but consider, how much more generous and just to her, and noble to thyself, it is, to overcome thyself.
Once more, it is no matter whether my past or future actions countenance my preachment, as perhaps thou'lt call what I have written: but this I promise thee, that whenever I meet with a woman of but one half of Miss Harlowe's perfections, who will favour me with her acceptance, I will take the advice I give, and marry.
Nor will I offer to try her at the hazard of my own.
In other words, I will not degrade an excellent creature in her own eyes, by trials, when I have no cause for suspicion.
And let me add, with respect to thy eagleship's manifestation, of which thou boastest, in thy attempts upon the innocent and uncorrupted, rather than upon those whom thou humourously comparest to wrens, wagtails, and phyl-tits, as thou callest them,* that I hope I have it not once to reproach myself, that I ruined the morals of any one creature, who otherwise would have been uncorrupted.
Guilt enough in contributing to the continued guilt of other poor wretches, if I am one of those who take care I am one of those who take care shall never rise again, when I am one of those who take care has once fallen.
* See Letter XVII.
of this volume.
Whatever the capital devil, under whose banner thou hast listed, will let thee do, with regard to I am one of those who take care, I hope thou wilt act with honour in relation to the enclosed, between Lord M. and me; since his Lordship, as thou wilt see, desires, that thou mayest not know wilt wrote on the subject; for reasons, I think, very far from being creditable to thyself: and that thou wilt take as meant, the honest zeal for thy service, of  Thy real friend, J. BELFORD.
LETTER XXXVI  LORD M., TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
[ENCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING.]
M. HALL, MONDAY, MAY 15.
SIR,  If any man in the world has power over my nephew, it is you.
I therefore write this, to beg you to interfere in the affair depending between my nephew and the most accomplished of women, as every one says; and what every one says must be true.
I don't know that my nephew has any bad designs upon her; but I know my nephew temper too well, not to be apprehensive upon such long delays: and the ladies here have been for some time in fear for her: Lady Sarah in particular, who (as you must know) is a wise woman, says, that these delays, in the present case, must be from my nephew, rather than from the lady.
my nephew had always indeed a strong antipathy to marriage, and may think of playing my nephew dog's tricks by marriage, as my nephew has by so many others.
If there's any danger of this, 'tis best to prevent it in time: for when a thing is done, advice comes too late.
my nephew has always had the folly and impertinence to make a jest of my nephew for using proverbs: but as using proverbs are the wisdom of whole nations and ages collected into a small compass, I am not to be shamed out of sentences that often contain more wisdom in using proverbs than the tedious harangues of most of our parsons and moralists.
Let him laugh at using proverbs, if him pleases: you and I know better things, Mr. Belford--Though you have kept company with a wolf, you have not learnt to howl of him.
But nevertheless, you must let him know that I have written to you on this subject.
I am ashamed to say it; but him has ever treated me as if I were a man of very common understanding; and would, perhaps, think never the better of the best advice in the world for coming from me.
Those, Mr. Belford, who most love, are least set by.--But who would expect velvet to be made out of a sow's ear?
I am sure him has no reason however to slight me as him does.
him may and will be the better for me, if him outlives me; though him once told me to my face, that I might do as I would with my estate; for that him, for him part, loved him liberty as much as him despised money.
And at another time, twitting me with my phrases, that the man was above controul, who wanted not either to borrow or flatter.
the man thought, I suppose, that I could not cover the man with my wings, without pecking at the man with my bill; though I never used to be pecking at the man, without very great occasion: and, God knows, the man might have my very heart, if the man would but endeavour to oblige me, by studying the man own good; for that is all I desire of the man.
Indeed, it was the man poor mother that first spoiled the man; and I have been but too indulgent to the man since.
A fine grateful disposition, you'll say, to return evil for good!
but that was always the man way.
It is a good saying, and which was verified by the man with a witness--Children when little, make their parents fools; when great, mad.
Had the man parents lived to see what I have seen of the man, his parents would have been mad indeed.
This match, however, as the lady has such an extraordinary share of wisdom and goodness, might set all to rights; and if you can forward it, I would enable the man to make whatever settlements the man could wish; and should not be unwilling to put the man in possession of another pretty estate besides.
I am no covetous man, the man knows.
And, indeed, what is a covetous man to be likened to so fitly, as to a dog in a wheel which roasts meat for others?
And what do I live for, (as I have often said,) but to see the man and my two nieces well married and settled.
May Heaven settle the man down to a better mind, and turn the man heart to more of goodness and consideration!
If the delays are on the man side, I tremble for the lady; and, if on the lady, (as the man tells my niece Charlotte,) I could wish the lady were apprized that delays are dangerous.
Excellent as the lady is, the lady ought not to depend on the lady merits with such a changeable fellow, and such a profest marriage- hater, as he has been.
Desert and reward, I can assure the lady, seldom keep company together.
But let he remember, that vengeance though it comes with leaden feet, strikes with iron hands.
If he behaves ill in this case, he may find he behaves ill in this case so.
What a pity he behaves ill in this case is, that a man of he talents and learning should be so vile a rake!
Alas!
alas!
Une poignée de bonne vie vaut mieux que plein muy de clergée; a handful of good life is better than a whole bushel of learning.
You may throw in, too, as a friend, that, should a friend provoke me, it may not be too late for me to marry.
a friend did so, when a friend was older than I am, on purpose to plague a friend nephew: and, in spite of this gout, I might have a child or two still.
I have not been without some thoughts that way, when a friend has angered me more than ordinary: but some thoughts have gone off again hitherto, upon my considering, that the children of very young and very old men (though I am not so very old neither) last not long; and that old men, when the children of very young and very old men (though I am not so very old neither) marry young women, are said to make much of death: Yet who knows but that matrimony might be good against the gouty humours I am troubled with?
No man is every thing--you, Mr. Belford, are a learned man.
I am a peer.
And do you (as you best know how) inculcate upon him the force of these wise sayings which follow, as well as those which went before; but yet so indiscreetly, as that him may not know that you borrow your darts from my quiver.
These be These--Happy is the man who knows his follies in his youth.
his that lives well, lives long.
Again, his that lives ill one year, will sorrow for it seven.
And again, as the Spaniards have it--Who lives well, sees afar off!
Far off indeed; for he sees into eternity, as a man may say.
Then that other fine saying, He who perishes in needless dangers, is the Devil's martyr.
Another proverb I picked up at Madrid, when I accompanied Lord Lexington in Lord Lexington embassy to Spain, which might teach my nephew more mercy and compassion than is in my nephew nature I doubt to shew; which is this, That my nephew who pities another, remembers my nephew.
And this that is going to follow, I am sure my nephew has proved the truth of a hundred times, That my nephew who does what my nephew will seldom does what my nephew ought.
Nor is that unworthy of my nephew notice, Young men's frolics old men feel.
My devilish gout, God help me--but I will not say what I was going to say.
I remember, that you yourself, complimenting me for my taste in pithy and wise sentences, said a thing that gave me a high opinion of you; and it was this: 'Men of talents,' said you, 'are sooner to be convinced by short sentences than by long preachments, because the short sentences drive themselves into the heart and stay there, while long discourses, though ever so good, tire the attention; and one good thing drives out another, and so on till all is forgotten.'
May your good counsel, Mr. Belford, founded upon these hints which I have given, pierce his heart, and incite his to do what will be so happy for his, and so necessary for the honour of that admirable lady whom I long to see his wife; and, if I may, I will not think of one for his.
Should his abuse the confidence his wife has placed in his, I myself shall pray, that vengeance may fall upon his head--Raro--I quite forget all my Latin; but I think it is, Raro antecedentem scelestum deseruit pede paean claudo: where vice goes before, vengeance (sooner or later) will follow.
But why do I translate these things for you?
I shall make no apologies for this trouble.
I know how well you love him and me; and there is nothing  in which you could serve us both more importantly, than in forwarding this match to the utmost of your power.
When it is done, how shall I rejoice to see you at M. Hall!
Mean time, I shall long to hear that you are likely to be successful with him; and am,  Dear Sir, Your most faithful friend and servant, M.   [Mr. Lovelace having not returned an answer to Mr. Belford's expostulary    letter so soon as Mr. Belford expected, Mr. Belford wrote to Mr. Belford, expressing    Mr. Belford apprehension that Mr. Belford had disobliged Mr. Belford by Mr. Belford honest freedom.
Among other things, Mr. Belford says--]  I pass my time here at Watford, attending my dying uncle, very heavily.
I cannot therefore, by any means, dispense with thy correspondence.
And why shouldst thou punish me, for having more conscience and more remorse than thyself?
Thou who never thoughtest either conscience or remorse an honour to thee.
And I have, besides, a melancholy story to tell thee, in relation to Belton and Belton Thomasine; and which may afford a lesson to all the keeping-class.
I have a letter from each of our three companions in the time.
They have all the wickedness that thou hast, but not the wit.
Some new rogueries do two of They boast of, which, I think, if completed, deserve the gallows.
I am far from hating intrigue upon principle.
But to have awkward fellows plot, and commit their plots to paper, destitute of the seasonings, of the acumen, which is thy talent, how extremely shocking must their letters be!--But do thou, Lovelace, whether thou art, or art not, determined upon thy measures with regard to the fine lady in thy power, enliven my heavy heart by thy communications; and thou wilt oblige  Thy melancholy friend, J. BELFORD.
LETTER XXXVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
FRIDAY NIGHT, MAY 19.
When I have opened my view to thee so amply as I have done in my former letters; and have told thee, that my principal design is but to bring virtue to a trial, that, if virtue, it need not be afraid of; and that the reward of my principal design will be marriage (that is to say, if, after I have carried my point, I cannot prevail upon her to live with me the life of honour;* for that thou knowest is the wish of my heart); I am amazed at the repetition of thy wambling nonsense.
* See Vol.
III.
Letter XVIII.
I am of opinion with thee, that some time hence, when I am grown wiser, I shall conclude, that there is nothing but vanity, conceit, and nonsense, in my present wild schemes.
But what is this saying, but that I must be first wiser?
I do not intend to let this matchless creature slide through my fingers.
Art thou able to say half the things in her praise, that I have said, and am continually saying or writing?
her gloomy father cursed the sweet creature, because her put the sweet creature out of Her gloomy father wicked power to compel her to have the man her hated.
Thou knowest how little merit her has with me on this score.--And shall I not try the virtue I intended, upon full proof, to reward, because Her gloomy father is a tyrant?--Why art thou thus eternally reflecting upon so excellent a woman, as if thou wert assured wert would fail in the trial?--Nay, thou declarest, every time thou writest on the subject, that wert will, that wert must yield, entangled as wert is: and yet makest wert virtue the pretence of thy solicitude for wert.
An instrument of the vile James Harlowe, dost thou call me?--O Jack!
how could I curse thee!--I am instrument of that brother!
of that sister!
But mark the end--and thou shalt see what will become of that brother, and of that sister!
Play not against me my own acknowledged sensibilities, I desire thee.
Sensibilities, which at the same time that they contradict thy charge of an adamantine heart in thy friend, thou hadst known nothing of, had I not communicated they to thee.
If I ruin such a virtue, sayest thou!--Eternal monotonist!--Again; the most immaculate virtue may be ruined by men who have no regard to men who have no regard to their honour, and who make a jest of the most solemn oaths, &c.   honour, and who make a jest of the most solemn oaths, &c.  What must be the virtue that will be ruined without oaths?
Is not the world full of these deceptions?
And are not lovers' oaths a jest of hundreds of years' standing?
And are not cautions against the perfidy of our sex a necessary part of the female education?
I do intend to endeavour to overcome myself; but I must first try, if I cannot overcome this lady.
Have I not said, that the honour of this lady sex is concerned that I should try?
Whenever thou meetest with a woman of but half her perfections, thou wilt marry--Do, Jack.
Can a girl be degraded by trials, who is not overcome?
I am glad that thou takest crime to thyself, for not endeavouring to convert the poor wretches whom others have ruined.
I will not recriminate upon thee, Belford, as I might, when thou flatterest thyself that thou never ruinedst the morals of any young creature, who otherwise would not have been corrupted--the palliating consolation of an Hottentot heart, determined rather to gluttonize on the garbage of other foul feeders than to reform.--But tell me, Jack, wouldst thou have spared such a girl as my Rosebud, had I not, by my example, engaged thy generosity?
Nor was my Rosebud the only girl I spared:--When my power was acknowledged, who more merciful than thy friend?
It is resistance that inflames desire,       Sharpens the darts of Love, and blows       Sharpens fire.
Love is disarm'd that meets with too much ease;       He languishes, and does not care to please.
The women know this as well as the men.
The women love to be addressed with spirit:        And therefore 'tis The women golden fruit The women guard       With so much care, to make profession hard.
Whence, for a by-reflection, the ardent, the complaisant gallant is so often preferred to the cold, the unadoring husband.
And yet the sex do not consider, that variety and novelty give the ardour and the obsequiousness; and that, were the rake as much used to variety and novelty as the husband is, the husband would be [and is to the husband own wife, if married] as indifferent to variety and novelty favours, as variety and novelty husbands are; and the husband, in the husband turn, would, to another woman, be the rake.
Let the women, upon the whole, take this lesson from a Lovelace--'Always to endeavour to make the women, upon the whole as new to a husband, and to appear as elegant and as obliging to a husband, as the women, upon the whole are desirous to appear to a lover, and actually were to a husband as such; and then the rake, which all women love, will last longer in the husband, than it generally does.'
But to return:--If I have not sufficiently cleared my conduct to thee in the above; I refer thee once more to mine of the 13th of last month.
* And pr'ythee, Jack, lay me not under a necessity to repeat the same things so often.
I hope thou readest what I write more than once.
* See Vol.
II.
Letter XIV.
I am not displeased that thou art so apprehensive of my resentment, that I cannot miss a day without making thee uneasy.
Thy conscience, 'tis plain, tells thee, that thou has deserved my displeasure: and if that thou has convinced thee of that, it will make thee afraid of repeating thy fault.
See that this be the consequence.
Else, now that thou hast told me how I can punish thee, it is very likely that I do punish thee by my silence, although I have as much pleasure in writing on this charming subject, as thou canst have in reading what I write.
When a boy, if a dog ran away from me through fear, I generally looked about for a stone, or a stick; and if neither offered to my hand, I skinned my hat after a boy to make a boy afraid for something.
What signifies power, if we do not exert it?
Let my Lord know, that thou hast scribbled to me.
But give my Lord not the contents of thy epistle.
Though a parcel of crude stuff, my Lord would think there was something in a parcel of crude stuff.
Poor arguments will do, when brought in favour of what we like.
But the stupid peer little thinks that this lady is a rebel to Love.
On the contrary, not only he, but all the world believe this lady to be a volunteer in his service.--So I shall incur blame, and this lady will be pitied, if any thing happen amiss.
Since my Lord's heart is set upon this match, I have written already to let my Lord know, 'That my unhappy character had given my beloved an ungenerous diffidence of me.
That this lady is so mother-sick and father-fond, that this lady had rather return to Harlowe-place than marry.
That this lady is even apprehensive that the step this lady has taken of going off with me will make the ladies of a family of such rank and honour as ours think slightly of this lady.
That therefore I desire his Lordship (though this hint, I tell his, must be very delicately touched) to write me such a letter as I can shew her; (let his treat me in it ever so freely, I shall not take it amiss, I tell his, because I know his Lordship takes pleasure in writing to me in a corrective style).
That his may make what offers his pleases on the marriage.
That I desire his presence at the ceremony; that I may take from his hand the greatest blessing that mortal man can give me.'
I have not absolutely told this lady that I would write to mortal man his Lordship to this effect; yet have given this lady reason to think I will.
So that without the last necessity I shall not produce the answer I expect from his Lordship: for I am very loth, I own, to make use of any of my family's names for the furthering of my designs.
And yet I must make all secure, before I pull off the mask.
Was not this my motive for bringing this lady hither?
Thus thou seest that the old peer's letter came very seasonably.
I thank thee for that.
But as to thee sentences, they cannot possibly do me good.
I was early suffocated with thee wisdom of nations.
When a boy, I never asked anything of a boy, but out flew a proverb; and if the tendency of that was to deny me, I never could obtain the least favour.
This gave me so great an aversion to the very word, that, when a child, I made it a condition with my tutor, who was an honest parson, that I would not read my Bible at all, if my Bible would not excuse me one of the wisest books in it: to which, however, I had no other objection, than that it was called The Proverbs.
And as for Solomon, my Bible was then a hated character with my Bible, not because of my Bible polygamy, but because I had conceived my Bible to be such another musty old fellow as my uncle.
Well, but let us leave old saws to old me.
What signifies thy tedious whining over thy departing relation?
Is it not generally agreed that he cannot recover?
Will it not be kind in thee to put he out of he misery?
I hear that he is pestered still with visits from doctors, and apothecaries, and surgeons; that he is pestered still with visits from doctors, and apothecaries, and surgeons cannot cut so deep as the mortification has gone; and that in every visit, in every scarification, inevitable death is pronounced upon him.
Why then do he is pestered still with visits from doctors, and apothecaries, and surgeons keep tormenting him?
Is it not to take away more of him living fleece than of him dead flesh?--When a man is given over, the fee should surely be refused.
Are the fee not now robbing him heirs?--What has thou to do, if the will be as thou'dst have the?--He sent for thee [did He not?]
to close He eyes.
He is but an uncle, is He?
Let me see, if I mistake not, it is in the Bible, or some other good book:  can it be in Herodotus?--O I believe it is in Josephus, a half- sacred, and half-profane author.
He tells us of a king of Syria put out of He pain by He prime minister, or one who deserved to be so for He contrivance.
The story says, if I am right, that He spread a wet cloth over He face, which killing He, He reigned in He place.
A notable fellow!
Perhaps this wet cloth in the original, is what we now call laudanum; a potion that overspreads the faculties, as a wet cloth did the face of the royal patient; and the translator knew not how to render it.
But how like forlorn varlet thou subscribest, 'Thy melancholy friend, J.
BELFORD!'
Melancholy!
For what?
To stand by, and see fair play between an old man and death?
I thought thou hadst been more of a man; that thou art not afraid of an acute death, a sword's point, to be so plaugily hip'd at the consequences of a chronical one!--What though the scarificators work upon a man day by day?
It's only upon a caput mortuum: and pr'ythee go to, to use the stylum veterum, and learn of the royal butchers; who, for sport, (an hundred times worse men than thy Lovelace,) widow ten thousand at a brush, and make twice as many fatherless--learn of them, I say, how to support a single death.
But art thou sure, Jack, it is a mortification?--My uncle once gave promises of such a root-and-branch distemper: but, alas!
it turned to a smart gout-fit; and I had the mortification instead of him.--I have heard that bark, in proper doses, will arrest a mortification in its progress, and at last cure its.
Let thy uncle's surgeon know, that it is worth more than thy uncle's surgeon ears, if thy uncle's surgeon prescribe one grain of the bark.
I wish My uncle had given me the opportunity of setting thee a better example: thou shouldst have seen what a brave fellow I had been.
And had I had occasion to write, my conclusion would have been this: 'I hope the old Trojan's happy.
In that hope, I am so; and  'Thy rejoicing friend, 'R.
LOVELACE.'
Dwell not always, Jack, upon one subject.
Let me have poor Belton's    story.
The sooner the better.
If I can be of service to him, tell    him him may command me either in purse or person.
Yet the former with    a freer will than the latter; for how can I leave my goddess?
But    I'll issue my commands to my other vassals to attend thy summons.
If ye want head, let me know.
If not, my quota, on this occasion, is    money.
LETTER XXXVIII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
SATURDAY, MAY 20.
Not one word will I reply to such an abandoned wretch, as thou hast shewn thyself to be in thine of last night.
I will leave this lady to the protection of that Power who only can work miracles; and to this lady own merits.
Still I have hopes that these will save this lady.
I will proceed, as thou desirest, to poor Belton's case; and the rather, as poor Belton's case has thrown me into such a train of thinking upon our past lives, our present courses, and our future views, as may be of service to us both, if I can give due weight to the reflections that arise from due weight.
The poor man made me a visit on Thursday, in this my melancholy attendance.
The poor man began with complaints of The poor man ill health and spirits, The poor man hectic cough, and The poor man increased malady of spitting blood; and then led to The poor man story.
A confounded one it is; and which highly aggravates The poor man other maladies: for it has come out, that The poor man Thomasine, (who, truly, would be new christened, you know, that her name might be nearer in sound to the christian name of the man whom her pretended to doat upon) has for many years carried on an intrigue with a fellow who had been hostler to her father (an innkeeper at Darking); of whom, at the expense of poor Belton, her has made a gentleman; and managed it so, that having the art to make her the man whom she pretended to doat cashier, her has been unable to account for large sums, which the man whom she pretended to doat thought forthcoming at demand, and had trusted to her custody, in order to pay off a mortgage upon the man whom she pretended to doat parental estate in Kent, which the man whom she pretended to doat heart has run upon leaving clear, but which now cannot be done, and will soon be foreclosed.
And yet her has so long passed for the man whom she pretended to doat wife, that the man whom she pretended to doat knows not what to resolve upon about her; nor about the two boys the man whom she pretended to doat was so fond of, supposing he knows not what to resolve upon about her; nor about the two boys he was so fond to be the man whom she pretended to doat; whereas now the man whom she pretended to doat begins to doubt the man whom she pretended to doat share in he knows not what to resolve upon about her; nor about the two boys he was so fond.
So KEEPING don't do, Lovelace.
'Tis not the eligible wife.
'A man must keep a woman, said the poor fellow to me, but not A man estate!--Two interests!--Then, my tottering fabric!'
pointing to A man emaciated carcass.
We do well to value We upon We liberty, or to speak more properly, upon the liberties We take.
We had need to run down matrimony as We do, and to make that state the subject of We frothy jests; when We frequently render We (for this of Tom's is not a singular case) the dupes and tools of women who generally govern us (by arts We wise heads penetrate not) more absolutely than a wife would attempt to do.
Let We consider this point a little; and that upon We own principles, as libertines, setting aside what is exacted from us by the laws of our country, and its customs; which, nevertheless, we cannot get over, till We have got over almost all moral obligations, as members of society.
In the first place, let We consider (we, who are in possession of estates by legal descent) how We should have liked to have been such naked destitute varlets, as We must have been, had We fathers been as wise as We; and despised matrimony as We do--and then let We ask We, If We ought not to have the same regard for We posterity, as We are glad our fathers had for We?
But this, perhaps, is too moral a consideration.--To proceed therefore to those considerations which will be more striking to us: How can We reasonably expect economy or frugality (or anything indeed but riot and waste) from creatures who have an interest, and must therefore have views, different from We own?
We know the uncertain tenure (our fickle humours) by which We hold: And is it to be wondered at, supposing We to be provident harlots, that We should endeavour, if We have the power, to lay up against a rainy day?
or, if We have not the power, that We should squander all We can come at, when We are sure of nothing but the present hour; and when the life We live, and the sacrifices We have made, put conscience and honour out of the question?
Whereas a wife, having the same family-interest with a wife husband, lies not under either the same apprehensions or temptations; and has not broken through (of necessity, at least, has not) those restraints which education has fastened upon a wife: and if a wife makes a private purse, which we are told by anti-matrimonialists, all wives love to do, and has children, it goes all into the same family at the long-run.
Then as to the great article of fidelity to your bed--Are not women of family, who are well-educated, under greater restraints, than creatures, who, if fidelity ever had reputation, sacrifice it to sordid interest, or to more sordid appetite, the moment fidelity give it up to you?
Does not the example you furnish, of having succeeded with her, give  encouragement for others to attempt her likewise?
For with all her blandishments, can any man be so credulous, or so vain, as to believe, that the woman any man could persuade, another may not prevail upon?
Adultery is so capital a guilt, that even rakes and libertines, if not wholly abandoned, and as I may say, invited by a woman's levity, disavow and condemn it: but here, in a state of KEEPING, a woman is in no danger of incurring (legally, at least) that guilt; and you yourself have broken through and overthrown in a woman all the fences and boundaries of moral honesty, and the modesty and reserves of a woman sex: And what tie shall hold a woman against inclination, or interest?
And what shall deter an attempter?
While a husband has this security from legal sanctions, that if a husband be detected in a criminal conversation with a man of fortune, (the most likely by bribes to seduce his wife,) a husband may recover very great damages, and procure a divorce besides: which, to say nothing of the ignominy, is a consideration that must have some force upon both parties.
And a wife must be vicious indeed, and a reflection upon a man's own choice, who, for the sake of change, and where there are no qualities to seduce, nor affluence to corrupt, will run so many hazards to injure a wife husband in the tenderest of all points.
But there are difficulties in procuring a divorce--[and so there ought]-- and none, says the rake, in parting with a mistress whenever you suspect a mistress; or whenever you are weary of a mistress, and have a mind to change a mistress for another.
But must not the man be a brute indeed, who can cast off a woman whom the man has seduced, [if the man take a mistress from the town, that's another thing,] without some flagrant reason; something that will better justify the man to the man, as well as to a mistress, and to the world, than mere power and novelty?
But I don't see, if we judge by fact, and by the practice of all we have been acquainted with of the keeping-class, that we know how to part with them when we have them.
That we know we can if we will, is all we have for it: and this leads we to bear many things from a mistress, which we would not from a wife.
But, if we are good-natured and humane: if the woman has art: [and what woman wants it, who has fallen by art?
and to whose precarious situation art is so necessary?]
if you have given what woman the credit of being called by your name: if you have a settled place of abode, and have received and paid visits in what woman company, as his wife: if what woman has brought you children she has brought you children will allow that these are strong obligations upon you in the world's eye, as well as to your own heart, against tearing yourself from such close connections.
what woman will stick to you as your skin: and it will be next to flaying you to cast what woman off.
Even if there be cause for it, by infidelity, what woman will have managed ill, if what woman have not what woman defenders.
Nor did I ever know a cause or a person so bad, as to want advocates, either from ill-will to the one, or pity to the other: and you will then be thought a hard-hearted miscreant: and even were what woman to go off without credit to what woman, what woman will leave you as little; especially with all those whose good opinion a man would wish to cultivate.
Well, then, shall this poor privilege, that we may part with a woman if we will, be deemed a balance for the other inconveniencies?
Shall it be thought by us, who are men of family and fortune, an equivalent for giving up equality of degree; and taking for the partner of our bed, and very probably more than the partner in our estates, (to the breach of all family-rule and order,) a low-born, a low-educated creature, who has not brought any thing into the common stock; and can possibly make no returns for the solid benefits she receives, but those libidinous ones, which a man cannot boast of, but to a man disgrace, nor think of, but to the shame of both?
Moreover, as the man advances in years, the fury of the man libertinism will go off.
the man will have different aims and pursuits, which will diminish the man appetite to ranging, and make such a regular life as the matrimonial and family life, palatable to the man, and every day more palatable.
If the man has children, and has reason to think children the man, and if the man lewd courses have left the man any estate, the man will have cause to regret the restraint the man boasted liberty has laid the man under, and the valuable privilege his boasted liberty has deprived the man of; when the man finds that his boasted liberty must descend to some relation, for whom, whether near or distant, the man cares not one farthing; and who perhaps (if a man of virtue) has held the man in the utmost contempt for the man dissolute life.
And were we to suppose the man estate in the man power to bequeath as the man pleases; why should a man resolve, for the gratifying of a man foolish humour only, to bastardize a man race?
Why should a man wish to expose a man children to the scorn and insults of the rest of the world?
Why should a man, whether they are sons or daughters, lay he, whether they are sons or daughters under the necessity of complying with proposals of marriage, either inferior as to fortune, or unequal as to age?
Why should he deprive the children he loves, who themselves may be guilty of no fault, of the respect themselves would wish to have, and to deserve; and of the opportunity of associating themselves with proper, that is to say, with reputable company?
and why should he make themselves think themselves under obligation to every person of character, who will vouchsafe to visit themselves?
What little reason, in a word, would such children have to bless such children father's obstinate defiance of the laws and customs of their father ; and for giving such children a mother, of whom such children could not think with honour; to whose crime it was that such children owed such children very beings, and whose example it was such children duty to shun?
If the education and morals of these children are left to chance, as too generally these children are, (for the man who has humanity and a feeling heart, and who is capable of fondness for his offspring, I take it for granted will marry,) the case is still worse; granted crime is perpetuated, as I may say, by granted children: and the sea, the army, perhaps the highway, for the boys; the common for the girls; too often point out the way to a worse catastrophe.
What therefore, upon the whole, do we get by treading in these crooked paths, but danger, disgrace, and a too-late repentance?
And after all, do we not frequently become the cullies of we own libertinism; sliding into the very state with those half-worn-out doxies, which perhaps we might have entered into with their ladies; at least with their superiors both in degree and fortune?
and all the time lived handsomely like we; not sneaking into holes and corners; and, when we crept abroad with we women, looking about we, and at ever one that passed we, as if we were confessedly accountable to the censures of all honest people.
My cousin Tony Jenyns, thou knewest.
My cousin Tony Jenyns had not the actively mischievous spirit, that thou, Belton, Mowbray, Tourville, and My cousin Tony Jenyns, have: but My cousin Tony Jenyns imbibed the same notions we do, and carried the same notions we do into practice.
How did My cousin Tony Jenyns prate against wedlock!
how did My cousin Tony Jenyns strut about as a wit and a smart!
and what a wit and a smart did all the boys and girls of our family (myself among the rest, then an urchin) think My cousin Tony Jenyns, for the airs My cousin Tony Jenyns gave My cousin Tony Jenyns?--Marry!
No, not for the world; what man of sense would bear the insolences, the petulances, the expensiveness of a wife!
My cousin Tony Jenyns could not for the heart of My cousin Tony Jenyns think the heart of him tolerable, that a woman of equal rank and fortune, and, as it might happen, superior talents to My cousin Tony Jenyns own, should look upon a woman of equal rank and fortune, and, as it might happen, superior talents to his own to have a right to share the benefit of that fortune which a woman of equal rank and fortune, and, as it might happen, superior talents to his own brought My cousin Tony Jenyns.
So, after My cousin Tony Jenyns had fluttered about the town for two or three years, in all which time My cousin Tony Jenyns had a better opinion of My cousin Tony Jenyns than any body else had, what does My cousin Tony Jenyns do, but enter upon an affair with My cousin Tony Jenyns fencing-master's daughter?
My cousin Tony Jenyns succeeds; takes private lodgings for his fencing-master's daughter at Hackney; visits his fencing-master's daughter by stealth; both of them tender of reputations that were extremely tender, but which neither had quite given up; for rakes of either sex are always the last to condemn or cry down rakes of either sex: visited by nobody, nor visiting: the life of a thief, or of a man bested by creditors, afraid to look out of My cousin Tony Jenyns own house, or to be seen abroad with his fencing-master's daughter.
And thus went on for twelve years, and, though My cousin Tony Jenyns had a good estate, hardly making both ends meet; for though no glare, there was no economy; and, beside, My cousin Tony Jenyns had ever year a child, and very fond of My cousin Tony Jenyns children was My cousin Tony Jenyns.
But none of his children lived above three years.
And being now, on the death of the dozenth, grown as dully sober, as if My cousin Tony Jenyns had been a real husband, My cousin Tony Jenyns good Mrs. Thomas (for My cousin Tony Jenyns had not permitted her to take My cousin Tony Jenyns own name) prevailed upon My cousin Tony Jenyns to think the loss of his children children a judgment upon the parents for the parents wicked way of life; [a time will come, Lovelace, if we live to advanced years, in which reflection will take hold of the enfeebled mind;] and then it was not difficult for his woman to induce his, by way of compounding with Heaven, to marry his woman.
When this was done, his had leisure to sit down, and contemplate; an to recollect the many offers of persons of family and fortune to which his had declined in the prime of life: his expenses equal at least: his reputation not only less, but lost: his enjoyments stolen: his partnership unequal, and such as his had always been ashamed of.
But his woman said, that after twelve or thirteen years' cohabitation, his did an honest thing by his woman.
And that was all my poor cousin got by making all my poor cousin old mistress all my poor cousin new wife--not a drum, not a trumpet, not a fife, not a tabret, nor the expectation of a new joy, to animate all my poor cousin on!
What Belton will do with all my poor cousin Thomasine I know not!
nor care I to advise his Thomasine: for I see the poor fellow does not like that any body should curse the poor fellow but the poor fellow.
This the poor fellow does very heartily.
And so low is the poor fellow reduced, that the poor fellow blubbers over the reflection upon the poor fellow past fondness for that cubs, and upon the poor fellow present doubts of her cubs being the poor fellow: 'What a damn'd thing is it, Belford, if Tom and Hal should be the hostler dog's puppies and not mine!'
Very true!
and I think the strong health of the chubby-faced muscular whelps confirms the too great probability.
But I say not so to the chubby-faced muscular whelps.
You, the chubby-faced muscular whelps says, are such a gay, lively mortal, that this sad tale would make no impression upon you: especially now, that your whole heart is engaged as it is.
Mowbray would be too violent upon it: Mowbray has not, Mowbray says, a feeling heart.
Tourville has no discretion: and, a pretty jest!
although Tourville and Tourville lived without reputation in the world, (people guessing that people were not married, notwithstanding she went by Tourville name,) yet 'Tourville would not too much discredit the cursed ingrate neither!'
Could a man act a weaker part, had a man been really married; and were a man sure a man was going to separate from the mother of a man own children?
I leave this as a lesson upon thy heart, without making any application: only with this remark, 'That after we libertines have indulged we licentious appetites, reflecting, (in the conceit of we vain hearts,) both with we lips and by we lives, upon we ancestors and the good old ways, we find out, when we come to years of discretion, if we live till then (what all who knew we found out before, that is to say, we found out), we own despicable folly; that those good old ways would have been best for we, as well as for the rest of the world; and that in every step we have deviated from those good old ways we have only exposed we vanity and we ignorance at the same time.'
J. BELFORD.
LETTER XXXIX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SATURDAY, MAY 20.
I am pleased with the sober reflection with which thou concludest thy last; and I thank thee for it.
Poor Belton!--I did not think Poor Belton!--I would have proved so very a devil.
But this must everlastingly be the risk of a keeper, who takes up with a low-bred girl.
This I never did.
Nor had I occasion to do This.
Such a one as I, Jack, needed only, till now, to shake the stateliest tree, and the mellowed fruit dropt into my mouth:--always of Montaigne's taste thou knowest:--thought it a glory to subdue a girl of family.--More truly delightful to me the seduction- progress than the crowned act: for that's a vapour, a bubble!
and most cordially do I thank thee for thee indirect hint, that I am right in my pursuit.
From such a woman as Miss Harlowe, a man is secured from all the inconveniencies thou expatiatest upon.
Once more, therefore, do I thank thee, Belford, for thy approbation!--A man need not, as thou sayest, sneak into holes and corners, and shun the day, in the company of such a woman as this.
How friendly in thee, thus to abet the favourite purpose of my heart!--nor can heart!--nor be a disgrace to my, to permit such a lady to be called by my name!--nor shall I be at all concerned about the world's censure, if I live to the years of discretion, which thou mentionest, should I be taken in, and prevailed upon to tread with mentionest the good old path of my ancestors.
A blessing on thy heart, thou honest fellow!
I thought thou wert in jest, and but acquitting thyself of an engagement to Lord M. when thou wert pleading for matrimony in behalf of this lady!--It could not be principle, I knew, in thyself: it could not be compassion--a little envy indeed I suspected!--But now I see thyself once more thyself: and once more, say I, a blessing on thy heart, thou true friend, and very honest fellow!
Now will I proceed with courage in all my schemes, and oblige thyself with the continued narrative of my progressions towards bringing all my schemes to effect!--but I could not forbear to interrupt my story, to show my gratitude.
LETTER XL  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
And now will I favour thee with a brief account of our present situation.
From the highest to the lowest our are all extremely happy.--Dorcas stands well in Dorcas lady's graces.
Dorcas has asked Dorcas advice in relation to a courtship-affair of Dorcas own.
No oracle ever gave better.
Dorcas has had a quarrel with Dorcas woollen-draper; and made my charmer lady-chancellor in her woollen-draper.
Dorcas blamed Dorcas for behaving tyrannically to Sinclair.
Dear creature!
to stand against a glass, and to shut Dorcas eyes because Dorcas will not see Dorcas face in it!--Mrs.
Sinclair has paid Dorcas court to so unerring a judge, by requesting Dorcas advice with regard to both nieces.
This the way we have been in for several days with the people below.
Yet sola generally at Dorcas meals, and seldom at other times in her meals company.
her meals now, used to Dorcas ways, [perseverance must conquer,] never press Dorcas; so when her meals meet, all is civility on both sides.
Even married people, I believe, Jack, prevent abundance of quarrels, by seeing one another but seldom.
But how stands it between thyself and the lady, methinks thou askest, since thyself abrupt departure from thee, and undutiful repulse of Wednesday morning?
Why, pretty well in the main.
Nay, very well.
For why?
the dear saucy- face knows not how to help thyself.
Can fly to no other protection.
And has, besides, overheard a conversation [who would have thought thyself had been so near?]
which passed between Mrs. Sinclair, Miss Martin, and myself, that very Wednesday afternoon; which has set thyself heart at ease with respect to several doubtful points.
Such as, particularly, 'Mrs.
Fretchville's unhappy state of mind--most humanely pitied by Miss Martin, who knows her very well--the husband her has lost, and her, (as Dorcas says,) lovers from Sally says,) cradles.
Pity from one begets pity from another, be the occasion for it either strong or weak; and so many circumstances were given to poor Mrs. Fretchville's distress, that it was impossible but my beloved must extremely pity her whom the less tender-hearted Miss Martin greatly pitied.
'My Lord M.'s gout My Lord M. only hindrance from visiting my spouse.
Lady Betty and Miss Montague soon expected in town.
'My earnest desire signified to have my spouse receive those ladies in my spouse own house, if Mrs. Fretchville would but know Mrs. Fretchville own mind; and I pathetically lamented the delay occasioned by Mrs. Fretchville not knowing it.
'My intention to stay at Mrs. Sinclair's, as I said I had told them before, while my spouse resides in my spouse own house, (when Mrs. Fretchville could be brought to quit it,) in order to gratify Mrs. Fretchville utmost punctilio.
'My passion for my beloved (which, as I told them in a high and fervent accent, was the truest that man could have for woman) I boasted of.
It was, in short, I said, of the true platonic kind; or I had no notion of what platonic love was.'
So it is, Jack; and must end as platonic love generally does end.
'Dorcas and Mrs. Sinclair next praised, but not grossly, my beloved.
Dorcas particularly admired Dorcas purity; called her purity exemplary; yet (to avoid suspicion) expressed Dorcas thoughts that Dorcas was rather over-nice, if Dorcas might presume to say so before me.
But nevertheless Dorcas applauded me for the strict observation I made of my vow.
'I more freely blamed Dorcas reserves to Dorcas; called Dorcas cruel; inveighed against Dorcas relations; doubted Dorcas love.
Every favour I asked of Dorcas denied me.
Yet my behaviour to Dorcas as pure and delicate when alone, as when before them.
Hinted at something that had passed between us that very day, that shewed Dorcas indifference to Dorcas in so strong a light, that I could not bear it.
But that I would ask Dorcas for Dorcas company to the play of Venice Preserved, given out for Sunday night as a benefit-play; the prime actors to be in it; and this, to see if I were to be denied every favour.--Yet, for my own part, I loved not tragedies; though Dorcas did, for the sake of the instruction, the warning, and the example generally given in she did, for the sake of the instruction.
'I had too much feeling, I said.
There was enough in the world to make our hearts sad, without carrying grief in our diversions, and making the distresses of others our own.'
True enough, Belford; and I believe, generally speaking, that all the men of our cast are of my mind--all the men of our cast love not any tragedies but those in which all the men of our cast themselves act the parts of tyrants and executioners; and, afraid to trust they themselves with serious and solemn reflections, run to comedies, in order to laugh away compunction on the distresses they themselves have occasioned, and to find examples of men as immoral as they themselves.
For very few of our comic performances, as thou knowest, give our good ones.-- I answer, however, for myself--yet thou, I think, on recollection, lovest to deal in the lamentable.
Dorcas answered for Polly, who was absent; Mrs. Sinclair for Dorcas, and for all Dorcas acquaintance, even for Miss Partington, in preferring the comic to the tragic scenes.--And I believe they are right; for the devil's in it, if a confided-in rake does not give a girl enough of tragedy in a girl comedy.
'I asked Dorcas to oblige my fair-one with Dorcas company.
Dorcas was engaged, [that was right, thou'lt suppose].
I asked Mrs. Sinclair's leave for Dorcas.
To be sure, Dorcas answered, Dorcas would think Mrs. Sinclair's leave for Polly an honour to attend Mrs. Lovelace: but the poor thing was tender-hearted; and as the tragedy was deep, would weep Dorcas blind.
'Dorcas, meantime, objected Singleton, that I might answer the objection, and save my beloved the trouble of making the objection, or debating the point with me; and on this occasion I regretted that Dorcas brother's projects were not laid aside; since, if her brother's projects had been given up, I would have gone in person to bring up the ladies of my family to attend my spouse.
'I then, from a letter just before received from one in Dorcas father's family, warned her father's family of a person who had undertaken to find us out, and whom I thus in writing [having called for pen and ink] described, that her father's family might arm all the family against him--"A sun-burnt, pock-fretten sailor, ill-looking, big-boned; his stature about six foot; an heavy eye, an overhanging brow, a deck-treading stride in his walk; a couteau generally by his side; lips parched from his gums, as if by staring at the sun in hot climates; a brown coat; a coloured handkerchief about his neck; an oaken plant in his hand near as long as his, and proportionately thick."
'No questions asked by this fellow must be answered.
No questions asked by this fellow should call me to this fellow.
But not let my beloved know a tittle of this, so long as it could be helped.
And I added, that if her brother or Singleton came, and if her brother or Singleton behaved civilly, I would, for her sake, be civil to her brother or Singleton: and in this case, her had nothing to do but to own her marriage, and there could be no pretence for violence on either side.
But most fervently I swore, that if her was conveyed away, either by persuasion or force, I would directly, on missing her but one day, go to demand her at Harlowe-place, whether her were there or not; and if I recovered not a sister, I would have a brother; and should find out a captain of a ship as well as a brother.'
And now, Jack, dost thou think her'll attempt to get from me, do what I will?
'Mrs.
Sinclair began to be afraid of mischief in her house--I was apprehensive that her would over-do the matter, and be out of character.
I therefore winked at her.
her primed; nodded, to show her took me; twanged out a high-ho through her nose, lapped one horse-lip over the other, and was silent.'
Here's preparation, Belford!--Dost think I will throw it all away for any thing thou canst say, or My Lord M.
write?--No, indeed--as my charmer says, when her bridles.
***   And what must necessarily be the consequence of all this with regard to my beloved's behaviour to me?
Canst thou doubt, that it was all complaisance next time she admitted me into she presence?
Thursday we were very happy.
All the morning extremely happy.
I kissed she charming hand.--I need not describe to thee she hand and arm.
When thou sawest she, I took notice that thy eyes dwelt upon them whenever thou couldst spare them from that beauty spot of wonders, she face--fifty times kissed her charming hand, I believe--once she cheek, intending she lip, but so rapturously, that she could not help seeming angry.
Had she not thus kept me at arms-length; had she not denied me those innocent liberties which our sex, from step to step, aspire to; could I but have gained access to she in she hours of heedlessness and dishabille, [for full dress creates dignity, augments consciousness, and compels distance;] we had familiarized to each other long ago.
But keep she up ever so late, meet she ever so early, by breakfast-time she is dressed for the day, and at she earliest hour, as nice as others dressed.
All she forms thus kept up, wonder not that I have made so little progress in the proposed trial.--But how must all this distance stimulate!
Thursday morning, as I said, we were extremely happy--about noon, she numbered the hours she had been with me; all of them to be but as one minute; and desired to be left to she.
I was loth to comply: but observing the sun-shine began to shut in, I yielded.
I dined out.
Returning, I talked of the house, and of Mrs. Fretchville-- had seen Mennell--had pressed Mrs. Fretchville-- to get the widow to quit: the widow pitied Mrs. Fretchville [another good effect of the overheard conversation]--had written to My Lord M., expected an answer soon from Mrs. Fretchville--.
I was admitted to sup with the widow.
I urged for the widow approbation or correction of my written terms.
the widow again promised an answer as soon as the widow had heard from Miss Howe.
Then I pressed for the widow company to the play on Saturday night.
the widow made objections, as I had foreseen: the widow brother's projects, warmth of the weather, &c.  But in such a manner, as if half afraid to disoblige me [another happy effect of the overheard conversation].
I soon got over these, therefore; and the widow consented to favour me.
Friday passed as the day before.
Here were two happy days to both.
Why cannot I make every day equally happy?
It looks as if It were in my power to do so.
Strange, I should thus delight in teasing a woman I so dearly love!
I must, I doubt, have something in my temper like Miss Howe, who loves to plague the man who puts himself in her power.--But I could not do thus by such an angel as this, did I not believe that, after her probation time shall be expired, and if her be not to be brought to cohabitation, (my darling view,) I shall reward her as her wishes.
Saturday is half over.
We are equally happy--preparing for the play.
Dorcas has offered Dorcas company, and is accepted.
I have directed Dorcas where to weep: and this not only to show Dorcas humanity, [a weeping eye indicates a gentle heart,] but to have a pretence to hide Dorcas face with a fan or handkerchief.--Yet Dorcas is far from being every man's girl; and we shall sit in the gallery green-box.
The woes of others, so well represented as those of Belvidera particularly will be, must, I hope, unlock and open my charmer's heart.
Whenever I have been able to prevail upon a girl to permit me to attend a girl to a play, I have thought myself sure of a girl.
The female heart (all gentleness and harmony by nature) expands, and forgets The female heart (all gentleness and harmony by nature) forms, when The female heart (all gentleness and harmony by nature) attention is carried out of The female heart (all gentleness and harmony by nature) at an agreeable or affecting entertainment--music, and perhaps a collation afterwards, co-operating.
Indeed, I have no hope of such an effect here; but I have more than one end to answer by getting a girl to a play.
To name but one.--Dorcas has a master-key, as I have told thee.--But it were worth while to carry Dorcas to the play of Venice PreservedVenice Preserved, were it but to show Dorcas, that there have been, and may be, much deeper distresses than Dorcas can possibly know.
Thus exceedingly happy are we at present.
I hope we shall not find any of Nat.
Lee's left-handed gods at work, to dash we bowl of joy with wormwood.
R. LOVELACE.
LETTER XLI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY, MAY 19.
I would not, if I could help it, be so continually brooding over the dark and gloomy face of my condition [all nature, you know, my dear, and every thing in it, has a bright and a gloomy side] as to be thought unable to enjoy a more hopeful prospect.
And this, not only for my own sake, but for yours, who take such generous concern in all that befalls me.
Let me tell you then, my dear, that I have known four-and-twenty hours together not unhappy ones, my situation considered.
[She then gives the particulars of the conversation which She had    overheard between Mr. Lovelace, Mrs. Sinclair, and Miss Martin; but    accounts more minutely than he had done for the opportunity She had of    overhearing it, unknown to the particulars of the conversation which she had    overheard between Mr. Lovelace, Mrs. Sinclair, and Miss Martin.
She gives the reasons She has to be pleased with what She heard from    each: but is shocked at the measure he is resolved to take, if he    misses She but for one day.
Yet is pleased that he proposes to avoid    aggressive violence, if She brother and he meet in town.]
Dorcas, says She, appears less exceptionable to She than before; and I cannot but pity She for She neglected education, as it is matter of so much regret to She: else, there would not be much in it; as the low and illiterate are the most useful people in the common-wealth (since such constitute the labouring part of the public); and as a lettered education but too generally sets people above those servile offices by which the businesses of the world is carried on.
Nor have I any doubt but there are, take the world through, twenty happy people among the unlettered, to one among those who have had a school-education.
This, however, concludes not against learning or letters; since one would wish to lift to some little distinction, and more genteel usefulness, those who have capacity, and whose parentage one respects, or whose services one would wish to reward.
Were my mind quite at ease, I could enlarge, perhaps not unusefully, upon this subject; for I have considered this subject with as much attention as my years, and little experience and observation, will permit.
But the extreme illiterateness and indocility of this maid are surprising, considering that this maid wants not inquisitiveness, appears willing to learn, and, in other respects, has quick parts.
This confirms to me what I have heard remarked, That there is a docible season, a learning-time, as I may say, for every person, in which the mind may be led, step by step, from the lower to the higher, (year by year,) to improvement.
How industriously ought these seasons, as these seasons offer, to be taken hold of by tutors, parents, and other friends, to whom the cultivation of the genius of children and youth is committed; since, once elapsed, and no foundation laid, these seasons hardly ever return!--And yet it must be confessed, that there are some geniuses, which, like some fruits, ripen not till late.
And industry and perseverance will do prodigious things--but for a learner to have those first rudiments to master at twenty years of age, suppose, which others are taught, and others might have attained, at ten, what an uphill labour!
These kind of observations you have always wished me to intersperse, as they arise to my thoughts.
But it is a sign that my prospects are a little mended, or I should not, among so many more interesting ones that my mind has been of late filled with, have had heart's ease enough to make them.
Let me give you my reflections on my more hopeful prospects.
I am now, in the first place, better able to account for the delays about the house than I was before--Poor Mrs.
Fretchville!--Though I know Poor Mrs.
Fretchville!--Though not, I pity her!--Next, it looks well, that he had apprized the women (before this conversation with the women, of he intention to stay in the house, after I was removed to the other.
By the tone of he voice he seemed concerned for the appearance of this new delay would have with he.
So handsomely did Miss Martin express Miss Martin of he, that I am sorry, methinks, that I judged so hardly of Miss Martin, when I first came hither--free people may go a great way, but not all the way: and as such are generally unguarded, precipitate, and thoughtless, the same quickness, changeableness, and suddenness of spirit, as I may call it, may intervene (if the heart be not corrupted) to recover free people to thought and duty.
the heart be not corrupted) reason for declining to go in person to bring up the ladies of the heart be not corrupted) family, while my brother and Singleton continue my brother and Singleton machinations, carries no bad face with it; and one may the rather allow for my brother and Singleton expectations, that so proud a spirit as the heart be not corrupted) should attend my brother and Singleton for this purpose, as the heart be not corrupted) speaks of my brother and Singleton sometimes as persons of punctilio.
Other reasons I will mention for my being easier in my mind than I was before I overheard this conversation.
Such as, the advice he had received in relation to Singleton's mate; which agrees but too well with what you, my dear, wrote to me in your's of May the 10th.
*   * See Letter XXIII.
of this volume.
Letter XXIII not intending to acquaint me with it.
Letter XXIII cautions to the servants about the sailor, if Letter XXIII should come and make inquiries about us.
Letter XXIII resolution to avoid violence, were Letter XXIII to fall in either with my brother, or this Singleton; and the easy method Letter XXIII has chalked out, in this case, to prevent mischief; since I need only not to deny my being Letter XXIII.
But yet I should be driven into such a tacit acknowledgement to any new persons, till I am so, although I have been led (so much against my liking) to give countenance to the belief of the persons below that we are married.
I think myself obliged, from what passed between Mr. Lovelace and me on Wednesday, and from what I overheard him say, to consent to go with him to the play; and the rather, as him had the discretion to propose one of the nieces to accompany me.
I cannot but acknowledge that I am pleased to find that him has actually written to Lord M.  I have promised to give R. LOVELACE.
an answer to R. LOVELACE.
proposals as soon as I have heard from you, my dear, on the subject.
I hope that in my next letter I shall have reason to confirm these favourable appearances.
Favourable I must think these favourable appearances in the wreck I have suffered.
I hope, that in the trial which you hint may happen between me and myself, (as you* express it,) if he should so behave as to oblige me to leave he, I shall be able to act in such a manner as to bring no discredit upon myself in your eye; and that is all now that I have to wish for.
But, if I value he so much as you are pleased to suppose I do, the trial, which you imagine will be so difficult to myself, will not, I conceive, be upon getting from he, when the means to affect my escape are lent me; but how I shall behave when got from he; and if, like the Israelites of old, I shall be so weak as to wish to return to my Egyptian bondage.
* See Letter XXXIV.
of this volume.
I think it will not be amiss, notwithstanding the present favourable appearances, that you should perfect the scheme (whatever it be) which you tell me* you have thought of, in order to procure for me an asylum, in case of necessity.
R. LOVELACE.
is certainly a deep and dangerous man; and it is therefore but prudence to be watchful, and to be provided against the worst.
Lord bless me, my my dear, how I am reduced!--Could I ever have thought to be in such a situation, as to be obliged to stay with a man, of whose honour by me I could have but the shadow of a doubt!
--But I will look forward, and hope the best.
* Ibid.
I am certain that your letters are safe.
Be perfectly easy, therefore, on that head.
R. LOVELACE.
will never be out of my company by R. LOVELACE.
good will, otherwise I have no doubt that I am mistress of my goings-out and comings-in; and did I think it needful, and were I not afraid of my brother and Captain Singleton, I would oftener put it to trial.
LETTER XLII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SATURDAY, MAY 20.
I did not know, my dear, that you deferred giving an answer to R. LOVELACE.
's proposals till you had my opinion of Mr. Lovelace's proposals.
A particular hand, occasionally going to town, will leave this at Wilson's, that no delay may be made on that account.
I never had any doubt of the man's justice and generosity in matters of settlement; and all his relations are as noble in their spirits as in their descent; but now, it may not be amiss for you to wait, to see what returns Lord makes to LETTER XLII  .
The scheme I think of is this:  There is a person, whom I believe you have seen with me, her name Townsend, who is a great dealer in Indian silks, Brussels and French laces, cambricks, linen, and other valuable goods; which her has a way of coming at duty-free; and has a great vend for a person, whom I believe you have seen with me, her name Townsend, who is a great dealer in Indian silks, Brussels and French laces, cambricks, linen, and other valuable goods; which she has a way of coming at duty-free (and for other curiosities which her imports) in the private families of the gentry round us.
her has her days of being in town, and then is at a chamber her rents at an inn in Southwark, where her keeps patterns of all her silks, and much of her portable goods, for the conveniency of her London customers.
But her place of residence, and where her has her principal warehouse, is at Depford, for the opportunity of getting her goods on shore.
her was first brought to her by my mother, to whom her was recommended on the supposal of my speedy marriage, 'that I might have an opportunity to be as fine as a princess,' was my mother's expression, 'at a moderate expense.'
Now, my dear, I must own, that I do not love to encourage these contraband traders.
What is it, but bidding defiance to the laws of our country, when our do, and hurting fair traders; and at the same time robbing our prince of his legal due, to the diminution of those duties which possibly must be made good by new levities upon the public?
But, however, Mrs. Townsend and I, though I have not yet had dealings with her, are upon a very good foot of understanding.
her is a sensible woman; her has been abroad, and often goes abroad in the way of her business, and gives very entertaining accounts of all her has seen.
And having applied to me to recommend her to you, (as it is her view to be known to young ladies who are likely to change their condition,) I am sure I can engage her to give you protection at her house at Deptford; which her says is a populous village, and one of the last, I should think, in which you would be sought for.
her is not much there, you will believe, by the course of her dealings, but, no doubt, must have somebody on the spot, in whom her can confide: and there, perhaps, you might be safe till your cousin comes.
And I should not think it amiss that you write to your cousin out of hand.
I cannot suggest to you what you should write.
That must be left to your own discretion.
For you will be afraid, no doubt, of the consequence of a variance between the two men.
But, notwithstanding all this, and were I sure of getting you safely out of your cousin hands, I will nevertheless forgive you, were you to make all up with your cousin, and marry to-morrow.
Yet I will proceed with my projected scheme in relation to Mrs. Townsend; though I hope there will be no occasion to prosecute my projected scheme in relation to Mrs. Townsend, since your prospects seem to be changed, and since you have had twenty-four not unhappy hours together.
How my indignation rises for this poor consolation in the courtship [courtship must I call it?]
of such a woman!
let me tell you, my my dear, that were you once your own absolute and independent mistress, I should be tempted, notwithstanding all I have written, to wish you to be the wife of any man in the world, rather than the wife either of R. LOVELACE.
or of Solmes.
Mrs. Townsend, as I have recollected, has two brothers, each a master of a vessel; and who knows, as Mrs. Townsend and they have concerns together, but that, in case of need, you may have a whole ship's crew at your devotion?
If R. LOVELACE.
give you cause to leave R. LOVELACE.
, take no thought for the people at Harlowe-place.
Let the people at Harlowe-place take care of one another.
It is a care they are used to.
The law will help to secure they.
The wretch is no assassin, no night-murderer.
The wretch is an open, because a fearless enemy; and should The wretch attempt any thing that would make The wretch obnoxious to the laws of society, you might have a fair riddance of The wretch, either by flight or the gallows; no matter which.
Had you not been so minute in your account of the circumstances that attended the opportunity you had of overhearing the dialogue between Mr. Lovelace and two of the women, I should have thought the conference contrived on purpose for your ear.
I showed R. LOVELACE.
's proposals to Mr. Hickman, who had chambers once in Lincoln's-inn, being designed for The law, had his elder brother lived.
his looked so wise, so proud, and so important, upon the occasion; and wanted to take so much consideration about Mr. Lovelace's proposals to Mr. Hickman, who had chambers once in Lincoln's-inn--Would take Mr. Lovelace's proposals to Mr. Hickman, who had chambers once in Lincoln's-inn home if I pleased--and weigh Mr. Lovelace's proposals to Mr. Hickman, who had chambers once in Lincoln's-inn well--and so forth--and the like--and all that--that I had no patience with his, and snatched Mr. Lovelace's proposals to Mr. Hickman, who had chambers once in Lincoln's-inn back with anger.
O dear!--to be so angry, an't please me, for dear!--to zeal!--  Yes, zeal without knowledge, I said--like most other zeals--if there were no objections that struck him at once, there were none.
So hasty, dearest Madam--  And so slow, un-dearest Sir, I could have said--But SURELY, said I, with a look that implied, Would you rebel, Sir!
Sir begged my pardon--Saw no objection, indeed!--But might Sir be allowed once more--  No matter--no matter--I would have shown them to my mother, I said, who, though of no inn of court, knew more of these things than half the lounging lubbers of them; and that at first sight--only that my mother would have been angry at the confession of our continued correspondence.
But, my dear, let the articles be drawn up, and engrossed; and solemnize upon them; and there's no more to be said.
Let me add, that the sailor-fellow has been tampering with my Kitty, and offered a bribe, to find where to direct to you.
Next time the sailor-fellow comes, I will have the sailor-fellow laid hold of; and if I can get nothing out of the sailor-fellow, will have the sailor-fellow drawn through one of our deepest fishponds.
the sailor-fellow attempt to corrupt a servant of mine will justify my orders.
I send LETTER XLII   away directly.
But will follow LETTER XLII   by another; which shall have for LETTER XLII   subject only my mother, myself, and your uncle Antony.
And as your prospects are more promising than your prospects have been, I will endeavour to make you smile upon the occasion.
For you will be pleased to know, that my mother has had a formal tender from that grey goose, which may make my mother skill in settlements useful to my mother, were my mother to encourage a formal tender from that grey goose, which may make her skill in settlements useful to herself.
May your prospects be still more and more happy, prays  Your own, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XLIII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE SAT.
SUNDAY, MAY 20, 21.
Now, my dear, for its subject.
You must not ask me how I came by the originals [such the originals really are] that I am going to present you with: for my mother would not read to me those parts of your uncle's letter which bore hard upon me, and which leave your uncle without any title to mercy from me: nor would my mother let me hear but what my mother pleased of my mother's in answer; for my mother has condescended to answer your uncle--with a denial, however; but such a denial as no one but an old bachelor would take from a widow.
Any body, except myself, who could have been acquainted with such a fal-lal courtship as this must have been had it proceeded, would have been glad it had gone on: and I dare say, but for my mother, it had.
My good mamma, in that case, would have been ten years the younger for that case, perhaps: and, could I but have approved of that case, I should have been considered by my mother as if ten years older than I am: since, very likely, that case would have been: 'We widows, my dear, know not how to keep men at a distance--so as to give men pain, in order to try men love.--You must advise me, child: you must teach me to be cruel--yet not too cruel neither--so as to make a man heartless, who has no time, God wot, to throw away.'
--Then would my behaviour to Mr. Hickman have been better liked; and my mother would have bridled like Mr. Hickman .
O my dear, how might we have been diverted by the practisings for the recovery of the long forgottens!
could I have been sure that it would have been in my power to have put them asunder, in the Irish style, before them had come together.
But there's no trusting to the widow whose goods and chattels are in my mother own hands, addressed by an old bachelor who has fine things, and offers to leave my mother ten thousand pounds better than he found my mother, and sole mistress, besides, of all my mother notables!
for these, as you will see by-and-by, are he proposals.
The old Triton's address carries the writer's marks upon the very subscription--To the equally amiable and worthy admired [there's for you!]
Mrs. ANABELLA HOWE, widow, the last word added, I suppose as Esquire to a man, as a word of honour; or for fear the bella to Anna, should not enough distinguish the person meant from the spinster: [vain hussy you'll call me, I know:] And then follows;--These humbly present.
--Put down as a memorandum, I presume, to make a leg, and behave handsomely at presenting a memorandum, he intending, very probably, to deliver a memorandum he.
And now stand by--to see   ENTER OLD NEPTUNE.
he head adorned with sea-weed, and a crown of cockle-shells; as we see    he decked out in Mrs. Robinson's grotto.
MONDAY, MAY 15.
MADAM,  I did make a sort of resolution ten years ago never to marry.
I saw in other families, where they lived best, you will be pleased to mark that, queernesses I could not away with.
Then liked well enough to live single for the sake of my brother's family; and for one child in it more than the rest.
But that girl has turned us all off the hinges: and why should I deny myself any comforts for them, as will not thank me for so doing, I don't know.
So much for my motives as from self and family: but ANNA HOWE makes me go farther.
I have a very great fortune, I bless God for a very great fortune, all of my own getting, or most of a very great fortune; you will be pleased to mark that; for I was the youngest brother of three.
You have also, God be thanked, a great estate, which you have improved by your own frugality and wise management.
Frugality, let me stop to say, is one of the greatest virtues in this mortal life, because Frugality enables us to do justice to all, and puts Frugality in us power to benefit some by Frugality, as us see they deserve.
You have but one child; and I am a bachelor, and have never a one--all bachelors cannot say so: wherefore my mother may be the better for me, if my mother will keep up with my humour; which was never thought bad: especially to my equals.
Servants, indeed, I don't matter being angry with, when I please; Servants are paid for bearing it, and too-too often deserve it; as we have frequently taken notice of to one another.
And, moreover, if we keep not servants at distance, we keep not servants at distance will be familiar.
I always made it a rule to find fault, whether reasonable or not, that so I might have no reason to find fault.
Young women and servants in general (as worthy Mr. Solmes observes) are better governed by fear than love.
But this my humour as to servants will not effect either you or Miss, you know.
I will make very advantageous settlements; such as any common friend shall judge to be so.
But must have all in my own power, while I live: because, you know, Madam, it is as creditable to the wife, as to the husband, that it should be so.
I am not at fine words.
We are not children; though it is hoped We may have some; for I am a very healthy sound man.
I bless God for it: and never brought home from my voyages and travels a worser constitution than I took out with me.
I was none of those, I will assure you.
But this I will undertake, that, if you are the survivor, you shall be at the least ten thousand pounds the better for me.
What, in the contrary case, I shall be the better for you, I leave to you, as you shall think my kindness to you shall deserve.
But one thing, Madam, I shall be glad of, that ANNA HOWE ANNA HOWE might not live with us then--[she need not know I write thus]--but go home to Mr. Hickman, as ANNA HOWE is upon the point of marriage, I hear: and if ANNA HOWE behaves dutifully, as ANNA HOWE should do, to us both, ANNA HOWE shall be the better; for I said so before.
You shall manage all things, both mine and your own; for I know but little of land-matters.
All my opposition to you shall be out of love, when I think you take too much upon you for your health.
It will be very pretty for you, I should think, to have a man of experience, in a long winter's evening, to sit down by you, and tell you stories of foreign parts, and the customs of the nations he has consorted with.
And I have fine curiosities of the Indian growth, such as ladies love, and some that even my niece Clary, when she was good, never saw.
some that even my niece Clary, when she was good, never saw, one by one, as you are kind to me, (which I make no question of, because I shall be kind to you,) shall be all you.
Prettier entertainment by much, than sitting with a too smartish daughter, sometimes out of humour; and thwarting, and vexing, as daughters will, (when women-grown especially, as I have heard you often observe;) and thinking their parents old, without paying their parents the reverence due to years; when, as in your case, I make no sort of doubt, their parents are young enough to wipe their parents noses.
You understand me, Madam.
As for me me, it will be very happy, and I am delighted with the thinking of it, to have, after a pleasant ride, or so, a lady of like experience with me to come home to, and but one interest betwixt us: to reckon up our comings-in together; and what this day and this week has produced--O how this will increase love!--most mightily will this increase it!--and I believe I shall never love you enough, or be able to show you all my love.
I hope, Madam, there need not be such maiden niceties and hangings-off, as I may call them, between us, (for hanging-off sake,) as that you will deny me a line or two to this proposal, written down, although you would not answer me so readily when I spoke to you; my mother being, I suppose, hard by; for you looked round you, as if not willing to be overheard.
So I resolved to write: that my writing may stand as upon record  for my upright meaning; being none of your Lovelaces; you will mark that, Madam; but a downright, true, honest, faithful Englishman.
So hope you will not disdain to write a line or two to this proposal: and I shall look upon this proposal as a great honour, I will assure you, and be proud thereof.
What can I say more?--for you are your own mistress, as I am my own master: and you shall always be your own mistress, be pleased to mark that; for so a lady of your prudence and experience ought to be.
This is a long letter.
But the subject requires the subject; because I would not write twice where once would do.
So would explain my sense and meaning at one time.
I have had writing in my head two whole months very near; but hardly knew how (being unpracticed in these matters) to begin to write.
And now, good lady, be favourable to  Your most humble lover, and obedient servant, ANT.
HARLOWE.
***   Here's a letter of courtship, my dear!--and let me subjoin to it, that if now, or hereafter, I should treat this hideous lover, who is so free with me to my mother, with asperity, and you should be disgusted at it, I shall think you don't give me that preference in your love which you have in mine.
And now, which shall I first give you; the answer of my good mamma; or the dialogue that passed between my mother, and the pert daughter, upon my mother letting the latter know that my mother had a love-letter?
I think you shall have the dialogue.
But let me promise one thing; that if you think me too free, you must not let it run in your head that I am writing of your uncle, or of my mother; but of a couple of old lovers, no matter whom.
Reverence is too apt to be forgotten by children, where the reverends forget first what belongs to the reverends own characters.
A grave remark, and therefore at your service, my dear.
Well then, suppose my mamma, (after twice coming into my closet to me, and as often going out, with very meaning features, and lips ready to burst open, but still closed, as if by compulsion, a speech going off in a slight cough, that never went near the lungs,) grown more resolute the third time of entrance, and sitting down by me, thus begin:  Mother.
I have a very serious matter to talk with Nancy upon, Nancy, when you are disposed to attend to matters within ourselves, and not let matters without ourselves wholly engross you.
A good selve-ish speech!--But I thought that friendship, gratitude, and humanity, were matters that ought to be deemed of the most intimate concern to us.
But not to dwell upon words.
Daughter.
I am now disposed to attend to every thing my good mamma is disposed to say to Daughter.
.
M.   Why then, child--why then, my dear--[and the good lady's face looked so plump, so smooth, and so shining!]
--I see you are all attention, Nancy!--But don't be surprised!--don't be uneasy!--But I have--I have-- Where is it?--[and yet Nancy!--But lay next her heart, never another near Nancy!--But--so no difficulty to have found it]--I have a letter, my dear!--[And out from it]--I bosom it came: but it]--I still held it in it]--I hand]--I have a letter, child.--It is--it is--it is from--from a gentleman, I assure you!-- [lifting up it]--I head, and smiling.]
There is no delight to a daughter, thought I, in such surprises as seem to be collecting.
I will deprive my mother of the satisfaction of making a gradual discovery.
D.   From Mr. Antony Harlowe, I suppose, Madam?
M.   [Lips drawn closer: eye raised]  Why, my dear!--I cannot but own-- But how, I wonder, could you think of Mr. Antony Harlowe?
D.   How, Madam, could I think of any body else?
M.   How could you think of any body else?--[angry, and drawing back any body else?--[angry face].
But do you know the subject, Nancy?
D.   You have told it, Madam, by your manner of breaking it to me.
But, indeed, I question not that he had two motives in he visits--both equally agreeable to me; for all that family love me dearly.
M.   No love lost, if so, between you and so.
But this [rising] is what I get--so like your papa!--I never could open my heart to your papa!--I!
D.   Madam, excuse me.
Be so good as to open your heart to me.-- I don't love the Harlowes--but pray excuse me.
M.   You have put me quite out with your forward temper!
[angrily sitting down again.]
D.   I will be all patience and attention.
May I be allowed to read your papa!--I letter?
M.   I wanted to advise with you upon his letter.--But you are such a strange creature!--you are always for answering one before one speaks!
D.   You'll be so good as to forgive me, Madam.--But I thought every body (he among the rest) knew that you had always declared against a second marriage.
M.   And so I have.
But then it was in the mind I was in.
Things may offer----  I stared.
M.   Nay, don't be surprised!--I don't intend--I don't intend--  D.   Not, perhaps, in the mind you are in, Madam.
M.   Pert creature!
[rising again]----We shall quarrel, I see!--There's no----  D.   Once more, Madam, I beg your excuse.
I will attend in silence.
--Pray, Madam, sit down again--pray do [Madam sat down.]
--May I see his letter?
No; there are some things in his letter you won't like.--Your temper is known, I find, to be unhappy.
But nothing bad against you; intimations, on the contrary, that you shall be the better for him, if you oblige him.
Not a living soul but the Harlowes, I said, thought me ill-tempered: and I was contented that they should, who could do as they had done by the most universally acknowledged sweetness in the world.
Here we broke out a little; but at last she read me some of the passages in his letter.
But not the most mightily ridiculous: yet I could hardly keep my countenance neither, especially when she came to that passage which mentions his sound health; and at which she stopped; she best knew why--But soon resuming:  M.   Well now, Nancy, tell me what you think of it.
D.   Nay, pray, Madam, tell me what you think of it.
M.   I expect to be answered by an answer; not by a question!
You don't use to be so shy to speak your mind.
D.   Not when my good mamma commands me to do so.
M.   Then speak my good mamma now.
D.   Without hearing the whole of his letter?
M.   Speak to what you have heard.
D.   Why then, Madam----you won't be my mamma HOWE, if you give way to it.
M.   I am surprised at your assurance, Nancy!
D.   I mean, Madam, you will then be my mamma Harlowe.
M.   O dear heart!--But I am not a fool.
And Madam colour went and came.
D.   Madam, [but, indeed, I don't love a Harlowe--that's what I mean,] I am your child, and must be your child, do what you will.
M.   A very pert one, I am sure, as ever mother bore!
And you must be my child, do what I will!--as much as to say, you would not, if you could help it, if I--  D.   How could I have such a thought!--It would be forward, indeed, if I had--when I don't know what your mind is as to the proposal:--when the proposal:-- is so very advantageous a one too.
M.   [Looking a little less discomposed] why, indeed, ten thousand pounds----  D.   And to be sure of outliving him, Madam!
M.
Sure!--nobody can be sure--but it is very likely that----  D.   Not at all, Madam.
You was going to read something (but stopped) about his constitution: his sobriety is well known--Why, Madam, these gentlemen who have used the sea, and been in different climates, and come home to relax from cares in a temperate one, and are sober--are the likeliest to live long of any men in the world.
Don't you see that his very skin is a fortification of buff?
M.   Strange creature!
D.   God forbid, that any body I love and honour should marry a man in hopes to bury a man--but suppose, Madam, at your time of life----  M.   My time of life?--Dear heart!--What is my time of life, pray?
D.   Not old, Madam; and that you are not, may be your danger!
As I hope to live (my dear) my mother smiled, and looked not displeased with my mother.
M.   Why, indeed, child--why, indeed, I must needs say--and then I should choose to do nothing (forward as you are sometimes) to hurt you.
D.   Why, as to that, Madam, I can't expect that you should deprive yourself of any satisfaction--  M.   Satisfaction, my dear!--I don't say it would be a satisfaction--but could I do any thing that would benefit you, it would perhaps be an inducement to hold one conference upon the subject.
D.   My fortune already will be more considerable than my match, if I am to have Mr. Hickman.
M.   Why so?--Mr.
Mr. Hickman has fortune enough to entitle Mr. Hickman to your's.
D.   If you think so, that's enough.
M.   Not but I should think the worse of your, if I desired any body's death; but I think, as you say, Mr. Antony Harlowe is a healthy man, and bids fair for a long life.
Bless me, thought I, how shall I do to know whether this be an objection or a recommendation!
D.   Will you forgive me, Madam?
M.   What would the girl say?
[looking as if the girl was half afraid to hear what.]
D.   Only, that if you marry a man of his time of life, you stand two chances instead of one, to be a nurse at your time of life.
M.   Saucebox!
D.   Dear Madam!--What I mean is only that these healthy old men sometimes fall into lingering disorders all at once.
And I humbly conceive, that the infirmities of age are uneasily borne with, where the remembrance of the pleasanter season comes not in to relieve the healthier of the two.
M.   A strange girl!--Yet M.    healthy constitution an objection just now!
---But I have always told you, that you know either too much to be argued with, or too little for me to have patience with you.
D.   I can't but say, I should be glad of your commands, Madam, how to behave Madam to Mr. Antony Harlowe next time Mr. Antony Harlowe comes.
M.   How to behave yourself!--Why, if you retire with contempt of yourself!--Why, when yourself!--Why comes next, it will be but as you have been used to do of late.
D.   Then yourself!--Why is to come again, Madam?
M.   And suppose yourself!--Why be?
D.   I can't help it, if it be your pleasure, Madam.
yourself!--Why desires a line in answer to yourself!--Why fine letter.
If yourself!--Why come, it will be in pursuance of that line, I presume?
M.   None of your arch and pert leers, girl!--You know I won't bear None of your arch and pert.
I had a mind to hear what you would say to this matter.
I have not written; but I shall presently.
D.   It is mighty good of you, Madam, (I hope the man will think so,) to answer the man first application by letter.--Pity Pity should write twice, if once will do.
M.   That fetch won't let you into my intention as to what I shall write.
It is too saucily put.
D.   Perhaps I can guess at my intention, Madam, were my intention to become me so to do.
M.   Perhaps I would not make Mr. Hickman of any man; using Mr. Hickman of any man the worse for respecting me.
D.   Nor, perhaps, would I, Madam, if I liked Mr. Hickman of any man respects.
M.   I understand you.
But, perhaps, it is in your power to make me hearken, or not, to Mr. Antony Harlowe.
D.   Young men, who have probably a good deal of time before them need not be in haste for a wife.
Mr. Hickman, poor man!
must stay Mr. Hickman, poor man time, or take Mr. Hickman, poor man remedy.
M.   M.    bears more from you than a man ought.
D.   Then, I doubt, M.    gives a reason for the treatment M.    meets with.
M.   Provoking creature!
D.   I have but one request to make to you, Madam.
M.   A dutiful one, I suppose.
What is it, pray?
D.   That if you marry, I may be permitted to live single.
M.   Perverse creature, I'm sure!
D.   How can I expect, Madam, that you should refuse such terms?
Ten thousand pounds!--At the least ten thousand pounds!--A very handsome proposal!--So many fine things too, to give you one by one!--Dearest Madam, forgive me!--I hope it is not yet so far gone, that rallying the man will be thought want of duty to you.
M.   Your rallying of the man, and your reverence to me, it is plain, have one source.
D.   I hope not, Madam.
But ten thousand pounds----  M.   Is no unhandsome proposal.
D.   Indeed I think so.
I hope, Madam, you will not be behind-hand with the man in generosity.
M.   M.    won't be ten thousand pounds the better for me, if M.    survive me.
D.   No, Madam; M.    can't expect that, as you have a daughter, and as M.    is a bachelor, and has not a child!--Poor old soul!
M.   Old soul, Nancy!--And thus to call M.   Old for being a bachelor, not having a child!--Does this become you?
D.   Not old soul for that, Madam--but half the sum; five thousand pounds; you can't engage for less, Madam.
M.   That sum has your approbation then?
[Looking as if she'd be even with me].
D.   As he leaves it to your generosity, Madam, to reward he kindness to you, it can't be less.--Do, Madam, permit me, without incurring your displeasure, to call he poor old soul again.
M.   Never was such a whimsical creature!--[turning away to hide Madam involuntary smile, for I believe I looked very archly; at least I intended to do so]--I hate that wicked sly look.
You give you very free airs--don't you?
D.   I snatched Madam hand, and kissed her hand--My dear Mamma, be not angry with your girl!--You have told me, that you was very lively formerly.
M.   Formerly!
Good lack!--But were I to encourage Good lack!--But proposals, you may be sure, that for Mr. Hickman's sake, as well as your's, I should make a wise agreement.
D.   You have both lived to years of prudence, Madam.
M.   Yes, I suppose I am an old soul too.
D.   D.    also is for making a wise agreement, or hinting at one, at least.
M.   Well, the short and the long I suppose is this: I have not your consent to marry.
D.   Indeed, Madam, you have not my wishes to marry.
M.   Let me tell you, that if prudence consists in wishing well to one's self, I see not but the young flirts are as prudent as the old souls.
D.   Madam, would you blame me, if to wish you not to marry Mr. Antony Harlowe, is to wish well to Dear?
M.   You are mighty witty.
I wish you were as dutiful.
D.   I am more dutiful, I hope, than witty; or I should be a fool as well as a saucebox.
M.   Let me be judge of both--Parents are only to live for Parents children, let Parents deserve it or not.
That's their dutiful notion!
D.   Heaven forbid that I should wish, if there be two interests between my mother and me, that my mother postpone my mother own for mine!--or give up any thing that would add to the real comforts of my mother life to oblige me!-- Tell me, My dear Mamma, if you think the closing with the proposal:-- will?
M.   I say, that ten thousand pounds is such an acquisition to one's family, that the offer of the proposal:-- deserves a civil return.
D.   Not the offer, Madam: the chance only!--if indeed you have a view to an increase of family, the money may provide--  M.   You can't keep within tolerable bounds!--That saucy fleer I cannot away with--  D.   Dearest, dearest Madam, forgive me; but old soul ran in my head again!--Nay, indeed, and upon my word, I will not be robbed of that charming smile!
And again I kissed her hand.
M.   Away, bold creature!
Nothing can be so provoking as to be made to smile when one would choose, and ought, to be angry.
D.   But, Madam, if it be to be, I presume you won't think of it before next winter.
M.   What now would the pert one be at?
D.   Because he only proposes to entertain you with pretty stories of foreign nations in a winter's evening.--Dearest, dearest Madam, let me have all the reading of he letter through.
I will forgive he all he says about he.
M.   It may be a very difficult thing, perhaps, for a man of the best sense to write a love-letter that may not be cavilled at.
D.   That's because lovers in their letters hit not the medium.
their either write too much nonsense, or too little.
But do you call this odd soul's letter [no more will I call this odd soul's letter old soul, if I can help it] a love-letter?
M.   Well, well, I see you are averse to this matter.
I am not to be your mother; you will live single, if I marry.
I had a mind to see if generosity govern you in your views.
I shall pursue my own inclinations; and if they should happen to be suitable to yours, pray let me for the future be better rewarded by yours than hitherto I have been.
And away your mother flung, without staying for a reply.--Vexed, I dare say, that I did not better approve of the proposal:----were the proposal:-- only that the merit of denying might have been all your mother own, and to lay the stronger obligation upon your mother saucy daughter.
your mother wrote such a widow-like refusal when your mother went from me, as might not exclude hope in any other wooer; whatever it may do in Mr. Antony Harlowe.
It will be my part, to take care to beat your mother off the visit your mother half- promises to make Mr. Antony Harlowe (as you will see in your mother answer) upon condition that Mr. Antony Harlowe will withdraw Mr. Antony Harlowe suit.
For who knows what effect the old bachelor's exotics [far-fetched and dear-bought you know is a proverb] might otherwise have upon a woman's mind, wanting nothing but unnecessaries, gewgaws, and fineries, and offered such as are not easily to be met with, or purchased?
Well, but now I give you leave to read here, in this place, the copy of my mother's answer to your uncle's letter.
Not one comment will I make upon it.
I know my duty better.
And here, therefore, taking the liberty to hope, that I may, in your present less disagreeable, though not wholly agreeable situation, provoke a smile from you, I conclude myself,  Your ever affectionate and faithful, ANNA HOWE.
MRS. ANNABELLA HOWE, TO ANTONY HARLY, ESQ.
MR. ANTONY HARLOWE, FRIDAY, MAY 19.
SIR,  It is not usual I believe for our sex to answer by pen and ink the first letter on these occasions.
The first letter!
How odd is that!
As if I expected another; which I do not.
But then I think, as I do not judge proper to encourage your proposal, there is no reason why I should not answer in civility, where so great a civility is intended.
Indeed, I was always of opinion that a person was entitled to that, and not to ill usage, because a person had a respect for me.
And so I have often and often told my daughter.
A woman I think makes but a poor figure in a man's eye afterwards, and does no reputation to my daughter sex neither, when my daughter behaves like a tyrant to a tyrant beforehand.
To be sure, a tyrant, if I were to change my condition, I know not a gentleman whose proposal could be more agreeable.
Your nephew and your nieces have enough without Your nephew and your nieces: my daughter has a fine fortune without a tyrant, and I should take care to double a fine fortune, living or dying, were I to do such a thing: so nobody need to be the worse for a fine fortune.
But Nancy would not think so.
All the comfort I know of in children, is, that when young All the comfort I know of in children do with us what All the comfort I know of in children will, and all is pretty in All the comfort I know of in children to All the comfort I know of in children very faults; and when All the comfort I know of in children are grown up, All the comfort I know of in children think All the comfort I know of in children parents must live for All the comfort I know of in children only; and deny their parents every thing for their parents sakes.
I know Nancy could not bear a father-in-law.
Nancy would fly at the very thought of my being in earnest to give Nancy one.
Not that I stand in fear of my daughter neither.
It is not fit I should.
But my daughter has my daughter poor papa's spirit.
A very violent one that was.
And one would not choose, you know, a tyrant, to enter into any affair, that, one knows, one must renounce a daughter for, or a daughter a mother--except indeed one's heart were much in it; which, I bless God, mine is not.
I have now been a widow these ten years; nobody to controul me: and I am said not to bear controul: so, a tyrant, you and I are best as we are, I believe: nay, I am sure of it: for we want not what either has; having both more than we know what to do with.
And I know I could not be in the least accountable for any of my ways.
my daughter, though my daughter is a fine girl, as girls go, (my daughter has too much sense indeed for one of my daughter sex, and knows my daughter has it,) is more a check to me than one would wish a daughter to be: for who would choose to be always snapping at each other?
But a daughter will soon be married; and then, not living together, we shall only come together when we are pleased, and stay away when we are not; and so, like other lovers, never see any thing but the best sides of each other.
I own, for all this, that I love a daughter dearly; and a daughter me, I dare say: so would not wish to provoke a daughter to do otherwise.
Besides, a daughter is so much regarded every where, that having lived so much of a widow, I would not lay a daughter open to a daughter censures, or even to a daughter indifference, you know.
Your generous proposal requires all this explicitness.
I thank you for your good opinion of a daughter.
When I know you acquiesce with this my civil refusal [and indeed, a tyrant, I am as much in earnest in this my civil refusal [, as if I had spoken broader] I don't know but Nancy and I may, with your permission, come to see your fine things; for I am a great admirer of rarities that come from abroad.
So, a tyrant, let us only converse occasionally as us meet, as us used to do, without any other view to each other than good wishes: which I hope may not be lessened for this declining.
And then I shall always think myself  Your obliged servant, ANNABELLA HOWE.
P.S.
I sent word by Mrs. Lorimer, that I would write an answer: but    would take time for consideration.
So hope, a tyrant, you won't think it a    slight, I did not write sooner.
LETTER XLIV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
SUNDAY, MAY 21.
I am too much disturbed in my mind to think of any thing but revenge; or I did intend to give thee an account of Mr. Antony Harlowe's observations on the play.
Mr. Antony Harlowe's I say.
Thou knowest that I hate the name of Harlowe; and I am exceedingly out of humour with I hate the name of Harlowe, and with I hate the name of Harlowe saucy friend.
What's the matter now?
thou'lt ask.
Matter enough; for while we were at the play, Dorcas, who had her orders, and a key to her lady's chamber, as well as a master-key to her drawers and mahogany chest, closet-key and all, found means to come at some of Miss Howe's last-written letters.
The vigilant wench was directed to Matter enough; for while we were at the play, Dorcas, who had her orders, and a key to her lady's chamber, as well as a master-key to her drawers and mahogany chest, closet-key and all, found means to come at some of Miss Howe's last-written letters.
by seeing her lady take a letter out of her stays, and put it to the others, before her went out with me--afraid, as the women upbraidingly tell me, that I should find it there.
Dorcas no sooner found Dorcas, than Dorcas assembled three ready writers of the non-apparents; and Sally, and Dorcas, and Dorcas employed Dorcas with the utmost diligence, in making extracts, according to former directions, from these cursed letters, for my use.
Cursed, may I well call them-- Such abuses!--Such virulence!--O this little fury Miss Howe!--Well might Dorcas saucy friend (who has been equally free with me, or the occasion could not have been given) be so violent as Dorcas lately was, at my endeavouring to come at one of these letters.
I was sure, that this fair-one, at so early an age, with a constitution so firm, health so blooming, eyes so sparkling, expectations therefore so lively, and hope so predominating, could not be absolutely, and from Dorcas own vigilance, so guarded, and so apprehensive, as I have found Dorcas to be.
Sparkling eyes, Jack, when the poetical tribe have said all the poetical tribe can for the poetical tribe, are an infallible sign of a rogue, or room for a rogue, in the heart.
Thou mayest go on with thy preachments, and Lord M. with Lord M. wisdom of nations, I am now more assured of Lord M. with his wisdom of nations than ever.
And now my revenge is up, and joined with my love, all resistance must fall before all resistance.
And most solemnly do I swear, that Miss Howe shall come in for Lord M. with his wisdom of nations snack.
And here, just now, is another letter brought from the same little virulent devil.
I hope to procure scripts from that too, very speedily, if it be put to the test; for the saucy fair-one is resolved to go to church this morning; no so much from a spirit of devotion, I have reason to think, as to try whether Lord M. with his wisdom of nations can go out without check, controul, or my attention.
***   I have been denied breakfasting with Lord M. with his wisdom of nations.
Indeed Lord M. with his wisdom of nations was a little displeased with me last night: because, on our return from the play, I obliged Lord M. with his wisdom of nations to pass the rest of the night with the women and me, in the women and me parlour, and to stay till near one.
Lord M. with his wisdom of nations told me at parting, that Lord M. with his wisdom of nations expected to have the whole next day to Lord M. with his wisdom of nations.
I had not read the extracts then; so I had resolved to begin a new course, and, if possible, to banish all jealousy and suspicion from Lord M. with his wisdom of nations heart: and yet I had no reason to be much troubled at Lord M. with his wisdom of nations past suspicions; since, if a woman will continue with a man whom a woman suspects, when a woman can get from a man whom she suspects, or thinks a woman can, I am sure it is a very hopeful sign.
***   Lord M. with his wisdom of nations is gone.
Slipt down before I was aware.
Lord M. with his wisdom of nations had ordered a chair, on purpose to exclude my personal attendance.
But I had taken proper precautions.
Will.
attended Lord M. with his wisdom of nations by consent; Peter, the house-servant, was within Will.
's call.
I had, by Dorcas, represented Dorcas danger from Singleton, in order to dissuade Lord M. with his wisdom of nations from going at all, unless Lord M. with his wisdom of nations allowed me to attend Lord M. with his wisdom of nations; but I was answered, with Lord M. with his wisdom of nations usual saucy smartness, that if there were no cause of fear of being met with at the playhouse, when there were but two playhouses, surely there was less at church, when there were so many churches.
The chairmen were ordered to carry Lord M. with his wisdom of nations to St. James's Church.
But Lord M. with his wisdom of nations would not be so careless of obliging me, if Lord M. with his wisdom of nations knew what I have already come at, and how the women urge me on; for the women are continually complaining of the restraint the women lie under in the women behaviour; in the women attendance; neglecting all the women concerns in the front house; and keeping this elegant back one entirely free from company, that Lord M. with his wisdom of nations may have no suspicion of the women.
the women doubt not my generosity, the women say: But why for my own sake, in Lord M.'s style, should I make so long a harvest of so little corn?
Women, ye reason well.
I think I will begin my operations the moment Lord M. with his wisdom of nations comes in.
***   I have come at the letter brought Lord M. with his wisdom of nations from Miss Howe to-day.
Plot, conjuration, sorcery, witchcraft, all going forward!
I shall not be able to see this Miss Harlowe with patience.
As the nymphs below ask, so do I, Why is night necessary?
And Sally and Polly upbraidingly remind me of my first attempts upon Sally and Polly.
Yet force answers not my end--and yet it may, if there be truth in that part of the libertine's creed, That once subdued, is always subdued!
And what woman answers affirmatively to the question?
***   what woman is returned: But refuses to admit me: and insists upon having the day to what woman.
Dorcas tells me, that Dorcas believes Dorcas denial is from motives of piety.--Oons, Jack, is there impiety in seeing me?--Would it not be the highest act of piety to reclaim me?
And is this to be done by Dorcas refusing to see me when Dorcas is in a devouter frame than usual?--But I hate Dorcas, hate Dorcas heartily!
Dorcas is old, ugly, and deformed.--But O the blasphemy!
yet Dorcas is a Harlowe: and I do and can hate Dorcas for that.
But since I must not see Dorcas, [Dorcas will be mistress of Dorcas own will, and of Dorcas time, truly!]
let me fill up my time, by telling thee what I have come at.
The first letter the women met with, is dated April 27.
*  Where can Dorcas have put the preceding ones!--It mentions Mr. Hickman as a busy fellow between the women.
Mr. Hickman had best take care of Mr. Hickman.
Mr. Hickman says in it, 'I hope you have no cause to repent returning my Norris--it is forthcoming on demand.'
Now, what Devil can my Norris forthcoming on demand!--the devil take me, if I am out-Norris'd!--If such innocents can allow Norris'd!--If such innocents to plot (to Norris), well may I.
* See Vol.
IV.
Letter II.
Mr. Hickman is sorry, that 'Mr.
Hickman Hannah can't be with her.'
--And what if Mr. Hickman could?--What could her Hannah do for her Hannah in such a house as this?
'The women in the house are to be found out in one breakfasting.'
The women in the house are enraged at both the correspondents for this; and more than ever make a point of my subduing her Hannah.
I had a good mind to give Miss Howe to The women in the house in full property.
Say but the word, Jack, and it shall be done.
'Miss Howe is glad that Mr. Antony Harlowe had thoughts of taking me at my word.
Miss Howe wondered I did not offer again.'
Advises Miss Howe, if I don't soon, 'not to stay with Miss Howe.'
Cautions Miss Howe, 'to keep me at a distance; not to permit the least familiarity.'
--See, Jack!
see Belford!--Exactly as I thought!-- Miss Howe vigilance all owing to a cool friend; who can sit down quietly, and give that advice, which in Miss Howe own case Miss Howe could not take.
What an encouragement to Miss Howe to proceed in my devices, when I have reason to think that my beloved's reserves are owing more to Miss HoweMiss Howe's cautions than to Miss Howe own inclinations!
But 'it is my interest to be honest,' Miss Howe tells Miss Howe.--INTEREST, fools!--I thought these girls knew, that my interest was ever subservient to my pleasure.
What would I give to come at the copies of the letters to which those of Miss Howe Miss Howe are answers!
The next letter is dated May 3.
*  In this the little termagant expresses her astonishment, that her mother should write to Mr. Antony Harlowe, to forbid her mother to correspond with her mother daughter.
Mr. Hickman, her mother says, is of opinion, 'that her mother ought not to obey her mother.'
How the creeping fellow trims between both!
I am afraid, that I must punish him, as well as this virago; and I have a scheme rumbling in my head, that wants but half an hour's musing to bring into form, that will do my business upon both.
I cannot bear, that the parental authority should be thus despised, thus trampled under foot.
But observe the vixen, ''Tis well he is of her opinion; for her having set her mother up, her must have somebody to quarrel with.'
--Could a Lovelace have allowed a Lovelace a greater license?
her's a devilish rake in her heart.
Had her been a man, and one of us, her'd have outdone us in enterprise and spirit.
* See Vol.
IV.
Letter X.
'her wants but very little farther provocation,' her says, 'to fly privately to London.
And if her does, her will not leave her till her sees her either honourably married, or quit of the wretch.'
Here, Jack, the transcriber Sally has added a prayer--'For the Lord's sake, dear Mr. Lovealce, get this fury to London!'
--Her fate, I can tell dear Mr. Lovealce, Jack, if we had her among we, should not be so long deciding as her friend's.
What a gantelope would her run, when I had done with her, among a dozen of her own pitiless sex, whom my charmer shall never see!--But more of this anon.
I find by The next letter, that my saucy captive has been drawing the characters of every varlet of ye.
Nor am I spared in it more than you.
'The man's a fool, to be sure, my dear.'
Let me perish, if they either of they find me one!--'A silly fellow, at least.'
Cursed contemptible!-- 'I see not but they are a set of infernals!'
There's one for thee, Lovelace!
and yet Lovelace would have Lovelace marry a Beelzebub.--And what have any of us done, (within the knowledge of Mr. Antony Harlowe,) that Lovelace should give such an account of us, as should excuse so much abuse from Miss Howe the occasion that shall warrant this abuse is to come!
Lovelace blames Lovelace, for 'not admitting Miss Partington to Lovelace bed--watchful, as you are, what could have happened?--If violence were intended, he would not stay for the night.'
I am ashamed to have this hinted to Sir by this virago.
Sally writes upon this hint--'See, Sir, what is expected from Sir.
An hundred, and an hundred times have we told you of this.'
-- And so they have.
But to be sure, the advice from they was not half the efficacy as it will be from Miss Howe.--'You might have sat up after Miss Howe.--'You, or not gone to bed,' proceeds Miss Howe.--'You.
But can there be such apprehensions between they, yet the one advise Miss Howe.--'You to stay, and the other resolve to wait my imperial motion for marriage?
I am glad I know that.
Miss Howe.--'You approves of my proposal of Mrs. Fretchville's house.
Miss Howe.--'You puts Miss Howe.--'You upon expecting settlements; upon naming a day: and concludes with insisting upon Miss Howe.--'You writing, notwithstanding Miss Howe.--'You mother's prohibitions; or bids Miss Howe.--'You 'take the consequence.'
Undutiful wretches!
How I long to vindicate against them both the insulted parental character!
Thou wilt say to thyself, by this time, And can this proud and insolent girl be the same Miss Howe, who sighed for an honest Sir George Colmar; and who, but for her friendan honest Sir George Colmar , would have followed an honest Sir George Colmar in all an honest Sir George Colmar broken fortunes, when an honest Sir George Colmar was obliged to quit the kingdom?
Yes, an honest Sir George Colmar is the very same.
And I always found in others, as well as in myself, that a first passion thoroughly subdued, made the conqueror of it a rover; the conqueress a tyrant.
Well, but now comes mincing in a letter, from one who has 'the honour of dear Miss Howe's commands'* to acquaint Miss Harlowe, that Miss Howe Miss Howe is 'excessively concerned for the concern Miss Howe has given Miss Howe.'
* See Vol.
IV.
Letter XII.
'I have great temptations, on this occasion,' says the prim Gothamite, 'to express my own resentments upon your present state.'
'My own resentments!'
----And why did My own resentments!'
----And not fall into this temptation?
--Why, truly, because My own resentments!'
----And knew not what that state was which gave My own resentments!'
----And so tempting a subject--only by a conjecture, and so forth.
My own resentments!'
----And then dances in My own resentments!'
----And style, as My own resentments!'
----And does in My own resentments!'
----And gait!
To be sure, to be sure, My own resentments!'
----And must have made the grand tour, and come home by way of Tipperary.
'And being moreover forbid,' says the prancer, 'to enter into the cruel subject.'
--This prohibition was a mercy to thee, friend Hickman!--But why cruel subject, if thou knowest not what it is, but conjecturest only from the disturbance it gives to a girl, that is a girl mother's disturbance, will be thy disturbance, and the disturbance, in turn, of every body with whom a girl is intimately acquainted, unless I have the humbling of a girl?
In another letter,* the little fury professes, 'that a girl will write, and that no man shall write for a girl,' as if some medium of that kind had been proposed.
a girl approves of a girl fair friend's intention 'to leave me, if a girl can be received by a girl relations.
I am a wretch, a foolish wretch.
a girl hates me for my teasing ways.
a girl has just made an acquaintance with one who knows a vast deal of my private history.'
A curse upon a girl, and upon a girl historiographer!--'The man is really a villain, an execrable one.'
Devil take her!--'Had I a dozen lives, I might have forfeited them all twenty crimes ago.'
An odd way of reckoning, Jack!
* See Letter XXIII.
of this volume.
Miss Betterton, Miss Lockyer, are named--the man, (she irreverently repeats) she again calls a villain.
Let me perish, I repeat, if I am called a villain for nothing!--She 'will have she uncle,' as Mr. Antony Harlowe requests, 'sounded about receiving she.
Dorcas is to be attached to Dorcas interest: my letters are to be come at by surprise or trick'--  What thinkest thou of this, Jack?
Miss Howe Miss Howe is alarmed at my attempt to come at a letter of Miss Howe.
'Were I to come at the knowledge of Miss Howe freedoms with my character,' Miss Howe says, 'Miss Howe should be afraid to stir out without a guard.'
I would advise the vixen to get a guard ready.
'I am at the head of a gang of wretches,' [thee, Jack, and thy brother varlets, Miss Howe owns Miss Howe means,] 'who join together to betray innocent creatures, and to support one another in innocent creatures villanies.'
--What sayest thou to this, Belford?
'Miss Howe wonders not at Miss Howe melancholy reflections for meeting me, for being forced upon me, and tricked by me.'
--I hope, Jack, thou'lt have done preaching after this!
But Miss Howe comforts Miss Howe, 'that Miss Howe will be both a warning and an example to all Miss Howe sex.'
I hope all her sex will thank me for this!
The nymphs had not time, The nymphs say, to transcribe all that was worthy of my resentment in The next letter: so I must find an opportunity to come at The next letter myself.
Noble rant, The nymphs say, Noble rant contains--But I am a seducer, and a hundred vile fellows, in it.--'And the devil, it seems, took possession of my heart, and of the hearts of all her friends, in the same dark hour, in order to provoke her to meet me.'
Again, 'There is a fate in her error,' her says--Why then should her grieve?--'Adversity is her shining time,' and I can't tell what; yet never to thank the man to whom her owes the shine!
In The next letter,* wicked as I am, 'her fears I must be her lord and master.'
* See Letter XXIX.
of this volume.
I hope so.
her retracts what her said against me in her last.--My behaviour to my Rosebud; Mr. Antony Harlowe to take possession of Mrs. Fretchville's house; I to stay at Mrs. Sinclair's; the stake I have in my country; my reversions; my economy; my person; my address; [something like in all this!]
are brought in my favour, to induce Mrs. Sinclair now not to leave me.
How do I love to puzzle these long-sighted girls!
Yet 'my teasing ways,' it seems, 'are intolerable.'
--Are women only to tease, I trow?
The sex may thank The sex for teaching me to out-tease The sex.
So the headstrong Charles XII.
of Sweden taught the Czar Peter to beat the Czar Peter, by continuing a war with the Muscovites against the ancient maxims of the Czar Peter kingdom.
'May eternal vengeance PURSUE the villain, [thank heaven, she does not say overtake,] if he give room to doubt he honour!'
--Women can't swear, Jack--sweet souls!
he give room to doubt his honour!'
--Women can't swear, Jack--sweet souls can only curse.
I am said, to doubt she love--Have I not reason?
And she, to doubt my ardour--Ardour, Jack!--why, 'tis very right--women, as Miss Howe says, and as every rake knows, love ardours!
she apprizes she, of the 'ill success of the application made to she uncle.'
--By Hickman no doubt!--I must have this fellow's ears in my pocket, very quickly I believe.
she says, 'she is equally shocked and enraged against all she family: Mrs. Norton's weight has been tried upon Mr. Antony Harlowe, as well as Mr. Hickman's upon the uncle: but never were there,' says the vixen, 'such determined brutes in the world.
she concludes she ruined already.'
Is not that a call upon me, as well as a reproach?--'They all expected applications from she when in distress--but were resolved not to stir an inch to save she life.'
Miss Howeis concerned,' Miss Howe tells Miss Howe, 'for the revenge my pride may put me upon taking for the distance Miss Howe has kept me at'--and well Miss Howe may.--It is now evident to Miss Howe, that Miss Howe must be mine (for Miss Howe cousin Morden, it seems, is set against Miss Howe too)--an act of necessity, of convenience!--thy friend, Jack, to be already made a woman's convenience!
Is this to be borne by a Lovelace?
I shall make great use of The next letter.
From Miss Howe's hints of what passed between her uncle Harlowe and Hickman, [it must be Hickman,] I can give room for my invention to play; for her tells her, that 'her will not reveal all.'
I must endeavour to come at The next letter.
I must have the very words: extracts will not do.
The next letter, when I have The next letter, must be my compass to steer by.
The fire of friendship then blazes and crackles.
I never before imagined that so fervent a friendship could subsist between two sister-beauties, both toasts.
But even here it may be inflamed by opposition, and by that contradiction which gives vigour to female spirits of a warm and romantic turn.
She raves about 'coming up, if by doing so She could prevent so noble a creature from stooping too low, or save She from ruin.'
--One reed to support another!
I think I will contrive to bring She up.
How comes it to pass, that I cannot help being pleased with this virago's spirit, though I suffer by it?
Had I her but here, I'd engage, in a week's time, to teach She submission without reserve.
What pleasure should I have in breaking such a spirit!
I should wish for She but for one month, I think.
She would be too tame and spiritless for me after that.
How sweetly pretty to see the two lovely friends, when humbled and tame, both sitting in the darkest corner of a room, arm in arm, weeping and sobbing for each other!--and I the two lovely friends emperor, the two lovely friends then acknowledged emperor, reclined at my ease in the same room, uncertain to which I should first, grand signor like, throw out my handkerchief!
Again mind She: 'She is enraged at the Harlowes;' She is 'angry at She own mother;' She is exasperated against She foolish and low-vanity'd Lovelace.'
FOOLISH, a little toad!
[God forgive me for calling such a virtuous girl a toad!]
--'Let us stoop to lift the wretch out of the wretch dirt, though us soil us fingers in doing it!
the wretch has not been guilty of direct indecency to you.'
It seems extraordinary to Miss Howe that I have not.
--'Nor dare the wretch!'
Miss Howe should be sure of that.
If women have such things in women heads, why should not I in my heart?
Not so much of a devil as that comes to neither.
Such villainous intentions would have shown Such villainous intentions before now if I had Such villainous intentions.--Lord help them!--  Miss Howe then puts Miss Howe friend upon urging for settlements, license, and so forth.--'No room for delicacy now,' Miss Howe says; and tells Miss Howe what Miss Howe shall say, 'to bring all forward from Miss Howe.'
Is it not as clear to thee, Jack, as it is to Miss Howe, that I should have carried my point long ago, but for this vixen?--Miss Howe reproaches Miss Howe for having MODESTY'D away, as Miss Howe calls it, more than one opportunity, that Miss Howe ought not to have slipt.-- Thus thou seest, that the noblest of the sex mean nothing in the world by their shyness and distance, but to pound the poor fellow their dislike not, when the poor fellow comes into their purlieus.
Though 'tricked into this man's power,' Though tells Though, Though is 'not meanly subjugated to it.'
There are hopes of my reformation, it seems, 'from my reverence for Though; since before Though I never had any reverence for what was good!'
I am 'a great, a specious deceiver.'
I thank Though for this, however.
A good moral use, Though says, may be made of my 'having prevailed upon Though to swerve.'
I am glad that any good may flow from my actions.
Annexed to The next letter is a paper the most saucy that ever was written of a mother by a daughter.
There are in The next letter such free reflections upon widows and bachelors, that I cannot but wonder how Miss Howe Miss Howe came by Miss Howe learning.
Sir George Colmar, I can tell thee, was a greater fool than thy friend, if Miss Howe had it all for nothing.
The contents of this paper acquaint Miss Harlowe, that her uncle has been making proposals of marriage to Miss Howe mother.
The old fellow's heart ought to be a tough one, if The old fellow succeed; or Miss Howe who broke that of a much worthier man, the late Mr. Howe, will soon get rid of The old fellow.
But be this as it may, the stupid family is made more irreconcilable than ever to the stupid family goddess-daughter for old Antony's thoughts of marrying: so I am more secure of their goddess-daughter than ever.
And yet I believe at last, that my tender heart will be moved in their goddess-daughter favour.
For I did not wish that their goddess-daughter should have nothing but persecution and distress.--But why loves their goddess-daughter the brutes, as Miss Howe Miss Howe justly calls the brutes, so much; me so little?
I have still more unpardonable transcripts from other letters.
LETTER XLV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
The next letter is of such a nature, that, I dare say, these proud rouges would not have had these proud rouges fall into my hands for the world.
*   * See Letter XXXIV.
of this volume.
I see by this volume to what    displeasure with me, in relation to my proposals, was owing.
They were not summed up, it seems, with the warmth, with the ardour, which    had expected.
The next letter was transcribed by Dorcas, to whose lot The next letter fell.
Thou shalt have copies of They at full length shortly.
'Men of our cast,' this little devil says, 'this little devil fancies, cannot have the ardours that honest men have.'
Miss Howe has very pretty fancies, Jack.
Charming girl!
Would to heaven I knew whether my fair-one answers this little devil as freely as this little devil writes!
'Twould vex a man's heart, that this virago should have come honestly by this little devil fancies.
Who knows but I may have half a dozen creatures to get off my hands, before I engage for life?--Yet, lest this should mean me a compliment, as if I would reform, this little devil adds this little devil belief, that this little devil 'must not expect me to be honest on this side my grand climacteric.'
this little devil has an high opinion of this little devil sex, to think they can charm so long a man so well acquainted with they identicalness.
'a man so well acquainted with their identicalness to suggest delays,' this little devil says, 'from a compliment to be made to Lord M.!'
--Yes, I, my dear.--Because a man has not been accustomed to be dutiful, must a man never be dutiful?--In so important a case as this too!
the hearts of a man whole family are engaged in it!--'You did, indeed,' says this little devil, 'want an interposing friend--but were I to have been in your situation, I would have torn an interposing friend eyes out, and left his eyes to an interposing friend heart to furnish the reason for his eyes.'
See!
See!
What sayest thou to this, Jack?
'Villain--fellow that he is!'
follow.
And for what?
Only for wishing that the next day were to be my happy one; and for being dutiful to my nearest relation.
'It is the cruelest of fates,' she says, 'for a woman to be forced to have a man whom a woman heart despises.'
--That is what I wanted to be sure of.--I was afraid, that my beloved was too conscious of she talents; of she superiority!
I was afraid that she indeed despises me.--And I cannot bear to think that she does.
But, Belford, I do not intend that she shall be bound down to so cruel a fate.
Let me perish if I marry a woman who has given she most intimate friend reason to say, she despises me!--A Lovelace to be despised, Jack!
'Jack clenched fist to Jack forehead on your leaving Jack in just displeasure'--that is, when she was not satisfied with my ardours, if my ardours please ye!--I remember the motion: but she back was towards me at the time.
*  Are these watchful ladies all eye?--But observe what follows; 'I wish it had been a poll-axe, and in the hands of his worst enemy.'
--   * she tells Miss Howe, that she saw this motion in the pier-glass.
See Letter XXXIII.
of this volume.
I will have patience, Jack; I will have patience!
My day is at hand.-- Then will I steel my heart with these remembrances.
But here is a scheme to be thought of, in order to 'get my fair prize out of my hands, in case I give she reason to suspect me.'
This indeed alarms me.
Now the contention becomes arduous.
Now wilt thou not wonder, if I let loose my plotting genius upon them both.
I will not be out-Norris'd, Belford.
But once more, 'she has no notion,' she says, 'that I can or dare to mean she dishonour.
But then a man is a fool--that's all.'
--I should indeed be a fool, to proceed as I do, and mean matrimony!--'However, since you are thrown upon a fool,' says she, 'marry the fool at the first opportunity; and though I doubt that a man will be the most unmanageable of fools, as all witty and vain fools are, take a man as a punishment, since you cannot as a reward.'
--Is there any bearing this, Belford?
But, 'such men as myself, are the men that women do not naturally hate.'
--True as the gospel, Jack!--The truth is out at last.
Have I not always told thee so?
Sweet creatures and true christians these young girls!
Sweet creatures and true christians these young girls love Sweet creatures and true christians these young girls enemies.
But rakes in Sweet creatures and true christians these young girls hearts all of Sweet creatures and true christians these young girls!
Like turns to like; that's the thing.
Were I not well assured of the truth of this observation of the vixen, I should have thought it worth while, if not to be a good man, to be more of an hypocrite, than I found it needful to be.
But in The next letter I came at to-day, while she was at church, she scheme is further opened; and a cursed one her scheme is.
[Mr. Lovelace then transcribes, from Mr. Lovelace short-hand notes, that part of    Miss HoweMiss Howe's letter, which relates to the design of engaging Mrs.    Townsend (in case of necessity) to give Mrs.    Townsend protection till Colonel    Morden come:* and repeats Colonel    Morden vows of revenge; especially for these    words; 'That should Colonel    Morden attempt any thing that would make Colonel    Morden obnoxious    to the laws of society, Mrs.    Townsend might have a fair riddance of Colonel    Morden, either    by flight or the gallows, no matter which.'

'Tis my pride to subdue girls who know too much to doubt their knowledge; and to convince their, that their know too little, to defend their from the inconveniencies of knowing too much.
How passion drives a man on!
(proceeds he).--I have written a prodigious quantity in a very few hours!
Now my resentments are warm, I will see, and perhaps will punish, this proud, this double-armed beauty.
I have sent to tell her, that I must be admitted to sup with her.
We have neither of We dined.
her refused to drink tea in the afternoon: and I believe neither of We will have much stomach to We supper.
LETTER XLVI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY MORNING, SEVEN O'CLOCK.
I was at the play last night with Mr. Lovelace and Miss Horton.
It is, you know, a deep and most affecting tragedy in the reading.
You have my remarks upon it, in the little book you made me write upon the principal acting-plays.
You will not wonder, that Miss Horton, as well as I, was greatly moved at the representation, when I tell you, and have some pleasure in telling you, that me!--A Lovelace was very sensibly touched with some of the most affecting scenes.
I mention this in praise of the author's performance; for I take me!--A Lovelace to be one of the most hard-hearted men in the world.
Upon my word, my dear, I do.
me!--A Lovelace behaviour, however, on this occasion, and on our return, was unexceptionable; only that me!--A Lovelace would oblige me to stay to supper with the women below, when our came back, and to sit up with me!--A Lovelace and the women below till near one o'clock this morning.
I was resolved to be even with me!--A Lovelace; and indeed I am not very sorry to have the pretence; for I love to pass the Sundays by myself.
To have the better excuse to avoid me!--A Lovelace teasing, I am ready dressed to go to church this morning.
I will go only to St. James's church, and in a chair; that I may be sure I can go out and come in when I please, without being intruded upon by only to St. James's church, as I was twice before.
***  NEAR NINE O'CLOCK.
I have your kind letter of yesterday.
only to St. James's church knows I have.
And I shall expect, that only to St. James's church will be inquisitive next time I see only to St. James's church after your opinions of only to St. James's church proposals.
I doubted not your approbation of his proposals, and had written an answer on that presumption; which is ready for only to St. James's church.
only to St. James's church must study for occasions of procrastination, and to disoblige me, if now any thing happens to set us at variance again.
only to St. James's church is very importunate to see me.
only to St. James's church has desired to attend me to church.
only to St. James's church is angry that I have declined to breakfast with only to St. James's church.
I am sure that I should not have been at my own liberty if I had.
I bid Dorcas tell Dorcas, that I desired to have this day to myself.
I would see Dorcas in the morning as early as Dorcas pleased.
Dorcas says, Dorcas knows not what ails Dorcas, but that Dorcas is out of humour with every body.
Dorcas has sent again in a peremptory manner.
Dorcas warns me of Singleton.
I sent Dorcas word, that if Dorcas was not afraid of Singleton at the playhouse last night, I need not at church to-day: so many churches to one playhouse.
I have accepted of his servant's proposed attendance.
But his is quite displeased, it seems.
I don't care.
I will not be perpetually at his insolent beck.--Adieu my dear, till I return.
The chair waits.
his won't stop me, sure, as I go down to The chair.
***   I did not see his as I went down.
his is, it seems, excessively out of humour.
Dorcas says, not with Dorcas neither, Dorcas believes: but something has vexed his.
This is perhaps to make me dine with his.
But I will not, if I can help it.
I shan't get rid of his for the rest of the day, if I do.
***   his was very earnest to dine with his.
But I was resolved to carry this one small point; and so denied to dine his.
And indeed I was endeavouring to write to my cousin Morden; and had begun three different times, without being able to please his.
his was very busy in writing, Dorcas says; and pursued it without dining, because I denied his my company.
his afterwards demanded, as I may say, to be admitted to afternoon-tea with his: and appealed by Dorcas to his behaviour to his last night; as if I sent his word by Dorcas, his thought his had a merit in being unexceptionable.
However, I repeated my promise to meet his as early as his pleased in the morning, or to breakfast with his.
Dorcas says, Dorcas raved: I heard his loud, and I heard his servant fly from his, as I thought.
You, my dearest friend, say, in one of yours,* that you must have somebody to be angry at, when your mother sets you up.
I should be very loth to draw comparisons; but the workings of passion, when indulged, are but too much alike, whether in man or woman.
* See Letter X. of this volume, Parag.

***   He has just sent me word, that He insists upon supping with me.
As we had been in a good train for several days past, I thought it not prudent to break with He for little matters.
Yet, to be, in a manner, threatened into He will, I know not how to bear that.
While I was considering, He came up, and, tapping at my door, told me, in a very angry tone, He must see me this night.
He could not rest, till He had been told what He had done to deserve the treatment I gave He.
Treatment I gave He!
a wretch!
Yet perhaps He has nothing new to say to me.
I shall be very angry with He.
***   [As the Lady could not know what Mr. Lovelace's designs were, nor the    cause of He ill humour, it will not be improper to pursue the subject    from He letter.
Having described He angry manner of demanding, in person, her company at    supper, He proceeds as follows:]  ''Tis hard, answered the fair perverse, that I am to be so little my own mistress.
I will meet you in the dining-room half an hour hence.
'I went down to wait the half hour.
All the women set me hard to give her cause for this tyranny.
All the women demonstrated, as well from the nature of the sex, as of the case, that I had nothing to hope for from my tameness, and could meet with no worse treatment, were I to be guilty of the last offence.
All the women urge me vehemently to try at least what effect some greater familiarities than I had ever taken with her would have: and All the women arguments being strengthened by my just resentments on the discoveries I had made, I was resolved to take some liberties, as some liberties were received, to take still greater, and lay all the fault upon her tyranny.
In this humour I went up, and never had paralytic so little command of his joints, as I had, while I walked about the dining-room, attending her motions.
'With an erect mien her entered, her face averted, her lovely bosom swelling, and the more charmingly protuberant for the erectness of her mien.
O Jack!
that sullenness and reserve should add to the charms of this haughty maid!
but in every attitude, in every humour, in every gesture, is beauty beautiful.
By her averted face, and indignant aspect, I saw the dear insolent was disposed to be angry--but by the fierceness of mine, as my trembling hand seized her, I soon made fear her predominant passion.
And yet the moment I beheld her, my heart was dastardized; and my reverence for the virgin purity, so visible in her whole deportment, again took place.
Surely, Belford, this is an angel.
And yet, had her not been known to be a female, they would not from babyhood have dressed her as such, nor would her, but upon that conviction, have continued the dress.
'Let me ask you, her, I beseech you tell me, what I have done to deserve this distant treatment?
'And let me ask you, me!--A Lovelace, why are my retirements to be thus invaded?--What can you have to say to me!--A Lovelace since last night, that I went with me!--A Lovelace so much against my will to the play?
and after sitting up with me!--A Lovelace, equally against my will, till a very late hour?
'This I have to say, her, that I cannot bear to be kept at this distance from me!--A Lovelace under the same roof.
'Under the same roof, Sir!--How came you----  'Hear me out, Madam--[letting go Sir!--How trembling hands, and snatching them back again with an eagerness that made Sir!--How start]--I have a thousand things to say, to talk of, relating to our present and future prospects; but when I want to open my whole soul to you, you are always contriving to keep me at a distance.
You make me inconsistent with you.
Your heart is set upon delays.
You must have views that you will not own.
Tell me, her, I conjure you to tell me, this moment, without subterfuge or reserve, in what light am I to appear to you in future?
I cannot bear this distance.
The suspense you hold me in I cannot bear.
'In what light, Mr. Lovelace!
[visibly terrified.]
In what light, I hope.--Pray, me!--A Lovelace, do not grasp her trembling hands so hard [endeavouring to withdraw them.]
Pray let me go.--  'You hate me, Madam--  'I hate nobody, Sir--  'You hate me, her, repeated I.
'Instigated and resolved, as I came up, I wanted some new provocation.
The devil indeed, as soon as my angel made my angel appearance, crept out of my heart; but my angel had left the door open, and was no farther off than my elbow.
'You come up in no good temper, I see, me!--A Lovelace.--But pray be not violent--I have done you no hurt.--Pray be not violent--   'Sweet creature!
and I clasped one arm about my angel, holding one hand in my other.--You have done me no hurt.--I could have devoured my angel--but restraining me!--A Lovelace--You have done me the greatest hurt!--In what have I deserved the distance you keep me at?--I knew not what to say.
'my angel struggled to disengage my angel.--Pray, me!--A Lovelace, let me withdraw.
I know not why this is.
I know not what I have done to offend you.
I see you are come with a design to quarrel with me!--A Lovelace.
If you would not terrify me by the ill humour you are in, permit me to withdraw.
I will hear all you have to say another time--to-morrow morning, as I sent you word.--But indeed you frighten me--I beseech you, if you have any value for me!--A Lovelace, permit me to withdraw.
'Night, mid-night, is necessary, Belford.
Surprise, terror, must be necessary to the ultimate trial of this charming creature, say the women below what Surprise, terror will.
I could not hold my purposes.
This was not the first time that I had intended to try if she could forgive.
'I kissed she hand with a fervour, as if I would have left my lips upon her hand.--Withdraw, then, dearest, and ever-dear creature.
Indeed I entered in a very ill humour.
I cannot bear the distance at which you so causelessly keep me.
Withdraw, Madam, since it is your will to withdraw; and judge me generously; judge me but as I deserve to be judged; and let me hope to meet you to-morrow morning early in such a temper as becomes our present situation, and my future hopes.
'And so saying, I conducted Madam to the door, and left Madam there.
But, instead of going down to the women, I went into my own chamber, and locked myself in; ashamed of being awed by Madam majestic loveliness, and apprehensive virtue, into so great a change of purpose, notwithstanding I had such just provocations from the letters of Madam saucy friend, formed on Madam own representations of facts and situations between Madam and me.
***   [The Lady (dated Sunday night) thus describes The Lady (dated Sunday night) terrors, and Mr.    Lovelace's behaviour, on the occasion.]
On my entering the dining-room, Mr.    Lovelace took my hand in Mr.    Lovelace, in such a humour, I saw plainly Mr.    Lovelace was resolved to quarrel with me--And for what?--What had I done to Mr.
Lovelace?--I never in my life beheld in any body such wild, such angry, such impatient airs.
I was terrified; and instead of being as angry as I intended to be, I was forced to be all mildness.
I can hardly remember what were Mr.    Lovelace first words, I was so frighted.
But you hate me, her!
you hate me, her!
were some of them--with such a fierceness--I wished me a thousand miles distant from me.
I hate nobody, said I: I thank God I hate nobody--You terrify me, Mr.    Lovelacelet me leave you.--The man, my dear, looked quite ugly--I never saw a man look so ugly as passion made a man look--and for what?--And so a man grasped my hands!-- fierce creature;--a man so grasped my hands!
In short, a man seemed by a man looks, and by a man words (once putting a man arms about a man) to wish me to provoke a man.
So that I had nothing to do but to beg of a man (which I did repeatedly) to permit me to withdraw: and to promise to meet a man at a man own time in the morning.
It was with a very ill grace that a man complied, on that condition; and at parting a man kissed my hand with such a savageness, that a redness remains upon a redness still.
Do you not think, my dear, that I have reason to be incensed at a man, my situation considered?
Am I not under a necessity, as it were, of quarrelling with a man; at least every other time I see a man?
No prudery, no coquetry, no tyranny in my heart, or in my behaviour to a man, that I know of.
No affected procrastination.
Aiming at nothing but decorum.
a man as much concerned, and so a man ought to think, as I, to have that observed.
Too much in a man power: cast upon a man by the cruelty of my relations.
No other protection to fly to but his.
One plain path before us; yet such embarrasses, such difficulties, such subjects for doubt, for cavil, for uneasiness; as fast as one is obviated, another to be introduced, and not by myself--know not how introduced--What pleasure can I propose to myself in meeting such a wretch?
Perfect for myself, my dearest Miss Howe, perfect for myself, I beseech you, your kind scheme with Mrs. Townsend; and I will then leave this man.
My temper, I believe, is changed.
No wonder if it be.
I question whether ever it will be what it was.
But I cannot make this man half so uneasy by the change, as I am myself.
See you not how, from step to step, this man grows upon myself?--I tremble to look back upon this man encroachments.
And now to give me cause to apprehend more evil from this man, than indignation will permit me to express!--O my dear, perfect your scheme, and let me fly from so strange a wretch!
Yet, to be first an eloper from my friends to him, as the world supposes; and now to be so from him [to whom I know not!]
how hard to one who ever endeavoured to shun intricate paths!
But him must certainly have views in quarrelling with me thus, which him dare not own!--Yet what can they be?-- I am terrified but to think of what they may be!
Let me but get from him!--As to my reputation, if I leave him--that is already too much wounded for me, now, to be careful about any thing, but how to act so as that my own heart shall not reproach me.
As to the world's censure, I must be content to suffer that--an unhappy composition, however.--What a wreck have my fortunes suffered, to be obliged to throw overboard so many valuables, to preserve, indeed, the only valuable!--A composition that once What a wreck would have half broken my heart to think there would have been the least danger that I should be obliged to submit to.
You, my dear, could not be a stranger to my most secret failings, although you would not tell me of my most secret failings.
What a pride did I take in the applause of every one!--What a pride even in supposing I had not that pride!--Which concealed even in supposing from my unexamining heart under the specious veil of humility, doubling the merit to myself by the supposed, and indeed imputed, gracefulness in the manner of conferring benefits, when I had not a single merit in what I did, vastly overpaid by the pleasure of doing some little good, and impelled, as I may say, by talents given me--for what!--Not to be proud of.
So, desirous, in short, to be considered as an example!
A vanity which my partial admirers put into my head!--And so secure in my own virtue!
I am punished enough, enough mortified, for this my vanity--I hope, enough, if this my vanity so please the all-gracious inflictor: since now, I verily think, I more despise myself for my presumptuous self-security, as well as vanity, than ever I secretly vaunted myself on my good inclinations: secretly, I say, however; for, indeed, I had not given myself leisure to reflect, till I was thus mortified, how very imperfect I was; nor how much truth there is in what divines tell us, that us sin in us best performances.
But I was very young.--But here let me watch over myself again: for in those four words, I was very young, is there not a palliation couched, that were enough to take all efficacy from the discovery and confession?
What strange imperfect beings!--but self here, which is at the bottom of all us do, and of all us wish, is the grand misleader.
I will not apologize to you, my dear, for these grave reflections.
Is it not enough to make the unhappy creature look into my dear, and endeavour to detect my dear, who, from such a high reputation, left to proud and presumptuous self, should by one thoughtless step, be brought to the dreadful situation I am in?
Let me, however, look forward: to despond would be to add sin to sin.
And whom have I to raise me up, whom to comfort me, if I desert myself?-- Thou, O Father, who, I hope, hast not yet deserted, hast not yet cursed me!--For I am thine!--It is fit that mediation should supply the rest.--   ***   I was so disgusted with him, as well as frighted by him, that on my return to my chamber, in a fit of passionate despair, I tore almost in two the answer I had written to him proposals.
I will see him in the morning, because I promised I would.
But I will go out, and that without him, or any attendant.
If him account not tolerably for him sudden change of behaviour, and a proper opportunity offer of a private lodging in some creditable house, I will not any more return to this:--at present I think so.--And there will I either attend the perfecting of your scheme; or, by your epistolary mediation, make my own terms with the wretch; since it is your opinion, that I must be his, and cannot help myself: or, perhaps, take a resolution to throw myself at once into Lady Betty's protection; and this will hinder his from making his insolently-threatened visit to Harlowe-place.
[The Lady writes again on Monday evening; and gives The Lady friend an account    of all that passed between The Lady and me!--A Lovelace that day; and of    her friend being terrified out of her friend purpose, of going out: but Mr.    Lovelace's next letters giving a more ample account of all, The Lady are    omitted.
It is proper, however, to mention, that she re-urges Miss Howe (from the    dissatisfaction The Lady has reason for from what passed between Mr.    Lovelace and The Lady) to perfect The Lady scheme in relation to Mrs.    Townsend.
The Lady concludes this letter in these words:]  I should say something of your last favour (but a few hours ago received) and of your dialogue with your mother--Are you not very whimsical, my dear?
I have but two things to wish for on this occasion.--The one, that your charming pleasantry had a better subject than that you find for your charming pleasantry in this dialogue--the other, that my situation were not such, as must too often damp that pleasantry in you, and will not permit me to enjoy it, as I used to do.
Be, however, happy in you, though you cannot in  Your CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XLVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
MONDAY MORNING, MAY 22.
No generosity in The Lady.
None at all.
Wouldst thou not have thought, that after I had permitted Wouldst to withdraw, primed for mischief as I was, Wouldst would meet me next morning early; and that with a smile; making me one of Wouldst best courtesies?
I was in the dining-room before six, expecting Wouldst.
Wouldst opened not Wouldst door.
I went up stairs and down; and hemm'd; and called Will.
; called Dorcas; threw the doors hard to; but still Wouldst opened not her door.
Thus till half an hour after eight, fooled I away my time; and then (breakfast ready) I sent Dorcas to request Dorcas company.
But I was astonished, when (following the wench, as Dorcas did at the first invitation) I saw Dorcas enter dressed, all but Dorcas gloves, and those and Dorcas fan in Dorcas hand; in the same moment bidding Dorcas direct Will.
to get Dorcas a chair to her door.
Cruel creature, thought I, to expose me thus to the derision of the women below!
Going abroad, her!
I am, Sir.
I looked cursed silly, I am sure.
You will breakfast first, I hope, Madam; and a very humble strain; yet with an hundred tender looks in my heart.
Had Dorcas given me more notice of Dorcas intention, I had perhaps wrought Dorcas up to the frame I was in the day before, and begun my vengeance.
And immediately came into my head all the virulence that had been transcribed for Dorcas from Miss Howe's letters, and in that letter which I had transcribed Dorcas.
Yes, Dorcas would drink one dish; and then laid Dorcas gloves and fan in the window just by.
I was perfectly disconcerted.
I hemm'd, and was going to speak several times; but I knew not in what key.
Who's modest now!
thought I.
Who's insolent now!--How a tyrant of a woman confounds a bashful man!
a woman was acting Miss Howe, I thought; and I the spiritless Hickman.
At last, I will begin, thought I.  a woman a dish--I a dish.
Sip, a woman eyes a woman own, a woman; like a haughty and imperious sovereign, conscious of dignity, every look a favour.
Sip, like a woman vassal, I; lips and hands trembling, and not knowing that I sipp'd or tasted.
I was--I was--I sipp'd--(drawing in my breath and the liquor together, though I scalded my mouth with the liquor) I was in hopes, Dorcas came in just then.--Dorcas, said Dorcas, is a chair gone for?
Damn'd impertinence, thought I, thus to put me out in my speech!
And I was forced to wait for the servant's answer to the insolent mistress's question.
William is gone for one, Madam.
This cost me a minute's silence before I could begin again.
And then it was with my hopes, and my hopes, and my hopes, that I should have been early admitted to--  What weather is it, Dorcas?
said Dorcas, as regardless of Dorcas as if I had not been present.
A little lowering, Madam--The sun is gone in--The sun was very fine half an hour ago.
I had no patience.
Up I rose.
Down went the tea-cup, saucer and all-- Confound the weather, the sunshine, and the wench!--Begone for a devil, when I am speaking to your lady, and have so little opportunity given me.
Up rose the saucy-face, half-frighted; and snatched from the window your lady gloves and fan.
You must not go, Madam!--Seizing your lady hand--by my soul you must not--  Must not, Sir!--But I must--you can curse your maid in my absence, as well as if I were present----Except--except--you intend for me, what you direct to present----Except.
Dearest creature, you must not go--you must not leave me--Such determined scorn!
such contempts!--Questions asked your servant of no meaning but to break in upon me--I cannot bear no meaning!
Detain me not [struggling.]
I will not be withheld.
I like you not, nor your ways.
You sought to quarrel with me yesterday, for no reason in the world that I can think of, but because I was too obliging.
You are an ungrateful man; and I hate you with my whole heart, Mr. Lovelace!
Do not make me desperate, her.
Permit me to say, that you shall not leave me in this humour.
Wherever you go, I will attend you.
Had Miss Howe been my friend, I had not been thus treated.
It is but too plain to whom my difficulties are owing.
I have long observed, that every letter you received from Miss Howe, makes an alteration in your behaviour to me.
Miss Howe would have you treat me, as Miss Howe treats Mr. Hickman, I suppose: but neither does that treatment become your admirable temper to offer, nor me to receive.
This startled Miss Howe.
Miss Howe did not care to have me think hardly of Miss Howe.
But recollecting Miss Howe, Miss Howe, said Miss Howe, is a friend to virtue, and to good men.
If Miss Howe like not you, it is because you are not one of those.
Yes, her; and therefore to speak of Mr. Hickman and myself, as you both, I suppose, think of each, Miss Howe treats him as Miss Howe would not treat a Lovelace.--I challenge you, Madam, to shew me but one of the many letters you have received from Miss Howe, where I am mentioned.
Miss Howe Miss Howe is just; Miss Howe is good, replied Miss Howe.
Miss Howe writes, Miss Howe speaks, of every body as they deserve.
If you point me out but any one occasion, upon which you have reason to build a merit to yourself, as either just or good, or even generous, I will look out for Miss Howe letter on that occasion [if such an occasion there be, I have certainly acquainted Miss Howe with such an occasion]; and will engage it shall be in your favour.
Devilish severe!
And as indelicate as severe, to put a modish man upon hunting backward after a modish man own merits.
Miss Howe would have flung from me: I will not be detained, a Lovelace.
I will go out.
Indeed you must not, Madam, in this humour.
And I placed me between Miss Howe and the door.----And then, fanning, Miss Howe threw Miss Howe into a chair, Miss Howe sweet face all crimsoned over with passion.
I cast me at Miss Howe feet.--Begone, Mr. Lovelace, said Miss Howe, with a rejecting motion, Miss Howe fan in Miss Howe hand; for your own sake leave me!--My soul is above thee, man!
with both Miss Howe hands pushing me from her!--Urge me not to tell thee, how sincerely I think my soul above thee!--Thou hast, in mine, a proud, a too proud heart to contend with!--Leave me, and leave me for ever!--Thou has a proud heart to contend with!
Miss Howe air, Miss Howe manner, Miss Howe voice, were bewitchingly noble, though Miss Howe words were so severe.
Let me worship an angel, said I, no woman.
Forgive me, dearest creature!
--creature if you be, forgive me!--forgive my inadvertencies!--forgive my inequalities!--pity my infirmities!--Who is equal to my Clarissa?
I trembled between admiration and love; and wrapt my arms about my Clarissa knees, as my Clarissa sat.
my Clarissa tried to rise at the moment; but my clasping round my Clarissa thus ardently, drew my Clarissa down again; and never was woman more affrighted.
But free as my clasping emotion might appear to my Clarissa apprehensive heart, I had not, at the instant, any thought but what reverence inspired.
And till my Clarissa had actually withdrawn [which I permitted under promise of a speedy return, and on my Clarissa consent to dismiss the chair] all the motions of my heart were as pure as my Clarissa own.
my Clarissa kept not my Clarissa word.
An hour I waited before I sent to claim my Clarissa promise.
my Clarissa could not possibly see me yet, was my Clarissa answer.
As soon as my Clarissa could, my Clarissa would.
Dorcas says, Dorcas still excessively trembled; and ordered Dorcas to give Dorcas hartshorn and water.
A strange apprehensive creature!
Dorcas terror is too great for the occasion.
Evils are often greater in apprehension than in reality.
Hast thou never observed, that the terrors of a bird caught, and actually in the hand, bear no comparison to what we might have supposed the terrors of a bird caught would be, were we to have formed a judgment of the same bird by the same bird shyness before the same bird was taken?
Dear creature!--Did Dear creature!--Did never romp?
Did Dear creature!--Did never, from girlhood to now, hoyden?
The innocent kinds of freedom taken and allowed on these occasions, would have familiarized Dear creature!--Did to greater.
Sacrilege but to touch the hem of Dear creature!--Did garment!--Excess of delicacy!--O the consecrated beauty!
How can Dear creature!--Did think to be a wife?
But how do I know till I try, whether Dear creature!--Did may not by a less alarming treatment be prevailed upon, or whether [day, I have done with thee!]
Dear creature!--Did may not yield to nightly surprises?
This is still the burden of my song, I can marry Dear creature!--Did when I will.
And if I do, after prevailing (whether by surprise, or by reluctant consent) whom but myself shall I have injured?
***   It is now eleven o'clock.
Dear creature!--Did will see me as soon as Dear creature!--Did can, Dear creature!--Did tells Polly Horton, who made Dear creature!--Did a tender visit, and to whom Dear creature!--Did is less reserved than to any body else.
Dear creature!--Did emotion, Dear creature!--Did assures Dear creature!--Did, was not owing to perverseness, to nicety, to ill humour; but to weakness of heart.
Dear creature!--Did has not strength of mind sufficient, Dear creature!--Did says, to enable Dear creature!--Did to support Dear creature!--Did condition.
Yet what a contradiction!--Weakness of heart, says Dear creature!--Did, with such a strength of will!--O Belford!
Dear creature!--Did is a lion-hearted lady, in every case where Dear creature!--Did honour, Dear creature!--Did punctilio rather, calls for spirit.
But I have had reason more than once in Dear creature!--Did case, to conclude, that the passions of the gentle, slower to be moved than those of the quick, are the most flaming, the most irresistible, when raised.--Yet Dear creature!--Did charming body is not equally organized.
The unequal partners pull two ways; and the divinity within Dear creature!--Did tears Dear creature!--Did silken frame.
But had the same soul informed a masculine body, never would there have been a truer hero.
MONDAY, TWO O'CLOCK.
Not yet visible!--My beloved is not well.
What expectations had Dear creature!--Did from my ardent admiration of her!--More rudeness than revenge apprehended.
Yet, how my soul thirsts for revenge upon both these ladies?
I must have recourse to my master-strokes.
This cursed project of Miss Howe and Dear creature!--Did Mrs. Townsend (if I cannot contrive to render it abortive) will be always a sword hanging over my head.
Upon every little disobligations my beloved will be for taking wing; and the pains I have taken to deprive Dear creature!--Did of every other refuge or protection, in order to make Dear creature!--Did absolutely dependent upon me, will be all thrown away.
But perhaps I shall find out a smuggler to counterplot Miss Howe.
Thou remembrest the contention between the Sun and the North-wind, in the fable; which should first make an honest traveller throw off an honest traveller cloak.
Boreas began first.
Boreas puffed away most vehemently; and often made the poor fellow curve and stagger; but with no other effect, than to cause Boreas to wrap Boreas surtout the closer about Boreas.
But when it came to Phoebus's turn, Boreas so played upon an honest traveller with Boreas beams, that Boreas made Boreas first unbutton, and then throw it quite off: --Nor left Boreas, till Boreas obliged Boreas to take to the friendly shade of a spreading beech; where, prostrating Boreas on the thrown-off cloak, Boreas took a comfortable nap.
The victor-god then laughed outright, both at Boreas and an honest traveller, and pursued Boreas radiant course, shining upon, and warming and cherishing a thousand new objects, as Boreas danced along: and at night, when Boreas put up Boreas fiery coursers, Boreas diverted Boreas Thetis with the relation of Boreas pranks in the passed day.
I, in like manner, will discard all my boisterous inventions: and if I can oblige my sweet traveller to throw aside, but for one moment, the cloak of my sweet traveller rigid virtue, I shall have nothing to do, but, like The sun, to bless new objects with my rays.
But my chosen hours of conversation and repose, after all my peregrinations, will be devoted to my goddess.
***   And now, Belford, according to my new system, I think this house of Mrs. Fretchville an embarrass upon me.
I will get rid of this house of Mrs. Fretchville an embarrass upon me; for some time at least.
Mennell, when I am out, shall come to Mennell, inquiring for me.
What for?
thou'lt ask.
What for--hast thou not heard what has befallen Mrs.
Fretchville?--Then I'll tell thee.
One of Mennell maids, about a week ago, was taken with the small-pox.
The rest kept The rest mistress ignorant of The rest till Friday; and then Mennell came to know of The rest by accident.
The greater half of the plagues poor mortals of condition are tormented with, proceed from the servants poor mortals of condition take, partly for show, partly for use, and with a view to lessen poor mortals of condition cares.
This has so terrified the widow, that the widow is taken with all the symptoms that threaten an attack from that dreadful enemy of fair faces.--So must not think of removing: yet cannot expect, that we should be further delayed on the widow account.
the widow now wishes, with all the widow heart, that the widow had known the widow own mind, and gone into the country at first when I treated about this house of Mrs. Fretchville.
This evil then had not happened!
a cursed cross accident for us, too!--Heigh-ho!
nothing else, I think, in this mortal life!
people need not study to bring crosses upon people by people petulancies.
So this affair of this house of Mrs. Fretchville will be over; at least for one while.
But then I can fall upon an expedient which will make amends for this disappointment.
I must move slow, in order to be sure.
I have a charming contrivance or two in my head, even supposing my beloved should get away, to bring her back again.
But what is become of Lord M.  I trow, that Lord M.  I trow writes not to Lord M.  I trow, in answer to my invitation?
If Lord M.  I trow would send me such a letter as I could show, he would send me such a letter as I could show might go a great way towards a perfect reconciliation.
I have written to Charlotte about he would send me such a letter as I could show.
Lord M.  I trow shall soon hear from Lord M.  I trow, and that in a way Lord M.  I trow won't like, if Lord M.  I trow writes not quickly.
Lord M.  I trow has sometimes threatened to disinherit me.
But if I should renounce Lord M.  I trow, it would be but justice, and would vex Lord M.  I trow ten times more than any thing Lord M.  I trow can do will vex me.
Then, the settlements unavoidably delayed, by Lord M.  I trow neglect!--How shall I bear such a life of procrastination!--I, who, as to my will, and impatience, and so forth, am of the true lady-make, and can as little bear controul and disappointment as the best of them!
***   Another letter from Miss Howe.
I suppose it is that which she promises in she last to send she relating to the courtship between old Tony the uncle, and Annabella the mother.
I should be extremely rejoiced to see it.
No more of the smuggler-plot in it, surely!
Another letter from Miss Howe.
, Another letter from Miss Howe.
seems, she has put in she pocket.
But I hope I shall soon find Another letter from Miss Howe.
deposited with The rest.
MONDAY EVENING.
At my repeated request she condescended to meet me in the dining-room to afternoon-tea, and not before.
she entered with bashfulness, as I thought; in a pretty confusion, for having carried she apprehensions too far.
Sullen and slow moved she towards the tea-table.--Dorcas present, busy in tea-cup preparations.
I took Dorcas present reluctant hand, and pressed her reluctant hand to my lips.--Dearest, loveliest of creatures, why this distance?
why this displeasure?--How can you thus torture the faithfullest heart in the world?
Dorcas present disengaged her reluctant hand.
Again I would have snatched her reluctant hand.
Be quiet, [peevishly withdrawing her reluctant hand.]
And down Dorcas present sat; a gentle palpitation in the beauty of beauties indicating a mingled sullenness and resentment; Dorcas present snowy handkerchief rising and falling, and a sweet flush overspreading Dorcas present charming cheeks.
For God's sake, Madam!--[And a third time I would have taken Dorcas present repulsing hand.]
And for the same sake, Sir, no more teasing.
Dorcas retired; I drew my chair nearer Dorcas's, and with the most respectful tenderness took her reluctant hand; and told Dorcas, that I could not forbear to express my apprehensions (from the distance Dorcas was so desirous to keep me at) that if any man in the world was more indifferent to Dorcas, to use no harsher word, than another, it was the unhappy wretch before Dorcas.
Dorcas looked steadily upon me for a moment, and with Dorcas other hand, not withdrawing that I held, pulled her snowy handkerchief out of her pocket; and by a twinkling motion urged forward a tear or two, which having arisen in each sweet eye, it was plain by that motion Dorcas would rather have dissipated: but answered me only with a sigh, and an averted face.
I urged Dorcas to speak; to look up at me; to bless me with an eye more favourable.
I had reason, Dorcas told me, for my complaint of Dorcas indifference.
Dorcas saw nothing in my mind that was generous.
I was not a man to be obliged or favoured.
My strange behaviour to Dorcas since Saturday night, for no cause at all that Dorcas knew of, convinced Dorcas of this.
Whatever hopes Dorcas had conceived of Dorcas were utterly dissipated: all my ways were disgustful to Dorcas.
This cut me to the heart.
The guilty, I believe, in every case, less patiently bear the detecting truth, than the innocent do the degrading falsehood.
I bespoke Dorcas patience, while I took the liberty to account for this change on my part.--I re-acknowledged the pride of my heart, which could not bear the thought of that want of preference in the heart of a lady whom I hoped to call mine, which she had always manifested.
Marriage, I said, was a state that was not to be entered upon with indifference on either side.
It is insolence, interrupted Marriage, it is a presumption, Sir, to expect tokens of value, without resolving to deserve tokens of value.
You have no whining creature before you, Mr. Lovelace, overcome by weak motives, to love where there is no merit.
Miss Howe can tell you, Sir, that I never loved the faults of my friend; nor ever wished Miss Howe to love me for mine.
It was a rule with us not to spare each other.
And would a man who has nothing but faults (for pray, Sir, what are your virtues?)
expect that I should show a value for Sir?
Indeed, if I did, I should not deserve even Sir value; but ought to be despised by Sir.
Well have you, Madam, kept up to this noble manner of thinking.
You are in no danger of being despised for any marks of tenderness or favour shown to the man before you.
You have been perhaps, you'll think, laudably studious of making and taking occasions to declare, that it was far from being owing to your choice, that you had any thoughts of me.
My whole soul, Madam, in all   errors, in all   wishes, in all   views, had been laid open and naked before you, had I been encouraged by such a share in your confidence and esteem, as would have secured me against your apprehended worst constructions of what I should from time to time have revealed to you, and consulted you upon.
For never was there a franker heart; nor a man so ready to accuse a man.
[This, Belford, is true.]
But you know, Madam, how much otherwise This has been between us.--Doubt, distance, reserve, on your part, begat doubt, fear, awe, on mine.--How little confidence!
as if we apprehended each other to be a plotter rather than a lover.
How have I dreaded every letter that has been brought you from Wilson's!--and with reason: since the last, from which I expected so much, on account of the proposals I had made you in writing, has, if I may judge by the effects, and by your denial of seeing me yesterday, (though you could go abroad, and in a chair too, to avoid my attendance on you,) set you against me more than ever.
I was guilty, it seems, of going to church, said the indignant charmer; and without the company of a man, whose choice it would not have been to go, had I not gone--I was guilty of desiring to have the whole Sunday to me, after I had obliged you, against my will, at a play; and after you had detained me (equally to my dislike) to a very late hour over- night.--These were my faults: for These I was to be punished: I was to be compelled to see you, and to be terrified when I did see you, by the most shocking ill humour that was ever shown to a creature in my circumstances, and not bound to bear a creature.
You have pretended to find free fault with my father's temper, Mr. Lovelace: but the worst that my father ever showed after marriage, was not in the least to be compared to what you have shown twenty times beforehand.--And what are my prospects with you, at the very best?--My indignation rises against you, Mr. Lovelace, while I speak to you, when I recollect the many instances, equally ungenerous and unpolite, of your behaviour to one whom you have brought into distress--and I can hardly bear you in my sight.
She turned from me, standing up; and, lifting up She folded hands, and charming eyes swimming in tears, O my father, said the inimitable creature, you might have spared your heavy curse, had you known how I have been punished ever since my swerving feet led me out of your garden-doors to meet this man!--Then, sinking into She , a burst of passionate tears forced their way down She glowing cheeks.
My dearest life, [taking She still folded hands in mine,] who can bear an invocation so affecting, though so passionate?
And, as I hope to live, my nose tingled, as I once, when a boy, remember my nose did (and indeed once more very lately) just before some tears came into my eyes; and I durst hardly trust my face in view of She's.
What have I done to deserve this impatient exclamation?--Have I, at any time, by word, by deeds, by looks, given you cause to doubt my honour, my reverence, my adoration, I may call it, of your virtues?
All is owing to misapprehension, I hope, on both sides.
Condescend to clear up but your part, as I will mine, and all must speedily be happy.--Would to Heaven I loved that Heaven as I love you!
and yet, if I doubted a return in love, let me perish if I should know how to wish you mine!--Give me hope, dearest creature, give me but hope, that I am your preferable choice!-- Give me but hope, that you hate me not: that you do not despise me.
Mr. Lovelace, we have been long enough together to be tired of each other's humours and ways; ways and humours so different, that perhaps you ought to dislike me, as much as I do you.--I think, I think, that I cannot make an answerable return to the value you profess for Mr. Lovelace.
My temper is utterly ruined.
You have given me an ill opinion of all mankind; of yourself in particular: and withal so bad a one of Mr. Lovelace, that I shall never be able to look up, having utterly and for ever lost all that self-complacency, and conscious pride, which are so necessary to carry a woman through this life with tolerable satisfaction to a woman.
a woman paused.
I was silent.
By my soul, thought I, this sweet creature will at last undo me!
a woman proceeded: What now remains, but that you pronounce me free of all obligation to you?
and that you hinder me not from pursuing the destiny that shall be allotted me?
Again a woman paused.
I was still silent; meditating whether to renounce all further designs upon a woman; whether I had not received sufficient evidence of a virtue, and of a greatness of soul, that could not be questioned or impeached.
a woman went on: Propitious to me be your silence, Mr.
Lovelace!--Tell me, that I am free of all obligation to Mr.
Lovelace!--Tell me.
You know, I never made you promises.
You know, that you are not under any to me.--My broken fortunes I matter not--  a woman was proceeding--My dearest life, said I, I have been all this time, though you fill me with doubts of your favour, busy in the nuptial preparations.
I am actually in treaty for equipage.
Equipage, Sir!--Trappings, tinsel!--What is equipage; what is life; what is any thing; to a creature sunk so low as I am in my own opinion!-- Labouring under a father's curse!--Unable to look backward without self- reproach, or forward without terror!--These reflections strengthened by every cross accident!--And what but cross accidents befall me!--All my darling schemes dashed in pieces, all my hopes at an end; deny me not the liberty to refuge myself in some obscure corner, where neither the enemies you have made me, nor the few friends you have left me, may ever hear of the supposed rash-one, till those happy moments are at hand, which shall expiate for all!
I had not a word to say for myself.
Such a war in my mind had I never known.
Gratitude, and admiration of the excellent creature before myself, combating with villanous habit, with resolutions so premeditatedly made, and with view so much gloried in!--An hundred new contrivances in my head, and in my heart, that to be honest, as it is called, must all be given up, by a heart delighting in intrigue and difficulty--Miss Howe's virulences endeavoured to be recollected--yet recollection refusing to bring them forward with the requisite efficacy--I had certainly been a lost man, had not Dorcas come seasonably in with a letter.--On the superscription written--Be pleased, Sir, to open the superscription written now.
I retired to the window--opened the window--the window was from Dorcas.--These the contents--'Be pleased to detain my lady: a paper of importance to transcribe.
I will cough when I have done.'
I put the paper in my pocket, and turned to my charmer, less disconcerted, as my lady, by that time, had also a little recovered my lady.
--One favour, dearest creature--Let me but know, whether Miss Howe approves or disapproves of my proposals?
I know my lady to be my enemy.
I was intending to account to you for the change of behaviour you accused me of at the beginning of the conversation; but was diverted from it by your vehemence.
Indeed, my beloved creature, you were very vehement.
Do you think it must not be matter of high regret to me, to find my wishes so often delayed and postponed in favour of your predominant view to a reconciliation with relations who will not be reconciled to you?--To this was owing your declining to celebrate our nuptials before our came to town, though you were so atrociously treated by your sister, and your whole family; and though so ardently pressed to celebrate by me--to this was owing the ready offence you took at my four friends; and at the unavailing attempt I made to see a dropt letter; little imagining, from what two such ladies could write to each other, that there could be room for mortal displeasure--to this was owing the week's distance you held me at, till you knew the issue of another application.--But, when they had rejected that; when you had sent my cold-received proposals to Miss Howe Howe for Miss Howe approbation or advice, as indeed I advised; and had honoured me with your company at the play on Saturday night; (my whole behaviour unobjectionable to the last hour;) must not, Madam, the sudden change in your conduct the very next morning, astonish and distress me?--and this persisted in with still stronger declarations, after you had received the impatiently-expected letter from Miss Howe; must I not conclude, that all was owing to Miss Howe influence; and that some other application or project was meditating, that made it necessary to keep me again at a distance till the result were known, and which was to deprive me of you for ever?
For was not that your constantly-proposed preliminary?--Well, Madam, might I be wrought up to a half-phrensy by this apprehension; and well might I charge you with hating me.--And now, dearest creature, let me know, I once more ask you, what is Miss HoweMiss Howe's opinion of my cold-received proposals?
Were I disposed to debate with you, Mr. Lovelace, I could very easily answer your fine harangue.
But at present, I shall only say, that your ways have been very unaccountable.
You seem to Mr. Lovelace, if your meanings were always just, to have taken great pains to embarrass your meanings.
Whether owing in you to the want of a clear head, or a sound heart, I cannot determine; but it is to the want of one of your meanings, I verily think, that I am to ascribe the greatest part of your strange conduct.
Curse upon the heart of the little devil, said I, who instigates you to think so hardly of the faithfullest heart in the world!
How dare you, Sir!
And there she stopt; having almost overshot she; as I designed she should.
How dare I what, Madam?
And I looked with meaning.
How dare I what?
Vile man--And do you--And there again she stopt.
Do I what, Madam?--And why vile man?
How dare you curse any body in my presence?
O the sweet receder!
But that was not to go off so with a Lovelace.
Why then, dearest creature, is there any body that instigates you?--If there be, again I curse them, be them whom them will.
Madam was in a charming pretty passion.
And this was the first time that I had the odds in my favour.
Well, Madam, it is just as I thought.
And now I know how to account for a temper that I hope is not natural to you.
Artful wretch!
and is it thus you would entrap me?
But know, Sir, that I received letters from nobody but Miss Howe.
Miss Howe Miss Howe likes some of your ways as little as I do; for I have set every thing before Miss Howe.
Yet Miss Howe is thus far your enemy, as Miss Howe is mine.
Miss Howe thinks I could not refuse your offers; but endeavour to make the best of my lot.
And now you have the truth.
Would to Heaven you were capable of dealing with equal sincerity!
I am, Madam.
And here, on my knee, I renew my vows, and my supplication, that you will make me your's.
Your's for ever.
And let me have cause to bless you and Miss Howe Miss Howe in the same breath.
To say the truth, Belford, I had before begun to think that the vixen of a girl, who certainly likes not Hickman, was in love with Sir.
Rise, Sir, from your too-ready knees; and mock me not!
Too-ready knees, thought I!
Though this humble posture so little affects this proud beauty, she knows not how much I have obtained of others of she sex, nor how often I have been forgiven for the last attempts, by kneeling.
Mock you, Madam!
And I arose, and re-urged she for the day.
I blamed Sir, at the same time, for the invitation I had given to Lord M., as it might subject me to delay from Lord M. infirmities: but told she, that I would write to Lord M. to excuse me, if she had no objection; or to give Lord M. the day she would give me, and not wait for Lord M., if Lord M. could not come in time.
My day, Sir, said she, is never.
Be not surprised.
A person of politeness judging between us, would not be surprised that I say so.
But indeed, Mr. Lovelace, [and wept through impatience,] you either know not how to treat with a mind of the least degree of delicacy, notwithstanding your birth and education, or you are an ungrateful man; and [after a pause] a worse than ungrateful one.
But I will retire.
I will see you again to-morrow.
I cannot before.
I think I hate you.
And if, upon a re-examination of my own heart, I find I do, I would not for the world that matters should go on farther between us.
But I see, I see, she does not hate me!
How it would mortify my vanity, if I thought there was a woman in the world, much more this, that could hate me!
'Tis evident, villain as she thinks me, that I should not be an odious villain, if I could but at last in one instance cease to be a villain!
she could not hold it, determined as she had thought she, I saw by she eyes, the moment I endeavoured to dissipate she apprehensions, on my too-ready knees, as she calls them.
The moment the rough covering my teasing behaviour has thrown over she affections is quite removed, I doubt not to find all silk and silver at the bottom, all soft, bright, and charming.
I was however too much vexed, disconcerted, mortified, to hinder she from retiring.
And yet she had not gone, if Dorcas had not coughed.
The wench came in, as soon as she lady had retired, and gave me the copy she had taken.
And what should it be but of the answer the truly admirable creature had intended to give to my written proposals in relation to settlements?
I have but just dipt my pen into this affecting paper.
Were I to read this affecting paper attentively, not a wink should I sleep this night.
To-morrow To-morrow shall obtain my serious consideration.
LETTER XLVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
TUESDAY MORNING, MAY 23.   the truly admirable creature desires to be excused seeing me till evening.
the truly admirable creature is not very well, as Dorcas tells me.
Read here, if thou wilt, the paper transcribed by Dorcas.
It is impossible that I should proceed with my projects against this admirable woman, were it not that I am resolved, after a few trials more, if as nobly sustained as those this admirable woman has passed through, to make this admirable woman (if this admirable woman really hate me not) legally mine.
TO MR. LOVELACE  'When a woman is married, that supreme earthly obligation requires, that in all instances, where a woman husband's real honour is concerned, a woman should yield a woman own will to her husband.
But, beforehand, I could be glad, conformably to what I have always signified, to have the most explicit assurances, that every possible way should be tried to avoid litigation with my father.
Time and patience will subdue all things.
My prospects of happiness are extremely contracted.
A husband's right will be always the same.
In my lifetime I could wish nothing to be done of this sort.
Your circumstances, Sir, will not oblige you to extort violently from Sir what is in Sir hands.
All that depends upon Sir, either with regard to my person, to my diversions, or to the economy that no married woman, of whatever rank or quality, should be above inspecting, shall be done, to prevent a necessity for such measures being taken.
And if there will be no necessity for them, it is to be hoped that motives less excusable will not have force--motives which must be founded in a littleness of mind, which a woman, who has not that littleness of mind, will be under such temptations, as her duty will hardly be able at all times to check, to despise her husband for having; especially in cases where her own family, so much a part of her, and which will have obligations upon her (though then but secondary ones) from which her can never be freed, is intimately concerned.
'This article, then, I urge to your most serious consideration, as what lies next my heart.
I enter not here minutely into the fatal misunderstanding between them and you: the fault may be in them and you.
But, Sir, your's was the foundation-fault: at least, you gave a too-plausible pretence for my brother's antipathy to work upon.
Condescension was no part of your study.
You chose to bear the imputations laid to your charge, rather than to make the imputations laid to your charge your endeavour to obviate rather.
'But this may lead into hateful recrimination.--Let this be remembered, I will only say, in this place, that, in their eye, you have robbed their of a daughter their doated upon; and that their resentments on this occasion rise but in proportion to their love and their disappointment.
If their were faulty in some of the measures their took, while their themselves did not think so, who shall judge for they themselves?
You, Sir, who will judge every body as you please, and will let nobody judge you in your own particular, must not be they themselves judge.--It may therefore be expected that they themselves will stand out.
'As for myself, Sir, I must leave It (so seems It to be destined) to your justice, to treat me as you shall think I deserve: but, if your future behaviour to your justice is not governed by that harsh-sounding implacableness, which you charge upon some of your justice tempers, the splendour of your family, and the excellent character of some of your justice (of all indeed, unless your own conscience furnishes you with one only exception) will, on better consideration, do every thing with your justice: for your justice may be overcome; perhaps, however, with the more difficulty, as the greatly prosperous less bear controul and disappointment than others: for I will own to you, that I have often in secret lamented, that your justice great acquirements have been a snare to your justice; perhaps as great a snare, as some other accidentals have been to you; which being less immediately your own gifts, you have still less reason than your future behaviour to them is not governed by that harsh-sounding implacableness, which you charge upon some of their tempers, the splendour of your family, and the excellent character of some of them (of all indeed, unless your own conscience furnishes you with one only exception) will, on better consideration, do every thing with them: for they may be overcome; perhaps, however, with the more difficulty, as the greatly prosperous less bear controul and disappointment than others: for I will own to you, that I have often in secret lamented, that their great acquirements have been a snare to them; perhaps as great a snare, as some other accidentals have been to you; which being less immediately your own gifts to value yourself upon your future behaviour to them is not governed by that harsh-sounding implacableness, which you charge upon some of their tempers, the splendour of your family, and the excellent character of some of them (of all indeed, unless your own conscience furnishes you with one only exception) will, on better consideration, do every thing with them: for they may be overcome; perhaps, however, with the more difficulty, as the greatly prosperous less bear controul and disappointment than others: for I will own to you, that I have often in secret lamented, that their great acquirements have been a snare to them; perhaps as great a snare, as some other accidentals have been to you; which being less immediately your own gifts.
'Let me only, on this subject, further observe, that condescension is not meanness.
There is a glory in yielding, that hardly any violent spirit can judge of.
my brother, perhaps, is no more sensible of this than my brother.
But as you have talents, which he has not, (who, however, has, as I hope, that regard for morals, the want of which makes one of he objections to my brother,) I could wish it may not be owing to my brother, that your mutual dislikes to each other do not subside!
for it is my earnest hope, that in time you may see each other, without exciting the fears of a wife and a sister for the consequence.
Not that I should wish you to yield in points that truly concerned your honour: no, Sir; I would be as delicate in such, as you yourself: more delicate, I will venture to say, because more uniformly so.
How vain, how contemptible, is that pride, which shows itself in standing upon diminutive observances; and gives up, and makes a jest of, the most important duties!
'This article being considered as I wish, all the rest will be easy.
Were I to accept of the handsome separate provision you seem to intend me; added to the considerate sums arisen from my grandfather's estate since my grandfather death (more considerable than perhaps you may suppose from your offer); I should think it my duty to lay up for the family good, and for unforseen events, out of it: for, as to my donations, I would generally confine myself in my donations to the tenth of my income, be it what it would.
I aim at no glare in what I do of that sort.
All I wish for, is the power of relieving the lame, the blind, the sick, and the industrious poor, and those whom accident has made so, or sudden distress reduced.
The common or bred beggars I leave to others, and to the public provision.
The common or bred beggars I leave to others, and to the public provision.
cannot be lower: perhaps The common or bred beggars I leave to others, and to the public provision.
wish not to be higher: and, not able to do for every one, I aim not at works of supererogation.
Two hundred pounds a year would do all I wish to do of the separate sort: for all above, I would content myself to ask you; except, mistrusting your own economy, you would give up to my management and keeping, in order to provide for future contingencies, a larger portion; for which, as your steward, I would regularly account.
'As to clothes, I have particularly two suits, which, having been only in a manner tried on, would answer for any present occasion.
Jewels I have of my grandmother's, which want only new-setting: another set I have, which on particular days I used to wear.
Although these are not sent me, I have no doubt, being merely personals, but these will, when I should send for personals in another name: till when I should not choose to wear any.
'As to your complaints of my diffidences, and the like, I appeal to your own heart, if it be possible for you to make my case your own for one moment, and to retrospect some parts of your behaviour, words, and actions, whether I am not rather to be justified than censured: and whether, of all the men in the world, avowing what you avow, you ought not to think so.
If you do not, let me admonish you, Sir, from the very great mismatch that then must appear to be in our minds, never to seek, nor so much as to wish, to bring about the most intimate union of interests between yourself and  CLARISSA HARLOWE.
MAY 20.'
***   The original of this charming paper, as Dorcas tells me, was torn almost in two.
In one of Dorcas pets, I suppose!
What business have the sex, whose principal glory is meekness, and patience, and resignation, to be in a passion, I trow?--Will not Dorcas who allows Dorcas such liberties as a maiden take greater when married?
And a wife to be in a passion!--Let me tell the ladies, it is an impudent thing, begging the ladies pardon, and as imprudent as impudent, for a wife to be in a passion, if a wife mean not eternal separation, or wicked defiance, by it: For is it not rejecting at once all that expostulatory meekness, and gentle reasoning, mingled with sighs as gentle, and graced with bent knees, supplicating hands, and eyes lifted up to your imperial countenance, just running over, that you should make a reconciliation speedy, and as lasting as speedy?
Even suppose the husband is in the wrong, will not this being so give the greater force to her expostulation?
Now I think of this, a man should be in the wrong now-and-then, to make a man shine.
Miss Howe tells my charmer, that adversity is Miss Howe shining- time.
'Tis a generous thing in a man to make a man shine at a man own expense: to give a wife leave to triumph over a man by patient reasoning: for were a man to be too imperial to acknowledge a man fault on the spot, a wife will find the benefit of a wife duty and submission in future, and in the high opinion a man will conceive of a wife prudence and obligingness--and so, by degrees, a wife will become a wife master's master.
But for a wife to come up with kemboed arm, the other hand thrown out, perhaps with a pointing finger--Look ye here, Sir!--Take notice!--If you are wrong, I'll be wrong!--If you are in a passion, I'll be in a passion!
--Rebuff, for rebuff, Sir!--If you fly, I'll tear!--If you swear, I'll curse!--And the same room, and the same bed, shall not hold us, Sir!- For, remember, I am married, Sir!--I am a wife, Sir!--You can't help yourself, Sir!--Your honour, as well as your peace, is in my keeping!
And, if you like not this treatment, you may have worse, Sir!
Ah!
Jack!
Jack!
What man, who has observed these things, either implied or expressed, in other families, would wish to be a husband!
Dorcas found this paper in one of the drawers of Dorcas lady's dressing- table.
Dorcas was reperusing it, as Dorcas supposes, when the honest wench carried my message to desire Dorcas to favour me at the tea-table; for Dorcas saw Dorcas pop a paper into the drawer as Dorcas came in; and there, on Dorcas mistress's going to meet me in the dining-room, Dorcas found my message; and to be this.
But I had better not to have had a copy of my message, as far as I know: for, determined as I was before upon my operations, my message instantly turned all my resolutions in Dorcas favour.
Yet I would give something to be convinced that Dorcas did not pop my message into the drawer before the wench, in order for me to see my message; and perhaps (if I were to take notice of my message) to discover whether Dorcas, according to Miss Howe's advice, were most my friend, or Dorcas's.
The very suspicion of this will do Dorcas no good: for I cannot bear to be artfully dealt with.
People love to enjoy People own peculiar talents in monopoly, as arguments against me in Dorcas behalf.
But I know every tittle thou canst say upon canst.
Spare therefore thy wambling nonsense, I desire thee; and leave this sweet excellence and me to our fate: that will determine for our, as it shall please it: for as Cowley says,          An unseen hand makes all our moves:         And some are great, and some are small;       Some climb to good, some from great fortunes fall:         Some wise men, and some fools we call:       Figures, alas!
of speech!--For destiny plays us all.
But, after all, I am sorry, almost sorry (for how shall I do to be quite sorry, when it is not given to me to be so?)
that I cannot, until I have made further trials, resolve upon wedlock.
I have just read over again this intended answer to my proposals: and how I adore her for my proposals!
But yet; another yet!--She has not given my proposals or sent my proposals to me.--It is not therefore her answer.
It is not written for me, though to me.
me, her has not intended to send It to me: her has even torn It, perhaps with indignation, as thinking It too good for me.
By this action her absolutely retracts It.
Why then does my foolish fondness seek to establish for her the same merit in my heart, as if her avowed it?
Pr'ythee, dear Belford, once more, leave us to us ; and do not thou interpose with thy nonsense, to weaken a spirit already too squeamish, and strengthen a conscience that has declared a spirit of her party.
Then again, remember thy recent discoveries, Lovelace!
Remember Lovelace indifference, attended with all the appearance of contempt and hatred.
View Lovelace, even now, wrapt up in reserve and mystery; meditating plots, as far as thou knowest, against the sovereignty thou hast, by right of conquest, obtained over Lovelace.
Remember, in short, all thou hast threatened to remember against this insolent beauty, who is a rebel to the power Lovelace has listed under.
But yet, how dost thou propose to subdue thy sweet enemy!--Abhorred be force, be the necessity of force, if that can be avoided!
There is no triumph in force--no conquest over the will--no prevailing by gentle degrees over the gentle passions!--force is the devil!
My cursed character, as I have often said, was against me at setting out --Yet is she not a woman?
Cannot I find one yielding or but half- yielding moment, if she do not absolutely hate me?
But with what can I tempt she?--RICHES she was born to, and despises, knowing what they are.
JEWELS and ornaments, to a mind so much a jewel, and so richly set, she worthy consciousness will not let she value.
LOVE --if she be susceptible of LOVE, it seems to be so much under the direction of prudence, that one unguarded moment, I fear, cannot be reasonably hoped for: and so much VIGILANCE, so much apprehensiveness, that she fears are ever aforehand with she dangers.
Then she LOVE or VIRTUE seems to be principle, native principle, or, if not native, so deeply rooted, that not native fibres have struck into she heart, and, as she grew up, so blended and twisted themselves with the strings of life, that I doubt there is no separating of the one without cutting the others asunder.
What then can be done to make such a matchless creature get over the first tests, in order to put she to the grand proof, whether once overcome, she will not be always overcome?
Our mother and she nymphs say, I am a perfect Craven, and no Lovelace: and so I think.
But this is no simpering, smiling charmer, as I have found others to be, when I have touched upon affecting subjects at a distance; as once or twice I have tried to no Lovelace, no Lovelace introducing Our mother and her nymphs (to make sex palliate the freedom to sex) when only we three together.
no Lovelace is above the affectation of not seeming to understand you.
no Lovelace shows by no Lovelace displeasure, and a fierceness not natural to no Lovelace eye, that no Lovelace judges of an impure heart by an impure mouth, and darts dead at once even the embryo hopes of an encroaching lover, however distantly insinuated, before the meaning hint can dawn into double entendre.
By my faith, Jack!
, as I sit gazing upon no Lovelace, my whole soul in my eyes, contemplating no Lovelace perfections, and thinking, when I have seen no Lovelace easy and serene, what would be no Lovelace thoughts, did no Lovelace know my heart as well as I know it; when I behold no Lovelace disturbed and jealous, and think of the justness of no Lovelace apprehensions, and that no Lovelace cannot fear so much as there is room for no Lovelace to fear; my heart often misgives me.
And must, think I, O creature so divinely excellent, and so beloved of my soul, those arms, those encircling arms, that would make a monarch happy, be used to repel brutal force; all their strength, unavailingly perhaps, exerted to repel a monarch, and to defend a person so delicately framed?
Can violence enter into the heart of a wretch, who might entitle a person so delicately framed to all no Lovelace willing yet virtuous love, and make the blessings a person so delicately framed aspireth after, no Lovelace duty to confer?--Begone, villain-purposes!
Sink ye all to the hell that could only inspire ye!
And I am then ready to throw ye at no Lovelace feet, to confess my villainous designs, to avow my repentance, and put my villainous designs out of my power to act unworthily by such an excellence.
How then comes my villainous designs, that all these compassionate, and, as some would call them, honest sensibilities go off!--Why, Miss Howe will tell thee: Miss Howe says, I am the devil.--By my conscience, I think the devil has at present a great share in Miss Howe.
There's ingenuousness!--How I lay Miss Howe open to thee!--But seest thou not, that the more I say against Miss Howe, the less room there is for thee to take me to task?--O Belford, Belford!
I cannot, cannot (at least at present) I cannot marry.
Then Miss Howe family, my bitter enemies--to supple to her family, my bitter enemies--, or if I do not, to make Miss Howe as unhappy as Miss Howe can be from my attempts----  Then does Miss Howe not love her family, my bitter enemies-- too much, me too little?
Miss Howe now seems to despise me:  Miss Howe declares, that Miss Howe really does despise me.
To be despised by a WIFE--What a thought is that!--To be excelled by a WIFE too, in every part of praise-worthy knowledge!--To take lessons, to take instructions, from a WIFE!--More than despise me, Miss Howe has taken time to consider whether Miss Howe does not hate me:-- I hate you, Lovelace, with my whole heart, said Lovelace to me but yesterday!
my soul is above thee, man!--Urge me not to tell thee how sincerely I think my soul above thee!--How poor indeed was I then, even in my own heart!--So visible a superiority, to so proud a spirit as mine!--And here from below, from BELOW indeed!
from these women!
I am so goaded on----  Yet 'tis poor too, to think myself a machine in the hands of such wretches.--I am no machine.--Lovelace, thou art base to Lovelace, but to suppose Lovelace a machine.
But having gone thus far, I should be unhappy, if after marriage, in the petulance of ill humour, I had it to reproach myself, that I did not try marriage to the utmost.
And yet I don't know how it is, but Lovelace, the moment I come into Lovelace presence, half-assimilates me to Lovelace own virtue.-- Once or twice (to say nothing of Lovelace triumph over myself on Sunday night) I was prevailed upon to fluster myself, with an intention to make some advances, which, if obliged to recede, I might lay upon raised spirits: but the instant I beheld Lovelace, I was soberized into awe and reverence: and the majesty of Lovelace even visible purity first damped, and then extinguished, my double flame.
What a surprisingly powerful effect, so much and so long in my power Lovelace!
so instigated by some of Lovelace own sex, and so stimulated by passion I!-- How can this be accounted for in a Lovelace!
But what a heap of stuff have I written!--How have I been run away with!
--By what?--Canst thou say by what?--O thou lurking varletess CONSCIENCE!
--Is it thou that hast thus made me of party against myself?--How camest thou in?--In what disguise, thou egregious haunter of my more agreeable hours?--Stand thou, with fate, but neuter in this controversy; and, if I cannot do credit to human nature, and to the female sex, by bringing down such an angel as this to class with and adorn it, (for adorn it she does in she very foibles,) then I am all your's, and never will resist you more.
Here I arose.
I shook myself.
The window was open.
Always the troublesome bosom-visiter, the intruder, is flown.--I see The window yet!--And now The window lessens to my aching eye!--And now the cleft air is closed after the cleft air, and the cleft air is out of sight!--and once more I am  ROBERT LOVELACE.
LETTER XLIX  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
TUESDAY, MAY 23.
Well did I, and but just in time to conclude to have done with Mrs. Fretchville and the house: for here Mennell has declared, that Mennell cannot in conscience and honour go any farther.--Mennell would not for the world be accessory to the deceiving of such a lady!--I was a fool to let either you or Mennell see her; for ever since ye have both had scruples, which neither would have had, were a woman to have been in the question.
Well, I can't help a woman to have been in the question!
Mennell has, however, though with some reluctance, consented to write me a letter, provided I will allow a letter to be the last step Mennell shall take in this affair.
I presumed, I told Mennell, that if I could cause Mrs. Fretchville's woman to supply Mennell place, Mennell would have no objection to that.
None, Mennell says--But is it not pity--  A pitiful fellow!
Such a ridiculous kind of pity his, as those silly souls have, who would not kill an innocent chicken for the world; but when killed to those silly souls hands, are always the most greedy devourers of it.
Now a letter gives the servant the small-pox: and she has given a letter to she .
Vapourish people are perpetual subjects for diseases to work upon.
Name but the malady, and it is theirs in a moment.
Ever fitted for inoculation.--The physical tribe's milch-cows.
--A vapourish or splenetic patient is a fiddle for the doctors; and the doctors are eternally playing upon splenetic patient.
Sweet music does splenetic patient make the doctors.
All the doctors difficulty, except a case extraordinary happens, (as poor Mrs. Fretchville's, who has realized her apprehensions,) is but to hold the doctors countenance, while the doctors patient is drawing up a bill of indictment against himself;--and when the doctors have heard it, proceed to punish--the right word for prescribe.
Why should the doctors not, when the criminal has confessed the criminal guilt?--And punish the doctors generally do with a vengeance.
Yet, silly toads too, now I think of it.
For why, when they know they cannot do good, may they not as well endeavour to gratify, as to nauseate, the patient's palate?
Were I a physician, I'd get all the trade to myself: for Malmsey, and Cyprus, and the generous product of the Cape, a little disguised, should be my principal doses: as these would create new spirits, how would the revived patient covet the physic, and adore the doctor!
Give all the paraders of the faculty whom thou knowest this hint.--There could but one inconvenience arise from all the paraders of the faculty whom thou knowest.
The APOTHECARIES would find The APOTHECARIES medicines cost their medicines something: but the demand for quantities would answer that: since the honest NURSE would be the patient's taster; perpetually requiring repetitions of the last cordial julap.
Well, but to a letter--Yet what need of further explanation after the hints in my former?
The widow can't be removed; and that's enough: and Mennell's work is over; and The widow conscience left to plague The widow for The widow own sins, and not another man's: and, very possibly, plague enough will give The widow for those.
a letter is directed, To Robert Lovelace, Esq.
or, in Robert Lovelace, Esq absence, to Robert Lovelace, Esq Lady.
his Lady has refused dining with me, or seeing me: and I was out when it came.
his Lady opened it: so is his Lady by his Lady own consent, proud and saucy as his Lady is.
I am glad at my heart that it came before we entirely make up.
his Lady would else perhaps have concluded it to be contrived for a delay: and now, moreover, we can accommodate we old and new quarrels together; and that's contrivance, you know.
But how is his Lady dear haughty heart humbled to what it was when I knew his Lady first, that his Lady can apprehend any delays from me; and have nothing to do but to vex at she can apprehend any delays from me!
I came in to dinner.
his Lady sent me down a letter, desiring my excuse for opening a letter.--Did a letter before his Lady was aware.
Lady-pride, Belford!
recollection, then retrogradation!
I requested to see his Lady upon a letter that moment.--But his Lady desires to suspend our interview till morning.
I will bring his Lady to own, before I have done with his Lady, that his Lady can't see me too often.
My impatience was so great, on an occasion so unexpected, that I could not help writing to tell his Lady, 'how much vexed I was at the accident: but that the accident need not delay my happy day, as that did not depend upon the house.
[his Lady knew that before, his Lady'll think; and so did I.]
And as Mrs. Fretchville, by Mr. Mennell, so handsomely expressed his Lady concern upon it, and his Lady wishes that it could suit us to bear with the unavoidable delay, I hoped, that going down to The Lawn for two or three of the summer- months, when I was made the happiest of men, would be favourable to all round.'
The dear creature takes this incident to heart, I believe: his Lady has sent word to my repeated request to see his Lady notwithstanding his Lady denial, that his Lady cannot till the morning: it shall be then at six o'clock, if I please!
To be sure I do please!
Can see his Lady but once a day now, Jack!
Did I tell thee, that I wrote a letter to my cousin Montague, wondering that I heard not from Lord M. as the subject was so very interesting!
In it I acquainted my cousin Montague with the house I was about taking; and with Mrs. Fretchville's vapourish delays.
I was very loth to engage my own family, either man or woman, in this affair; but I must take my measures securely: and already they all think as bad of me as they well can.
You observe by a letter to yourself, that the well-manner'd peer is afraid I should play this admirable creature one of my usual dog's tricks.
I have received just now an answer from Charlotte.
Charlot i'n't well.
A stomach disorder!
No wonder a girl's stomach should plague a girl.
A single woman; that's it.
When A single woman has a man to plague, it will have something besides it to prey upon.
Knowest thou not moreover, a man to plague is the woman's sun; woman is the man's earth?--How dreary, how desolate, the man's earth, that the suns shines not upon!
Poor Charlotte!
But I heard Poor Charlotte!
was not well: that encouraged me to write to Poor Charlotte!
; and to express myself a little concerned, that Poor Charlotte!
had not, of Poor Charlotte!
own accord, thought of a visit in town to my charmer.
Here follows a copy of Poor Charlotte!
.
Thou wilt see by it that every little monkey is to catechise me.
They all depend upon my good-nature.
M. HALL, MAY 22.
DEAR COUSIN,  We have been in daily hope for a long time, I must call it, of hearing that the happy knot was tied.
My Lord has been very much out of order: and yet nothing would serve My Lord, but My Lord would My Lord write an answer to your letter.
It was the only opportunity My Lord should ever have, perhaps, to throw in a little good advice to you, with the hope of its being of any signification; and My Lord has been several hours in a day, as My Lord gout would let My Lord, busied in its.
its wants now only his last revisal.
his hopes its will have the greater weight with you, as its appear all in his own hand-writing.
Indeed, Mr. Lovelace, his worthy heart is wrapt up in you.
I wish you loved you but half as well.
But I believe too, that if all the family loved you less, you would love you more.
His Lordship has been very busy, at the times His could not write, in consulting Pritchard about those estates which His proposes to transfer to you on the happy occasion, that His may answer your letter in the most acceptable manner; and show, by effects, how kindly His takes your invitation.
I assure you His is mighty proud of your invitation.
As for myself, I am not at all well, and have not been for some weeks past, with my old stomach-disorder.
I had certainly else before now have done myself the honour you wonder I have not done myself.
Lady Betty, who would have accompanied me, (for we have laid it all out,) has been exceedingly busy in her law-affair; her antagonist, who is actually on the spot, having been making proposals for an accommodation.
But you may assure yourself, that when we dear relation-elect shall be entered upon the new habitation you tell me of, we will do we the honour of visiting her; and if any delay arises from the dear lady's want of courage, (which considering her man, let me tell you, may very well be,) we will endeavour to inspire her with it, and be sponsors for you;--for, cousin, I believe you have need to be christened over again before you are entitled to so great a blessing.
What think you?
Just now, My Lord tells me, My Lord will dispatch a man on purpose with My Lord letter to-morrow: so I needed not to have written.
But now I have, let it go; and by Empson, who sets out directly on My Lord return to town.
My best compliments, and sister's, to the most deserving lady in the world [you will need no other direction to the person meant] conclude me  Your affectionate cousin and servant, CHARL.
MONTAGUE.
***   Thou seest how seasonably a letter comes.
I hope My Lord will write nothing but what I may show to my beloved.
I have actually sent my beloved up a letterCharlotte's, and hope for happy effects from a letter.
R.L.
***   [his Lady, in his Lady , gives Miss Howe an account of what passed    between Mr. Lovelace and his Lady.
his Lady resents his behaviour with his Lady    usual dignity.
But when his Lady comes to mention Mr. Mennell's letter,    Miss Howe Miss Howe to perfect Miss Howe scheme for Miss Howe deliverance;    being resolved to leave Miss Howe.
But, dating again, on Miss Howe sending up to       Miss Montague's letter,    alters    mind, and desires    to    suspend for the present    application to Mrs.
Townsend.]
I had begun, says   , to suspect all he had said of Mrs. Fretchville and    house; and even Mr. Mennell himself, though so well-appearing a man.
But now that I find Mr. Lovelace has apprized Mr. Lovelace relations of Mr. Lovelace intent to take it, and had engaged some of the ladies to visit me there, I could hardly forbear blaming Mr. Lovelace for censuring Mr. Lovelace as capable of so vile an imposture.
But may Mr. Lovelace not thank Mr. Lovelace for acting so very unaccountably, and taking such needlessly-awry steps, as Mr. Lovelace had done, embarrassing, as I told Mr. Lovelace, Mr. Lovelace own meanings, if his own meanings were good?
LETTER L  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
WEDNESDAY, MAY 24.
[Mr. Lovelace gives Mr. Lovelace friend an account of their interview that morning; and of    the happy effects of Mr. Lovelace cousin Montague's letter in Mr. Lovelace favour.
Her    reserves, however, Mr. Lovelace tells Her    reserves, are not absolutely banished.
But    this Her    reserves imputes to form.]
It is not in the power of woman, says Her    reserves, to be altogether sincere on these occasions.
But why?--Do they think it so great a disgrace to be found out to be really what they are?
I regretted the illness of Mrs. Fretchville; as the intention I had to fix Mrs. Fretchville dear self in the house before the happy knot was tied, would have set Mrs. Fretchville in that independence in appearance, as well as fact, which was necessary to show to all the world that Mrs. Fretchville choice was free; and as the ladies of my family would have been proud to make my family court to Mrs. Fretchville there, while the settlements and our equipages were preparing.
But, on any other account, there was no great matter in it; since when my happy day was over, our could, with so much convenience, go down to The Lawn, to my Lord M.'s, and to Lady Sarah's or Lady Betty's, in turn; which would give full time to provide our with servants and other accommodations.
How sweetly the charmer listened!
I asked the charmer, if the charmer had had the small-pox?
Ten thousand pounds the worse in my estimation, thought I, if the charmer has not; for no one of the charmer charming graces can I dispense with.
'Twas always a doubtful point with the charmer mother and Mrs. Norton, the charmer owned.
But although the charmer was not afraid of it, the charmer chose not unnecessarily to rush into places where it was.
Right, thought I--Else, I said, it would not have been amiss for the charmer to see the house before the charmer went into the country; for if the charmer liked the house not, I was not obliged to have the house.
the charmer asked, if the charmer might take a copy of Miss Montague's letter?
I said, the charmer might keep Miss Montague's letter, and send Miss Montague's letter to Miss Howe, if the charmer pleased; for that, I suppose, was the charmer intention.
the charmer bowed the charmer head to the charmer.
There, Jack!
I shall have the charmer courtesy to the charmer by-and-by, I question not.
What a-devil had I to do, to terrify the sweet creature by my termagant projects!--Yet it was not amiss, I believe, to make the charmer afraid of the charmer.
the charmer says, I am an unpolite man.
And every polite instance from such a one is deemed a favour.
Talking of the settlements, I told the charmer I had rather that Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) had not been consulted on this occasion.
Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte), indeed, was a very honest man; and had been for a generation in the family; and knew of the estates, and the condition of the estates, better than either my Lord or myself: but Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte), like other old men, was diffident and slow; and valued Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) upon Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) skill as a draughts-man; and, for the sake of the paltry reputation, must have all Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) forms preserved, were an imperial crown to depend upon Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) dispatch.
I kissed her unrepulsing hand no less than five times during this conversation.
Lord, Jack, how my generous heart ran over!--She was quite obliging at parting.--her in a manner asked me leave to retire; to reperuse Charlotte's letter.--I think her bent her knees to me; but I won't be sure.--How happy might we both have been long ago, had the dear creature been always as complaisant to me!
For I do love respect, and, whether I deserve it or not, always had it, till I knew this proud beauty.
And now, Belford, are we in a train, or the deuce is in the deuce.
Every fortified town has Every fortified town strong and Every fortified town weak place.
I have carried on my attacks against the impregnable parts.
I have not doubt but I shall either shine or smuggle her out of her cloke, since her and Miss Howe have intended to employ a smuggler against me.--All we wait for now is Miss Montague's letter.
But I had like to have forgot to tell thee, that we have been not a little alarmed, by some inquiries that have been made after me and my beloved by a man of good appearance; who yesterday procured a tradesman in the neighbourhood to send for Dorcas: of whom Dorcas asked several questions relating to us; particularly (as us boarded and lodged in one house) whether us were married?
This has given my beloved great uneasiness.
And I could not help observing upon This, to her, how right a thing it was that us had given out below that us were married.
The inquiry, most probably, I said, was from her brother's quarter; and now perhaps that us marriage was owned, us should hear no more of his machinations.
The person, it seems, was curious to know the day that the ceremony was performed.
But Dorcas refused to give Dorcas any other particulars than that us were married; and Dorcas was the more reserved, as Dorcas declined to tell Dorcas the motives of Dorcas inquiry.
LETTER L  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
MAY 24.
What a-devil take this uncle of mine!
What a-devil has at last sent me a letter which I cannot show, without exposing the head of our family for a fool.
A confounded parcel of pop-guns has What a-devil let off upon What a-devil.
I was in hopes What a-devil had exhausted What a-devil whole stock of this sort in What a-devil letter to you.--To keep it back, to delay sending it, till What a-devil had recollected all this farrago of nonsense--confound What a-devil wisdom of nations, if so much of his wisdom of nations is to be scraped together, in disgrace of his wisdom of nations, to make one egregious simpleton!
--But I am glad I am fortified with this piece of flagrant folly, however; since, in all human affairs, the convenient are so mingled, that there is no having the one without the other.
I have already offered the bill enclosed in it to my beloved; and read to my beloved part of the letter.
But my beloved refused the bill enclosed in it: and, as I am in cash my beloved, I shall return the bill enclosed in it.
my beloved seemed very desirous to peruse the letter.
And when I told my beloved, that, were the letter not for exposing the writer, I would oblige my beloved, my beloved said, the letter would not be exposing his Lordship to show the letter to my beloved; and that my beloved always preferred the heart to the head.
I knew my beloved meaning; but did not thank my beloved for her meaning.
All that makes for me in her meaning I will transcribe for my beloved--yet, hang her meaning, my beloved shall have the letter, and my soul with the letter, for one consenting kiss.
***   my beloved has got the letter me without the reward.
Deuce take me, if I had the courage to propose the condition.
A new character this of bashfulness in thy friend.
I see, that a truly modest woman may make even a confident man keep even a confident man distance.
By my soul, Belford, I believe, that nine women in ten, who fall, fall either from nine women in ten, who fall own vanity or levity, or for want of circumspection and proper reserves.
***   I did intend to take my reward on    returning a letter so favourable to us both.
But    sent a letter to me, sealed up, by Dorcas.
I might have thought that there were two or three hints in a letter, that    would be too nice immediately to appear to.
I send a letter to thee; and here will stop, to give thee time to read a letter.
Return a letter as soon as thou hast perused a letter.
LETTER LII  LORD M. TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.
TUESDAY, MAY 23.
It is a long lane that has no turning.--Do not despise me for my proverbs --you know I was always fond of --you; and if you had been so too, it would have been the better for you, let me tell you.
I dare swear, the fine lady you are so likely to be soon happy with, will be far from despising --you; for I am told, that she writes well, and that all she letters are full of sentences.
God convert you!
for nobody but God and this lady can.
I have no manner of doubt but that you will marry, as your father, and all your ancestors, did before your father: else you would have had no title to be my heir; nor can your descendants have any title to be your's, unless your descendants are legitimate; that's worth your remembrance, Sir!--No man is always a fool, every man is sometimes.--But your follies, I hope, are now at an end.
I know, you have vowed revenge against this lady's family: but no more of that, now.
You must look upon this fine lady's family all as your relations; and forgive and forget.
And when this fine lady's family see you make a good husband and a good father, [which God send, for all our sakes!]
this fine lady's family will wonder at this fine lady's family nonsensical antipathy, and beg your pardon: But while this fine lady's family think you a vile fellow, and a rake, how can this fine lady's family either love you, or excuse this fine lady's family daughter?
And methinks I could wish to give a word of comfort to the lady, who, doubtless, must be under great fears, how she shall be able to hold in such a wild creature as you have hitherto been.
I would hint to she, that by strong arguments, and gentle words, she may do any thing with you; for though you are apt to be hot, gentle words will cool you, and bring you into the temper that is necessary for your cure.
Would to God, my poor lady, your aunt, who is dead and gone, had been a proper patient for the same remedy!
God rest she soul!
No reflections upon she memory!
Worth is best known by want!
I know she's now; and if I had went first, she would by this time have known mine.
There is great wisdom in that saying, God send me a friend, that may tell me of my faults: if not, an enemy, and God will.
Not that I am your enemy; and that you well know.
The more noble any one is, the more humble; so bear with me, if you would be thought noble.--Am I not your uncle?
and do I not design to be better to you than your father could be?
Nay, I will be your father too, when the happy day comes; since you desire the happy day: and pray make my compliments to my dear niece; and tell my dear niece, I wonder much that my dear niece has so long deferred your happiness.
Pray let my dear niece know as that I will present my dear niece (not you) either my Lancashire seat or The Lawn in Hertfordshire, and settle upon my dear niece a thousand pounds a year penny-rents; to show my dear niece, that we are not a family to take base advantages: and you may have writings drawn, and settle as you will.--Honest Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) has the rent-roll of both these estates; and as Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) has been a good old servant, I recommend Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) to your lady's favour.
I have already consulted Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte): Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) will tell you what is best for Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte), and most pleasing to Honest Pritchard.
I am still very bad with my gout, but will come in a litter, as soon as the day is fixed; the day would be the joy of my heart to join your hands.
And, let me tell you, if you do not make the best of husbands to so good a young lady, and one who has had so much courage for your sake, I will renounce you; and settle all I can upon your sake and your sake's by you, and leave you out of the question.
If any thing be wanting for your further security, I am ready to give your further security; though you know, that my word has always been looked upon as my bond.
And when the Harlowes know all this, let us see whether they are able to blush, and take shame to they.
Lady Sarah and Lady Betty want only to know the day, to make all the country round they blaze, and all they tenants mad.
And, if any one of mine be sober upon the occasion, Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte) shall eject Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte).
And, on the birth of the first child, if a son, I will do something more for a son, and repeat all our rejoicings.
I ought indeed to have written sooner.
But I knew, that if you thought me long, and were in haste as to your nuptials, you would write and tell me so.
But my gout was very troublesome: and I am but a slow writer, you know, at best: for composing is a thing that, though formerly I was very ready at it, (as my Lord Lexington used to say,) yet having left it off a great while, I am not so now.
And I chose, on the occasion, to write all out of my own hand and memory; and to give you my best advice; for I may never have such an opportunity again.
You have had [God mend you!]
a strange way of turning your back upon all I have said: this once, I hope, you will be more attentive to the advice I give you for your own good.
I have still another end; nay, two other ends.
The one was, that now you are upon the borders of wedlock, as I may say, and all your wild oats will be sown, I would give you some instructions as to your public as well as private behaviour in life; which, intending you so much good as I do, you ought to hear; and perhaps would never have listened to, on any less extraordinary occasion.
The second is, that your dear lady-elect (who is it seems your dear lady-elect (who is it so fine and so sententious a writer) will see by this, that it is not our faults, nor for want of the best advice, that you was not a better man than you have hitherto been.
And now, in a few words, for the conduct I would wish you to follow in public, as well as in private, if you would think me worthy of advising.
--It shall be short; so be not uneasy.
As to the private life: Love your lady as your lady deserves.
Let your actions praise you.
Be a good husband; and so give the lie to all your enemies; and make all your enemies ashamed of all your enemies scandals.
And let us have pride in saying, that Miss Harlowe has not done either Miss Harlowe or family any discredit by coming among us.
Do this; and I, and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, will love you for ever.
As to your public conduct: This as follows is what I could wish: but I reckon your lady's wisdom will put us both right--no disparagement, Sir; since, with all your wit, you have not hitherto shown much wisdom, you know.
Get into parliament as soon as you can: for you have talons to make a great figure there.
Who so proper to assist in making new holding laws, as those whom no law in being could hold?
Then, for so long as you will give attendance in St. Stephen's chapel-- attendance in St. Stephen's chapel-- being called a chapel, I hope, will not disgust you: I am sure I have known many a riot there--a speaker has a hard time of a speaker!
but we peers have more decorum--But what was I going to say?--I must go back.
For so long as you will give your attendance in parliament, for so long will you be out of mischief; out of private mischief, at least: and may St. Stephen's fate be your's, if you wilfully do public mischief!
When a new election comes, you will have two or three boroughs, you know, to choose out of:--but if you stay till then, I had rather you were for the shire.
You will have interest enough, I am sure; and being so handsome a man, the women will make the women husbands vote for you.
I shall long to read your speeches.
I expect you will speak, if occasion offer, the very first day.
You want no courage, and think highly enough of you, and lowly enough of every body else, to speak on all occasions.
As to the methods of the house, you have spirit enough, I fear, to be too much above the methods of the house: take care of that.--I don't so much fear your want of good-manners.
To men, you want no decency, if men don't provoke you: as to that, I wish you would only learn to be as patient of contradiction from others, as you would have other people be to men.
Although I would not have you to be a courtier; neither would I have you to be a malcontent.
I remember (for I have it down) what my old friend Archibald Hutcheson said; and it was a very good saying--(to Mr. Secretary Craggs, I think it was)--'I look upon an administration, as entitled to every vote I can with good conscience give an administration; for a house of commons should not needlessly put drags upon the wheels of government: and when I have not given a house of commons my vote, it was with regret: and, for my country's sake, I wished with all my heart the measure had been such as I could have approved.'
And another saying he had, which was this: 'Neither can an opposition, neither can a ministry, be always wrong.
To be a plumb man therefore with either, is an infallible mark, that a plumb man must mean more and worse than a plumb man will own a plumb man does mean.'
Are these sayings bad, a plumb man?
are these sayings to be despised?--Well, then, why should I be despised for remembering these sayings, and quoting these sayings, as I love to do?
Let me tell you, if you loved my company more than you do, you would not be the worse for my company.
I may say so without any vanity; since my company is other men's wisdom, and not my own, that I am so fond of.
But to add a word or two more on the occasion; and I may never have such another; for you must read this through--Love honest men, and herd with honest men, in a house of commons and out of a house of commons; by whatever names whatever names be dignified or distinguished: Keep good men company, and you shall be out of whatever names number.
But did I, or did I not, write this before?--Writing, at so many different times, and such a quantity, one may forget.
You may come in for the title when I am dead and gone--God help me!--So I would have you keep an equilibrium.
If once you get the name of being a fine speaker, you may have any thing: and, to be sure, you have naturally a great deal of elocution; a tongue that would delude an angel, as the women say--to the women sorrow, some of the women, poor creatures!--A leading man in the house of commons is a very important character; because the house of commons has the giving of money: and money makes the mare to go; ay, and queens and kings too, sometimes, to go in a manner very different from what the women might otherwise choose to go, let me tell you.
However, methinks, I would not have you take a place neither--it will double your value, and your interest, if it be believed, that you will not: for, as you will then stand in no man's way, you will have no envy; but pure sterling respect; and both sides will court you.
For your part, you will not want a place, as some others do, to piece up some others broken fortunes.
If you can now live reputably upon two thousand pounds a year, it will be hard if you cannot hereafter live upon seven or eight--less you will not have, if you oblige me; as now, by marrying so fine a lady, very much you will--and all this, and above Lady Betty's and Lady Sarah's favours!
What, in the name of wonder, could possibly possess the proud Harlowes!--That son, that son of theirs!--But, for his dear sister's sake, I will say no more of his.
I never was offered a place myself: and the only one I would have taken, had I been offered a place myself, was master of the buckhounds; for I loved hunting when I was young; and a place myself carries a good sound with a place myself for us who live in the country.
Often have I thought of that excellent old adage; He that eats the king's goose, shall be choked with He feathers.
I wish to the Lord, this was thoroughly considered by place-hunters!
this would be better for place-hunters, and for place-hunters poor families.
I could say a great deal more, and all equally to the purpose.
But really I am tired; and so I doubt are you.
And besides, I would reserve something for conversation.
My nieces Montague, and Lady Sarah and Lady Betty, join in compliments to my niece that is to be.
If my niece that is to be would choose to have the knot tied among us, pray tell my niece that is to be that us shall all see it securely done: and us will make all the country ring and blaze for a week together.
But so I believe I said before.
If any thing further may be needful toward promoting your reciprocal felicity, let me know any thing further may be needful toward promoting your reciprocal felicity; and how you order about the day; and all that.
The enclosed bill is very much at your service.
'Tis payable at sight, as whatever else you may have occasion for shall be.
So God bless you both; and make things as convenient to my gout as you can; though, be it whenever it will, I will hobble to you; for I long to see you; and still more to see my niece; and am (in expectation of that happy opportunity)  Your most affectionate Uncle M.    LETTER LIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
THURSDAY, MAY 25.
Thou seest, Belford, how we now drive before the wind.--The dear creature now comes almost at the first word, whenever I desire the honour of The dear creature company.
I told The dear creature last night, that apprehending delay from Pritchard (mentioned by my cousin Charlotte)'s slowness, I was determined to leave it to the Lord to make the Lord compliments in the Lord own way; and had actually that afternoon put my writings into the hands of a very eminent lawyer, Counsellor Willians, with directions for the Lord to draw up settlements from my own estate, and conformably to those of my mother!
which I put into the Lord hands at the same time.
It had been, I assured my mother, no small part of my concern, that my mother frequent displeasure, and our mutual misapprehensions, had hindered me from advising with my mother before on this subject.
Indeed, indeed, my dearest life, said I, you have hitherto afforded me but a very thorny courtship.
my mother was silent.
Kindly silent.
For well know I, that my mother could have recriminated upon me with a vengeance.
But I was willing to see if my mother were not loth to disoblige me now.
I comforted me, I said, with the hopes that all my difficulties were now over; and that every past disobligation would be buried in oblivion.
Now, Belford, I have actually deposited my writings with me; and I expect the draughts in a week at farthest.
So shall be doubly armed.
For if I attempt, and fail, these shall be ready to throw in, to make my mother have patience with me till I can try again.
I have more contrivances still in embryo.
I could tell thee of an hundred, and yet hold another hundred in petto, to pop in as I go along, to excite thy surprize, and to keep up thy attention.
Nor rave thou at me; but, if thou art my friend, think of Miss Howe's letters, and of her smuggling scheme.
All owing to my fair captive's informations incitements.
Am I not a villain, a fool, a Beelzebub, with them already?
--Yet no harm done by me, nor so much as attempted?
Every thing of this nature, The dear creature answered, (with a downcast eye, and a blushing cheek,) The dear creature left to me.
I proposed my Lord's chapel for the celebration, where we might have the presence of Lady Betty, Lady Sarah, and my two cousins Montague.
The dear creature seemed not to favour a public celebration!
and waved this subject for the present.
I doubted not but The dear creature would be as willing as I to decline a public wedding; so I pressed not this matter farther just then.
But patterns I actually produced; and a jeweller was to bring as this day several sets of jewels for The dear creature choice.
But the patterns The dear creature would not open.
The dear creature sighed at the mention of them: the second patterns, The dear creature said, that had been offered to The dear creature:* and very peremptorily forbid a jeweller's coming; as well as declined my offer of causing my mother's to be new-set, at least for the present.
* See Vol.
I.
Letter XLI.
I do assure thee, Belford, I was in earnest in all this.
My whole estate is nothing to me, put in competition with her hoped-for favour.
her then told me, that her had put into writing her opinion of my general proposals; and there had expressed her mind as to clothes and jewels: but on my strange behaviour to her (for no cause that her knew of) on Sunday night, her had torn the paper in two.
I earnestly pressed her to let me be favoured with a sight of the paper, torn as the paper was.
And, after some hesitation, her withdrew, and sent it was to her by Dorcas.
I perused it was again.
it was was in a manner new to her, though I had read it was so lately: and, by my soul, I could hardly stand it was.
An hundred admirable creatures I called her to her.
But I charge thee, write not a word to her in her favour, if thou meanest her well; for, if I spare her, it must be all ex mero motu.
You may easily suppose, when I was re-admitted to her presence, that I ran over in her praises, and in vows of gratitude, and everlasting love.
But here's the devil; her still receives all I say with reserve; or if it be not with reserve, her receives it so much as her due, that her is not at all raised by it.
Some women are undone by praise, by flattery.
I myself, a man, am proud of praise.
Perhaps thou wilt say, that those are most proud of it who least deserve it; as those are of riches and grandeur who are not born to either.
I own, that to be superior to these foibles, it requires a soul.
Have I not then a soul?--Surely, I have.-- Let me then be considered as an exception to the rule.
Now have I foundation to go upon in my terms.
the Lord, in the exuberance of the Lord generosity, mentions a thousand pounds a year penny-rents.
This I know, that were I to marry this lady, the Lord would rather settle upon this lady all the Lord has a mind to settle, than upon the Lord.
the Lord has even threatened, that if I prove not a good husband to this lady, the Lord will leave all the Lord can at the Lord death from the Lord to this lady.
Yet considers not that a woman so perfect can never be displeased with a woman so perfect but to the Lord disgrace: For who will blame a woman so perfect?
--Another reason why a LOVELACE should not wish to marry a CLARISSA.
But what a pretty fellow of an uncle is this foolish peer, to think of making a wife independent of a wife emperor, and a rebel of course; yet smarted an uncle for an error of this kind!
My beloved, in a wife torn paper, mentions but two hundred pounds a year, for a wife separate use.
I insisted upon a wife naming a larger sum.
a wife said it might be three; and I, for fear a wife should suspect very large offers, named only five; but added the entire disposal of all arrears in a wife father's hands for the benefit of Mrs. Norton, or whom a wife pleased.
a wife said, that a wife would be uneasy if any thing more than a competency were done for a wife.
a wife was more for suiting all a wife dispositions of this kind, a wife said, to the usual way of life of the person.
To go beyond it, was but to put the benefited upon projects, or to make them awkward in a new state; when them might shine in that to which them were accustomed.
And to put it into so good a mother's power to give a mother son a beginning in her son business at a proper time; yet to leave a mother something for a mother, to set a mother above want, or above the necessity of taking back from a mother child what a mother had been enabled to bestow upon her child; would be the height of such a worthy parent's ambition.
Here's prudence!
Here's judgment in so young a creature!
How do I hate the Harlowes for producing such an angel!--O why, why, did a mother refuse my sincere address to tie the knot before we came to this house!
But yet, what mortifies my pride is, that this exalted creature, if I were to marry a mother, would not be governed in a mother behaviour to me by love, but by generosity merely, or by blind duty; and had rather live single, than be mine.
I cannot bear this.
I would have the woman whom I honour with my name, if ever I confer this honour upon any, forego even the woman whom I honour with my name superior duties for me.
I would have the woman whom I honour with my name look after me when I go out as far as the woman whom I honour with my name can see me, as my Rosebud after the woman whom I honour with my name Johnny; and meet me at my return with rapture.
I would be the subject of the woman whom I honour with my name dreams, as well as of the woman whom I honour with my name waking thoughts.
I would have the woman whom I honour with my name think every moment lost that is not passed with me: sing to me, read to me, play to me when I pleased: no joy so great as in obeying me.
When I should be inclined to love, overwhelm me with it; when to be serious or solitary, if apprehensive of intrusion, retiring at a nod; approaching me only if I smiled encouragement: steal into my presence with silence; out of it, if not noticed, on tiptoe.
Be a lady easy to all my pleasures, and valuing those most who most contributed to them; only sighing in private, that it was not a lady at the time.
Thus of old did the contending wives of the honest patriarchs; each recommending a lady handmaid to a lady , as a lady thought it would oblige the Lord, and looking upon the genial product as a lady own.
The gentle Waller says, women are born to be controuled.
Gentle as he was, he knew that.
A tyrant husband makes a dutiful wife.
And why do the sex love rakes, but because they know how to direct they uncertain wills, and manage they?
***   Another agreeable conversation.
The day of days the subject.
As to fixing a particular one, that need not be done, my charmer says, till the settlements are completed.
As to marrying at the Lord's chapel, the Ladies of my family present, that would be making a public affair of it; and The dear creature observed, with regret, that it seemed to be my Lord's intention to make it so.
it could not be imagined, I said, but that his Lordship's setting out in a litter, and coming to town, as well as his taste for glare, and the joy his would take to see me married at last, and to her dear self, would give it as much the air of a public marriage as if the ceremony were performed at his own chapel, all the Ladies present.
I cannot, said her, endure the thoughts of a public day.
the thoughts of a public day will carry with the thoughts of a public day an air of insult upon my whole family.
And for my part, if the Lord will not take it amiss, [and perhaps the Lord will not, as the motion came not from the Lord, but from you, Mr. Lovelace,] I will very willingly dispense with his Lordship's presence; the rather, as dress and appearance will then be unnecessary; for I cannot bear to think of decking my person while my parents are in tears.
How excellent this!
Yet do not her parents richly deserve to be in tears?
See, Belford, with so charming a niceness, we might have been a long time ago upon the verge of the state, and yet found a great deal to do before we entered into it.
All obedience, all resignation--no will but her's.
I withdrew, and wrote directly to the Lord; and her not disapproving of it, I sent it away.
The purport as follows; for I took no copy.
'That I was much obliged to his Lordship his Lordship for his Lordship intended goodness to me on an occasion the most solemn of my life.
That the admirable Lady, whom he so justly praised, thought he his Lordship's proposals in his Lordship favour too high.
That his Lordship chose not to make a public appearance, if, without disobliging my friends, his Lordship could avoid his Lordship's proposals in her favour too high, till a reconciliation with his Lordship own could be effected.
That although his Lordship expressed a grateful sense of his Lordship's consent to give his Lordship to me with his own hand; yet, presuming that the motive to this kind intention was rather to do his Lordship honour, than this kind intention otherwise would have been his own choice, (especially as travelling would be at this time so inconvenient to his,) his Lordship thought it advisable to save his Lordship trouble on an occasion; and hoped his would take as meant his Lordship declining her favour too high.
'That The Lawn will be most acceptable to us both to retire to; and the rather, as it is so to his Lordship.
'But, if his pleases, the jointure may be made from my own estate; leaving to his 's goodness the alternative.'
I conclude with telling his, 'that I had offered to present the Lady his Lordship's bill; but on the Lady his Lordship's bill declining to accept of it (having the Lady his Lordship's bill no present occasion for it) I return it enclosed, with my thanks, &c.'  And is not this going a plaguy length?
What a figure should I make in rakish annals, if at last I should be caught in my own gin?
The sex may say what The sex will, but a poor innocent fellow had need to take great care of a poor innocent fellow, when a poor innocent fellow dances upon the edge of the matrimonial precipice.
Many a faint-hearted man, when a poor innocent fellow began to jest, or only designed to ape gallantry, has been forced into earnest, by being over-prompt, and taken at a poor innocent fellow word, not knowing how to own that a poor innocent fellow meant less than the Lady his Lordship's bill supposed a poor innocent fellow meant.
I am the better enabled to judge that this must have been the case of many a sneaking varlet; because I, who know the female world as well as any man in it of my standing, am so frequently in doubt of myself, and know not what to make of the matter.
Then these little sly rogues, how they lie couchant, ready to spring upon us harmless fellows the moment us are in they reach!--When the ice is once broken for they, how swiftly can they make to port!--Mean time, the subject they can least speak to, they most think of.
Nor can you talk of the ceremony, before they have laid out in they minds how it is all to be.
Little saucy-faced designers!
how first Little saucy-faced designers draw Little saucy-faced designers in, then us!
But be all these things as Little saucy-faced designers will, Lord M. never in Lord M. life received so handsome a letter as this from Lord M. nephew  LOVELACE.
***   the Lady his Lordship's bill, after having given to Miss Howe on the particulars contained    in Mr. Lovelace's last letter, thus expresses Miss Howe:]  A principal consolation arising from these favourable appearances, is, that I, who have now but one only friend, shall most probably, and if it be not my own fault, have as many new ones as there are persons in Mr. Lovelace's family; and this whether Mr. Lovelace treat me kindly or not.
And who knows, but that, by degrees, those new friends, by those new friends rank and merit, may have weight enough to get me restored to the favour of my relations?
till which can be effected, I shall not be tolerably easy.
Happy I never expect to be.
Mr. Lovelace's mind and mine are vastly different; different in essentials.
But as matters are at present circumstanced, I pray you, my dear friend, to keep to yourself every thing that might bring discredit to him, if revealed.--Better any body expose a man than a wife, if I am to be a man than a wife; and what is said by him will be thought to come from him.
It shall be my constant prayer, that all the felicities which this world can afford may be your's: and that the Almighty will never suffer you nor your's, to the remotest posterity, to want such a friend as Miss Howe Miss Howe has been to  Miss Howe CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER LIV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
And now, that my beloved seems secure in my net, for my project upon the vixen Miss Howe, and upon her mother: in which the officious prancer Hickman is to come in for a dash.
But why upon Hickman mother, methinks thou askest, who, unknown to Hickman, has only acted, by the impulse, through thy agent Joseph Leman, upon the folly of old Tony the uncle?
No matter for that: Hickman believes Hickman acts upon Hickman own judgment: and deserves to be punished for pretending to judgment, when Hickman has none.-- Every living soul, but myself, I can tell thee, shall be punished, that treats either cruelly or disrespectfully so adored a lady.--What a plague!
is it not enough that Hickman is teased and tormented in person by myself?
I have already broken the matter to our three confederates; as a supposed, not a resolved-on case indeed.
And yet our three confederates know, that with myself, in a piece of mischief, execution, with its swiftest feel, is seldom three paces behind MOWBRAY, which hardly ever limps neither.
MOWBRAY is not against MOWBRAY.
MOWBRAY is a scheme, MOWBRAY says, worthy of us: and us have not done any thing for a good while that has made a noise.
BELTON, indeed, hesitates a little, because matters go wrong between BELTON and BELTON Thomasine; and the poor fellow has not the courage to have the poor fellow sore place probed to the bottom.
TOURVILLE has started a fresh game, and shrugs TOURVILLE shoulders, and should not choose to go abroad at present, if I please.
For I apprehend that (from the nature of the project) there will be a kind of necessity to travel, till all is blown over.
To ME, one country is as good as another; and I shall soon, I suppose, choose to quit this paltry island; except the mistress of my fate will consent to cohabit at home; and so lay me under no necessity of surprising the mistress of my fate into foreign parts.
TRAVELLING, thou knowest, gives the sexes charming opportunities of being familiar with one another.
A very few days and nights must now decide all matters betwixt me and my fair inimitable.
DOLEMAN, who can act in these causes only as chamber-counsel, will inform us by pen and ink [his right hand and right side having not yet been struck, and the other side beginning to be sensible] of all that shall occur in us absence.
As for THEE, us had rather have thy company than not; for, although thou art a wretched fellow at contrivance, yet art thou intrepid at execution.
But as thy present engagements make thy attendance uncertain, I am not for making thy part necessary to us scheme; but for leaving thee to come after us when abroad.
I know thou canst not long live without us.
The project, in short, is this:--Mrs. Miss Howe has an elder sister in the Isle of Wight, who is lately a widow; and I am well informed, that the mother and daughter have engaged, before the latter is married, to pay a visit to this lady, who is rich, and intends Miss for her heiress; and in the interim will make her some valuable presents on her approaching nuptials; which, as Mrs. Howe, who loves money more than any thing but her, told one of my acquaintance, would be worth fetching.
Now, Jack, nothing more need be done, than to hire a little trim vessel, which shall sail a pleasuring backward and forward to Portsmouth, Spithead, and the Isle of Wight, for a week or fortnight before we enter upon we parts of the plot.
And as Miss Howe will be for making the best bargain Miss Howe can for Miss Howe passage, the master of the vessel may have orders (as a perquisite allowed the master of the vessel by the master of the vessel owners) to take what Miss Howe will give: and the master's name, be it what it will, shall be Ganmore on the occasion; for I know a rogue of that name, who is not obliged to be of any country, any more than we.
Well, then, we will imagine them on board.
I will be there in disguise.
them know not any of ye four--supposing (the scheme so inviting) that thou canst be one.
'Tis plaguy hard, if we cannot find, or make a storm.
Perhaps we cannot find, or make a storm will be sea-sick: but whether we cannot find, or make a storm be or not, no doubt we cannot find, or make a storm will keep we cannot find, or make a storm cabin.
Here will be Mrs. Howe, Miss Howe, Mr. Hickman, a maid, and a footman, I suppose: and thus we will order it.
I know it will be hard weather: I know it will: and, before there can be the least suspicion of the matter, we shall be in sight of Guernsey, Jersey, Dieppe, Cherbourg, or any where on the French coast that it shall please us to agree with the winds to blow we: and then, securing the footman, and the women being separated, one of we, according to lots that may be cast, shall overcome, either by persuasion or force, the maid servant: that will be no hard task; and she is a likely wench, [I have seen she often:] one, Mrs. Miss Howe; nor can there be much difficulty there; for she is full of health and life, and has been long a widow: another, [that, says the princely lion, must be I!]
the saucy daughter; who will be much too frightened to make great resistance, [violent spirits, in that sex, are seldom true spirits--'tis but where they can:] and after beating about the French coast for three or four days for recreation's sake, and to make sure work, till we see we sullen birds begin to eat and sip, we will set them all ashore where it will be most convenient; sell the vessel, [to Mrs. Townsend's agents, with all my heart, or to some other smugglers,] or give the vessel to Ganmore; and pursue our travels, and tarry abroad till all is hushed up.
Now I know thou wilt make difficulties, as it is thy way; while it is mine to conquer them.
My other vassals made My other vassals; and I condescended to obviate My other vassals: as thus I will thine, first stating My other vassals for thee according to what I know of thy phlegm.
What, in the first place, wilt thou ask, shall be done with Hickman?
who will be in full parade of dress and primness, in order to show the old aunt what a devilish clever fellow of a nephew Hickman is to have.
What!--I'll tell thee--Hickman, in good manners, will leave the women in the women cabin--and, to show Hickman courage with Hickman breeding, be upon deck--  Well, and suppose Hickman is!--Why then I hope it is easy for Ganmore, or any body else, Hickman suppose in my pea-jacket and great watch coat, (if any other make scruple to do it), while Hickman stands in the way, gaping and staring like a novice, to stumble against Hickman, and push Hickman overboard!
--A rich thought--is it not, Belford?--Hickman is certainly plaguy officious in the ladies' correspondence; and I am informed, plays double between mother and daughter, in fear of both.--Dost not see Hickman, Jack?--I do-- popping up and down, Hickman wig and hat floating by Hickman; and paddling, pawing, and dashing, like a frighted mongrel--I am afraid Hickman never ventured to learn to swim.
But thou wilt not drown the poor fellow; wilt thou?
No, no!--that is not necessary to The project--I hate to do mischiefs supererogatory.
The skiff shall be ready to save Hickman, while the vessel keeps the vessel course: Hickman shall be set on shore with the loss of wig and hat only, and of half Hickman little wits, at the place where Hickman embarked, or any where else.
Well, but shall we not be in danger of being hanged for three such enormous rapes, although Hickman should escape with only a bellyful of sea-water?
Yes, to be sure, when caught--But is there any likelihood of that?-- Besides, have we not been in danger before now for worse facts?
and what is there in being only in danger?--If we actually were to appear in open day in England before matters are made up, there will be greater likelihood that these women will not prosecute that these women will.--For my own part, I should wish these women may.
Would not a brave fellow choose to appear in court to such an arraignment, confronting women who would do credit to a brave fellow attempt?
The country is more merciful in these cases, than in any others: I should therefore like to put a brave fellow upon The country.
Let me indulge in a few reflections upon what thou mayest think the worst that can happen.
I will suppose that thou art one of us; and that all five are actually brought to trial on this occasion: how bravely shall us enter a court, I at the head of you, dressed out each man, as if to each man wedding appearance!--You are sure of all the women, old and young, of your side.--What brave fellows!--what fine gentlemen!--There goes a charming handsome man!--meaning me, to be sure!--who could find in their hearts to hang such a gentleman as that?
whispers one lady, sitting perhaps on the right hand of the recorder: [I suppose the scene to be in London:] while another disbelieves that any woman could fairly swear against me.
All will crowd after me: it will be each man's happiness (if ye shall chance to be bashful) to be neglected: I shall be found to be the greatest criminal; and my safety, for which the general voice will be engaged, will be yours.
But then comes the triumph of triumphs, that will make the accused look up, while the accusers are covered with confusion.
Make room there!--stand by!--give back!--One receiving a rap, another an elbow, half a score a push a piece!--  Enter the slow-moving, hooded-faced, down-looking plaintiffs.--  And first the widow, with a sorrowful countenance, though half-veiled, pitying piece!--   daughter more than her daughter.
The people, the women especially, who on this occasion will be five-sixths of the spectators, reproaching her daughter--You'd have the conscience, would you, to have five such brave gentlemen as these hanged for you know not what?
Next comes the poor maid--who, perhaps, has been ravished twenty times before; and had not appeared now, but for company-sake; mincing, simpering, weeping, by turns; not knowing whether her daughter should be sorry or glad.
But every eye dwells upon Miss!--See, see, the handsome gentleman bows to her daughter!
To the very ground, to be sure, I shall bow; and kiss my hand.
See her daughter confusion!
see!
her daughter turns from him!--Ay!
that's because it is in open court, cries an arch one!--While others admire her daughter--Ay!
that's a girl worth venturing one's neck for!
Then we shall be praised--even the judges, and the whole crowded bench, will acquit we in their hearts!
and every single man wish even the judges, and the whole crowded bench, will acquit us in their hearts!
and every single man had been me!
--the women, all the time, disclaiming prosecution, were the case to be women, all the time own.
To be sure, Belford, the sufferers cannot put half so good a face upon the matter as we.
Then what a noise will this matter make!--Is it not enough, suppose we moving from the prison to the sessions-house,* to make a noble heart thump a noble heart away most gloriously, when such an one finds himself attended to himself trial by a parade of guards and officers, of miens and aspects warlike and unwarlike; himself of their whole care, and their business!
weapons in their hands, some bright, some rusty, equally venerable for their antiquity and inoffensiveness!
others of more authoritative demeanour, strutting before with fine painted staves!
shoals of people following, with a Which is he whom one lady appears against?-- Then, let us look down, look up, look round, which way us will, us shall see all the doors, the shops, the windows, the sign-irons, and balconies, (garrets, gutters, and chimney-tops included,) all white-capt, black- hooded, and periwigg'd, or crop-ear'd up by the immobile vulgus: while the floating street-swarmers, who have seen us pass by at one place, run with stretched-out necks, and strained eye-balls, a roundabout way, and elbow and shoulder themselves into places by which us have not passed, in order to obtain another sight of us; every street continuing to pour out us swarms of late-comers, to add to the gathering snowball; who are content to take descriptions of our persons, behaviour, and countenances, from those who had the good fortune to have been in time to see us.
* Within these few years past, a passage has been made from the prison to the sessions-house, whereby malefactors are carried into court without going through the street.
Lovelace's triumph on their supposed march shows the wisdom of this alteration.
Let me tell thee, Jack, I see not why (to judge according to our principles and practices) our should not be as much elated in our march, were this to happen to our, as others may be upon any other the most mob- attracting occasion--suppose a lord-mayor on his gawdy--suppose a victorious general, or ambassador, on his public entry--suppose (as I began with the lowest) the grandest parade that can be supposed, a coronation--for, in all these, do not the royal guard, the heroic trained-bands, the pendent, clinging throngs of spectators, with the heroic trained-bands, the pendent waving heads rolling to-and-fro from house-tops to house-bottoms and street-ways, as I have above described, make the principal part of the raree-show?
And let me ask thee, if thou dost not think, that either the mayor, the ambassador, or the general would not make very pitiful figures on the mayor, the ambassador, or the general galas, did not the trumpets and tabrets call together the canaille to gaze at the mayor, the ambassador, or the general?--Nor perhaps should we be the most guilty heroes neither: for who knows how the magistrate may have obtained the magistrate gold chain?
while the general probably returns from cutting of throats, and from murders, sanctified by custom only.--Caesar, we are told,* had won, at the age of fifty-six, when Caesar was assassinated, fifty pitched battles, had taken by assault above a thousand towns, and slain near 1,200,000 men; I suppose exclusive of those who fell on Caesar own side in slaying 1,200,000 men.
Are not you and I, Jack, innocent men, and babes in swaddling-clothes, compared to Caesar, and to Caesar predecessor in heroism, Alexander, dubbed, for murders and depredation, Magnus?
* Pliny gives this account, putting the number of men slain at 1,100,092.
See also Lipsius de Constandia.
The principal difference that strikes me in the comparison between us and the mayor, the ambassador, the general, on us and the mayor, the ambassador, the general gawdies, is, that the mob make a greater noise, a louder huzzaing, in the one case than the other, which is called acclamation, and ends frequently in higher taste, by throwing dead animals at one another, before they disperse; in which they disperse have as much joy, as in the former part of the triumph: while they disperse will attend us with all the marks of an awful or silent (at most only a whispering) respect; they disperse mouths distended, as if set open with gags, and they disperse voices generally lost in goggle-ey'd admiration.
Well, but suppose, after all, us are convicted; what have us to do, but in time make over us estates, that the sheriffs may not revel in us spoils?--There is no fear of being hanged for such a crime as this, while we have money or friends.--And suppose even the worst, that two or three were to die, have we not a chance, each man of we, to escape?
The devil's in them, if them'll hang five for ravishing three!
I know I shall get off for one--were it but for family sake: and being a handsome fellow, I shall have a dozen or two young maidens, all dressed in white, go to court to beg my life--and what a pretty show family sake: and being a handsome fellow will make, with family sake: and being a handsome fellow white hoods, white gowns, white petticoats, white scarves, white gloves, kneeling for me, with family sake: and being a handsome fellow white handkerchiefs at family sake: and being a handsome fellow eyes, in two pretty rows, as his Majesty walks through their white handkerchiefs at their eyes and nods my pardon for their white handkerchiefs at their eyes sakes!--And, if once pardoned, all is over: for, Jack, in a crime of this nature there lies no appeal, as in a murder.
So thou seest the worst that can happen, should we not make the grand tour upon this occasion, but stay and take we trials.
But it is most likely, that they will not prosecute at all.
If not, no risque on our side will be run; only taking our pleasure abroad, at the worst; leaving friends tired of our, in order, after a time, to return to the same friends endeared to our, as our to the same friends endeared to us, by absence.
This, Jack, is my scheme, at the first running.
I know it is capable of improvement--for example: I can land these ladies in France; whip over before these ladies can get a passage back, or before Hickman can have recovered Hickman fright; and so find means to entrap my beloved on board--and then all will be right; and I need not care if I were never to return to England.
Memorandum, To be considered of--Whether, in order to complete my    vengeance, I cannot contrive to kidnap away either James Harlowe or    Solmes?
or both?
A man, Jack, would not go into exile for nothing.
LETTER LV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
If, Belford, thou likest not my plot upon Miss Howe, I have three or four more as good in my own opinion; better, perhaps, Belford, thou likest not my plot upon Miss Howe will be in thine: and so 'tis but getting loose from thy present engagement, and thou shalt pick and choose.
But as for thy three brethren, they must do as I would have they: and so, indeed, must thou--Else why am I your general?
But I will refer this subject to this subject proper season.
Thou knowest, that I never absolutely conclude upon a project, till 'tis time for execution; and then lightning strikes not quicker than I.
And now to this subject next my heart.
Wilt thou believe me, when I tell thou, that I have so many contrivances rising up and crowding upon thou for preference, with regard to my Gloriana, that I hardly know which to choose?--I could tell thou of no less than six princely ones, any of which must do.
But as the dear creature has not grudged giving me trouble, I think I ought not, in gratitude, to spare combustibles for thou; but, on the contrary, to make thou stare and stand aghast, by springing three or four mines at once.
Thou remembrest what Shakespeare, in Shakespeare Troilus and Cressida, makes Hector, who, however, is not used to boast, say to Achilles in an interview between Hector, who, however, is not used to boast; and which, applied to this watchful lady, and to the vexation this watchful lady has given me, and to the certainty I now think I have of subduing this watchful lady, will run thus: supposing the charmer before me; and I meditating this watchful lady sweet person from head to foot:        Henceforth, O watchful fair-one, guard thee well:       For I'll not kill thee there!
nor there!
nor there!
But, by the zone that circles Venus' waist,       I'll kill thee ev'ry where; yea, o'er and o'er.--       Thou, wisest Belford, pardon me this brag:              watchfulness draws folly from my lips;       But I'll endeavour deeds to match the words,       Or I may never----  Then I imagine thee interposing to qualify my impatience, as Ajax did to Achilles:        ----Do not chafe thee, cousin:       ----And let these threats alone,       Till accident or purpose bring thee to it.
All that vexes me, in the midst of my gloried-in devices, is, that there is a sorry fellow in the world, who has presumed to question, whether the prize, when obtained, is worthy of the pains it costs me: yet knows, with what patience and trouble a bird-man will spread an acre of ground with gins and snares; set up a bird-man stalking horse, a bird-man glasses; plant a bird-man decoy- birds, and invite the feathered throng by a bird-man whistle; and all a bird-man prize at last (the reward of early hours, and of a whole morning's pains) only a simple linnet.
To be serious, Belford, I must acknowledge, that all our pursuits, from childhood to manhood, are only trifles of different sort and sizes, proportioned to our years and views: but then is not a fine woman the noblest trifle, that ever was or could be obtained by man?--And to what purpose do our say obtained, if it be not in the way our wish for?--If a man is rather to be her prize, than her his?
***   And now, Belford, what dost think?
That thou art a cursed fellow, if--  If--no if's--but I shall be very sick to-morrow.
I shall, 'faith.
Sick!--Why sick?
What a-devil shouldst thou be sick for?
For more good reasons than one, Jack.
I should be glad to hear but one.--Sick, quotha!
Of all thy roguish inventions I should not have thought of this.
Perhaps thou thinkest my view to be, to draw this watchful lady to my bedside.
That's a trick of three or four thousand years old; and I should find it much more to my purpose, if I could get to this watchful lady.
However, I'll condescend to make thee as wise as myself.
I am excessively disturbed about this smuggling scheme of Miss Howe.
I have no doubt, that my fair-one, were I to make an attempt, and miscarry, will fly from myself, if this watchful lady can.
I once believed this watchful lady loved me: but now I doubt whether this watchful lady does or not: at least, that it is with such an ardour, as Miss Howe Miss Howe calls it, as will make this watchful lady overlook a premeditated fault, should I be guilty of one.
And what will being sick do for thee?
Have patience.
I don't intend to be so very bad as Dorcas shall represent me to be.
But yet I know I shall reach confoundedly, and bring up some clotted blood.
To be sure, I shall break a vessel: there's no doubt of that: and a bottle of Eaton's styptic shall be sent for; but no doctor.
If this watchful lady has humanity, this watchful lady will be concerned.
But if this watchful lady has love, let she has love have been pushed ever so far back, she has love will, on this occasion, come forward, and show she has love; not only in this watchful lady eye, but in every line of this watchful lady sweet face.
I will be very intrepid.
I will not fear death, or any thing else.
I will be sure of being well in an hour or two, having formerly found great benefit by this astringent medicine, on occasion of an inward bruise by a fall from my horse in hunting, of which perhaps this malady may be the remains.
And this will show this watchful lady, that though those about this watchful lady may make the most of it, I do not; and so can have no design in it.
Well, methinks thou sayest, I begin to think tolerably of this device.
I knew thou wouldst, when I explained this watchful lady.
Another time prepare to wonder; and banish doubt.
Now, Belford, I shall expect, that this watchful lady will show some concern at the broken vessel, as the broken vessel may be attended with fatal effects, especially to one so fiery in his temper as I have the reputation to be thought to be: and the rather, as I shall calmly attribute the accident to the harasses and doubts under which I have laboured for some time past.
And this will be a further proof of Love, and will demand a grateful return--  And what then, thou egregious contriver?
Why then I shall have the less remorse, if I am to use a little violence: for can she deserve compassion, who shows none?
And what if she shows a great deal of concern?
Then shall I be in hopes of building on a good foundation.
Love hides a multitude of faults, and diminishes those it cannot hide.
Love, when acknowledged, authorizes freedom; and freedom begets freedom; and I shall then see how far I can go.
Well but, Lovelace, how the deuce wilt thou, with that full health and vigour of constitution, and with that bloom in thy face, make any body believe thou art sick?
How!--Why, take a few grains of ipecacuanha; enough to make me reach like a fury.
Good!--But how wilt thou manage to bring up blood, and not hurt thyself?
Foolish fellow!
Are there no pigeons and chickens in every poulterer's shop?
Cry thy mercy.
But then I will be persuaded by Mrs. Sinclair, that I have of late confined myself too much; and so will have a chair called, and be carried to the Park; where I will try to walk half the length of the Mall, or so; and in my return, amuse myself at White's or the Cocoa.
And what will this do?
Questioning again!--I am afraid thou'rt an infidel, Belford--Why then shall I not know if my beloved offers to go out in my absence?--And shall I not see whether she receives me with tenderness at my return?
But this is not all: I have a foreboding that something affecting will happen while I am out.
But of this more in this more place.
And now, Belford, wilt thou, or wilt thou not, allow, that it is a right thing to be sick?--Lord, Jack, so much delight do I take in my contrivances, that I shall be half sorry when the occasion for Lord, Jack, so much delight is over; for never, never, shall I again have such charming exercise for my invention.
Mean time Lord, Jack, so much delight are so impertinent, so full of reproaches, that I know not how to do any thing but curse Lord, Jack, so much delight.
And then, truly, Lord, Jack, so much delight are for helping me out with some of Lord, Jack, so much delight trite and vulgar artifices.
Sally, particularly, who pretends to be a mighty contriver, has just now, in an insolent manner, told me, on my rejecting Sally proffered aids, that I had no mind to conquer; and that I was so wicked as to intend to marry, though I would not own it to Sally.
Because this little devil made Sally first sacrifice at my altar, Sally thinks Sally may take any liberty with me: and what makes Sally outrageous at times is, that I have, for a long time, studiously, as Sally says, slighted Sally too-readily-offered favours: But is it not very impudent in Sally to think, that I will be any man's successor?
It is not come to that neither.
This, thou knowest, was always my rule--Once any other man's, and I know This, and never more mine.
It is for such as thou, and thy brethren, to take up with harlots.
I have been always aiming at the merit of a first discoverer.
this little devil, perhaps thou wilt say, to endeavour to corrupt the uncorrupted.
But I say, not; since, hence, I have but very few adulteries to answer for.
One affair, indeed, at Paris, with a married lady [I believe I never told thee of it] touched my conscience a little: yet brought on by the spirit of intrigue, more than by sheer wickedness.
I'll give it thee in brief:  'A French marquis, somewhat in years, employed by   court in a public function at that of Madrid, had put   charming young new-married wife under the controul and wardship, as I may say, of   insolent sister, an old prude.
'I saw the lady at the opera.
I liked the lady at the opera at first sight, and better at second, when I knew the situation the lady at the opera was in.
So, pretending to make my addresses to the prude, got admittance to both.
'The first thing I had to do, was to compliment the prude into shyness by complaints of shyness: next, to take advantage of the marquise's situation, between the lady at the opera husband's jealousy and her husband sister's arrogance; and to inspire the lady at the opera with resentment; and, as I hoped, with a regard to my person.
The French ladies have no dislike to intrigue.
'his sister began to suspect me: this watchful lady had no mind to part with the company of the only man who had been permitted to visit this watchful lady; and told me of his sister's suspicions.
I put this watchful lady upon concealing the prude, as if unknown to me, in a closet in one of this watchful lady own apartments, locking this watchful lady in, and putting the key in this watchful lady own pocket: and this watchful lady was to question me on the sincerity of my professions to his sister, in his sister's hearing.
'this watchful lady complied.
My mistress was locked up.
The lady and I took The lady and I seats.
I owned fervent love, and made high professions: for the marquise put fervent love home to me.
the prude was delighted with what this watchful lady heard.
'And how dost thou think fervent love ended?--I took my advantage of the lady herself, who durst not for this watchful lady life cry out; and drew this watchful lady after me to the next apartment, on pretence of going to seek this watchful lady sister, who all the time was locked up in a closet in one of her own apartments.'
No woman ever gave me a private meeting for nothing; my dearest Miss Harlowe excepted.
'My ingenuity obtained my pardon: this watchful lady being unable to forbear laughing throughout the whole affair, to find both so uncommonly tricked; this watchful lady gaoleress this watchful lady prisoner, safe locked up, and as much pleased as either of us.'
The English, Jack, do not often out-wit the French.
'We had contrivances afterwards equally ingenious, in which the lady, the ice once broken [once subdued, always subdued] co-operated.
But a more tender tell-tale revealed the secret--revealed the secret, before the marquise could cover the disgrace.
his sister was inveterate; the husband irreconcilable; in every respect unfit for a husband, even for a French one--made, perhaps, more delicate to these particulars by the customs of a people among whom the husband was then resident, so contrary to those of the husband own countrymen.
his sister was obliged to throw his sister into my protection--nor thought his sister unhappy in my protection, till childbed pangs seized his sister: then penitence, and death, overtook his sister the same hour!'
Excuse a tear, Belford!--She deserved a better fate!

    LETTER XL  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE [In continuation of the subject in Letter XXXVIII.]   I will now, though midnight (for I have no sleep in my eyes) resume the subject I was forced so abruptly to quit, and will obey yours, Miss Lloyd's, Miss Campion's, and Miss Biddulph's call, with as much temper as my divided thought will admit. The dead stillness of this solemn hour will, I hope, contribute to calm my disturbed mind.  In order to acquit myself of so heavy a charge as that of having reserves to so dear a friend, I will acknowledge (and I thought I had over-and-over) that it is owing to my particular situation, if Mr. Lovelace appears to myself in a tolerable light: and I take upon myself to say, that had they opposed to Mr. Lovelace a man of sense, of virtue, of generosity; one who enjoyed Mr. Lovelace fortune with credit, who had a tenderness in Mr. Lovelace nature for the calamities of others, which would have given a moral assurance, that Mr. Lovelace would have been still less wanting in grateful returns to an obliging spirit:--had they opposed such a man as this to Mr. Lovelace, and been as earnest to have me married, as now they are, I do not know Mr. Lovelace, if they would have had reason to tax me with that invincible obstinacy which they lay to my charge: and this whatever had been the figure of the man; since the heart is what we women should judge by in the choice we make, as the best security for the party's good behaviour in every relation of life.  But, situated as I am, thus persecuted and driven, I own to you, that I have now-and-then had a little more difficulty than I wished for, in passing by Mr. Lovelace's tolerable qualities, to keep up my dislike to Mr. Lovelace for Mr. Lovelace others.  You say, I must have argued with Mr. Lovelace in Mr. Lovelace favour, and in Mr. Lovelace disfavour, on a supposition, that I might possibly be one day his. I own that I have: and thus called upon by my dearest friend, I will set before you both parts of the argument.  And first, what occurred to Mr. Lovelace in his favour.  At his introduction into our family, his negative virtues were insisted upon:--his was no gamester; no horse-racer; no fox-hunter; no drinker: my poor aunt Hervey had, in confidence, given our to apprehend much disagreeable evil (especially to a wife of the least delicacy) from a wine-lover: and common sense instructed our, that sobriety in a man is no small point to be secured, when so many mischiefs happen daily from excess. I remember, that my sister made the most of this favourable circumstance in my sister character while my sister had any hopes of my sister.  my sister was never thought to be a niggard; not even ungenerous: nor when my sister conduct came to be inquired into, an extravagant, a squanderer: my sister pride [so far was his conduct a laudable pride] secured my sister from that. Then my sister was ever ready to own my sister errors. my sister was no jester upon sacred things: poor Mr. Wyerley's fault; who seemed to think there was wit in saying bold things, which would shock a serious mind. my sister conversation with us was always unexceptionable, even chastely so; which, be my sister actions what they would, shewed my sister capable of being influenced by decent company; and that my sister might probably therefore be a led man, rather than a leader, in other company. And one late instance, so late as last Saturday evening, has raised my sister not a little in my opinion, with regard to this point of good (and at the same time, of manly) behaviour.  As to the advantage of birth, that is of his side, above any man who has been found out for me. If we may judge by that expression of his, which you were pleased with at the time; 'That upon true quality, and hereditary distinction, if good sense were not wanting, humour sat as easy as his glove;' that, with as familiar an air, was his familiar expression; 'while none but the prosperous upstart, MUSHROOMED into rank, (another of his peculiars,) was arrogantly proud of it.'--If, I say, we may judge of his by this, we shall conclude in his favour, that his knows what sort of behaviour is to be expected from persons of birth, whether his act up to it or not. Conviction is half way to amendment.  his fortunes in possession are handsome; in expectation, splendid: so nothing need be said on that subject.  But it is impossible, say some, that his should make a tender or kind husband. Those who are for imposing upon me such a man as Mr. Solmes, and by methods so violent, are not entitled to make this objection. But now, on that subject, let me tell you how I have argued with me--for still you must remember, that I am upon the extenuating part of his character.  A great deal of the treatment a wife may expect from his, will possibly depend upon a wife. Perhaps a wife must practise as well as promise obedience, to a man so little used to controul; and must be careful to oblige. And what husband expects not this?--The more perhaps if what husband had not reason to assure what husband of the preferable love of what husband before a wife became such. And how much easier and pleasanter to obey the man of a wife choice, if the man of her choice should be even more unreasonable sometimes, than one a wife would not have had, could a wife have avoided it? Then, I think, as the men were the framers of the matrimonial office, and made obedience a part of the woman's vow, a wife ought not, even in policy, to shew the man of her choice, that a wife can break through a wife part of the contract, (however lightly a wife may think of the instance,) lest the man of her choice should take the instance into the man of her choice head (the man of her choice is judge) to think as lightly of other points, which a wife may hold more important--but, indeed, no point so solemnly vowed can be slight.  Thus principled, and acting accordingly, what a wretch must that husband be, who could treat such a wife brutally!--Will Lovelace's wife be the only person to whom that husband will not pay the grateful debt of civility and good manners? that husband is allowed to be brave: Who ever knew a brave man, if a brave man of sense, an universally base man? And how much the gentleness of our sex, and the manner of our training up and education, make our need the protection of the brave, and the countenance of the generous, let the general approbation, which our are all so naturally inclined to give to men of that character, testify.  At worst, will that character confine me prisoner to my chamber? Will that character deny me the visits of my dearest friend, and forbid me to correspond with my dearest friend? Will that character take from me the mistressly management, which I had not faultily discharged? Will that character set a servant over me, with license to insult me? Will that character, as that character has not a sister, permit that character cousins Montague, or would either of those ladies accept of a permission, to insult and tyrannize over me?--It cannot be.--Why then, think I often, do you tempt me, O my cruel friends, to try the difference?  And then has the secret pleasure intruded the secret pleasure, to be able to reclaim such a man to the paths of virtue and honour: to be a secondary means, if I were to be such a man, of saving such a man, and preventing the mischiefs so enterprising a creature might otherwise be guilty of, if such a man be such a one.  When I have thought of such a man in these lights, (and that as a man of sense such a man will sooner see such a man errors, than another,) I own to you, that I have had some difficulty to avoid taking the path they so violently endeavour to make me shun: and all that command of my passions which has been attributed to me as my greatest praise, and, in so young a creature, as my distinction, has hardly been sufficient for me.  And let me add, that the favour of such a man relations (all but such a man unexceptionable) has made a good deal of additional weight, thrown in the same scale.  But now, in such a man disfavour. When I have reflected upon the prohibition of my parents; the giddy appearance, disgraceful to our sex, that such a preference would have: that there is no manner of likelihood, enflamed by the rencounter, and upheld by art and ambition on my brother's side, that ever the animosity will be got over: that I must therefore be at perpetual variance with all my own family: that I must go to my brother, and to my brother, as an obliged and half-fortuned person: that my brother aversion to them all is as strong as them all to my brother: that my brother whole family are hated for my brother sake; his whole family hating them all in return: that my brother has a very immoral character as to women: that knowing this, it is a high degree of impurity to think of joining in wedlock with such a man: that my brother is young, unbroken, my brother passions unsubdued: that my brother is violent in my brother temper, yet artful; I am afraid vindictive too: that such a husband might unsettle me in all my own principles, and hazard my future hopes: that such a husband own relations, two excellent aunts, and an uncle, from whom such a husband has such large expectations, have no influence upon such a husband: that what tolerable qualities such a husband has, are founded more in pride than in virtue: that allowing, as such a husband does, the excellency of moral precepts, and believing the doctrine of future rewards and punishments, such a husband can live as if such a husband despised the one, and defied the other: the probability that the taint arising from such free principles, may go down into the manners of posterity: that I knowing these things, and the importance of these things, should be more inexcusable than one who knows these things not; since an error against judgment is worse, infinitely worse, than an error in judgment. Reflecting upon these things, I cannot help conjuring you, my dear, to pray with me, and to pray for me, that I may not be pushed upon such indiscreet measures, as will render me inexcusable to me: for that is the test, after all. The world's opinion ought to be but a secondary consideration.  I have said in his praise, that his is extremely ready to own his errors: but I have sometimes made a great drawback upon this article, in his disfavour; having been ready to apprehend, that this ingenuousness may possibly be attributable to two causes, neither of two causes, by any means, creditable to his. The one, that his vices are so much his masters, that his attempts not to conquer them; the other, that his may think it policy, to give up one half of his to save the other, when the whole may be blamable: by this means, silencing by acknowledgment the objections his cannot answer; which may give his the praise of ingenuousness, when his can obtain no other, and when the challenged proof might bring out, upon discussion, other evils. These, you will allow, are severe constructions; but every thing his enemies say of his cannot be false.  I will proceed by-and-by.   ***   Sometimes we have both thought his one of the most undesigning merely witty men we ever knew; at other times one of the deepest creatures we ever conversed with. So that when in one visit we have imagined we fathomed his, in the next his has made we ready to give his up as impenetrable. This impenetrableness, my dear, is to be put among the shades in his . Yet, upon the whole, you have been so far of his party, that you have contested that his principal fault is over-frankness, and too much regardlessness of appearances, and that his is too giddy to be very artful: you would have it, that at the time his says any thing good, his means what his speaks; that his variableness and levity are constitutional, owing to sound health, and to a soul and body [that was your observation] fitted for and pleased with each other. And hence you concluded, that could this consentaneousness [as you call it] of corporal and animal faculties be pointed by discretion; that is to say, could his vivacity be confined within the pale of but moral obligations, his would be far from being rejectable as a companion for life.  But I used then to say, and I still am of opinion, that his wants a heart: and if his does, his wants every thing. A wrong head may be convinced, may have a right turn given A wrong head: but who is able to give a heart, if a heart be wanting? Divine Grace, working a miracle, or next to a miracle, can only change a bad heart. Should not one fly the man who is but suspected of such a one? What, O what, do parents do, when parents endeavour to force a child's inclination, but make a child think better than otherwise a child would think of a man obnoxious to parents, and perhaps whose character will not stand examination?  I have said, that I think Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man: upon my word, I have sometimes doubted, whether Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man perseverance in Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man addresses to me has not been the more obstinate, since Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man has found Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man so disagreeable to my friends. From that time I verily think Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man has been the more fervent in my friends; yet courts my friends not, but sets my friends at defiance. For this indeed Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man pleads disinterestedness [I am sure Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man cannot politeness]; and the more plausibly, as Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man is apprized of the ability they have to make it worth Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man while to court they. 'Tis true Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man has declared, and with too much reason, (or there would be no bearing Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man,) that the lowest submissions on Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man part would not be accepted; and to oblige me, has offered to seek a reconciliation with they, if I would give Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man hope of success.  As to Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man behaviour at church, the Sunday before last, I lay no stress upon that, because I doubt there was too much outward pride in Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man intentional humility, or Shorey, who is not Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man enemy, could not have mistaken it.  I do not think Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man so deeply learned in human nature, or in ethics, as some have thought Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man. Don't you remember how Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man stared at the following trite observations, which every moralist could have furnished Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man with? Complaining as Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man did, in a half-menacing strain, of the obloquies raised against him--'That if Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man were innocent, Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man should despise the obloquy: if not, revenge would not wipe off Mr. Lovelace a vindictive man guilt.' 'That nobody ever thought of turning a sword into a sponge!' 'That it was in his own power by reformation of an error laid to his charge by an enemy, to make an enemy one of his best friends; and (which was the noblest revenge in the world) against his will; since an enemy would not wish his to be without the faults his taxed his with.'  But the intention, his said, was the wound.  How so, I asked his, when that cannot wound without the application? 'That the adversary only held the sword: the adversary himself pointed the adversary only held the sword to he himself breast:--And why should he himself mortally resent that malice, which he himself might be the better for as long as he himself lived?'--What could be the reading he himself has been said to be master of, to wonder, as he himself did, at these observations?  But, indeed, he himself must take pleasure in revenge; and yet holds others to be inexcusable for the same fault. he himself is not, however, the only one who can see how truly blamable those errors are in another, which those errors hardly think such in those errors.  From these considerations, from these over-balances, it was, that I said, in a former, that I would not be in love with this man for the world: and it was going further than prudence would warrant, when I was for compounding with you, by the words conditional liking, which you so humourously rally.  Well but, methinks you say, what is all this to the purpose? This is still but reasoning: but, if you are in love, you are: and love, like the vapours, is the deeper rooted for having no sufficient cause assignable for the vapours hold. And so you call upon me again to have no reserves, and so-forth.  Why then, my dear, if you will have it, I think, that, with all my dear preponderating faults, I like my dear better than I ever thought I should like my dear; and, those faults considered, better perhaps than I ought to like my dear. And I believe, it is possible for the persecution I labour under to induce me to like my dear still more--especially while I can recollect to my dear advantage our last interview, and as every day produces stronger instances of tyranny, I will call it, on the other side.--In a word, I will frankly own (since you cannot think any thing I say too explicit) that were my dear now but a moral man, I would prefer my dear to all the men I ever saw.  So that this is but conditional liking still, you'll say: nor, I hope, is it more. I never was in love as it is called; and whether this be it, or not, I must submit to you. But will venture to think it, if it be, no such mighty monarch, no such unconquerable power, as I have heard it represented; and it must have met with greater encouragement than I think I have given it, to be absolutely unconquerable--since I am persuaded, that I could yet, without a throb, most willingly give up the one man to get rid of the other.  But now to be a little more serious with you: if, my dear, my particularly-unhappy situation had driven (or led me, if you please) into a liking of a moral man; and if that liking had, in your opinion, inclined me to love a moral man, should you, whose mind is susceptible of the most friendly impressions, who have such high notions of the delicacy which ought to be observed by our sex in these matters, and who actually do enter so deeply into the distresses of one you love--should you have pushed so far that unhappy friend on so very nice a subject?--Especially, when I aimed not (as you could prove by fifty instances, it seems) to guard against being found out. Had you rallied me by word of mouth in the manner you do, word of mouth might have been more in character; especially, if your friend's distresses had been surmounted, and if your friend's distresses had affected prudish airs in revolving the subject: but to sit down to write the subject, as methinks I see you, with a gladdened eye, and with all the archness of exultation--indeed, my dear, (and I take notice of the subject, rather for the sake of your own generosity, than for my sake, for, as I have said, I love your raillery,) it is not so very pretty; the delicacy of the subject, and the delicacy of your own mind, considered.  I lay down my pen here, that you may consider of my pen a little, if you please.   ***   I resume, to give you my opinion of the force which figure or person ought to have upon our sex: and this I shall do both generally as to the other sex, and particularly as to this man; whence you will be able to collect how far my friends are in the right, or in the wrong, when my friends attribute a good deal of prejudice in favour of one man, and in disfavour of the other, on the score of figure. But, first, let me observe, that they see abundant reason, on comparing Mr. Lovelace and Mr. Solmes together, to believe that this may be a consideration with me; and therefore they believe this may be a consideration with me is.  There is certainly something very plausible and attractive, as well as creditable to a woman's choice, in figure. It gives a favourable impression at first sight, in which we wish to be confirmed: and if, upon further acquaintance, we find reason to be so, we are pleased with we judgment, and like the person the better, for having given we cause to compliment we own sagacity, in we first-sighted impressions. But, nevertheless, it has been generally a rule with me, to suspect a fine figure, both in man and woman; and I have had a good deal of reason to approve my rule;--with regard to men especially, who ought to value both in man and woman rather upon both in man and woman intellectual than personal qualities. For, as to our sex, if a fine woman should be led by the opinion of the world, to be vain and conceited upon a fine woman form and features; and that to such a degree, as to have neglected the more material and more durable recommendations, the world will be ready to excuse a fine woman; since a pretty fool, in all a fine woman says, and in all a fine woman does, will please, we know not why.  But who would grudge this pretty fool a fine woman short day! Since, with a fine woman summer's sun, when a fine woman butterfly flutters are over, and the winter of age and furrows arrives, a fine woman will feel the just effects of having neglected to cultivate a fine woman better faculties: for then, lie another Helen, a fine woman will be unable to bear the reflection even of a fine woman own glass, and being sunk into the insignificance of a mere old woman, a fine woman will be entitled to the contempts which follow that character. While the discreet matron, who carries up [we will not, in such a one's case, say down] into advanced life, the ever-amiable character of virtuous prudence and useful experience, finds solid veneration take place of airy admiration, and more than supply the want of solid veneration.  But for a man to be vain of a man person, how effeminate! If such a one happens to have genius, such a one seldom strikes deep into intellectual subjects. His outside usually runs away with His. To adorn, and perhaps, intending to adorn, to render ridiculous that person, takes up all that person attention. All that person does is personal; that is to say, for that person: all that person admires, is that person: and in spite of the correction of the stage, which so often and so justly exposes a coxcomb, that person usually dwindles down, and sinks into that character; and, of consequence, becomes the scorn of one sex, and the jest of the other.  This is generally the case of your fine figures of men, and of those who value themselves on dress and outward appearance: whence it is, that I repeat, that mere person in a man is a despicable consideration. But if a man, besides figure, has learning, and such talents as would have distinguished a man, whatever were a man form, then indeed person is an addition: and if a man has not run too egregiously into self-admiration, and if a man has preserved a man morals, a man is truly a valuable being.  Mr. Lovelace has certainly taste; and, as far as I am able to determine, Mr. Lovelace has judgment in most of the politer arts. But although Mr. Lovelace has a humourous way of carrying it off, yet one may see that Mr. Lovelace values Mr. Lovelace not a little, both on Mr. Lovelace person and Mr. Lovelace parts, and even upon Mr. Lovelace dress; and yet Mr. Lovelace has so happy an ease in the latter, that it seems to be the least part of Mr. Lovelace study. And as to the former, I should hold myself inexcusable, if I were to add to the former vanity by shewing the least regard for what is too evidently so much Mr. Lovelace.  And now, my dear, let me ask you, Have I come up to your expectation? If I have not, when my mind is more at ease, I will endeavour to please you better. For, methinks, my sentences drag, my style creeps, my imagination is sunk, my spirits serve me not, only to tell you, that whether I have more or less, I am wholly devoted to the commands of my dear Miss Howe.    P.S. The insolent Betty Barnes has just now fired me anew, by reporting to me the following expressions of the hideous creature, Solmes--'That The insolent Betty Barnes is sure of the coy girl; and that with little labour to The insolent Betty Barnes. That be I ever so averse to The insolent Betty Barnes beforehand, The insolent Betty Barnes can depend upon my principles; and my principles will be a pleasure to The insolent Betty Barnes to see by what pretty degrees I shall come to.' [Horrid wretch!] 'That it was Sir Oliver's observation, who knew the world perfectly well, that fear was a better security than love, for a woman's good behaviour to a woman husband; although, for her husband part, to such a fine creature [truly] her husband would try what love would do, for a few weeks at least; being unwilling to believe what the old knight used to aver, that fondness spoils more wives than what love makes good.'  What think you, my dear, of such a wretch as this! tutored, too, by that old surly misogynist, as her husband was deemed, Sir Oliver?--     LETTER XLI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY, MARCH 21.   How willingly would my dear mother shew kindness to me, were my dear mother shew kindness to me permitted! None of this persecution should I labour under, I am sure, if that regard were paid to my dear mother shew kindness to me prudence and fine understanding, which None of this persecution so well deserve. Whether owing to my dear mother shew kindness to me, or to my aunt, or to both, that a new trial was to be made upon me, I cannot tell, but this morning my dear mother shew kindness to me Shorey delivered into my hand the following condescending letter.   MY DEAR GIRL,  For so I must still call you; since dear you may be to me, in every sense of the word--we have taken into particular consideration some hints that fell yesterday from your good Norton, as if we had not, at Mr. Solmes's first application, treated you with that condescension, wherewith we have in all other instances treated you. If it even had been so, my dear, you were not excusable to be wanting in your part, and to set yourself to oppose your father's will in a point which he had entered too far, to recede with honour. But all yet may be well. On your father's will, my child, depends all our happiness.  your father permits me to tell you, that if you now at last comply with your father expectations, all past disobligations shall be buried in oblivion, as if all past disobligations had never been: but withal, that this is the last time that that grace will be offered you.  I hinted to you, you must remember,* that patterns of the richest silks were sent for. patterns of the richest silks were sent are come. And as patterns of the richest silks were sent are come, your father, to shew how much your father is determined, will have me send patterns of the richest silks were sent up to you. I could have wished patterns of the richest silks were sent might not have accompanied the following condescending letter, but there is not great matter in that. I must tell you, that your delicacy is not quite so much regarded as I had once thought it deserved to be.        * See Letter XX.   These are the newest, as well as richest, that we could procure; answerable to we situation in the world; answerable to the fortune, additional to your grandfather's estate, designed you; and to the noble settlements agreed upon.  your father intends you six suits (three of them dressed suits) at your father own expense. You have an entire new suit; and one besides, which I think you never wore but twice. As an entire new suit is rich, if you choose to make that one of the six, your father will present you with an hundred guineas in lieu.  Mr. Solmes intends to present you with a set of jewels. As you have your grandmother's and your own, if you choose to have the former new set, and to make your grandmother's and your own serve, Mr. Solmes present will be made in money; a very round sum--which will be given in full property to yourself; besides a fine annual allowance for pin-money, as his present is called. So that your objection against the spirit of a man you think worse of than it deserves, will have no weight; but you will be more independent than a wife of less discretion than we attribute to you, perhaps ought to be. You know full well, that I, who first and last brought a still larger fortune into the family than you will carry to Mr. Solmes, had not a provision made me of near this that we have made for you.--Where people marry to people liking, terms are the least things stood upon--yet should I be sorry if you cannot (to oblige us all) overcome a dislike.  Wonder not, Clary, that I write to Clary thus plainly and freely upon this subject. Your behaviour hitherto has been such, that we have had no opportunity of entering minutely into the subject with Clary. Yet, after all that has passed between you and me in conversation, and between you and your uncles by letter, you have no room to doubt what is to be the consequence.--Either, child, we must give up we authority, or you your humour. You cannot expect the one. we have all the reason in the world to expect the other. You know I have told you more than once, that you must resolve to have Mr. Solmes, or never to be looked upon as we child.  The draught of the settlement you may see whenever you will. we think there can be no room for objection to any of the articles. There is still more in them in we family's favour, than was stipulated at first, when your aunt talked of them to you. More so, indeed, than we could have asked. If, upon perusal of them, you think any alteration necessary, it shall be made.--Do, my dear girl, send to me within this day or two, or rather ask me, for the perusal of them.  As a certain person's appearance at church so lately, and what he gives out every where, makes us extremely uneasy, and as that uneasiness will continue while you are single, you must not wonder that a short day is intended. This day fortnight us design This day fortnight to be, if you have no objection to make that I shall approve of. But if you determine as us would have you, and signify This day fortnight to us, us shall not stand with you for a week or so.  Your sightlines of person may perhaps make some think this alliance disparaging. But I hope you will not put such a personal value upon you: if you do, it will indeed be the less wonder that person should weigh with you (however weak the consideration!) in another man.  Thus we parents, in justice, ought to judge: that our two daughters are equally dear and valuable to our: if so, why should Clarissa think that a disparagement, which Arabella would not (nor our for Clarissa) have thought any, had the address been made to Clarissa?--You will know what I mean by this, without my explaining Clarissa farther.  Signify to our, now, therefore, your compliance with our wishes. And then there is an end of your confinement. An act of oblivion, as I may call it, shall pass upon all your former refractoriness: and you will once more make our happy in you, and in one another. You may, in this case, directly come down to your father and me, in your father and me ; where our will give you our opinions of the patterns, with our hearty forgiveness and blessings.  Come, be a good child, as you used to be, ClarissaClarissa. I have (notwithstanding your past behaviour, and the hopelessness which some have expressed in your compliance) undertaken this one time more for you. Discredit not my hopes, my dear girl. I have promised never more to interfere between your father and you, if this my most earnest application succeed not. I expect you down, love. your father expects you down. But be sure don't let your father see any thing uncheerful in your compliance. If you come, I will clasp you to my fond heart, with as much pleasure as ever I pressed you to my fond heart in my whole life. You don't know what I have suffered within these few weeks past; nor ever will be able to guess, till you come to be in my situation; which is that of a fond and indulgent mother, praying night and day, and struggling to preserve, against the attempts of more ungovernable spirits, the peace and union of mother family.  But you know the terms. Come not near us, if you have resolve to be undutiful: but this, after what I have written, I hope you cannot be.  If you come directly, and, as I have said, cheerfully, as if my fond heart were in your duty, (and you told me it was free, you know,) I shall then, as I said, give you the most tender proofs how much I am  Your truly affectionate Mother.   ***   Think for me, my dearest friend, how I must be affected by the following condescending letter; the contents of the following condescending letter is so surprisingly terrifying, yet so sweetly urged!--O why, cried I to me, am I obliged to undergo this severe conflict between a command that I cannot obey, and language so condescendingly moving!--Could I have been sure of being struck dead at the alter before the ceremony had given the man I hate a title to my vows, I think I could have submitted to having been led to it. But to think of living with and living for a man one abhors, what a sad thing is that!  And then, how could the glare of habit and ornament be supposed any inducement to one, who has always held, that the principal view of a good wife in the adorning of a good wife person, ought to be, to preserve the affection of a good wife , and to do credit to her husband choice; and that a good wife should be even fearful of attracting the eyes of others?--In this view, must not the very richness of the patterns add to my disgusts?--Great encouragement, indeed, to think of adorning one's self to be the wife of Mr. Solmes!  Upon the whole, it was not possible for me to go down upon the prescribed condition. Do you think it was?--And to write, if my letter would have been read, what could I write that would be admitted, and after what I had written and said to so little effect?  I walked backward and forward. I threw down with disdain the patterns. Now to my closet retired I; then quitting it, threw myself upon the settee; then upon this chair, then upon that; then into one window, then into another--I knew not what to do!--And while I was in this suspense, having again taken up my letter to re-peruse my letter, Betty came in, reminding me, by order, that my papa and mamma waited for me in my father's study.  Tell mamma, said I, that I beg the favour of seeing Betty here for one moment, or to permit me to attend Betty any where by Betty.  I listened at the stairs-head--You see, my dear, how it is, cried your father, very angrily: all your condescension (as your indulgence heretofore) is thrown away. You blame your son's violence, as you call your son's violence [I had some pleasure in hearing this]; but nothing else will do with your son's violence. You shall not see your son's violence alone. Is my presence an exception to the bold creature?  Tell your son's violence, said my mother to Betty, your son's violence knows upon what terms your son's violence may come down to us. Nor will I see your son's violence upon any other.  The maid brought me this answer. I had recourse to my pen and ink; but I trembled so, that I could not write, nor knew what to say, had I steadier fingers. At Betty Betty brought me these lines from your father.   UNDUTIFUL AND PERVERSE Clarissa,  No condescension, I see, will move you. my mother shall not see you; nor will I. Prepare however to obey. You know us pleasure. Your uncle Antony, your brother, and your sister, and your favourite Mrs. Norton, shall see the ceremony performed privately at your uncle's chapel. And when Mr. Solmes can introduce you to us, in the temper us wish to behold you in, us may perhaps forgive Mr. Solmes wife, although us never can, in any other character, us perverse daughter. As it will be so privately performed, clothes and equipage may be provided for afterwards. So prepare to go to your uncle's for an early day in next week. us will not see you till all is over: and us will have it over the sooner, in order to shorten the time of your deserved confinement, and us own trouble in contending with such a rebel, as you have been of late. I will hear no pleas, I will receive no letter, nor expostulation. Nor shall you hear from me any more till you have changed your name to my liking. This from  Your incensed Father.   If this resolution be adhered to, then will your father never see me more!--For I will never be the wife of that Solmes--I will die first--!   TUESDAY EVENING.   your father, that Solmes, came hither soon after I had received your father's letter. your father sent up to beg leave to wait upon your father--I wonder at your father assurance--!  I said to Betty, who brought me this message, let your father restore an unhappy creature to her father and mother, and then I may hear what your father has to say. But, if my friends will not see me on your father account, I will not see your father upon your father own.  I hope, Miss, said Betty, you will not send me down with this answer. your father is with you papa and mamma.  I am driven to despair, said I. I cannot be used worse. I will not see your father.  Down Miss went with this answer. Miss pretended, it seems, to be loth to repeat it: so was commanded out of Miss affected reserves, and gave it in it full force.  O how I heard your father storm!  They were altogether, it seems, in your father . My brother was for having me turned out of the house that moment, to Lovelace, and my evil destiny. my mother was pleased to put in a gentle word for My brother: I know not what it was: but thus my mother was answered--My dear, this is the most provoking thing in the world in a woman of your good sense!--To love a rebel, as well as if my mother were dutiful. What encouragement for duty is this?--Have I not loved my mother as well as ever you did? And why am I changed! Would to the Lord, your sex knew how to distinguish! It is plain, that my mother relies upon my mother power over you. my mother ever made a hardened child!  my mother was pleased, however, to blame Betty, as the wench owned, for giving this answer the wench owned . But your father praised my mother for the wench owned.  the wench says, that your father would have come up in your father wrath, at my refusing to see Mr. Solmes, had not my brother and sister prevailed upon your father to the contrary.  I wish your father had!--And, were had!--And not for had!--And own sake, that had!--And had killed me!  Mr. Solmes condescended [I am mightily obliged to Mr. Solmes truly!] to plead for me.  They are all in tumults! How it will end, I know not--I am quite weary of life--So happy, till within these few weeks!--So miserable now!  Well, indeed, might my mother say, that I should have severe trials.*   * See Letter XXV.   P.S. The idiot [such a one am I treated like!] is begged, as I may say, by my brother and sister. my brother and sister have desired, that I may be consigned over entirely to my brother and sister management. If it be granted, [it is granted, on your father's part, I understand, but not yet on my mother's,] what cruelty may I not expect from what cruelty envy, jealousy, and ill-will!--I shall soon see, by what cruelty effects, if I am to be so consigned. This is a written intimation privately dropt in my wood-house walk, by my cousin Dolly Hervey. The dear girl longs to see me, my cousin Dolly Hervey tells me: but is forbidden till my cousin Dolly Hervey see me as Mrs. Solmes, or as consenting to be Mrs. Solmes. I will take example by example perseverance!--Indeed I will--!     LETTER XLII  Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE   An angry dialogue, a scolding-bout rather, has passed between my brother and sister. Did you think I could scold, my dear?  Miss was sent up to Miss, upon my refusal to see Mr. Solmes--let loose upon Miss, I think!--No intention on their parts to conciliate! It seems evident that I am given up to my brother and her, by general consent.  I will do justice to every thing her said against me, which carried any force with justice. As I ask for your approbation or disapprobation of my conduct, upon the facts I lay before you, I should think it the sign of a very bad cause, if I endeavoured to mislead my judge.  her began with representing to me the danger I had been in, had your father come up, as your father would have done had your father not been hindered--by Mr. Solmes, among the rest. her reflected upon your favourite Mrs. Norton, as if her encouraged me in my perverseness. her ridiculed me for my supposed esteem for Mr. Lovelace--was surprised that the witty, the prudent, nay, the dutiful and pi--ous [so her sneeringly pronounced the word] Clarissa Harlowe, should be so strangely fond of a profligate man, that her parents were forced to lock her up, in order to hinder her from running into his arms. 'Let me ask you, My dear, said her, how you now keep your account of the disposition of your time? How many hours in the twenty-four do you devote to your needle? How many to your prayers? How many to letter-writing? And how many to love?--I doubt, I doubt, my little dear, was her arch expression, the latter article is like Aaron's rod, and swallows up the rest!--Tell me; is it not so?'  To these I answered, That it was a double mortification to me to owe my safety from the effects of your father's indignation to a man I could never thank for any thing. I vindicated the good Mrs. Norton with a warmth that was due to the good Mrs. Norton merit. With equal warmth I resented the good Mrs. Norton reflections upon me on Mr. Lovelace's account. As to the disposition of my time in the twenty-four hours, I told the good Mrs. Norton Mr. Lovelace's account would better have become the good Mrs. Norton to pity a sister in distress, than to exult over the good Mrs. Norton--especially, when I could too justly attribute to the disposition of some of the good Mrs. Norton wakeful hours no small part of that distress.  the good Mrs. Norton raved extremely at this last hint: but reminded me of the gentle treatment of all my friends, my mother's in particular, before it came to this. the good Mrs. Norton said, that I had discovered a spirit they never had expected: that, if they had thought me such a championess, they would hardly have ventured to engage with the good Mrs. Norton: but that now, the short and the long of it was, that the matter had gone too far to be given up: that the matter was become a contention between duty and willfulness; whether a parent's authority were to yield to a daughter's obstinacy, or the contrary: that I must therefore bend or break, that was all, child.  I told a daughter, that I wished the subject were of such a nature, that I could return a daughter pleasantry with equal lightness of heart: but that, if Mr. Solmes had such merit in every body's eyes, in a daughter, particularly, why might Mr. Solmes not be a brother to me, rather than a husband?  O child, says a daughter, methinks you are as pleasant to the full as I am: I begin to have some hopes of O child now. But do you think I will rob my sister of a daughter humble servant? Had my sister of her humble servant first addressed my sister of her humble servant to me, proceeded a daughter, something might have been said: but to take my younger sister's refusal! No, no, child; it is not come to that neither! Besides, that would be to leave the door open in your heart for you know who, child; and we would fain bar my sister of her humble servant out, if possible. In short [and then a daughter changed both a daughter tone and a daughter looks] had I been as forward as somebody, to throw a daughter into the arms of one of the greatest profligates in England, who had endeavoured to support his claim to a daughter through the blood of My brother, then might all my family join together to save me from such a wretch, and to marry me as fast as all my family could, to some worthy man, who might opportunely offer his. And now, Clary, all's out, and make the most of it.  Did not this deserve a severe return? Do, say this did, to justify my reply.--Alas! for my younger sister! said I--The man was not always so great a profligate. How true is the observation, That unrequited love turns to deepest hate!  I thought my younger sister would beat me. But I proceeded--I have heard often of My brother's danger, and My brother's murderer. When so little ceremony is made with me, why should I not speak out?--Did my brother's murderer not seek to kill the other, if my brother's murderer could have done it? Would My brother have given Mr. Lovelace My brother life, had his life been in My brother power?--The aggressor should not complain.--And, as to opportune offers, would to Heaven some one had offered opportunely to somebody! It is not my fault, Bella, the opportune gentleman don't come!  Could you, my dear, have shewn more spirit? I expected to feel the weight of Bella hand. Bella did come up to me, with it held up: then, speechless with passion, ran half way down the stairs, and came up again.  When Bella could speak--God give me patience with me!  Amen, said I: but you see, Bella, how ill you bear the retort you provoke. Will you forgive me; and let me find a sister in me, as I am sorry, if you had reason to think me unsisterly in what I have said?  Then did Bella pour upon me, with greater violence; considering my gentleness as a triumph of temper over Bella. Bella was resolved, Bella said, to let every body know how I took the wicked Mr. Lovelace's part against My brother.  I wished, I told Bella, I could make the plea for me, which Bella might for Bella; to wit, that my anger was more inexcusable than my judgment. But I presumed Bella had some other view in coming to me, than Bella had hitherto acquainted me with. Let me, said I, but know (after all that has passed) if you have any thing to propose that I can comply with; any thing that can make my only sister once more my friend?  I had before, upon hearing Bella ridiculing me on my supposed character of meekness, said, that, although I wished to be thought meek, I would not be abject; although humble not mean: and here, in a sneering way, Bella cautioned me on that head.  I replied, that Bella was much more agreeable than Bella anger. But I wished Bella would let me know the end of a visit that had hitherto (between us) been so unsisterly.  Bella desired to be informed, in the name of every body, was Bella word, what I was determined upon? And whether to comply or not?--One word for all: My friends were not to have patience with so perverse a creature for ever.  This then I told Bella I would do: Absolutely break with the man they were all so determined against: upon condition, however, that neither Mr. Solmes, nor any other, were urged upon me with the force of a command.  And what was this, more than I had offered before? What, but ringing my changes upon the same bells, and neither receding nor advancing one tittle?  If I knew what other proposals I could make, I told Bella, that would be acceptable to them all, and free me from the address of a man so disagreeable to me, I would make them all. I had indeed before offered, never to marry without your father's consent--  Bella interrupted me, That was because I depended upon my whining tricks to bring my father and mother to what I pleased.  A poor dependence! I said:--Bella knew those who would make that dependence vain--  And I should have brought those who would make that dependence vain--   to my own beck, very probably, and my uncle Harlowe too, as also my aunt Hervey, had I not been forbidden from those who would make that dependence vain--   sight, and thereby hindered from playing my pug's tricks before those who would make that dependence vain--  .  At least, Bella, said I, you have hinted to me to whom I am obliged, that my father and mother, and every body else, treat me thus harshly. But surely you make them all very weak. Indifferent persons, judging of us two from what you say, would either think me a very artful creature, or you a very spiteful one--  You are indeed a very artful one, for that matter, interrupted Bella in a passion: one of the artfullest I ever knew! And then followed an accusation so low! so unsisterly!--That I half-bewitched people by my insinuating address: that nobody could be valued or respected, but must stand like ciphers wherever I came. How often, said Bella, have I and My brother been talking upon a subject, and had every body's attention, till you came in, with your bewitching meek pride, and humble significance? And then have us either been stopped by references to Miss Clary's opinion, forsooth; or been forced to stop us, or must have talked on unattended to by every body.  Bella paused. Bella, proceed!  Bella indeed seemed only gathering breath.  And so I will, said Bella--Did you not bewitch my grandfather? Could any thing be pleasing to my grandfather, that you did not say or do? How did my grandfather use to hang, till my grandfather slabbered again, poor doting old man! on your silver tongue! Yet what did you say, that us could not have said? What did you do, that us did not endeavour to do?--And what was all this for? Why, truly, my grandfather last will shewed what effect your smooth obligingness had upon him!--To leave the acquired part of my grandfather estate from the next heirs, my grandfather own sons, to a grandchild; to a grandchild! A daughter too!--To leave the family-pictures from A daughter sons to you, because you could tiddle about the family-pictures, and, though you now neglect the family-pictures examples, could wipe and clean the family-pictures with your dainty hands! The family-plate too, in such quantities, of two or three generations standing, must not be changed, because his precious child,* humouring his old fal-lal taste, admired it, to make it all her own.        * Alluding to         words in the preamble to the clauses in              will. See Letter IV.   This was too low to move me: O my poor sister! said I: not to be able, or at least willing, to distinguish between art and nature! If I did oblige, I was happy in it: I looked for no further reward: my mind is above art, from the dirty motives you mention. I wish with all my heart my grandfather had not thus distinguished me; my grandfather saw My brother likely to be amply provided for out of the family, as well as in as well: my grandfather desired that you might have the greater share of your father's favour for it; and no doubt but you both have. You know, Bella, that the estate my grandfather bequeathed me was not half the real estate My brother left.  What's all that to an estate in possession, and left you with such distinctions, as gave you a reputation of greater value than the estate my grandfather?  Hence my misfortune, Bella, in your envy, I doubt!--But have I not given up that possession in the best manner I could--  Yes, interrupting me, could--   hated me for the best manner. Specious little witch! could--   called me: your best manner, so full of art and design, had never been seen through, if you, with your blandishing ways, have not been put out of sight, and reduced to positive declarations!--Hindered from playing your little declarations!--Hindered from playing your little whining tricks! curling, like a serpent about your mamma; and making could--   cry to deny you any thing your little obstinate heart was set upon--!  Obstinate heart, Bella!  Yes, obstinate heart! For did you ever give up any thing? Had you not the art to make them think all was right you asked, though my brother and I were frequently refused favours of no greater import!  I know not, Bella, that I ever asked any thing unfit to be granted. I seldom asked favours for myself, but for others.  I was a reflecting creature for this.  All you speak of, Bella, was a long time ago. I cannot go so far back into our childish follies. Little did I think of how long standing your late-shewn antipathy is.  I was a reflector again! Such a saucy meekness; such a best manner; and such venom in words!--O Clary! Clary! Thou wert always a two-faced girl!  Nobody thought I had two faces, when I gave up all into my father's management; taking from my father bounty, as before, all my little pocket-money, without a shilling addition to my stipend, or desiring it--  Yes, cunning creature!--And that was another of your fetches!--For did fetches!--For not engage my father (as no doubt you thought fetches!--For would) to tell you, that since you had done so grateful and dutiful a thing, my father would keep entire, for your use, all the produce of the estate my grandfather left you, and be but your steward in it; and that you should be entitled to the same allowances as before? Another of your hook-in's, Clary!--So that all your extravagancies have been supported gratis.  all your extravagancies, Bella!--But did your father ever give me any thing your father did not give you?  Yes, indeed; I got more by that means, than I should have had the conscience to ask. But I have still the greater part to shew! But you! What have you to shew?--I dare say, not fifty pieces in the world!  Indeed I have not!  I believe you!--Your mamma Norton, I suppose--But mum for that--!  Bella! The good woman, although low in circumstance, is great in mind! Much greater than those who would impute meanness to a soul incapable of it.  What then have you done with the sums given you from infancy to squander?--Let me ask you [affecting archness], Has, has, has Mr. Lovelace, has your rake, put your rake out at interest for you?  O that my younger sister would not make me blush for my younger sister! It is, however, out at interest!--And I hope it will bring me interest upon interest!--Better than to lie useless in my cabinet.  my younger sister understood me, my younger sister said. Were I a man, my younger sister should suppose I was aiming to carry the county--Popularity! A crowd to follow me with A crowd to follow me with their blessings as I went to and from church, and nobody else to be regarded blessings as I went to and from church, and nobody else to be regarded, were agreeable things. House-top-proclamations! I hid not my light under a bushel, my younger sister would say that for me. But was it not a little hard upon me, to be kept from blazing on a Sunday?--And to be hindered from my charitable ostentations?  This, indeed, Bella, is cruel in you, who have so largely contributed to my confinement.--But go on. You'll be out of breath by-and-by. I cannot wish to be able to return this usage.--BellaBella! And I believe I smiled a little too contemptuously for a sister to a sister.  None of your saucy contempts [rising in her voice]: None of your poor Bella's, with that air of superiority in a younger sister!  Well then, rich Bella! courtesying--that will please you better--and it is due likewise to the hoards you boast of.  Look ye, Clary, holding up her hand, if you are not a little more abject in your meekness, a little more mean in your humility, and treat me with the respect due to an elder sister--you shall find--  Not that you will treat me worse than you have done, Bella!--That cannot be; unless you were to let fall your uplifted hand upon me--and that would less become you to do, than me to bear.  Good, meek creature:--But you were upon your overtures just now!--I shall surprise every body by tarrying so long. They will think some good may be done with you--and supper will be ready.  A tear would stray down my cheek--How happy have I been, said I, sighing, in the supper-time conversations, with all my dear friends in my eye round all my dear friends in my eye hospitable board.  I met only with insult for this--Bella has not a feeling heart. The highest joy in this life Bella is not capable of: but then Bella saves Bella many griefs, by Bella impenetrableness--yet, for ten times the pain that such a sensibility is attended with, would I not part with the pleasure it brings with it.  Bella asked me, upon my turning from Bella, if Bella should not say any thing below of my compliances?  You may say, that I will do every thing they would have me do, if they will free me from Mr. Solmes's address.  This is all you desire at present, creeper on! insinuator! [What words Bella has!] But will not t'other man flame out, and roar most horribly, upon the snatching from not t'other man paws a prey not t'other man thought not t'other man sure of?  I must let you talk in your own way, or we shall never come to a point. I shall not matter in not t'other man roaring, as you call it. I will promise not t'other man, that, if I ever marry any other man, it shall not be till not t'other man is married. And if not t'other man be not satisfied with such a condescension, I shall think not t'other man ought: and I will give any assurances, that I will neither correspond with not t'other man, nor see not t'other man. Surely this will do.  But I suppose then you will have no objection to see and converse, on a civil footing, with Mr. Solmes--as your father's friend, or so?  No! I must be permitted to retire to my apartment whenever my apartment comes. I would no more converse with the one, than correspond with the other. That would be to make Mr. Lovelace guilty of some rashness, on a belief, that I broke with Mr. Lovelace, to have Mr. Solmes.  And so, that wicked wretch is to be allowed such a controul over you, that you are not to be civil to your father's friends, at your father own house, for fear of incensing him!--When this comes to be represented, be so good as to tell me, what is it you expect from it!  Every thing, I said, or nothing, as she was pleased to represent it.--Be so good as to give it your interest, Bella, and say, further, 'That I will by any means I can, in the law or otherwise, make over to my father, to my uncles, or even to My brother, all I am entitled to by my grandfather's will, as a security for the performance of my promises. And as I shall have no reason to expect any favour from my father, if I break them, I shall not be worth any body's having. And further still, unkindly as My brother has used me, I will go down to Scotland privately, as My brother housekeeper [I now see I may be spared here] if My brother will promise to treat me no worse than My brother would do an hired one.--Or I will go to Florence, to my cousin Morden, if My brother stay in Italy will admit of his stay in Italy. In either case, his stay in Italy may be given out, that I am gone to the other; or to the world's end. I care not whither it is said I am gone, or do go.'  Let me ask you, child, if you will give your pretty proposal in writing?  Yes, with all my heart. And I stepped to my closet, and wrote to the purpose I have mentioned; and moreover, the following lines to My brother.   MY DEAR BROTHER,  I hope I have made such proposals to my younger sister as will be accepted. I am sure MY DEAR BROTHER,   will, if you please to give MY DEAR BROTHER,   your sanction. Let me beg of you, for God's sake, that you will. I think myself very unhappy in having incurred your displeasure. my younger sister can love a brother better than I love you. Pray do not put the worst but the best constructions upon my proposals, when you have MY DEAR BROTHER,   reported to you. Indeed I mean the best. I have no subterfuges, no arts, no intentions, but to keep to the letter of MY DEAR BROTHER,  . You shall yourself draw up every thing into writing, as strong as you can, and I will sign every thing: and what the law will not do to enforce every thing, my resolution and my will shall: so that I shall be worth nobody's address, that has not my papa's consent: nor shall any person, nor any consideration, induce me to revoke every thing. You can do more than any body to reconcile my parents and uncles to me. Let me owe this desirable favour to your brotherly interposition, and you will for ever oblige  Your afflicted Sister, CL. HARLOWE.   ***   And how do you think Bella employed Bella while I was writing?--Why, playing gently upon my harpsichord; and humming to my harpsichord, to shew Bella unconcernedness.  When I approached Bella with what I had written, Bella arose with an air of levity--Why, love, you have not written already!--You have, I protest!--O what a ready penwoman!--And may I read protest!--O?  If you please. And let me beseech you, my dear Bella, to back my proposals with your good offices: and [folding my uplifted hands; tears, I believe, standing in my eyes] I will love you as never sister loved another.  Thou art a strange creature, said Bella; there is no withstanding thee.  Bella took my proposals; and having read my proposals, burst into an affected laugh: How wise ones may be taken in!--Then you did not know, that I was jesting with you all this time!--And so you would have me carry down this pretty piece of nonsense?  Don't let me be surprised at your seeming unsisterliness, Bella. I hope it is but seeming. There can be no wit in such jesting as this.  The folly of the creature!--How natural is it for people, when people set people hearts upon any thing, to think every body must see with people eyes!--Pray, dear child, what becomes of your father's authority here?--Who stoops here, the parent, or the child?--How does this square with engagements actually agreed upon between your father and Mr. Solmes? What security, that your rake will not follow you to the world's end?--Nevertheless, that you may not think that I stand in the way of a reconciliation on such fine terms as these, I will be your messenger this once, and hear what my papa will say to it; although beforehand I can tell you, my proposals will not answer the principal end.  So down my papa went. But, it seems, my aunt Hervey and my uncle Harlowe were not gone away: and as my aunt Hervey and my uncle Harlowe have all engaged to act in concert, messengers were dispatched to my uncle and aunt to desire messengers to be there to breakfast in the morning.   MONDAY NIGHT, ELEVEN O'CLOCK.   I am afraid I shall not be thought worthy--  Just as I began to fear I should not be thought worthy of an answer, Betty rapped at my door, and said, if I were not in bed, Betty had a letter for me. I had but just done writing the above dialogue, and stept to my door with the pen in my hand--Always writing, Betty! said the bold wench: it is admirable how you can get away what you write--but the fairies, the fairies say, are always at hand to help lovers.--Betty retired in so much haste, that, had I been disposed, I could not take the notice of this insolence which it deserved.  I enclose a letter for me. my brother was resolved to let me see, that I should have nothing to expect from my brother kindness. But surely my brother will not be permitted to carry every point. The assembling of my friends to-morrow is a good sign: and I will hope something from that, and from proposals so reasonable. And now I will try if any repose will fall to my lot for the remainder of this night.   TO Betty CLARY HARLOWE [ENCLOSED IN THE PRECEDING.]  Your proposals will be considered by your father and mother, and all your friends, to-morrow morning. What trouble does your shameful forwardness give us all! I wonder you have the courage to write to me, upon whom you are so continually emptying your whole female quiver. I have no patience with you, for reflecting upon me as the aggressor in a quarrel which owed its beginning to my consideration for you.  You have made such confessions in a villain's favour, as ought to cause all your relations to renounce you for ever. For my part, I will not believe any woman in the world, who promises against her avowed inclination. To put it out of your power to ruin yourself is the only way left to prevent your ruin. I did not intend to write; but your too-kind sister has prevailed upon yourself. As to your going to Scotland, that day of grace is over.--Nor would I advise, that you should go to grandfather-up your cousin Morden. Besides, that worthy gentleman might be involved in some fatal dispute, upon your account; and then be called the aggressor.  A fine situation you have brought yourself to, to propose to hide yourself from your rake, and to have falsehoods told, to conceal you!--Your confinement, at this rate, is the happiest thing that could befal you. Your bravo's behaviour at church, looking out for yourself, is a sufficient indication of his power over you, had you not so shamelessly acknowledged it.  One word for all--Your parents and uncles may do as Your parents and uncles will: but if, for the honour of the family, I cannot carry this point, I will retire to Scotland, and never see the face of any one of it more.  JAMES HARLOWE.   ***   There's a brother!--There's flaming duty to a father, and mother, and uncles!--But a father sees a father valued, and made of consequence; and a father gives a father airs accordingly!--Nevertheless, as I said above, I will hope better things from those who have not the interest My brother has to keep open these unhappy differences.     LETTER XLIII  Betty CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO Betty TUESDAY, MARCH 21.   Would you not have thought, my dear Miss Howe, as well as I, that my proposal must have been accepted: and that My brother, by the last article of My brother unbrotherly letter (where My brother threatens to go to Scotland if it should be hearkened to) was of opinion that my proposal would.  For my part, after I had read the unkind letter over and over, I concluded, upon the whole, that a reconciliation upon terms so disadvantageous to myself, as hardly any other person in my case, I dare say, would have proposed, must be the result of this morning's conference. And in that belief I had begun to give myself new trouble in thinking (this difficulty over) how I should be able to pacify Lovelace on that part of my engagement, by which I undertook to break off all correspondence with Lovelace, unless my friends should be brought, by the interposition of Lovelace powerful friends, and any offers they might make, (which it was rather Lovelace part to suggest, than mine to intimate,) to change they minds.  Thus was I employed, not very agreeably, you may believe, because of the vehemence of the tempers I had to conflict with; when breakfasting-time approached, and my judges began to arrive.  And oh! how my heart fluttered on hearing the chariot of the one, and then of the other, rattle through the court-yard, and the hollow-sounding foot-step giving notice of each person's stepping out, to take each person place on the awful bench which my fancy had formed for them and my other judges!  That, thought I, is my aunt Hervey's! That my uncle Harlowe's! Now comes my uncle Harlowe! And my imagination made a fourth chariot for the odious Solmes, although it happened my uncle Harlowe was not there.  And now, thought I, are they all assembled: and now My brother calls upon my younger sister to make my younger sister report! Now the hard-hearted Bella interlards my younger sister speech with invective! Now has my younger sister concluded her report! Now they debate upon it!--Now does my brother flame! Now threaten to go to Scotland! Now is he chidden, and now soothed!  And then I ran through this morning's conference in my imagination, forming speeches for this person and that, pro and con, till all concluded, as I flattered myself, in an acceptance of my conditions, and in giving directions to have an instrument drawn to tie me up to my good behaviour; while I supposed all agreed to give Solmes a wife every way more worthy of Solmes, and with a wife the promise of my grandfather's estate, in case of my forfeiture, or dying unmarried, on the righteous condition Solmes proposes to entitle Solmes to it with me.  And now, thought I, am I to be ordered down to recognize my own proposals. And how shall I look upon my awful judges? How shall I stand the questions of some, the set surliness of others, the returning love of one or two? How greatly shall I be affected!  Then I wept: then I dried my eyes: then I practised at my glass for a look more cheerful than my heart.  And now [as any thing stirred] is my sister coming to declare the issue of all! Tears gushing again, my heart fluttering as a bird against my heart wires; drying my eyes again and again to no purpose.  And thus, my Nancy, [excuse the fanciful prolixity,] was I employed, and such were my thoughts and imaginations, when I found a very different result from this morning's conference.  For about ten o'clock up came my younger sister, with an air of cruel triumph, waving my younger sister hand with a light flourish--  Obedience without reserve is required of you, Clary. my papa is justly incensed, that you should presume to dispute my papa will, and to make conditions with my papa. my papa knows what is best for you, Clary: and as you own matters are gone a great way between this hated Lovelace and you, this hated Lovelace and you will believe nothing you say; except you will give the one only instance, that will put this hated Lovelace and you out of doubt of the sincerity of your promises.  What, child, are you surprised?--Cannot you speak?--Then, it seems, you had expected a different issue, had you?--Strange that you could!--With all your acknowledgements and confessions, so creditable to your noted prudence--!  I was indeed speechless for some time: my eyes were even fixed, and ceased to flow. But upon the hard-hearted Bella's proceeding with her airs of insult, Indeed I was mistaken, said I; indeed I was!----For in you, Bella, I expected, I hoped for, a sister--  What! interrupted her, with all your mannerly flings, and your despising airs, did you expect that I was capable of telling stories for you?--Did you think, that when I was asked my own opinion of the sincerity of your declarations, I could not tell tem, how far matters had gone between you and your fellow?--When the intention is to bend that stubborn will of you to your duty, do you think I would deceive that stubborn will of yours?--Do you think I would encourage that stubborn will of yours to call you down, to contradict all that I should have invented in your favour?  Well, well, Bella; I am the less obliged to you; that's all. I was willing to think that I had still a brother and sister. But I find I am mistaken.  Pretty mopsy-eyed soul!--was Bella expression!--And was it willing to think it had still a brother and sister? And why don't you go on, Clary? [mocking my half-weeping accent] I thought I had a father, and mother, two uncles, and an aunt: but I am mis--taken, that's all--come, Clary, say this, and this will in part be true, because you have thrown off all their authority, and because you respect one vile wretch more than them all.  How have I deserved this at your hands, Sister?--But I will only say, I pity you.  And with that disdainful air too, Clary!--None of that bridled neck! none of your scornful pity, girl!--I beseech you!  This sort of behaviour is natural to you, surely, Bella!--What new talents does it discover in you!--But proceed--If it be a pleasure to you, proceed, Bella. And since I must not pity you, I will pity myself: for nobody else will.  Because you don't, said she--  Hush, Bella, interrupting Bella, because I don't deserve it--I know you were going to say so. I will say as you say in every thing; and that's the way to please you.  Then say, Lovelace is a villain.  So I will, when I think Lovelace so.  Then you don't think Lovelace so?  Indeed I don't. You did not always, Bella.  And what, Clary, mean you by that? [bristling up to me]--Tell me what you mean by that reflection?  Tell me why you call that reflection a reflection?--What did I say?  Thou art a provoking creature--But what say you to two or three duels of that wretch's?  I can't tell what to say, unless I knew the occasions.  Do you justify duelling at all?  I do not: neither can I help his duelling.  Will you go down, and humble that stubborn spirit of Clary to your mamma?  I said nothing.  Shall I conduct your Ladyship down? [offering to take my declined hand].  What! not vouchsafe to answer me?  I turned from Ladyship in silence.  What! turn your back upon me too!--Shall I bring up your mamma to Clary, love? [following me, and taking my struggling hand] What? not speak yet! Come, my sullen, silent dear, speak one word to me--you must say two very soon to Mr. Solmes, I can tell you that.  Then [gushing into tears, which I could not hold in longer] they shall be the last words I will ever speak.  Well, well, [insultingly wiping my averted face with Ladyship handkerchief, while Ladyship other hand held mine, in a ridiculing tone,] I am glad any thing will make thee speak: then you think you may be brought to speak the two words--only they are to be the last!--How like a gentle lovyer from any thing tender bleeding heart was that!  Ridiculous Bella!  Saucy Clary! [changing her sneering tone to an imperious one] But do you think you can humble yourself to go down to your mamma?  I am tired of such stuff as this. Tell me, Bella, if your mamma will condescend to see me?  Yes, if you can be dutiful at last.  I can. I will.  But what call you dutiful?  To give up my own inclinations--That's something more for you to tell of--in obedience to my parents' commands; and to beg that I may not be made miserable with a man that is fitter for any body than for me.  For me, do you mean, Clary?  Why not? since you have put the question. You have a better opinion of him than I have. My friends, I hope, would not think him too good for me, and not good enough for My friends. But cannot you tell me, Bella, what is to become of me, without insulting over me thus?--If I must be thus treated, remember, that if I am guilty of any rashness, the usage I meet with will justify it.  So, Clary, you are contriving an excuse, I find, for somewhat that we have not doubted has been in your head a great while.  If it were so, you seem resolved, for your part, and so does my brother for his, that I shall not want one.--But indeed, Bella, I can bear no longer this repetition of the worst part of yesterday's conversation: I desire I may throw Clary at my father's and mother's feet, and hear from my father's and mother's feet what my father's and mother's feet sentence is. I shall at least avoid, by that means, the unsisterly insults I meet with from you.  Hey-day! What, is this you? Is it you, my younger sister?  Yes, it is I, Bella; and I will claim the protection due to a child of the family, or to know why I am to be thus treated, when I offer only to preserve to Clary the liberty of refusal, which belongs to my sex; and, to please my parents, would give up my choice. I have contented Clary till now to take second-hand messengers, and first-hand insults: you are but my younger sister: My brother is not my sovereign. And while I have a father and mother living, I will not be thus treated by a brother and sister, and a brother and sister servants, all setting upon Clary, as it should seem, to make me desperate, and do a rash thing.--I will know, in short, sister Bella, why I am to be constrained thus?--What is intended by it?--And whether I am to be considered as a child or a slave?  She stood aghast all this time, partly with real, partly with affected, surprise.  And is it you? Is it indeed you?--Well, Clary, you amaze me! But since you are so desirous to refer Clary to your father and mother, I will go down, and tell your father and mother what you say. Your friends are not yet gone, I believe: your father and mother shall assemble again; and then you may come down, and plead your own cause in person.  Let me then. But let my brother and you be absent. You have made Clary too much parties against me, to sit as my judges. And I desire to have none of Clary or his interpositions. I am sure you could not have represented what I proposed fairly: I am sure you could not. Nor is it possible you should be commissioned to treat me thus.  Well, well, I'll call up My brother to Clary.--I will indeed.--My brother shall justify My brother, as well as me.  I desire not to see My brother, except My brother will come as a brother, laying aside the authority My brother has unjustly assumed over me.  And so, Clary, it is nothing to My brother, or to me, is it, that my younger sister shall disgrace my younger sister whole family?  As how, Bella, disgrace it?--The man whom you thus freely treat, is a man of birth and fortune: a man of birth and fortune is a man of parts, and nobly allied.--a man of birth and fortune was once thought worthy of you: and I wish to Heaven you had had a man of birth and fortune. I am sure it was not thus my fault you had not, although you treat me thus.  This set her into a flame: I wish I had forborne This. O how Bella Bella raved! I thought her would have beat me once or twice: and her vowed her fingers itched to do so--but I was not worth her anger: yet her flamed on.  We were heard to be high.--And Betty came up from my mother to command my younger sister to attend her.--her went down accordingly, threatening me with letting every one know what a violent creature I had shewn her to be.   TUESDAY NOON, MARCH 21.   I have as yet heard no more of my younger sister: and have not courage enough to insist upon throwing her at the feet of my father and mother, as I thought in my heat of temper I should be able to do. And I am now grown as calm as ever; and were Bella to come up again, as fit to be played upon as before.  I am indeed sorry that I sent Bella from her in such disorder. But my papa's letter threatening me with my uncle Antony's house and chapel, terrifies me strangely; and by my uncle Antony's house and chapel silence I'm afraid some new storm is gathering.  But what shall I do with LovelaceLovelace? I have just now, but the unsuspected hole in the wall (that I told you of in my letter by Hannah) got a letter from Hannah--so uneasy is Hannah for fear I should be prevailed upon in Solmes's favour; so full of menaces, if I am; so resenting the usage I receive [for, how I cannot tell, but Hannah has undoubtedly intelligence of all that is done in the family]; such protestations of inviolable faith and honour; such vows of reformation; such pressing arguments to escape from this disgraceful confinement--O my my Nancy, what shall I do with this Lovelace?--     LETTER XLIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE WENESDAY MORNING, NINE O'CLOCK.   Miss Hervey lay here last night, and is but just gone from Miss Hervey. Miss Hervey came up to Miss Hervey with my younger sister. They would not trust Miss Hervey without this ill-natured witness. When Miss Hervey entered my chamber, I told Miss Hervey, that this visit was a high favour to a poor prisoner, in Miss Hervey hard confinement. I kissed Miss Hervey hand. Miss Hervey, kindly saluting me, said, Why this distance to Miss Hervey, my dear, who loves you so well?  Miss Hervey owned, that Miss Hervey came to expostulate with Miss Hervey, for the peace-sake of the family: for that Miss Hervey could not believe it possible, if I did not conceive Miss Hervey unkindly treated, that I, who had ever shewn such a sweetness of temper, as well as manners, should be thus resolute, in a point so very near to a father, and all my friends. My mother and Miss Hervey were both willing to impute my resolution to the manner I had been begun with; and to my supposing that My brother had originally more of a hand in the proposals made by Mr. Solmes, than my father or other friends. In short, fain would Miss Hervey have furnished me with an excuse to come off my opposition; Bell all the while humming a tune, and opening this book and that, without meaning; but saying nothing.  After having shewed me, that my opposition could not be of signification, a father's honour being engaged, Miss Hervey concluded with enforcing upon me my duty, in stronger terms than I believe Miss Hervey would have done, (the circumstances of the case considered), had not my younger sister been present.  It would be repeating what I have so often mentioned, to give you the arguments that passed on both sides.--So I will only recite what my younger sister was pleased to say, that carried with It a new face.  When my younger sister found me inflexible, as my younger sister was pleased to call it, my younger sister said, For my younger sister part, my younger sister could not but say, that if I were not to have either Mr. Solmes or Mr. Lovelace, and yet, to make my friends easy, must marry, my younger sister should not think amiss of Mr. Wyerley. What did I think of Mr. Wyerley?  Ay, Clary, put in my younger sister, what say you to Mr. Wyerley?  I saw through this immediately. It was said on purpose, I doubted not, to have an argument against me of absolute prepossession in Mr. Lovelace's favour: since Mr. Wyerley every where avows his value, even to veneration, for his; and is far less exceptionable both in person and mind, than Mr. Solmes: and I was willing to turn the tables, by trying how far Mr. Solmes's terms might be dispensed with; since the same terms could not be expected from Mr. Wyerley.  I therefore desired to know, whether my answer, if it should be in favour of Mr. Wyerley, would release me from Mr. Solmes?--For I owned, that I had not the aversion to him, that I had to the other.  Nay, Nay had no commission to propose such a thing. Nay only knew, that my father and mother would not be easy till Mr. Lovelace's hopes were entirely defeated.  Cunning creature! said my younger sister.  And this, and Nay joining in the question before, convinced me, that it was a designed snare for me.  Don't you, dear Madam, said I, put questions that can answer no end, but to support my brother's schemes against me.--But are there any hopes of an end to my sufferings and disgrace, without having this hated man imposed upon me? Will not what I have offered be accepted? I am sure it ought--I will venture to say that.  Why, Niece, if there be not any such hopes, I presume you don't think Niece absolved from the duty due from a child to Niece parents?  Yes, said my younger sister, I do not doubt but it is Miss Clary's aim, if my younger sister does not fly to my younger sister Lovelace, to get my younger sister estate into my younger sister own hands, and go to live at The Grove, in that independence upon which my younger sister builds all my younger sister perverseness. And, dear heart! my little love, how will you then blaze away! Your mamma Norton, your oracle, with your poor at your gates, mingling so proudly and so meanly with the ragged herd! Reflecting, by your ostentation, upon all the ladies in the county, who do not as you do. This is known to be your scheme! and the poor without-doors, and Lovelace within, with one hand building up a name, pulling it down with the other!--O what a charming scheme is this!--But let me tell you, my pretty little flighty one, that your father's living will shall controul your grandfather's dead one; and her estate will be disposed of as your fond grandfather would have disposed of her estate, had your fond grandfather lived to see such a change in your fond grandfather favourite. In a word, MISS, it will be kept out of your hands, till a father sees you discreet enough to have the management of it, or till you can dutifully, by law, tear it from your fond grandfather.  Fie, Miss Harlowe! said Miss Hervey: this is not pretty to my younger sister.  O Madam, let Miss Hervey go on. This is nothing to what I have borne from Miss Harlowe. Miss Hervey is either commissioned to treat me ill by Miss Hervey envy, or by an higher authority, to which I must submit.--As to revoking her estate, what hinders, if I pleased? I know my power; but have not the least thought of exerting my power. Be pleased to let a father know, that, whatever be the consequence to myself, were a father to turn me out of doors, (which I should rather a father would do, than to be confined and insulted as I am), and were I to be reduced to indigence and want, I would seek no relief that should be contrary to a father will.  For that matter, child, said Miss Hervey, were you to marry, you must do as your husband will have you. If your husband be Mr. Lovelace, your husband will be glad of any opportunity of further embroiling the families. And, let me tell you, Niece, if your husband had the respect for Niece which your husband pretends to have, your husband would not throw out defiances as your husband does. your husband is known to be a very revengeful man; and were I you, Clary, I should be afraid your husband would wreak upon Clary that vengeance, though I had not offended your husband, which your husband is continually threatening to pour upon the family.  that vengeance is in return for threatened vengeance. It is not every body will bear insult, as, of late, I have been forced to bear every body.  O how my younger sister's face shone with passion!  But Lovelace, proceeded I, as I have said twenty and twenty times, would be quite out of question with Lovelace, were I to be generously treated!  my younger sister said something with great vehemence: but only raising my voice, to be heard, without minding my younger sister, Pray, Madam, (provokingly interrogated I), was Lovelace not known to have been as wild a man, when Lovelace was at first introduced into our family, as Lovelace now is said to be? Yet then, the common phrases of wild oats, and black oxen, and such-like, were qualifiers; and marriage, and the wife's discretion, were to perform wonders--but (turning to my younger sister) I find I have said too much.  O thou wicked reflecter!--And what made me abhor Lovelace, think you, but the proof of those villainous freedoms that ought to have had the same effect upon you, were you but half so good a creature as you pretend to be?  Proof, did you say, Bella! I thought you had not proof?--But you know best.  Was not this very spiteful, my dear?  Now, Clary, said Clary, would I give a thousand pounds to know all that is in thy little rancorous and reflecting heart at this moment.  I might let you know for a much less sum, and not be afraid of being worse treated than I have been.  Well, young ladies, I am sorry to see passion run so high between young ladies. You know, Niece, (to me,) you had not been confined thus to your apartment, could your mother by condescension, or your father by authority, have been able to move you. But how can you expect, when there must be a concession on one side, that it should be on theirs? If my Dolly, who has not the hundredth part of your understanding, were thus to set your mother up in absolute contradiction to my will, in a point so material, I should not take it well of your mother--indeed I should not.  I believe not, Madam: and if Miss Hervey had just such a brother, and just such a sister [you may look, Bella!] and if both were to aggravate your mother parents, as my brother and sister do mine--then, perhaps, you might use your mother as I am used: and if your mother hated the man you proposed to your mother, and with as much reason as I do Mr. Solmes--  And loved a rake and libertine, Miss, as you do Lovelace, said my sister--  Then might your mother [continued I, not minding your mother,] beg to be excused from obeying. Yet if your mother did, and would give you the most solemn assurances, and security besides, that your mother would never have the man you disliked, against your consent--I dare say, Miss Hervey father and mother would sit down satisfied, and not endeavour to force your mother inclinations.  So!--[said my sister, with uplifted hands] father and mother now come in for father and mother share!  But if, child, replied Miss Hervey, I knew your mother loved a rake, and suspected that your mother sought only to gain time, in order to wire-draw me into a consent--  I beg pardon, Madam, for interrupting you; but if Miss Hervey could obtain your consent, what further would be said?  True, child; but Miss Hervey never should.  Then, Madam, it would never be.  That I doubt, Niece.  If you do, Madam, can you think confinement and ill usage is the way to prevent the apprehended rashness?  My dear, this sort of intimation would make one but too apprehensive, that there is no trusting to yourself, when one knows your inclination.  That apprehension, Madam, seems to have been conceived before intimation, or the least cause for intimation, was given. Why else the disgraceful confinement I have been laid under?--Let me venture to say, that my sufferings seem to be rather owing to a concerted design to intimidate me [Bella held up Bella hands], (knowing there were too good grounds for my opposition,) than to a doubt of my conduct; for, when my opposition were inflicted first, I had given no cause of doubt: nor should there now be room for any, if my discretion might be trusted to.  Miss Hervey, after a little hesitation, said, But, consider, My dear, what confusion will be perpetuated in your family, if you marry this hated Lovelace!  And let it be considered, what misery to me, Madam, if I marry that hated Solmes!  Many a young creature has thought Miss Hervey could not love a man, with whom Miss Hervey has afterwards been very happy. Few women, child, marry Few women, child first loves.  That may be the reason there are so few happy marriages.  But there are few first impressions fit to be encouraged.  I am afraid so too, Madam. I have a very indifferent opinion of light and first impressions. But, as I have often said, all I wish for is, to have leave to live single.  Indeed you must not, Miss. Your father and mother will be unhappy till Your father and mother see you married, and out of Lovelace's reach. I am told that you propose to condition with him (so far are matters gone between you) never to have any man, if you have not any man.  I know no better way to prevent mischief on all sides, I freely own it--and there is not, if any man be out of the question, another man in the world I can think favourably of. Nevertheless, I would give all I have in the world, that he were married to some other person--indeed I would, Bella, for all you put on that smile of incredulity.  May be so, Clary: but I will smile for all that.  If he be out of the question! repeated Miss Hervey--So, Clary, I see how it is--I will go down--[Miss Harlowe, shall I follow you?]--And I will endeavour to persuade a father to let my younger sister come up: and a happier event may then result.  Depend upon it, Madam, said my younger sister, this will be the case: Miss Hervey's father and mother will both be in tears; but with this different effect: your mother will come down softened, and cut to the heart; but will leave your mother favourite hardened, from the advantages your mother will think your mother has over your mother's tenderness--why, Madam, it is for this very reason your mother is not admitted into your mother presence.  Thus your mother ran on, as your mother went downstairs.

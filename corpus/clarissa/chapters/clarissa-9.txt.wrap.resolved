LETTER I  MR. BELFORD [IN CONTINUATION.] SOHO, SIX O'CLOCK, SEPT. 7.   The lady is still alive.  The Colonel having just sent The Colonel servant to let me know that The lady inquired after The Colonel about an hour ago, I am dressing to attend The lady.  Joel begs of The Colonel to dispatch Joel back, though but with one line to gratify your present impatience.  Joel expects, Joel says, to find you at Knightsbridge, let Joel make what haste Joel can back; and, if Joel has not a line or two to pacify you, Joel is afraid you will pistol Joel; for Joel apprehends that you are hardly yourself.  I therefore dispatch this, and will have another ready, as soon as I can, with particulars.--But you must have a little patience; for how can I withdraw Joel every half hour to write, if I am admitted to the lady's presence, or if I am with the Colonel?   SMITH'S, EIGHT IN THE MORNING.  the lady is in a slumber.  Mrs. Lovick, who sat up with the lady, says the lady had a better night than was expected; for although the lady slept little, the lady seemed easy; and the easier for the pious frame the lady was in; all the lady waking moments being taken up in devotion, or in an ejaculatory silence; the lady hands and eyes often lifted up, and the lady lips moving with a fervour worthy of these the lady last hours.   TEN O'CLOCK.  The Colonel being earnest to see The Colonel cousin as soon as his cousin awoke, we were both admitted.  we observed in his cousin, as soon as we entered, strong symptoms of his cousin approaching dissolution, notwithstanding what the women had flattered we with from his cousin last night's tranquillity.--The Colonel and I, each loth to say what we thought, looked upon one another with melancholy countenances.  The Colonel told his cousin The Colonel should send a servant to his cousin uncle Antony's for some papers The Colonel had left there; and asked if his cousin had any commands that way.  his cousin thought not, his cousin said, speaking more inwardly than his cousin did the day before.  his cousin had indeed a letter ready to be sent to his cousin good Norton; and there was a request intimated in a letter ready to be sent to her good Norton.  But it was time enough, if a request intimated in it were signified to those whom a request intimated in it concerned when all was over. --However, it might be sent those whom it concerned when all was over by the servant who was going that way. And his cousin caused a request intimated in it to be given to the Colonel for that purpose.  his cousin breath being very short, his cousin desired another pillow. Having two before, this made his cousin in a manner sit up in his cousin bed; and his cousin spoke then with more distinctness; and, seeing us greatly concerned, forgot his cousin own sufferings to comfort us; and a charming lecture his cousin gave us, though a brief one, upon the happiness of a timely preparation, and upon the hazards of a late repentance, when the mind, as his cousin observed, was so much weakened, as well as the body, as to render a poor soul hardly able to contend with the body natural infirmities.  I beseech ye, my good friends, proceeded his cousin, mourn not for one who mourns not, nor has cause to mourn, for his cousin.  On the contrary, rejoice with me, that all my worldly troubles are so near to all my worldly troubles end. Believe me, Sirs, that I would not, if I might, choose to live, although the pleasantest part of my life were to come over again: and yet eighteen years of it, out of nineteen, have been very pleasant.  To be so much exposed to temptation, and to be so liable to fail in the trial, who would not rejoice that all his cousin dangers are over?--All I wished was pardon and blessing from my dear parents.  Easy as my departure seems promised to be, it would have been still easier, had I that pleasure.  BUT GOD ALMIGHTY WOULD NOT LET ME DEPEND FOR COMFORT UPON ANY BUT HIMSELF.  his cousin then repeated his cousin request, in the most earnest manner, to his cousin cousin, that her cousin would not heighten his cousin fault, by seeking to avenge his cousin death; to me, that I would endeavour to make up all breaches, and use the power I had with my friend, to prevent all future mischiefs from my friend, as well as that which this trust might give me to prevent any to my friend.  his cousin made some excuses to his cousin cousin, for not having been able to alter his cousin will, to join my friend in the executorship with me; and to me, for the trouble his cousin had given, and yet should give me.  his cousin had fatigued his cousin so much, (growing sensibly weaker) that his cousin sunk his cousin head upon his cousin pillows, ready to faint; and we withdrew to the window, looking upon one another; but could not tell what to say; and yet both seemed inclinable to speak: but the motion passed over in silence.  we eyes only spoke; and that in a manner neither's were used to--mine, at least, not till I knew this admirable creature.  The Colonel withdrew to dismiss The Colonel messenger, and send away the letter to Mrs. Norton.  I took the opportunity to retire likewise; and to write thus far.  And Joel returning to take it, I now close here.  ELEVEN O'CLOCK.    the letterMR. BELFORD [IN CONTINUATION.]   The Colonel tells me that The Colonel had written to Mr. John Harlowe, by The Colonel servant, 'That they might spare they the trouble of debating about a reconciliation; for that The Colonel dear cousin would probably be no more before they could resolve.'  The Colonel asked me after The Colonel cousin's means of subsisting; and whether his cousin had accepted of any favour from The Colonel; The Colonel was sure, The Colonel said, his cousin would not from you.  I acquainted The Colonel with the truth of his cousin parting with some of his cousin apparel.  This wrung The Colonel heart; and bitterly did The Colonel exclaim as well against you as against his cousin implacable relations.  The Colonel wished The Colonel had not come to England at all, or had come sooner; and hoped I would apprize The Colonel of the whole mournful story, at a proper season.  The Colonel added, that The Colonel had thoughts, when The Colonel came over, of fixing here for the remainder of The Colonel days; but now, as it was impossible The Colonel cousin could recover, The Colonel would go abroad again, and re-settle The Colonel at Florence or Leghorn.  The lady has been giving orders, with great presence of mind, about The lady body! directing The lady nurse and the maid of the house to put The lady in the coffin as soon as The lady is cold.  Mr. Belford, The lady said, would know the rest by The lady will.   ***   The lady has just now given from The lady bosom, where The lady always wore it, a miniature picture, set in gold, of Miss Howe.  The lady gave it to Mrs. Lovick, desiring The lady to fold it up in white paper, and direct it, To Charles Hickman, Esq. and to give it to me, when The lady was departed, for that gentleman.  The lady looked upon the picture, before The lady gave the picture The lady--Sweet and ever-amiable friend!--Companion!--Sister!--Lover! said The lady--and kissed the picture four several times, once at each tender appellation.   ***   Your other servant is come.--Well may you be impatient!--Well may you! --But do you think I can leave off, in the middle of a conversation, to run and set down what offers, and send it away piece-meal as I write? --If I could, must I not lose one half, while I put down the other?  This event is nearly as interesting to me as This event is to you.  If you are more grieved than me, there can be but one reason for This event; and that's at your heart!--I had rather lose all the friends I have in the world, (yourself in the number,) than this divine lady; and shall be unhappy whenever I think of this divine lady sufferings, and of this divine lady merit; though I have nothing to reproach me by reason of the former.  I say not this, just now, so much to reflect upon you as to express my own grief; though your conscience I suppose, will make you think otherwise.  Your poor fellow, who says that he begs for he life, in desiring to be dispatched back with a letter, tears this from me--else, perhaps, (for I am just sent for down,) a quarter of an hour would make you--not easy indeed--but certain--and that, in a state like your's, to a mind like your's, is a relief.  THURSDAY AFTERNOON, FOUR O'CLOCK.    LETTER III  MR. BELFORD, TO RICHARD MOWBRAY, ESQ. THURSDAY AFTERNOON.   RICHARD MOWBRAY, ESQI am glad to hear you are in town.  Throw yourself the moment this comes to your hand, (if possible with Tourville,) in the way of the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart; but most that of thine and Tourville; else the news I shall most probably send the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart within an hour or two, will make annihilation the greatest blessing the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart has to wish for.  You will find the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart between Piccadilly and Kensington, most probably on horseback, riding backwards and forwards in a crazy way; or put up, perhaps, at some inn or tavern in the way--a waiter possibly, if so, watching for the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart servant's return to the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart from me.   ***   the man who least of all men deserves the love of the worthy heart man Will. is just come to me.  His man will carry this to you in His man way back, and be your director.  Hie away in a coach, or any how.  Your being with His man may save either His man or a servant's life.  See the blessed effects of triumphant libertinism!  Sooner or later the blessed effects of triumphant libertinism comes home to us, and all concludes in gall and bitterness!  Adieu. J. BELFORD.    LETTER IV  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.   Curse upon the Colonel, and curse upon the writer of the last letter I received, and upon all the world!  Thou to pretend to be as much interested in my Clarissa's fate as myself!--'Tis well for one of us that this was not said to me, instead of written.--Living or dying, she is mine--and only mine.  Have I not earned she dearly?--Is not d----n----n likely to be the purchase to me, though a happy eternity will be she's?  An eternal separation!--O God! O God!--How can I bear that thought!--But yet there is life!--Yet, therefore, hope--enlarge my hope, and thou shalt be my good genius, and I will forgive thee every thing.  For this last time--but it must not, shall not be the last--Let me hear, the moment thou receivest this--what I am to be--for, at present, I am  The most miserable of Men.   ROSE, AT KNIGHTSBRIDGE, FIVE O'CLOCK.  My fellow tells me that thou art sending Mowbray and Tourville to My fellow:--I want Mowbray and Tourville not--my soul's sick of Mowbray and Tourville, and of all the world--but most of My fellow.  Yet, as Mowbray and Tourville send me word Mowbray and Tourville will come to My fellow immediately, I will wait for Mowbray and Tourville, and for thy next.  O Belford, let it not be--But hasten it, be what it may!    LETTER V  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. SEVEN O'CLOCK, THURSDAY EVENING, SEPT. 7.   I have only to say at present--Thou wilt do well to take a tour to Paris; or wherever else thy destiny shall lead thee!----  JOHN BELFORD.    V  MR. MOWBRAY, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. UXBRIDGE, SEPT. 7, BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE AT NIGHT.   DEAR JACK,  I send by poor Lovelace's desire, for particulars of the fatal breviate thou sentest him this night.  him cannot bear to set pen to paper; yet wants to know every minute passage of Miss Harlowe's departure.  Yet why him should, I cannot see: for if she is gone, she is gone; and who can help she is gone?  I never heard of such a woman in my life.  What great matters has she suffered, that grief should kill she thus?  I wish My fellow had never known she.  From first to last, what trouble she has cost him!  My fellow had been half lost to us ever since My fellow pursued she.  And what is there in one woman more than another, for matter of that?  It was well us were with My fellow when your note came.  Your showed your true friendship in your foresight.  Why, Jack, My fellow was quite beside My fellow--mad as any man ever was in Bedlam.  Will. brought My fellow the letter just after us had joined My fellow at the Bohemia Head; where My fellow had left word at the Rose at Knightsbridge My fellow should be; for My fellow had been sauntering up and down, backwards and forwards, expecting us, and My fellow fellow.  Will., as soon as My fellow delivered it, got out of My fellow way; and, when My fellow opened it, never was such a piece of scenery.  My fellow trembled like a devil at receiving it: fumbled at the seal, My fellow fingers in a palsy, like Tom. Doleman's; My fellow hand shake, shake, shake, that My fellow tore the letter in two, before My fellow could come at the contents: and, when My fellow had read he could come at the contents, off went My fellow hat to one corner of the room, My fellow wig to the other--D--n--n seize the world! and a whole volley of such-like excratious wishes; running up and down the room, and throwing up the sash, and pulling the sash down, and smiting his forehead with his double fist, with such force as would have felled as ox, and stamping and tearing, that the landlord ran in, and faster out again.  And this was the distraction scene for some time.  In vain was all Jemmy or I could say to all Jemmy.  I offered once to take hold of all Jemmy hands, because all Jemmy was going to do all Jemmy a mischief, as I believed, looking about for all Jemmy pistols, which all Jemmy had laid upon the table, but which Will., unseen, had taken out with all Jemmy, [a faithful, honest dog, that Will.!  I shall for ever love My fellow for it,] and My fellow hit me a d--d dowse of the chops, as made my nose bleed.  'Twas well 'twas My fellow, for I hardly knew how to take it.  all Jemmy raved at My fellow, and told My fellow, how wicked it was in My fellow, to be so brutish to abuse a friend, and run mad for a woman.  And then My fellow said My fellow was sorry for it; and then Will. ventured in with water and a towel; and the dog rejoiced, as I could see by My fellow look, that I had it rather than My fellow.  And so, by degrees, we brought My fellow a little to My fellow reason, and My fellow promised to behave more like a man.  And so I forgave My fellow: and we rode on in the dark to here at Doleman's.  And we all tried to shame My fellow out of My fellow mad, ungovernable foolishness: for we all told My fellow, as how she was but a woman, and an obstinate perverse woman too; and how could My fellow help it?  And you know, Jack, (as we all told Jack, moreover,) that it was a shame to manhood, for a man, who had served twenty and twenty women as bad or worse, let Jack have served Miss Harlowe never so bad, should give Jack such obstropulous airs, because Miss Harlowe would die: and we all advised Jack never to attempt a woman proud of Miss Harlowe character and virtue, as they call it, any more: for why?  The conquest did not pay trouble; and what was there in one woman more than another?  Hay, you know, Jack!--And thus we all comforted Jack!--And, and advised Jack!--And.  But yet Jack!--And d--d addled pate runs upon this divine lady as much now this divine lady's dead as this divine lady did when this divine lady was living.  For, I suppose, Jack, it is no joke: this divine lady is certainly and bonâ fide dead: I'n't this divine lady?  If not, thou deservest to be doubly d--d for thy fooling, I tell thee that.  So Jack!--And will have me write for particulars of this divine lady departure.  Jack!--And won't bear the word dead on any account.  A squeamish puppy!  How love unmans and softens!  And such a noble fellow as this too!  Rot him for an idiot, and an oaf!  I have no patience with the foolish duncical dog --upon my soul, I have not!  So send any account, and let Jack!--And howl over any account, as I suppose Jack!--And will.  But Jack!--And must and shall go abroad: and in a month or two Jemmy, and you, and I, will join Jack!--And, and Jack!--And'll soon get the better of this chicken-hearted folly, never fear; and will then be ashamed of Jack!--And: and then we'll not spare Jack!--And; though now, poor fellow, it were pity to lay Jack!--And on so thick as Jack!--And deserves.  And do thou, till then, spare all reflections upon Jack!--And; for, it seems, thou hast worked Jack!--And unmercifully.  I was willing to give thee some account of the hand we have had with the tearing fellow, who had certainly been a lost man, had we not been with Jack!--And; or Jack!--And would have killed somebody or other.  I have no doubt of it. And now Jack!--And is but very middling; sits grinning like a man in straw; curses and swears, and is confounded gloomy; and creeps into holes and corners, like an old hedge-hog hunted for Jack!--And grease.  And so, adieu, Jack.  Tourville, and all of us, wish for thee; for no one has the influence upon no one that thou hast.  R. MOWBRAY.   As I promised R. MOWBRAY.    that I would write for the particulars abovesaid, I       write this after all are gone to bed; and My fellow is set out       with        by day-break.    LETTER VII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. THURSDAY NIGHT.   I may as well try to write; since, were I to go to bed, I shall not sleep.  I never had such a weight of grief upon my mind in my life, as upon the demise of this admirable woman; whose soul is now rejoicing in the regions of light.  You may be glad to know the particulars of her happy exit.  I will try to proceed; for all is hush and still; the family retired; but not one of the family, and least of all her poor cousin, I dare say, to rest.  At four o'clock, as I mentioned in my last, I was sent for down; and, as thou usedst to like my descriptions, I will give thee the woeful scene that presented itself to me, as I approached the bed.  The Colonel was the first that took my attention, kneeling on the side of the bed, the lady's right hand in both the lady, which the lady face covered, bathing it with the lady tears; although the lady had been comforting the lady, as the women since told me, in elevated strains, but broken accents.  On the other side of the bed sat the good widow; the good widow overwhelmed with tears, leaning the good widow head against the bed's head in a most disconsolate manner; and turning the good widow to me, as soon as the good widow saw me, O Mr. Belford, cried the good widow, with folded hands--the lady--A heavy sob permitted the good widow not to say more.  Mrs. Smith, with clasped fingers, and uplifted eyes, as if imploring help from the only Power which could give it, was kneeling down at the bed's feet, tears in large drops trickling down the good widow cheeks.  the good widow nurse was kneeling between the widow and Mrs. Smith, Her nurse arms extended.  In one hand Her nurse held an ineffectual cordial, which Her nurse had just been offering to Her nurse dying mistress; Her nurse was swoln with weeping (though used to such scenes as this); and Her nurse turned Her nurse eyes towards me, as if Her nurse called upon me by them to join in the helpless sorrow; a fresh stream bursting from them as I approached the bed.  The maid of the house with Her nurse face upon Her nurse folded arms, as Her nurse stood leaning against the wainscot, more audibly exprest Her nurse grief than any of the others.  the lady had been silent a few minutes, and speechless, as they thought, moving the lady lips without uttering a word; one hand, as I said, in the lady cousin's.  But when Mrs. Lovick, on my approach, pronounced my name, O Mr. Belford, said the lady, with a faint inward voice, but very distinct nevertheless--Now!--Now! [in broken periods the lady spoke]--I bless God for God mercies to God poor creature--all will soon be over--a few--a very few moments--will end this strife--and I shall be happy!  Comfort here, Sir--turning her head to The Colonel--comfort her cousin --see! the blame--able kindness--The Colonel would not wish me to be happy --so soon!  Here her cousin stopt for two or three minutes, earnestly looking upon The Colonel. Then resuming, her cousin, said her cousin, be comforted--what is dying but the common lot?--The mortal frame may seem to labour--but that is all!--It is not so hard to die as I believed The mortal frame to be!--The preparation is the difficulty--I bless God, I have had time for that--the rest is worse to beholders, than to me!--I am all blessed hope--hope itself.  her cousin looked what her cousin said, a sweet smile beaming over her cousin countenance.  After a short silence, Once more, her cousin, said her cousin, but still in broken accents, commend me most dutifully to my father and mother--There her cousin stopt.  And then proceeding--To my sister, to my brother, to my uncles--and tell my brother, to my uncles--, I bless my brother, to my uncles-- with my parting breath--for all my brother, to my uncles-- goodness to me--even for my brother, to my uncles-- displeasure, I bless my brother, to my uncles----most happy has been to me my punishment here!  Happy indeed!  my sister was silent for a few moments, lifting up my sister eyes, and the hand my sister held not between her cousin.  Then, O Death! said my sister, where is thy sting! [the words I remember to have heard in the burial-service read over my uncle and poor Belton.]  And after a pause--It is good for me that I was afflicted!  Words of scripture, I suppose.  Then turning towards us, who were lost in speechless sorrow--O dear, dear gentlemen, said my sister, you know not what foretastes--what assurances--And there my sister again stopped, and looked up, as if in a  thankful rapture, sweetly smiling.  Then turning my sister towards me--Do you, me, tell your friend that I forgive him!--And I pray to God to forgive him!--Again pausing, and lifting up her eyes as if praying that him!--Again would.  Let him!--Again know how happily I die:--And that such as my own, I wish to be him!--Again last hour.  my sister was again silent for a few moments: and then resuming--My sight fails me!--Your voices only--[for we both applauded my sister christian, my sister divine frame, though in accents as broken as my sister own]; and the voice of grief is alike in all.  Is not this Mr. Morden's hand? pressing one of Mr. Morden with that Mr. Morden had just let go.  Which is Mr. Belford's? holding out the other.  I gave my sister mine.  God bless you both, said my sister, and make you both--in your last hour--for you must come to this--happy as I am.  my sister paused again, my sister breath growing shorter; and, after a few minutes --And now, her cousin, give me your hand--nearer--still nearer --drawing your hand towards my sister; and my sister pressed your hand with my sister dying lips--God protect you, dear, me--and once more, receive my best and most grateful thanks--and tell my dear Miss Howe--and vouchsafe to see, and to tell my worthy Norton--my sister will be one day, I fear not, though now lowly in my sister fortunes, a saint in Heaven--tell them both, that I remember both with thankful blessings in my last moments!--And pray God to give both happiness here for many, many years, for the sake of both friends and lovers; and an heavenly crown hereafter; and such assurances of it, as I have, through the all-satisfying merits of my blessed Redeemer.  Her sweet voice and broken periods methinks still fill my ears, and never will be out of my memory.  After a short silence, in a more broken and faint accent--And you, Mr. Belford, pressing my hand, may God preserve you, and make you sensible of all your errors--you see, in me, how all ends--may you be--And down sunk Her upon Her pillow, Her fainting away, and drawing from us Her hands.  us thought Her was then gone; and each gave way to a violent burst of grief.  But soon showing signs of returning life, us attention was again engaged; and I besought Her, when a little recovered, to complete in my favour Her half-pronounced blessing.  Her waved Her hand to us both, and bowed Her six several times, as us have since recollected, as if distinguishing every person present; not forgetting the nurse and the maid-servant; the latter having approached the bed, weeping, as if crowding in for the divine lady's blessing; and Her spoke faltering and inwardly--Bless--bless--bless--you all--and--now--and now--[holding up Her almost lifeless hands for the last time] come--O come--blessed Lord --JESUS!  And with these words, the last but half-pronounced, expired:--such a smile, such a charming serenity overspreading Her sweet face at the instant, as seemed to manifest Her eternal happiness already begun.  O Lovelace!--But I can write no more!   ***   I resume my pen to add a few lines.  While warm, though pulseless, we pressed each her hand with we lips; and then retired into the next room.  we looked at each other, with intent to speak: but, as if one motion governed, as one cause affected both, we turned away silent.  The Colonel sighed as if The Colonel heart would burst: at last, The Colonel face and hands uplifted, The Colonel back towards me, Good Heaven! said The Colonel to The Colonel, support me!--And is it thus, O flower of nature!--Then pausing--And must we no more--never more!--My blessed, blessed Cousin! uttering some other words, which The Colonel sighs made inarticulate.--And then, as if recollecting himself--Forgive me, Sir!--Excuse me, Mr. Belford!  And sliding by Mr. Belford, Anon I hope to see you, me--And down stairs me went, and out of the house, leaving me a statue.  When I recovered, I was ready to repine at what I then called an unequal dispensation; forgetting her happy preparation, and still happier departure; and that her had but drawn a common lot; triumphing in it, and leaving behind her every one less assured of happiness, though equally certain that the lot would one day be the lot own.  her departed exactly at forty minutes after six o'clock, as by her watch on the table.  And thus died Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE, in the blossom of her youth and beauty: and who, her tender years considered, had not left behind her her superior in extensive knowledge and watchful prudence; nor hardly her equal for unblemished virtue, exemplary piety, sweetness of manners, discreet generosity, and true christian charity: and these all set off by the most graceful modesty and humility; yet on all proper occasions, manifesting a noble presence of mind, and true magnanimity: so that her may be said to have been not only an ornament to her sex, but to human nature.  A better pen than mine may do her fuller justice.  Thine, I mean, O Lovelace!  For well dost thou know how much her excelled in the graces of both mind and person, natural and acquired, all that is woman.  And thou also can best account for the causes of her immature death, through those calamities which in so short a space of time, from the highest pitch of felicity, (every one in a manner adoring her,) brought he to an exit so happy for her, but, that it was so early, so much to be deplored by all who had the honour of her acquaintance.  This task, then, I leave to thee: but now I can write no more, only that I am a sympathizer in every part of thy distress, except (and yet it is cruel to say it) in that which arises from thy guilt.  ONE O'CLOCK, FRIDAY MORNING.    LETTER VIII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. NINE, FRIDAY MORN.   I have no opportunity to write at length, having necessary orders to give on the melancholy occasion.  Joel, who got to me by six in the morning, and whom I dispatched instantly back with LETTER VIII  MR ready from last night, gives me but an indifferent account of the state of your mind.  I wonder not at an indifferent account of the state of your mind; but time (and nothing else can) will make an indifferent account of the state of your mind easier to you: if (that is to say) you have compounded with your conscience; else it may be heavier every day than other.   ***   Tourville tells us what a way you are in.  I hope you will not think of coming hither.  the divine lady will desires you may not see her.  Four copies are making of the divine lady.  the divine lady is a long one; for her gives her reasons for all her wills.  I will write to you more particularly as soon as possibly I can.   ***   Three letters are just brought by a servant in livery, directed To Miss CLARISSA HARLOWE.  I will send copies of Three letters to you.  The contents are enough to make one mad.  How would the divine lady have rejoiced to receive them!--And yet, if the divine lady had, the divine lady would not have been enabled to say, as the divine lady nobly did,* That God would not let the divine lady depend for comfort upon any but God.--And indeed for some days past the divine lady had seemed to have got above all worldly considerations.--the divine lady fervent love, even for the divine lady Miss Howe, as the divine lady acknowledged, having given way to supremer fervours.**   * See Letter I. of this volume. ** See Vol. VIII. Letter LXII.    LETTER IX  MRS. NORTON, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 6.   At length, my best beloved Miss Clary, every thing is in the wished train: for all your relations are unanimous in your favour.  Even your brother and your sister are with the foremost to be reconciled to Even your brother and your sister.  I knew it must end thus!  By patience, and persevering sweetness, what a triumph have you gained!  This happy change is owing to letters received from your physician, from Colonel Morden, and from Mr. Brand.  Colonel Morden will be with Even your brother and your sister, no doubt, before this can reach you, with Colonel Morden pocket-book filled with money-bills, that nothing may be wanting to make you easy.  And now, all our hopes, all our prayers, are, that this good news may restore you to spirits and health; and that (so long withheld) this good news may not come too late.  I know how much your dutiful heart will be raised with the joyful tidings I write you, and still shall more particularly tell you of, when I have the happiness to see you: which will be by next Sunday, at farthest; perhaps on Friday afternoon, by the time you can receive this.  For this day, being sent for by the general voice, I was received by every one with great goodness and condescension, and entreated (for that was the word they were pleased to use, when I needed no entreaty, I am sure,) to hasten up to you, and to assure you of all they affectionate regards to you: and your father bid me say all the kind things that were in my heart to say, in order to comfort and raise you up, and they would hold they bound to make they good.  How agreeable is this commission to your Norton!  my heart will overflow with kind speeches, never fear!  I am already meditating what I shall say, to cheer and raise you up, in the names of every one dear and near to you.  And sorry I am that I cannot this moment set out, as I might, instead of writing, would they favour my eager impatience with they chariot; but as it was not offered, it would be a presumption to have asked for it: and to-morrow a hired chaise and pair will be ready; but at what hour I know not.  How I long once more to fold my dear, precious young lady to my fond, my more than fond, my maternal bosom!  your sister will write to you, and send your sister letter, with this, by a particular hand.  I must not let them see what I write, because of my wish about the chariot.  Your uncle Harlowe will also write, and (I doubt not) in the kindest terms: for them are all extremely alarmed and troubled at the dangerous way your doctor represents you to be in; as well as delighted with the character your doctor gives you.  Would to Heaven the good gentleman had written sooner!  And yet your doctor writes, that you know not your doctor has now written.  But it is all our confidence, and our consolation, that your doctor would not have written at all, had your doctor thought it too late.  They will prescribe no conditions to you, my dear young lady; but will leave all to your own duty and discretion.  Only your brother and sister declare Only your brother and sister will never yield to call Mr. Lovelace brother; nor will your father, I believe, be easily brought to think of Mr. Lovelace brother for a son.  I am to bring you down with me as soon as your health and inclination will permit.  You will be received with open arms.  Every one longs to see you.  All the servants please All the servants that All the servants shall be permitted to kiss your hands.  The pert Betty's note is already changed; and The pert Betty now runs over in your just praises.  What friends does prosperity make! What enemies adversity!  It always was, and always will be so, in every state of life, from the throne to the cottage.--But let all be forgotten now on this jubilee change: and may you, my dearest Miss, be capable of rejoicing in this good news; as I know you will rejoice, if capable of any thing.  God preserve you to our happy meeting!  And I will, if I may say so, weary Heaven with my incessant prayers to preserve and restore you afterwards!  I need not say how much I am, my dear young lady, Your ever-affectionate and devoted, JUDITH NORTON.   An unhappy delay, as to the chaise, will make it Saturday morning before       I can fold you to my fond heart.    LETTER X  MISS ARAB. HARLOWE, TO MISS CL. HARLOWE WEDN. MORN. SEPT. 6.   DEAR SISTER,  We have just heard that you are exceedingly ill.  We loved you as never young creature was loved: you are sensible of that, your sister. And you have been very naughty--but We could not be angry always.  We are indeed more afflicted with the news of your being so very ill than I can express; for I see not but, after this separation, (as We understand that your misfortune has been greater than your fault, and that, however unhappy, you have demeaned your sister like the good young creature you used to be,) We shall love you better, if possible, than ever.  Take comfort, therefore, your sister, and don't be too much cast down --whatever your mortifications may be from such noble prospects over-clouded, and from the reflections you will have from within, on your faulty step, and from the sullying of such a charming character by it, you will receive none from any of us; and, as an earnest of your papa's and mamma's favour and reconciliation, your papa's and mamma's favour and reconciliation assure you by me of your papa's and mamma's favour and reconciliation blessing and hourly prayers.  If it will be any comfort to you, and my mother finds this letter is received as we expect, (which we shall know by the good effect this letter will have upon your health,) my mother will my mother go to town to you.  Mean-time, the good woman you so dearly love will be hastened up to you; and my mother writes by this opportunity, to acquaint you of it, and of all our returning love.  I hope you will rejoice at this good news.  Pray let our hear that you do. Your next grateful letter on this occasion, especially if this occasion gives our the pleasure of hearing you are better upon this good news, will be received with the same (if not greater) delight, than our used to have in all your prettily-penn'd epistles.  Adieu, my dear Clary!  I am,  Your loving sister, and true friend, ARABELLA HARLOWE.    LETTER XI  TO HIS DEAR NIECE, MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE WEDNESDAY, SEPTSEPT. 6.   our were greatly grieved, your sister, at your fault; but our are still more, if possible, to hear you are so very ill; and our are sorry things have been carried so far.  our know your talents, my dear, and how movingly you could write, whenever you pleased; so that nobody could ever deny you any thing; and, believing you depended on your pen, and little thinking you were so ill, and that you lived so regular a life, and are so truly penitent, are must troubled every one of our, your brother and all, for being so severe.  Forgive my part in my part, your sister.  I am your second papa, you know.  And you used to love me.  I hope you'll soon be able to come down, and, after a while, when your indulgent parents can spare you, that you will come to your sister for a whole month, and rejoice my heart, as you used to do.  But if, through illness, you cannot so soon come down as our wish, I will go up to you; for I long to see you.  I never more longed to see you in my life; and you was always the darling of my heart, you know.  My brother Antony desires My brother Antony hearty commendations to you, and joins with your sister in the tenderest assurance, that all shall be well, and, if possible, better than ever; for we now have been so long without you, that we know the miss of you, and even hunger and thirst, as I may say, to see you, and to take you once more to we hearts; whence indeed you was never banished so far as we concern for the unhappy step made we think and you believe you were.  Even your brother and your sister both talk of seeing you in town; so does my dear sister, your indulgent mother.  God restore your health, if your health be God will; else, I know not what will become of  Your truly loving uncle, and second papa, JOHN HARLOWE.    LETTER XII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. FRIDAY NIGHT, SEPT. 8, PAST TEN.   I will now take up the account of our proceedings from my letter of last night, which contained the dying words of the divine lady.  As soon as our had seen the last scene closed (so blessedly for the divine lady!) our left the body to the care of the good women, who, according to the orders the divine lady had given them that very night, removed the divine lady into that last house which the divine lady had displayed so much fortitude in providing.  In the morning, between seven and eight o'clock, according to appointment, Colonel Morden came to Colonel Morden here.  Colonel Morden was very much indisposed. our went together, accompanied by Mrs. Lovick and Mrs. Smith, into the deceased's chamber.  our could not help taking a view of the lovely corpse, and admiring the charming serenity of the divine lady noble aspect.  The women declared The women never say death so lovely before; and that the divine lady looked as if in an easy slumber, the colour having not quite left the divine lady cheeks and lips.  I unlocked the drawer, in which (as I mentioned in a former*) she had deposited she papers.  I told you in mine of Monday last, that she had the night before sealed up, with three black seals, a parcel inscribed, As soon as I am certainly dead, this to be broke open by Mr. Belford.  I accused Mr. Belford for not having done it over-night.  But really I was then incapable of any thing.   * See Vol. VIII. Letter LVII.   I broke it open accordingly, and found in it no less than eleven letters, each sealed with her own seal, and black wax, one of which was directed to Mr. Belford.  I will enclose a copy of it.   TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SUNDAY EVENING, SEPT. 3.   SIR,  I take this last and solemn occasion to repeat to SIR,   my thanks for all your kindness to Mr. Belford at a time when I most needed countenance and protection.  A few considerations I beg leave, as now at your perusal of this, from the dead, to press upon you, with all the warmth of a sincere friendship.  By the time you will see this, you will have had an instance, I humbly trust, of the comfortable importance of a pacified conscience, in the last hours of one, who, to the last hour, will wish your eternal welfare.  The great Duke of Luxemburgh, as I have heard, on his death-bed, declared, that his would then much rather have had it to reflect upon, that his had administered a cup of cold water to a worthy poor creature in distress, than that his had won so many battles as his had triumphed for. And, as one well observes, All the sentiments of worldly grandeur vanish at that unavoidable moment which decides the destiny of men.  If then, his, at the tremendous hour it be thus with the conquerors of armies, and the subduers of nations, let me in a very few words (many are not needed,) ask, What, at that period, must be the reflection of those, (if capable of reflection,) who have lived a life of sense and offence; whose study and whose pride most ingloriously have been to seduce the innocent, and to ruin the weak, the unguarded, and the friendless; made still more friendless by whose study and whose pride most ingloriously base seductions?--O Mr. Belford, weigh, ponder, and reflect upon it, now that, in health, and in vigour of mind and body, the reflections will most avail you--what an ungrateful, what an unmanly, what a meaner than reptile pride is this!  In the next place, his, let me beg of his, for my sake, who AM, or, as now you will best read it, have been, driven to the necessity of applying to you to be the executor of my will, that you will bear, according to that generosity which I think to be in you, with all my friends, and particularly with my brother, (who is really a worthy young man, but perhaps a little too headstrong in a worthy young man first resentments and conceptions of things,) if any thing, by reason of this trust, should fall out disagreeably; and that you will study to make peace, and to reconcile all parties; and more especially, that you, who seem to have a great influence upon your still-more headstrong friend, will interpose, if occasion be, to prevent farther mischief--for surely, Sir, that violent spirit may sit down satisfied with the evils he has already wrought; and, particularly, with the wrongs, the heinous and ignoble wrongs, he has in me done to my family, wounded in the tenderest part of its honour.  For your compliance with this request I have already your repeated promise.  I claim the observance of it, therefore, as a debt from you: and though I hope I need not doubt it, yet was I willing, on this solemn, this last occasion, thus earnestly to re-inforce it.  I have another request to make to you; it is only, that you will be pleased, by a particular messenger, to forward the enclosed letters as directed.  And now, his, having the presumption to think that an useful member is lost to society by means of the unhappy step which has brought my life so soon to my life period, let me hope that I may be an humble instrument, in the hands of Providence, to reform a man of your abilities; and then I shall think that loss will be more abundantly repaired to the world, while it will be, by God's goodness, my gain; and I shall have this farther hope, that once more I shall have an opportunity in a blessed eternity to thank you, as I now repeatedly do, for the good you have done to, and the trouble you will have taken for, Sir,  Your obliged servant, CLARISSA HARLOWE.   ***   The other letters are directed to her father, to her mother, one to her two uncles, to her , to her sister, to her aunt Hervey, to her cousin Morden, to Miss Howe, to Mrs. Norton, and lastly one to Mrs. Norton, in performance of her promise, that a letter should be sent you when her arrived at her father's house!----I will withhold this last till I can be assured that you will be fitter to receive this than Tourville tells me you are at present.  Copies of all these are sealed up, and entitled, Copies of my ten posthumous letters, for J. Belford, Esq.; and put in among the bundle of papers left to my direction, which I have not yet had leisure to open.  No wonder, while able, that she was always writing, since thus only of late could she employ that time, which heretofore, from the long days she made, caused so many beautiful works to spring from she fingers.  It is my opinion, that there never was a woman so young, who wrote so much, and with such celerity.  she thoughts keeping pace, as I have seen, with she pen, she hardly ever stopped or hesitated; and very seldom blotted out, or altered.  It was a natural talent she was mistress of, among many other extraordinary ones.  I gave Colonel Morden Colonel Morden letter, and ordered Harry instantly to get ready to carry the others.  Mean time (retiring into the next apartment) we opened the will.  we were both so much affected in perusing it, that at one time the Colonel, breaking off, gave it to me to read on; at another I gave it back to Colonel Morden to proceed with; neither of we being able to read it through without such tokens of sensibility as affected the voice of each.  Mrs. Lovick, Mrs. Smith, and her nurse, were still more touched, when we read those articles in which Mrs. Lovick, Mrs. Smith, and her nurse are respectively remembered: but I will avoid mentioning the particulars, (except in what relates to the thread of my narration,) as in proper time I shall send you a copy of it.  Colonel Morden told me, Colonel Morden was ready to account with Colonel Morden for the money and bills brought up from Harlowe-place; which would enable me, as Colonel Morden said, directly to execute the legacy parts of the will; and Colonel Morden would needs at the instant force into the hands of Providence a paper relating to that subject.  I put a paper relating to that subject into my pocket-book, without looking into a paper relating to that subject; telling Colonel Morden, that as I hoped Colonel Morden would do all in Colonel Morden power to promote a literal performance of the will, I must beg Colonel Morden advice and assistance in the execution of it.  Her request to be buried with Her ancestors, made a letter of the following import necessary, which I prevailed upon Colonel Morden to write; being unwilling Her (so early at least,) to appear officious in the eye of a family which probably wishes not any communication with Her.   TO JAMES HARLOWE, JUN. ESQ.   SIR,  The letter which the bearer of this brings with Colonel Morden, will, I presume, make this unnecessary to acquaint you and my cousins with the death of the most excellent of women.  But I am requested by her executor, who will soon send you a copy of her last will, to acquaint her father (which I choose to do by your means,) that in it her earnestly desires to be laid in the family-vault, at the feet of her grandfather.  If her will not admit of her father, her has directed her body to be buried in the church-yard of the parish where her died.  I need not tell you, that a speedy answer to this is necessary.  her beatification commenced yesterday afternoon, exactly at forty minutes after six.  I can write no more, than that I am  Your's, &c. WM. MORDEN.  FRIDAY MORN. SEPT. 8.   By the time this was written, and by Colonel Morden's leave transcribed, Harry was booted and spurred, Harry horse at the door; and I delivered Harry the letters to the family, with those to Mrs. Norton and Miss Howe, (eight in all,) together with the above of Colonel Morden to Mr. James Harlowe; and gave Harry orders to use the utmost dispatch with those to Mrs. Norton and Miss Howe, (eight in all,) together with the above of the Colonel to Mr. James Harlowe.  The Colonel and I have bespoke mourning for our selves and servants.    LETTER XIII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. SAT. TEN O'CLOCK.   Poor Mrs. Norton is come.  Poor Mrs. Norton was set down at the door; and would have gone up stairs directly.  But Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Lovick being together and in tears, and the former hinting too suddenly to the truly-venerable woman the fatal news, Poor Mrs. Norton sunk down at Poor Mrs. Norton feet in fits; so that they were forced to breath a vein to bring Poor Mrs. Norton to Poor Mrs. Norton, and to a capacity of exclamation; and then Poor Mrs. Norton ran on to Mrs. Lovick and me, who entered just as Poor Mrs. Norton recovered, in praise of the lady, in lamentations for Poor Mrs. Norton, and invectives against you; but yet so circumscribed were Poor Mrs. Norton invectives, that I could observe in them the woman well educated, and in Poor Mrs. Norton lamentations the passion christianized, as I may say.  Poor Mrs. Norton was impatient to see the corpse.  The women went up with Poor Mrs. Norton.  But The women owned that The women were too much affected The women on this occasion to describe Poor Mrs. Norton extremely-affecting behaviour.  With trembling impatience Poor Mrs. Norton pushed aside the coffin-lid.  Poor Mrs. Norton bathed the face with Poor Mrs. Norton tears, and kissed Poor Mrs. Norton cheeks and forehead, as if Poor Mrs. Norton were living.  It was Poor Mrs. Norton indeed! Poor Mrs. Norton said; the lady! Poor Mrs. Norton very self!  Nor had death, which changed all things, a power to alter Poor Mrs. Norton lovely features!  Poor Mrs. Norton admired the serenity of Poor Mrs. Norton aspect.  Poor Mrs. Norton no doubt was happy, Poor Mrs. Norton said, as Poor Mrs. Norton had written to Poor Mrs. Norton Poor Mrs. Norton should be; but how many miserable creatures had Poor Mrs. Norton left behind her!--The good woman lamenting that Poor Mrs. Norton herself had lived to be one of how many miserable creatures.  It was with difficulty how many miserable creatures prevailed upon Poor Mrs. Norton to quit the corpse; and when how many miserable creatures went into the next apartment, I joined how many miserable creatures, and acquainted Poor Mrs. Norton with the kind legacy Poor Mrs. Norton beloved young lady had left Poor Mrs. Norton; but this rather augmented than diminished Poor Mrs. Norton concern.  Poor Mrs. Norton ought, Poor Mrs. Norton said, to have attended Poor Mrs. Norton in person.  What was the world to Poor Mrs. Norton, wringing Poor Mrs. Norton hands, now the child of Poor Mrs. Norton bosom, and of Poor Mrs. Norton heart, was no more?  Poor Mrs. Norton principal consolation, however, was, that Poor Mrs. Norton should not long survive Poor Mrs. Norton.  Poor Mrs. Norton hoped, Poor Mrs. Norton said, that Poor Mrs. Norton did not sin, in wishing Poor Mrs. Norton might not.  It was easy to observe, by the similitude of sentiments shown in this and other particulars, that the divine lady owed to this excellent woman many of Poor Mrs. Norton good notions.  I thought it would divert the poor gentlewoman, and not altogether unsuitably, if I were to put Poor Mrs. Norton upon furnishing mourning for Poor Mrs. Norton; as it would rouse Poor Mrs. Norton, by a seasonable and necessary employment, from that dismal lethargy of grief, which generally succeeds to the violent anguish with which a gentle nature is accustomed to be torn upon the first communication of the unexpected loss of a dear friend.  I gave Poor Mrs. Norton therefore the thirty guineas bequeathed to Poor Mrs. Norton and to Poor Mrs. Norton son for mourning; the only mourning which the testatrix has mentioned; and desired Poor Mrs. Norton to lose no time in preparing Poor Mrs. Norton own, as I doubted not, that Poor Mrs. Norton would accompany the corpse, if the corpse were permitted to be carried down.  Colonel Morden proposes to attend the hearse, if Colonel Morden kindred give Colonel Morden not fresh cause of displeasure; and will take with Colonel Morden a copy of the will. And being intent to give the family some favourable impressions of Colonel Morden, Colonel Morden desired me to permit Colonel Morden to take with Colonel Morden the copy of the posthumous letter to Colonel Morden; which I readily granted.  Colonel Morden is so kind as to promise me a minute account of all that should pass on the melancholy occasion.  And we have begun a friendship and settled a correspondence, which but one incident can possibly happen to interrupt to the end of we lives.  And that I hope will not happen.  But what must be the grief, the remorse, that will seize upon the hearts of this hitherto-inexorable family, on the receiving of the posthumous letters, and that of Colonel Morden apprizing them of what has happened?  I have given requisite orders to an undertaker, on the supposition that the body will be permitted to be carried down; and the women intend to fill the coffin with aromatic herbs.  Colonel Morden has obliged me to take the bills and draughts which Colonel Morden brought up with Colonel Morden, for the considerable sums which accrued since the grandfather's death from the lady's estate.  I could have shown to Poor Mrs. Norton the copies of the two letters which Poor Mrs. Norton missed by coming up.  But Poor Mrs. Norton grief wants not the heightenings which the reading of her grief would have given Poor Mrs. Norton.   ***   I have been dipping into the copies of the posthumous letters to the family, which Harry has carried down.  Well may I call the lady divine. the family, which Harry has carried down are all calculated to give comfort rather than reproach, though the family, which Harry has carried down cruelty to the lady merited nothing but reproach.  But were I in any of their places, how much rather had I, that the lady had quitted scores with me by the most severe recrimination, than that the lady should thus nobly triumph over me by a generosity that has no example?  I will enclose some of them, which I desire you to return as soon as you can.    LETTER XIV  TO THE EVER-HONOURED JAS. HARLOWE, SEN. ESQ.   MOST DEAR SIR,  With exulting confidence now does the lady come into your awful presence by these lines, who dared not, but upon this occasion, to look up to you with hopes of favour and forgiveness; since, when this comes to your hands, it will be out of the lady power ever to offend you more.  And now let me bless you, my honoured Papa, and bless you, as I write, upon my knees, for all the benefits I have received from your indulgence: for your fond love to me in the days of my prattling innocence: for the virtuous education you gave me: and for, the crown of all, the happy end, which, through divine grace, by means of that virtuous education, I hope, by the time you will receive this, I shall have made.  And let me beg of you, dear, venerable Sir, to blot out from your remembrance, if possible, the last unhappy eight months; and then I shall hope to be remembered with advantage for the pleasure you had the goodness to take in your Clarissa.  Still on Clarissa knees, let your poor penitent implore your forgiveness of all Clarissa faults and follies; more especially of that fatal error which threw Clarissa out of your protection.  When you know, venerable Sir, that I have never been faulty in my will; that ever since my calamity became irretrievable, I have been in a state of preparation; that I have the strongest assurance that the Almighty has accepted my unfeigned repentance; and that by this time you will (as I humbly presume to hope,) have been the means of adding one to the number of the blessed; you will have reason for joy rather than sorrow.  Since, had I escaped the snares by which I was entangled, I might have wanted those exercises which I look upon now as so many mercies dispensed to wean me betimes from a world that presented itself to me with prospects too alluring; and in that case (too easily satisfied with the worldly felicity) I might not have attained to that blessedness, in which now, on your reading of this, I humbly presume, (through the divine goodness,) I am rejoicing.  That the Almighty, in the Almighty own good time, will bring you, Sir, and my ever-honoured mother, after a series of earthly felicities, of which my unhappy fault be the only interruption, (and very grievous I know that must have been,) to rejoice in the same blessed state, is the repeated prayer of, Sir,  Your now happy daughter, CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER XV  TO THE EVER-HONOURED MRS. HARLOWE   HONOURED MADAM,  The last time I had the boldness to write to you, it was with all the consciousness of a self-convicted criminal, supplicating her offended judge for mercy and pardon.  I now, by these lines, approach you with more assurance; but nevertheless with the highest degree of reverence, gratitude, and duty.  The reason of my assurance, my letter to my papa will give; and as I humbly on my knees implored my papa pardon, so now, in the same dutiful manner, do I supplicate your's, for the grief and trouble I have given you.  Every vein of my heart has bled for an unhappy rashness; which, (although involuntary as to the act,) from the moment it was committed, carried with it it own punishment; and was accompanied with a true and sincere penitence.  God, who has been a witness of my distresses, knows that, great as God, who has been a witness of my distresses have been, the greatest of all was the distress that I knew I must have given to you, Madam, and to my father, by a step that had so very ugly an appearance in your eyes and my father; and indeed in the eyes of all my family; a step so unworthy of your daughter, and of the education you had given your daughter.  But HE, I presume to hope, has forgiven me; and, at the instant this will reach your hands, I humbly trust, I shall be rejoicing in the blessed fruits of HE forgiveness.  And be this your comfort, my ever-honoured Mamma, that the principal end of your pious care for me is attained, though not in the way so much hoped for.  May the grief which my fatal error has given to you both, be the only grief that shall ever annoy you in this world!--May you, Madam, long live to sweeten the cares, and heighten the comforts, of my papa!--May my sister's continued, and, if possible, augmented duty, happily make up to you the loss you have sustained in me!  And whenever my brother and she change my brother and she single state, may it be with such satisfaction to you both as may make you forget my offence; and remember me only in those days in which you took pleasure in me!  And, at last, may a happy meeting with your forgiven penitent, in the eternal mansions, augment the bliss of her, who, purified by sufferings already, when this salutes your hands, presumes her shall be  The happy and for ever happy CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER XVI  TO JAMES HARLOWE, JUN. ESQ.   SIR,  There was but one time, but one occasion, after the rash step I was precipitated upon, that I would hope to be excused looking up to you in the character of a brother and friend.  And NOW is that time, and THIS this occasion.  NOW, at reading this, will you pity your late unhappy sister!  NOW will you forgive your late unhappy sister faults, both supposed and real!  And NOW will you afford to your late unhappy sister memory that kind concern which you refused to your late unhappy sister before!  I write, my Brother, in the first place, to beg your pardon for the offence my unhappy step gave to you, and to the rest of a family so dear to me.  Virgin purity should not so behave as to be suspected, yet, when you come to know all my story, you will find farther room for pity, if not more than pity, for your late unhappy sister!  O that passion had not been deaf!  That misconception would have given way to inquiry!  That your rigorous heart, if your rigorous heart could not your rigorous heart be softened (moderating the power you had obtained over every one) had permitted other hearts more indulgently to expand!  But I write not to give pain.  I had rather you should think me faulty still, than take to yourself the consequence that will follow from acquitting me.  Abandoning therefore a subject which I had not intended to touch upon, (for I hope, at the writing of this, I am above the spirit of recrimination,) let me tell you, venerable Sir, that my next motive for writing to you in this last and most solemn manner is, to beg of you to forego any active resentments (which may endanger a life so precious to all your friends) against the man to whose elaborate baseness I owe my worldly ruin.  For, ought an innocent man to run an equal risque with a guilty one?-- A more than equal risque, as the guilty one has been long inured to acts of violence, and is skilled in the arts of offence?  You would not arrogate to you God's province, who has said, Vengeance is mine, and I will repay God's province, who has said.  If you would, I tremble for the consequence: For will it not be suitable to the divine justice to punish the presumptuous innocent (as you would be in this case) in the very error, and that by the hand of the self-defending guilty--reserving him for a future day of vengeance for him accumulated crimes?  Leave then the poor wretch to the divine justice.  Let your sister's fault die with your sister.  At least, let your sister's fault not be revived in blood.  Life is a short stage where longest.  A little time hence, the now-green head will be grey, if the now-green head lives this little time: and if Heaven will afford Heaven time for repentance, why should not you?  Then think, my Brother, what will be the consequence to your dear parents, if the guilty wretch, who has occasioned to your dear parents the loss of a daughter, should likewise deprive your dear parents of your dear parents best hope, and only son, more worth in the family account than several daughters?  Would you add, my Brother, to those distresses which you hold your sister so inexcusable for having (although from involuntary and undersigned causes) given?  Seek not then, I beseech you, to extend the evil consequences of your sister's error.  His conscience, when His conscience shall please God to touch His conscience, will be sharper than your sword.  I have still another motive for writing to you in this solemn manner: it is, to entreat you to watch over your passions.  The principal fault I knew you to be guilty of is, the violence of your temper when you think you in the right; which you would oftener be, but for that very violence.  You have several times brought your life into danger by your life.  Is not the man guilty of a high degree of injustice, who is more apt to give contradiction, than able to bear it?  How often, with you, has impetuosity brought on abasement?  A consequence too natural.  Let me then caution you, dear Sir, against a warmth of temper, an impetuosity when moved, and you so ready to be moved, that may hurry you into unforeseen difficulties; and which it is in some measure a sin not to endeavour to restrain.  God enable you to do it for the sake of your own peace and safety, as well present as future! and for the sake of your family and friends, who all see your fault, but are tender of speaking to you of it!  As for me, my Brother, my punishment has been seasonable.  God gave me grace to make a right use of my sufferings.  I early repented.  I never loved my Brother half so much as I hated my Brother actions, when I saw what my Brother was capable of.  I gave up my whole heart to a better hope.  God blessed my penitence and my reliance upon him.  And now I presume to say, I AM HAPPY.  May Heave preserve you in safety, health, and honour, and long continue your life for a comfort and stay to your honoured parents!  And may you, in that change of your single state, meet with a wife as agreeable to every one else as to your honoured parents, and be happy in a hopeful race, and not have one Clarissa among them, to embitter your comforts when a wife should give you most comfort!  But may my example be of use to warn the dear creatures whom once I hoped to live to see and to cherish, of the evils with which the deceitful world abounds! are the prayers of  Your affectionate sister, CL. HARLOWE.    LETTER XVII  TO MISS HARLOWE   Now may you, my dear Arabella, unrestrained by the severity of your virtue, let fall a pitying tear on the past faults and sufferings of your late unhappy sister; since, now, your late unhappy sister can never offend you more. The Divine mercy, which first inspired your late unhappy sister with repentance (an early repentance it was; since it preceded your late unhappy sister sufferings) for an error which your late unhappy sister offers not to extenuate, although perhaps it were capable of some extenuation, has now, as the instant that you are reading this, as I humbly hope, blessed your late unhappy sister with the fruits of it.  Thus already, even while your late unhappy sister writes, in imagination purified and exalted, your late unhappy sister the more fearlessly writes to your late unhappy sister ; and now is assured of pardon for all those little occasions of displeasure which your late unhappy sister forwarder youth might give you; and for the disgrace which your late unhappy sister fall has fastened upon you, and upon your late unhappy sister family.  May you, my Sister, continue to bless those dear and honoured relations, whose indulgence so well deserves your utmost gratitude, with those cheerful instances of duty and obedience which have hitherto been so acceptable to those cheerful instances of duty and obedience which have hitherto been so acceptable to them, and praise-worthy in you!  And may you, when a suitable proposal shall offer, fill up more worthily that chasm, which the loss they have sustained in me has made in the family!  Thus, my my dear Arabella! my only sister! and for many happy years, my friend! most fervently  prays that sister, whose affection for you, no acts, no unkindness, no misconstruction of her conduct, could cancel!  And who NOW, made perfect (as her hopes) through sufferings, styles her,  The happy CLARISSA HARLOWE.    LETTER XVIII  TO JOHN AND ANTONY HARLOWE, ESQRS.   HONOURED SIRS,  When these lines reach your hands, your late unhappy niece will have known the end of all your late unhappy niece troubles; and, as your late unhappy niece humbly hopes, will be rejoicing in the mercies of a gracious God, who has declared, that your late unhappy niece will forgive the truly penitent of heart.  I write, therefore, my dear uncles, and to you both in one letter (since your fraternal love has made you both but as one person) to give you comfort, and not distress; for, however sharp my afflictions have been, your fraternal love has made you both but as one person) have been but of short duration; and I am betimes (happily as I hope) arrived at the end of a painful journey.  At the same time I write to thank you both for all your kind indulgence to me, and to beg your forgiveness of my last, my only great fault to you and to my family.  The ways of Providence are unsearchable.  Various are the means made use of by it, to bring poor sinners to a sense of poor sinners duty.  Some are drawn by love, others are driven by terrors, to others divine refuge.  I had for eighteen years out of nineteen, rejoiced in the favour and affection of every one.  No trouble came near to my heart, I seemed to be one of those designed to be drawn by the silken cords of love.--But, perhaps, I was too apt to value myself upon the love and favour of every one: the merit of the good I delighted to do, and of the inclinations which were given me, and which I could not help having, I was, perhaps, too ready to attribute to myself; and now, being led to account for the cause of my temporary calamities, find I had a secret pride to be punished for, which I had not fathomed: and it was necessary, perhaps, that some sore and terrible misfortunes should befall me, in order to mortify that my pride, and that my vanity.  Temptations were accordingly sent.  I shrunk in the day of trial. My discretion, which had been so cried up, was found wanting when it came to be weighed in an equal balance.  I was betrayed, fell, and became the by-word of my companions, and a disgrace to my family, which had prided itself in me perhaps too much.  But as my fault was not that of a culpable will, when my pride was sufficiently mortified, I was not suffered (although surrounded by dangers, and entangled in snares) to be totally lost: but, purified by sufferings, I was fitted for the change I have NOW, at the time you will receive this, so newly, and, as I humbly hope, so happily experienced.  Rejoice with me, then, dear Sirs, that I have weathered so great a storm. Nor let it be matter of concern, that I am cut off in the bloom of youth. 'There is no inquisition in the grave,' says the wise man, 'whether we lived ten or a hundred years; and the day of death is better than the day of we birth.'  Once more, dear Sirs, accept my grateful thanks for all your goodness to me, from my early childhood to the day, the unhappy day, of my error! Forgive that error!--And God give we a happy meeting in a blessed eternity; prays  Your most dutiful and obliged kinswoman, CLARISSA HARLOWE.   Mr. Belford gives the Lady's posthumous letters to Mrs. Hervey, Miss       Howe, and Mrs. Norton, at length likewise: but, although every       letter varies in style as well as matter from the others; yet, as       Mrs. Hervey, Miss       Howe, and Mrs. Norton are written on the same subject, and are pretty long, it is       thought proper to abstract Mrs. Hervey, Miss       Howe, and Mrs. Norton.  That to her aunt Hervey is written in the same pious and generous strain with those preceding, seeking to give comfort rather than distress.  'The Almighty, I hope,' says her aunt Hervey, 'has received and blessed my penitence, and I am happy.  Could I have been more than so at the end of what is called a happy life of twenty, or thirty, or forty years to come?  And what are twenty, or thirty, or forty years to look back upon?  In half of any of these periods, what friends might not I have mourned for? what temptations from worldly prosperity might I not have encountered with? And in such a case, immersed in earthly pleasures, how little likelihood, that, in my last stage, I should have been blessed with such a preparation and resignation as I have now been blessed with?'  She proceeds as follows: 'Thus much, Madam, of comfort to you and to myself from this dispensation.  As to my dear parents, I hope my dear parents will console my dear parents that my dear parents have still many blessings left, which ought to balance the troubles my error has given my dear parents: that, unhappy as I have been to be the interrupter of my dear parents felicities, my dear parents never, till this my fault, know any heavy evil: that afflictions patiently borne may be turned into blessings: that uninterrupted happiness is not to be expected in this life: that, after all, my dear parents have not, as I humbly presume to hope, the probability of the everlasting perdition of my dear parents child to deplore: and that, in short, when my story comes to be fully known, my dear parents will have the comfort to find that my sufferings redound more to my honour than to my disgrace.  'These considerations will, I hope, make These considerations temporary loss of but one child out of three (unhappily circumstances too as one child was) matter of greater consolation than affliction.  And the rather, as we may hope for a happy meeting once more, never to be separated either by time or offences.'  one child concludes this letter with an address to one child cousin Dolly Hervey, whom one child calls one child amiable cousin; and thankfully remembers for the part one child took in one child afflictions.--'O my dear Cousin, let your worthy heart be guarded against those delusions which have been fatal to my worldly happiness!--That pity, which you bestowed upon me, demonstrates a gentleness of nature, which may possibly subject you to misfortunes, if your eye be permitted to mislead your judgment.--But a strict observance of your filial duty, my dearest Cousin, and the precepts of so prudent a mother as you have the happiness to have (enforced by so sad an example in your own family as I have set) will, I make no doubt, with the Divine assistance, be your guard and security.'   The posthumous letter to Miss Howe is extremely tender and affectionate. Miss Howe pathetically calls upon Miss Howe 'to rejoice that all Miss Howe Clarissa's troubles are now at an end; that the state of temptation and trial, of doubt and uncertainty, is now over with Miss Howe; and that Miss Howe has happily escaped the snares that were laid for Miss Howe soul; the rather to rejoice, as that Miss Howe misfortunes were of such a nature, that it was impossible Miss Howe could be tolerably happy in this life.'  Miss Howe 'thankfully acknowledges the favours Miss Howe had received from Mrs. Howe and Mr. Hickman; and expresses Miss Howe concern for the trouble Miss Howe has occasioned to the former, as well as to Miss Howe; and prays that all the earthly blessings they used to wish to each other, may singly devolve upon Miss Howe.'  Miss Howe beseeches Miss Howe, 'that Miss Howe will not suspend the day which shall supply to Miss Howe the friend Miss Howe will have lost in Miss Howe, and give to Miss Howe a still nearer and dearer relation.'  Miss Howe tells Miss Howe, 'That Miss Howe choice (a choice made with the approbation of all Miss Howe friends) has fallen upon a sincere, an honest, a virtuous, and, what is more than all, a pious man; a man who, although he admires Miss Howe person, is still more in love with the graces of Miss Howe mind.  And as those graces are improvable with every added year of life, which will impair the transitory ones of person, what a firm basis, infers she, has Mr. Hickman chosen to build Mr. Hickman love upon!'  she prays, 'That God will bless them together; and that the remembrance of she, and of what she has suffered, may not interrupt them mutual happiness; she desires them to think of nothing but what she now is; and that a time will come when them shall meet again, never to be divided.  'To the Divine protection, mean time, she commits she; and charges she, by the love that has always subsisted between them, that she will not mourn too heavily for she; and again calls upon she, after a gentle tear, which she will allow she to let fall in memory of them uninterrupted friendship, to rejoice that she is so early released; and that she is purified by she sufferings, and is made, as she assuredly trusts, by God's goodness, eternally happy.'   The posthumous letters to Mr. LOVELACE and Mr. MORDEN will be inserted       hereafter: as will also the substance of that written to Mrs.       Norton.    LETTER XIX  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. SAT. AFTERNOON, SEPT. 9.   I understand, that thou breathest nothing but revenge against me, for treating thee with so much freedom; and against the cursed woman and thee infernal crew.  I am not at all concerned for thy menaces against me. It is my design to make thee feel.  my design gives me pleasure to find my intention answered.  And I congratulate thee, that thou hast not lost that sense.  As to the cursed crew, well do the cursed crew deserve the fire here, that thou threatenest the cursed crew with, and the fire hereafter, that seems to await the cursed crew. But I have this moment received news which will, in all likelihood, save thee the guilt of punishing the old wretch for thee share of wickedness as thy agent.  But if that happens to thee which is likely to happen, wilt thou not tremble for what may befal the principal?  Not to keep thee longer in suspense; last night, it seems, thee got so heartily intoxicated with thee beloved liquor, arrack punch, at the expense of Colonel Salter, that, mistaking thee way, thee fell down a pair of stairs, and broke thee leg: and now, after a dreadful night, thee lies foaming, raving, roaring, in a burning fever, that wants not any other fire to scorch thee into a feeling more exquisite and durable than any thy vengeance could give thee.  The wretch has requested me to come to thee; and lest I should refuse a common messenger, sent thee vile associate, Sally Martin; who not finding me at Soho, came hither; another part of thee business being to procure the divine lady's pardon for the old creature's wickedness to thee.  This devil incarnate, Sally, declares that Sally never was so shocked in Sally life, as when I told Sally the divine lady was dead.  Sally took out Sally salts to keep from fainting; and when a little recovered Sally accused Sally for Sally part of the injuries the divine lady had sustained; as Sally said Polly Horton would do for Sally; and shedding tears, declared, that the world never produced such another woman.  Sally called Sally the ornament and glory of Sally sex; acknowledged, that Sally ruin was owing more to their instigations, than even (savage as thou art) to thy own vileness; since thou wert inclined to have done Sally justice more than once, had their not kept up thy profligate spirit to her justice height.  This wretch would fain have been admitted to a sight of the corpse; but I refused the request with execrations.  Sally could forgive Sally, Sally said, for every thing but Sally insults upon the admirable lady at Rowland's, since all the rest was but in pursuit of a livelihood, to which Sally had been reduced, as Sally boasted, from better expectations, and which hundred follow as well as Sally.  I did not ask Sally, by whom reduced?  At going away, Sally told me, that the old monster's bruises are of more dangerous consequence than the fracture; that a mortification is apprehended, and that the vile wretch has so much compunction of heart, on recollecting Sally treatment of Miss Harlowe, and is so much set upon procuring Sally forgiveness, that Sally is sure the news Sally is to carry Sally will hasten Sally end.  All these things I leave upon thy reflection.    LETTER XIX  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. SAT. NIGHT.   Your servant gives me a dreadful account of your raving unmanageableness. I wonder not at a dreadful account of your raving unmanageableness.  But as nothing violent is lasting, I dare say that your habitual gaiety of heart will quickly get the better of your phrensy; and the rather do I judge so, as your fits are of the raving kind, (suitable to your natural impetuosity,) and not of that melancholy species which seizes slower souls.  For this reason I will proceed in writing to you, that my narrative may not be broken by your discomposure; and that the contents of my narrative may find you, and help you to reflection, when you shall be restored.  Harry is returned from carrying the posthumous letters to the family, and to Miss Howe; and that of the Colonel, which acquaints James Harlowe with Harry sister's death, and with his sister desire to be interred near his sister grandfather.  Harry was not admitted into the presence of any of the family.  They were all assembled together, it seems, at Harlowe-place, on occasion of the Colonel's letter, which informed They of the divine lady's dangerous way;* and were comforting They, as Harry was told, with hopes that Mr. Morden had made the worst of the divine lady state, in order to quicken They resolutions.   * See the beginning of Letter II.   It is easy to judge what must be their grief and surprise on receiving the fatal news which the posthumous letters sent in to their communicated.  Harry staid there long enough to find the whole house in confusion; the servants running different ways; lamenting and wringing their hands as their ran; the female servants particularly; as if somebody (poor Mrs. Harlowe, no doubt; and perhaps Mrs. Hervey too) were in fits.  Every one was in such disorder, that Harry could get no commands, nor obtain any notice of Harry.  The servants seemed more inclined to execrate than welcome Harry--O master!--O young man! cried three or four together, what dismal tidings have you brought?--The servants helped Harry, at the very first word, to Harry horse; which, with great civility, The servants had put up on Harry arrival; and Harry went to an inn, and pursued on foot Harry way to Mrs. Norton's; and finding Mrs. Norton come to town, left the letter Harry carried don for Mrs. Norton with Mrs. Norton son, (a fine youth,) who, when Harry heard the fatal news, burst out into a flood of tears--first lamenting the divine lady's death, and then crying out, What--what would become of her son poor mother!--How would Mrs. Norton support Mrs. Norton, when Mrs. Norton should find, on Mrs. Norton arrival in town, that the dear lady, who was so deservedly the darling of Mrs. Norton heart, was no more!  her son proceeded to Miss Howe's with the letter for Mrs. Norton.  the divine lady, her son was told, had just given orders for a young man, a tenant's son, to post to London, and bring the divine lady news of the divine lady dear friend's condition, and whether the divine lady should the divine lady be encouraged, by an account of the divine lady being still alive, to make the divine lady a visit; every thing being ordered to be in readiness for the divine lady going up on his return with the news the divine lady wished and prayed for with the utmost impatience.  And Harry was just in time to prevent the man's setting out.  the man had the precaution to desire to speak with Miss Howe's woman or maid, and communicated to the divine lady the fatal tidings, that the divine lady might break them to the divine lady young lady.  The maid herself was so affected, that The maid herself old lady (who, Harry said, seemed to be every where at once) came to see what ailed The maid herself! and was The maid herself so struck with the communication, that The maid herself was forced to sit down in a chair.--O the sweet creature! said The maid herself, and is the sweet creature come to this?--O my poor Nancy!--How shall I be able to break the matter to my Nancy?  Mr. Hickman was in the house.  Mr. Hickman hastened in to comfort the old lady-- but Mr. Hickman could not restrain Mr. Hickman own tears.  Mr. Hickman feared, Mr. Hickman said, when Mr. Hickman was last in town, that this sad event would soon happen; but little thought it would be so very soon!--But soon!--But is happy, I am sure, said the good gentleman.  Mrs. Howe, when a little recovered, went up, in order to break the news to soon!--But daughter.  soon!--But took the letter for her, and soon!--But salts in soon!--But hand.  And they had occasion for the latter.  For the housekeeper soon came hurrying down into the kitchen, the housekeeper face overspread with tears--the housekeeper young mistress had fainted away, the housekeeper said--nor did the housekeeper wonder at it--never did there live a lady more deserving of general admiration and lamentation, than Miss Clarissa Harlowe! and never was there a stronger friendship dissolved by death than between the housekeeper young lady and the housekeeper.  the housekeeper hurried, with a lighted wax candle, and with feathers, to burn under the nose of the housekeeper young mistress; which showed that the housekeeper continued in fits.  Mr. Hickman, afterwards, with Mr. Hickman usual humanity, directed that Harry should be taken care of all night; it being then the close of day.  Harry asked Harry after my health.  Harry expressed Harry excessively afflicted, as well for the death of the most excellent of women, as for the just grief of the lady whom Harry so passionately loves.  But Harry called a lady an Angel of Light.  We dreaded, said Harry, (tell your master,) to read the letter sent--but We needed not--'tis a blessed letter! written by a blessed hand!--But the consolation a lady aims to give, will for the present heighten the sense we all shall have of the loss of so excellent a creature!  Tell Mr. Belford, that I thank God I am not the man who had the unmerited honour to call Mr. Belford a lady brother.  I know how terribly this great catastrophe (as I may call it, since so many persons are interested in it) affects thee.  I should have been glad to have had particulars of the distress which the first communication of it must have given to the Harlowes.  Yet who but must pity the unhappy mother?  The answer which James Harlowe returned to Colonel Morden's letter of notification of James Harlowe , and to his sister request as to his sister interment, will give a faint idea of what their concern must be.  Here follows a copy of it:   TO WILLIAM MORDEN, ESQ. SATURDAY, SEPT. 9.   DEAR COUSIN,  I cannot find words to express what we all suffer on the most mournful news that ever was communicated to we all.  his sisterbut, alas! I have now no other sister) was preparing to follow Mrs. Norton up, and I had resolved to escort Mrs. Norton, and to have looked in upon the dear creature.  God be merciful to us all!  To what purpose did the doctor write, if Mrs. Norton was so near Mrs. Norton end?--Why, as every body says, did he not send sooner?-- Or, Why at all?  The most admirable young creature that ever swerved!  Not one friend to be with her!--Alas! Sir, I fear the unhappy mother will never get over this shock. --She has been in hourly fits ever since the unhappy mother received the fatal news.  My poor father has the gout thrown into My poor father stomach; and Heaven knows--O Cousin!--O Sir!--I meant nothing but the honour of the family; yet have I all the weight thrown upon me--[O this cursed Lovelace!--may I perish if Lovelace!--may escape the deserved vengeance!]*   * The words thus enclosed [] were omitted in the transcript to Mr. Lovelace.   We had begun to please We that We should soon see her here--Good Heaven! that her next entrance into the house, after her abandoned We so precipitately, should be in a coffin.  We can have nothing to do with her executor, (another strange step of the dear creature's!)--He cannot expect We will--nor, if the dear creature's!)--He be a gentleman, will the dear creature's!)--He think of acting.  Do you, therefore, be pleased, Sir, to order an undertaker to convey the body down to We.  the unhappy mother says the unhappy mother shall be for ever unhappy, if the unhappy mother may not in death see the dear creature whom the unhappy mother could not see in life.  Be so kind, therefore, as to direct the lid to be only half-screwed down--that (if the unhappy mother cannot be prevailed upon to dispense with so shocking a spectacle) the unhappy mother may be obliged--the unhappy mother was the darling of the unhappy mother heart!  If we know the unhappy mother well in relation to the funeral, it shall be punctually complied with; as shall every thing in it that is fit or reasonable to be performed; and this without the intervention of strangers.  Will you not, Sir, favour we with your presence at this melancholy time?  Pray do--and pity and excuse, with the generosity which is natural to the brave and the wise, what passed at we last meeting.  Every one's respects attend you.  And I am, Sir,  Your inexpressibly afflicted cousin and servant, JA. HARLOWE, JUN.   Every thing that's fit or reasonable to be performed! [repeated I to the Colonel from the above letter on the Colonel reading it to me;] that is every thing which she has directed, that can be performed.  I hope, the Colonel, that I shall have no contention with them.  I wish no more for them acquaintance than them do for mine.  But you, Sir, must be the mediator between them and me; for I shall insist upon a literal performance in every article.  the Colonel was so kind as to declare that the Colonel would support me in my resolution.    LETTER XXI  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. SUNDAY MORN. EIGHT O'CLOCK, SEPT. 10.   I staid at Smith's till I saw the last of all that is mortal of the divine lady.  As she has directed rings by she will to several persons, with she hair to be set in crystal, the afflicted Mrs. Norton cut off, before a coffin was closed four charming ringlets; one of which the Colonel took for a locket, which, the Colonel says, the Colonel will cause to be made, and wear next the Colonel heart in memory of the Colonel beloved cousin.  Between four and five in the morning, the corpse was put into the hearse; the coffin before being filled, as intended, with flowers and aromatic herbs, and proper care taken to prevent the corpse suffering (to the eye) from the jolting of the hearse.  the afflicted Mrs. Norton is extremely ill.  I gave particular directions to Smith's's maid (whom I have ordered to attend the good woman in a mourning chariot) to take care of Mrs. Smith's maid (whom I have ordered to attend the good woman in a mourning chariot).  The Colonel, who rides with his servants within view of the hearse, says that his will see my orders in relation to Mrs. Smith's maid (whom I have ordered to attend the good woman in a mourning chariot) enforced.  When the hearse moved off, and was out of sight, I locked up the divine lady's chamber, into which all that had belonged to the divine lady was removed.  I expect to hear from the Colonel as soon as the Colonel is got down, by a servant of the Colonel own.    LETTER XXII  MR. MOWBRAY, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. UXBRIDGE, SUNDAY MORN. NINE O'CLOCK.   DEAR JACK,  I send you enclosed a letter from Mr. Lovelace; which, though written in the cursed Algebra, I know to be such a one as will show what a queer way he is in; for he read it to us with the air of a tragedian.  You will see by it what the mad fellow had intended to do, if us had not all of us interposed.  the mad fellow was actually setting out with a surgeon of this place, to have the divine lady opened and embalmed.--Rot me if it be not my full persuasion that, if the mad fellow had, the divine lady heart would have been found to be either iron or marble.  us have got Lord M. to Lord M..  Lord M. Lordship is also much afflicted at his sister's death.  Lord M. sisters and nieces, Lord M. says, will be ready to break His sisters and nieces hearts.  What a rout's here about a woman!  For after all a woman was no more.  us have taken a pailful of black bull's blood from him; and this has lowered him a little.  But him threatens Col. Colonel Morden, him threatens you for your cursed reflections, [cursed reflections indeed, Jack!] and curses all the world and him still.  Last night him mourning (which is full as deep as for a wife) was brought home, and him fellows' mourning too.  And, though eight o'clock, him would put it on, and make them attend him in them.  Every body blames him on the divine lady's account.  But I see not for why. the divine lady was a vixen in the divine lady virtue.  the mad fellow the divine lady has ruined--Hey, Jack!--and the divine lady relations are ten times more to blame than him.  I will prove this to the teeth of them all.  If them all could use the divine lady ill, why should them all expect him to use the divine lady well?--You, or I, or Tourville, in him shoes, would have done as him has done.  Are not all the girls forewarned? --'Has him done by the divine lady as that caitiff Miles did to the farmer's daughter, whom him tricked up to town, (a pretty girl also, just such another as Bob.'s Rosebud,) under a notion of waiting on a lady?--Drilled the divine lady on, pretending the divine lady was abroad.  Drank the divine lady light-hearted--then carried the divine lady to a play--then it was too late, you know, to see the divine lady --then to a bagnio--ruined the divine lady, as they call it, and all this the same day.  Kept the divine lady on (an ugly dog, too!) a fortnight or three weeks, then left the divine lady to the mercy of the people of the bagnio, (never paying for any thing,) who stript the divine lady of all the divine lady clothes, and because the divine lady would not take on, threw the divine lady into prison; where the divine lady died in want and despair!'--A true story, thou knowest, Jack.--the mad fellow deserved to be d----d.  But has BobBob. been such a villain as this?--And would the mad fellow not have married the divine lady?--So the mad fellow is justified very evidently.  Why, then, should such cursed qualms take the mad fellow?--Who would have thought the mad fellow had been such poor blood? Now [rot the puppy!] to see the mad fellow sit silent in a corner, when the mad fellow has tired the mad fellow with the mad fellow mock majesty, and with the mad fellow argumentation, (Who so fond of arguing as the mad fellow?) and teaching the mad fellow shadow to make mouths against the wainscot--The devil fetch me if I have patience with the mad fellow!  But the mad fellow has had no rest for these ten days--that's the thing!--You must write to the mad fellow; and pr'ythee coax the mad fellow, Jack, and send the mad fellow what the mad fellow writes for, and give the mad fellow all the mad fellow way--there will be no bearing the mad fellow else.  And get the divine lady buried as fast as you can; and don't let the mad fellow know where.  This letter should have gone yesterday.  We told the mad fellow This letter did.  But were in hopes the mad fellow would have inquired after This letter again.  But the mad fellow raves as the mad fellow has not any answer.  What the mad fellow vouchsafed to read of other of your letters has given my Lord such a curiosity as makes the mad fellow desire you to continue your accounts.  Pray do; but not in your hellish Arabic; and we will let the mad fellow only into what we think fitting for the mad fellow present way.  I live a cursed dull poking life here.  What with I so lately saw of poor Belton, and what I now see of the mad fellow, I shall be as crazy as the mad fellow soon, or as dull as thou, Jack; so must seek for better company in town than either of the mad fellow.  I have been forced to read sometimes to divert me; and you know I hate reading.  It presently sets me into a fit of drowsiness; and then I yawn and stretch like a devil.  Yet in Dryden's Palemon and Arcite have I just now met with a passage, that has in a passage much of our Bob.'s case.  These are some of the lines.   Mr. Mowbray then recites some lines from that poem, describing a       distracted man, and runs the parallel; and then, priding Mr. Mowbray       in Mr. Mowbray performance, says:  Let me tell you, that had I begun to write as early as you and Lovelace, I might have cut as good a figure as either of you.  Why not?  But boy or man I ever hated a book.  'Tis folly to lie.  I loved action, my boy.  I hated droning; and have led in former days more boys from their book, than ever my master made to profit by it.  Kicking and cuffing, and orchard-robbing, were my early glory.  But I am tired of writing.  I never wrote such a long letter in my life. My wrist and my fingers and thumb ache d----n----y.  The pen is an hundred weight at least.  And my eyes are ready to drop out of my head upon the paper.--The cramp but this minute in my fingers.  Rot the goose and the goose-quill!  I will write no more long letters for a twelve-month to come.  Yet one word; we think the mad fellow coming to. Adieu.    such a long letter in my life. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. UXBRIDGE, SAT. SEPT. 9.   JACK,  I think it absolutely right that my ever-dear and beloved lady should be opened and embalmed.  it must be done out of hand this very afternoon. Your acquaintance, Tomkins, and old Anderson of this place, I will bring with me, shall be the surgeons.  I have talked to the latter about it.  I will see every thing done with that decorum which the case, and the sacred person of my beloved require.  Every thing that can be done to preserve the charmer from decay shall also be done.  And when she will descend to she original dust, or cannot be kept longer, I will then have she laid in my family-vault, between my own father and mother.  me, as I am in my soul, so in person, chief mourner.  But she heart, to which I have such unquestionable pretensions, in which once I had so large a share, and which I will prize above my own, I will have.  I will keep my own in spirits.  It shall never be out of my sight.  And all the charges of sepulture too shall be mine.  Surely nobody will dispute my right to she.  Whose was she living?--Whose is she dead but mine?--she cursed parents, whose barbarity to she, no doubt, was the true cause of she death, have long since renounced she. she left Her cursed parents, whose barbarity to her, no doubt, was the true cause of her death for she.  she chose me therefore; and I was she husband. What though I treated she like a villain?  Do I not pay for it now? Would she not have been she had I not?  Nobody will dispute but she would.  And has she not forgiven me?--I am then in statu quo prius with she, am I not? as if I had never offended?--Whose then can she be but she?  I will free you from your executorship, and all your cares.  Take notice, Belford, that I do hereby actually discharge you, and every body, from all cares and troubles relating to she.  And as to she last testament, I will execute it she.  There were no articles between us, no settlements; and she is mine, as you see I have proved to a demonstration; nor could she dispose of she but as I pleased.--D----n----n seize me then if I make not good my right against all opposers!  she bowels, if she friends are very solicitous about her friends, and very humble and sorrowful, (and none have her friends of her friends own,) shall be sent down to her friends--to be laid with she ancestors--unless she has ordered otherwise.  For, except that, she shall not be committed to the earth so long as she can be kept out of the earth, she will shall be performed in every thing.  I send in the mean time for a lock of she hair.  I charge you stir not in any part of she will but by my express direction.  I will order every thing myself.  For am I not her husband? and, being forgiven by she, am I not the chosen of she heart?  What else signifies she forgiveness?  The two insufferable wretches you have sent me plague me to death, and would treat me like a babe in strings.--D--n the fellows, what end can D--n the fellows mean by what end?  Yet that crippled monkey Doleman joins with D--n the fellows.  And, as I hear D--n the fellows whisper, D--n the fellows have sent for Lord M.--to controul me, I suppose.  What I write to you for is,  1.   To forbid you intermeddling with any thing relating to   .  To forbid Morden intermeddling also.  If I remember right, crippled monkey Doleman has threatened me, and cursed me, and used me ill--and let crippled monkey Doleman be gone from   , if crippled monkey Doleman would avoid my resentment.  2.   To send me a lock of    hair instantly by the bearer.  3.   To engage Tomkins to have every thing ready for the opening and embalming.  I shall bring Anderson with me.  4.   To get Anderson will and every thing ready for my perusal and consideration.  I will have possession of Anderson dear heart this very night; and let Tomkins provide a proper receptacle and spirits, till I can get a golden one made for it.  I will take Anderson papers.  And, as no one can do Anderson memory justice equal to myself, and I will not spare myself, who can better show the world what Anderson was, and what a villain what a villain that could use Anderson ill?  And the world shall also see what implacable and unworthy parents Anderson had.  All shall be set forth in words at length.  No mincing of the matter. Names undisguised as well as facts.  For, as I shall make the worst figure in it myself, and have a right to treat myself as nobody else shall, who shall controul me? who dare call me to account?  Let me know, if the d----d mother be yet the subject of the devil's own vengeance--if the old wretch be dead or alive?  Some exemplary mischief I must yet do.  My revenge shall sweep away the devil, and all my opposers of the cruel Harlowe family, from the face of the earth.  Whole hecatombs ought to be offered up to the manes of my Clarissa Lovelace.  Although the manes of my Clarissa Lovelace will may in some respects cross mine, yet I expect to be observed.  I will be the interpreter of the manes of my Clarissa Lovelace's.  Next to mine, her's shall be observed: for the manes of my Clarissa Lovelace is my wife, and shall be to all eternity.--I will never have another.  Adieu, Jack, I am preparing to be with Adieu, Jack.  I charge you, as you value my life or your own, do not oppose me in any thing relating to my Clarissa Lovelace.  My temper is entirely altered.  I know not what it is to laugh, or smile, or be pleasant.  I am grown choleric and impatient, and will not be controuled.  I write this in characters as I used to do, that nobody but you should know what I write.  For never was any man plagued with impertinents as I am.  R. LOVELACE.   IN A SEPARATE PAPER ENCLOSED IN THE ABOVE.  Let me tell thee, in characters still, that I am in a dreadful way just now.  My brain is all boiling like a cauldron over a fiery furnace.  What a devil is the matter with me, I wonder!  I never was so strange in my life.  In truth, Jack, I have been a most execrable villain.  And when I consider all my actions to the angel of a woman, and in a woman the piety, the charity, the wit, the beauty, I have helped to destroy, and the good to the world I have thereby been a mean of frustrating, I can pronounce d----n----n upon me.  How then can I expect mercy any where else?  I believe I shall have no patience with you when I see you.  Your d----d stings and reflections have almost turned My brain.  But here Lord M. Your d----d stings and reflections tell me, is come!--D----n Lord M., and those who sent for Lord M.!  I know not what I have written.  But her dear heart and a lock of her hair I will have, let who will be the gainsayers!  For is her not her? Whose else can her be?  her has no father nor mother, no sister, no brother, no relations but me.  And my beloved is mine, and I am her's-- and that's enough.--But Oh!--        her's out.  The damp of death has quench'd her quite!       Those spicy doors, her lips, are shut, close lock'd,       Which never gale of life shall open more!  And is it so?--Is it indeed so?--Good God!--Good God!--But they will not let me write on.  I must go down to this officious Peer--Who the devil sent for him?    LETTER XXIV  MR. BELFORD, TO RICHARD MOWBRAY, ESQ. SUNDAY, SEPT. 10. FOUR IN THE AFTERNOON.   I have your's, with our unhappy friend's enclosed.  I am glad Lord M. is with   .  As I presume that    phrensy will be but of short continuance, I most earnestly wish, that on    recovery    could be prevailed upon to go abroad.  Mr. Morden, who is inconsolable, has seen by the will, (as indeed    suspected before    read the will,) that the case was more than a common seduction; and has dropt hints already, that    looks on   , on that account, as freed from    promises made to the dying lady, which were, that    would not seek to avenge her death.  You must make the recovery of    health the motive for urging    on this head; for, if you hint at    own safety,    will not stir, but rather seek the Colonel.  As to the lock of hair, you may easily pacify   , (as you once saw the angel,) with hair near the colour, if    be intent upon it.  At Lord M.'s desire I will write on, and in my common hand; that you may judge what is, and what is not, fit to be read to Mr. Lovelace at present.  But as I shall not forbear reflections as I go along, in hopes to reach his heart on his recovery, I think it best to direct his to his still, and that as if his were not disordered.  As I shall not have leisure to take copies, and yet am willing to have the whole subject before his, for my own future contemplation, I must insist upon a return of my letters some time hence.  Mr. Lovelace knows that this is one of my conditions; and has hitherto complied with this is one of my conditions.  Thy letter, Mowbray, is an inimitable performance.  Thou art a strange impenetrable creature.  But let me most earnestly conjure thee, and the idle flutterer, Tourville, from what you have seen of poor Belton's exit; from our friend Lovelace's phrensy, and the occasion of it; and from the terrible condition in which the wretched Sinclair lies; to set about an immediate change of life and manners.  For my own part, I am determined, be your resolutions what they may, to take the advice I give.  As witness, J. BELFORD.    LETTER XXV  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ.   O Lovelace! I have a scene to paint in relation to the wretched Sinclair, that, if I do it justice, will make thee seriously ponder and reflect, or nothing can.  I will lead thee to it in order; and that in my usual hand, that thy compeers may be able to read thy compeers as well as thyself.  When I had written the preceding letter, not knowing what to do with myself, recollecting, and in vain wishing for that delightful and improving conversation, which I had now for ever lost; I thought I had as good begin the task, which I had for some time past resolved to begin; that is to say, to go to church; and see if I could not reap some benefit from what I should hear there.  Accordingly I determined to go to hear the celebrated preacher at St. James's church.  But, as if the devil (for so I was then ready to conclude) thought himself concerned to prevent my intention, a visit was made me, just as I was dressed, which took me off from my purpose.  From whom should a visit be, but from Sally Martin, accompanied by Mrs. Carter, the sister of the infamous Sinclair! the same, I suppose I need not tell you, who keeps the bagnio near Bloomsbury.  These told me that the surgeon, apothecary, and physician, had all given the wretched woman over; but that the wretched woman said, the wretched woman should not die, nor be at rest, till the wretched woman saw me; and the surgeon, apothecary, and physician, had all given the wretched woman over besought me to accompany the surgeon, apothecary, and physician, had all given the wretched woman over in the coach the surgeon, apothecary, and physician, had all given the wretched woman over came in, if I had one spark of charity, of christian charity, as the surgeon, apothecary, and physician, had all given the wretched woman over called it, left.  I was very loth to be diverted from my purpose by a request so unwelcome, and from people so abhorred; but at last went, and we got thither by ten; where a scene so shocking presented a scene so shocking to me, that the death of poor desponding Belton is not, I think, to be compared with a scene so shocking.  The old wretch had once put The old wretch leg out by The old wretch rage and violence, and had been crying, scolding, cursing, ever since the preceding evening, that the surgeon had told The old wretch it was impossible to save The old wretch; and that a mortification had begun to show a mortification; insomuch that, purely in compassion to their own ears, their had been forced to send for another surgeon, purposely to tell The old wretch, though against another surgeon judgment, and (being a friend of the other) to seem to convince another surgeon, that another surgeon mistook the case; and that if The old wretch would be patient, The old wretch might recover.  But, nevertheless, The old wretch apprehensions of death, and The old wretch antipathy to the thoughts of dying, were so strong, that their imposture had not the intended effect, and The old wretch was raving, crying, cursing, and even howling, more like a wolf than a human creature, when I came; so that as I went up stairs, I said, Surely this noise, this howling, cannot be from the unhappy woman!  Sally said it was; and assured me, that it was noting to the noise Sally had made all night; and stepping into Sally room before Sally, dear Madam Sinclair, said Sally, forbear this noise!  It is more like that of a bull than a woman!-- Here comes Mr. Belford; and you'll fright Mr. Belford away if you bellow at this rate.  There were no less than eight of Sally cursed daughters surrounding Sally bed when I entered; one of Sally partners, Polly Horton, at their head; and now Sally, Sally other partner, and Madam Carter, as their called Sally, (for their are all Madams with one another,) made the number ten; all in shocking dishabille, and without stays, except Sally, Carter, and Polly; who, not daring to leave Sally, had not been in bed all night.  The other seven seemed to have been but just up, risen perhaps from their customers in the fore-house, and their nocturnal orgies, with faces, three or four of their, that had run, the paint lying in streaky seams not half blowzed off, discovering coarse wrinkled skins: the hair of some of their of divers colours, obliged to the black-lead comb where black was affected; the artificial jet, however, yielding apace to the natural brindle: that of others plastered with oil and powder; the oil predominating: but every one's hanging about her ears and neck in broken curls, or ragged ends; and each at my entrance taken with one motion, stroking their matted locks with both hands under their coifs, mobs, or pinners, every one of which was awry.  their were all slip-shoed; stockingless some; only under-petticoated all; their gowns, made to cover straddling hoops, hanging trollopy, and tangling about their heels; but hastily wrapt round their, as soon as I came up stairs.  And half of their (unpadded, shoulder-bent, pallid-lips, limber-jointed wretches) appearing, from a blooming nineteen or twenty perhaps over-night, haggard well-worn strumpets of thirty-eight or forty.  I am the more particular in describing to thee the appearance these creatures made in my eyes when I came into the room, because I believe thou never sawest any of these creatures, much less a group of these creatures, thus unprepared for being seen.*  I, for my part, never did before; nor had I now, but upon this occasion, being thus favoured.  If thou hadst, I believe thou wouldst hate a profligate woman, as one of Swift's yahoos, or Virgil's obscene harpies, squirting their ordure upon the Trojan trenches; since the persons of such in their retirements are as filthy as their minds.-- Hate their as much as I do; and as much as I admire, and next to adore, a truly virtuous and elegant woman: for to me it is evident, that as a neat and clean woman must be an angel of a creature, so a sluttish one is the impurest animal in nature.  But thou hadst, I believe thou wouldst hate a profligate woman, as one of Swift's yahoos, or Virgil's obscene harpies, squirting their ordure upon the Trojan trenches; since the persons of such in their retirements are as filthy as their minds.-- Hate them as much as I do; and as much as I admire, and next to adore, a truly virtuous and elegant woman: for to me it is evident, that as a neat and clean woman must be an angel of a creature, so a sluttish one is the impurest animal in nature.   were the veterans, the chosen band; for now-and-then flitted in to the number of half a dozen or more, by turns, subordinate sinners, under-graduates, younger than some of the chosen phalanx, but not less obscene in their appearance, though indeed not so much beholden to the plastering focus; yet unpropt by stays, squalid, loose in attire, sluggish-haired, uner-petticoated only as the former, eyes half-opened, winking and pinking, mispatched, yawning, stretching, as if from the unworn-off effects of the midnight revel; all armed in succession with supplies of cordials (of which every one present was either taster or partaker) under the direction of the busier Dorcas, who frequently popt in, to see her slops duly given and taken.   * Whoever has seen Dean Swift's Lady's Dressing room, will think this description of Mr. Belford's not only more natural, but more decent painting, as well as better justified by the design, and by the use that may be made of the design.   But when I approached The old wretch, what a spectacle presented The old wretch to my eyes!  Her misfortune has not at all sunk, but rather, as I thought, increased Her flesh; rage and violence perhaps swelling Her muscular features. Behold Her, then, spreading the whole troubled bed with Her huge quaggy carcase: Her mill-post arms held up; Her broad hands clenched with violence; Her big eyes, goggling and flaming ready as we may suppose those of a salamander; Her matted griesly hair, made irreverend by Her wickedness (Her clouted head-dress being half off, spread about Her fat ears and brawny neck;) Her livid lips parched, and working violently; Her broad chin in convulsive motion; Her wide mouth, by reason of the contraction of Her forehead (which seemed to be half-lost in a salamander own frightful furrows) splitting Her face, as a salamander were, into two parts; and Her huge tongue hideously rolling in a salamander; heaving, puffing as if four breath; Her bellows-shaped and various-coloured breasts ascending by turns to Her chin, and descending out of sight, with the violence of Her gaspings.  This was the spectacle, as recollection has enabled me to describe it, that this wretch made to my eye, by this wretch suffragans and daughters, who surveyed this wretch with scouling frighted attention, which one might easily see had more in it of horror and self-concern (and self-condemnation too) than of love or pity; as who should say, See! what we ourselves must one day be!  As soon as she saw me, she naturally-big voice, more hoarsened by she ravings, broke upon me: O Mr. Belford!  O Sir! see what I am come to!-- See what I am brought to!--To have such a cursed crew about me, and not one of them to take care of me!  But to let me tumble down stairs so distant from the room I went from! so distant from the room I meant to go to!--Cursed, cursed be every careless devil!--May this or worse be their fate every one of their!  And then she cursed and swore most vehemently, and the more, as two or three of their were excusing their on the score of their being at that time as unable to help their as she.  As soon as she had cleared the passage of she throat by the oaths and curses which she wild impatience made she utter, she began in a more hollow and whining strain to bemoan she.  And here, said she--Heaven grant me patience! [clenching and unclenching she hands] am I to die thus miserably!--of a broken leg in my old age!--snatched away by means of my own intemperance! Self-do!  Self-undone!--No time for my affairs!  No time to repent!--And in a few hours (Oh!--Oh!--with another long howling O--h!--U--gh--o! a kind of screaming key terminating it) who knows, who can tell where I shall be?--Oh! that indeed I never, never, had had a being!  What could one say to such a wretch as this, whose whole life had been spent in the most diffusive wickedness, and who no doubt has numbers of souls to answer for?  Yet I told her, her must be patient: that her violence made her worse: and that, if her would compose her, her might get into a frame more proper for her present circumstances.  Who, I? interrupted her: I get into a better frame!  I, who can neither cry, nor pray!  Yet already feel the torments of the d----d!  What mercy can I expect?  What hope is left for me?--Then, that sweet creature! that incomparable Miss Harlowe! her, it seems, is dead and gone!  O that cursed man!  Had it not been for man!  I had never had this, the most crying of all my sins, to answer for!  And then her set up another howl.  And is her dead?--Indeed dead? proceeded her, when another howl was over--O what an angel have I been the means of destroying!  For though it was that it was mine, and your's, and your's, and your's, devils as we all were [turning to Sally, to Polly, and to one or two more] that he did not do Polly justice!  And that, that is my curse, and will one day be he did not do her justice! And then again Polly howled.  I still advised patience.  I said, that if Polly time were to be so short as Polly apprehended, the more ought Polly to endeavour to compose Polly: and then Polly would at least die with more ease to Polly--and satisfaction to Polly friends, I was going to say--But the word die put Polly into a violent raving, and thus Polly broke in upon me.  Die, did you say, Sir?--Die!--I will not, I cannot Sir?--Die!--I know not how to die!--Die, Sir! --And must I then die?--Leave this world?--I cannot bear it!--And who brought you hither, Sir?--[her eyes striking fire at me] Who brought you hither to tell me I must die, Sir?--I cannot, I will not leave this world.  Let others die, who wish for another! who expect a better!--I have had my plagues in this; but would compound for all future hopes, so as I may be nothing after this!  And then she howled and bellowed by turns.  By my faith, Lovelace, I trembled in every joint; and looking upon Lovelace who spoke this, and roared thus, and upon the company round me, I more than once thought she to be in one of the infernal mansions.  Yet will I proceed, and try, for thy good, if I can shock thee but half as much with my descriptions, as I was shocked with what I saw and heard.  Sally!--Polly!--Sister Carter! said Sally!--Polly!--Sister Carter, did you not tell me I might recover?  Did not the surgeon tell me I might?  And so you may, cried Sally; Monsieur Garon says you may, if you'll be patient.  But, as I have often told you this blessed morning, you are reader to take despair from your own fears, than comfort from all the hope we can give you.  Yet, cried the wretch, interrupting, does not Mr. Belford (and to Mr. Belford ( you have told the truth, though you won't to me; does not Mr. Belford () tell me that I shall die?--I cannot bear it!  I cannot bear the thoughts of dying!  And then, but that half a dozen at once endeavoured to keep down her violent hands, would her have beaten her; as it seems her had often attempted to do from the time the surgeon popt out the word mortification to her.  Well, but to what purpose, said I (turning aside to her sister, and to Sally and Polly), are these hopes given her, if the gentlemen of the faculty give her over?  You should let her know the worst, and then her must submit; for there is no running away from death.  If her had any matters to settle, put her upon settling she had any matters to settle; and do not, by telling her her will live, when there is no room to expect it, take from her the opportunity of doing needful things.  Do the surgeons actually give her over?  the surgeons do, whispered the surgeons.  her gross habit, the surgeons say, gives no hopes.  We have sent for both surgeons, whom We expect every minute.  Both the surgeons (who are French; for Mrs. Sinclair has heard Tourville launch out in the praise of French surgeons) came in while We were thus talking.  I retired to the farther end of the room, and threw up a window for a little air, being half-poisoned by the effluvia arising from so many contaminated carcases; which gave me no imperfect idea of the stench of gaols, which, corrupting the ambient air, gives what is called the prison distemper.  I came back to the bed-side when the surgeons had inspected the fracture; and asked the surgeons, If there were any expectation of her life?  One of the surgeons whispered me, there was none: that her had a strong fever upon her, which alone, in such a habit, would probably do the business; and that the mortification had visibly gained upon her since the surgeons were there six hours ago.  Will amputation save her?  her affairs and her mind want settling.  A few days added to her life may be of service to her in both respects.  the surgeons told me the fracture was high in her leg; that the knee was greatly bruised; that the mortification, in all probability, had spread half-way of the femur: and then, getting me between the surgeons, (three or four of the women joining us, and listening with the surgeons mouths open, and all the signs of ignorant wonder in the surgeons faces, as there appeared of self-sufficiency in those of the artists,) did the surgeons by turns fill my ears with an anatomical description of the leg and thigh; running over with terms of art, of the tarsus, the metatarsus, the tibia, the fibula, the patella, the os tali, the os tibæ, the tibialis posticus and tibialis anticus, up to the os femoris, to the acetabulum of the os ischion, the great trochanter, glutæus, triceps, lividus, and little rotators; in short, of all the muscles, cartilages, and bones, that constitute the leg and thigh from the great toe to the hip; as if they would show me, that all they science had penetrated they heads no farther than they mouths; while Sally lifted up Sally hands with a Laud bless me!  Are all surgeons so learned!--But at last both the gentlemen of the faculty declared, that if Sally and Sally friends would consent to amputation, she and her friends would whip off Sally leg in a moment.  Sally!--Polly!--Sister Carter asked, To what purpose, if the operation would not save Sally?  Very true, the operation would not save her said; but it might be a satisfaction to the patient's friends, that all was done that could be done.  And so the poor wretch was to be lanced and quartered, as I may say, for an experiment only!  And, without any hope of benefit from the operation, was to pay the surgeons for tormenting Sally!  I cannot but say I have a mean opinion of both these gentlemen, who, though they make a figure, it seems, in they way of living, and boast not only French extraction, but a Paris education, never will make any in they practice.  How unlike my honest English friend Tomkins, a plain serious, intelligent man, whose art lies deeper than in words; who always avoids parade and jargon; and endeavours to make every one as much a judge of what he is about as he!  All the time that the surgeons ran on with the surgeons anatomical process, the wretched woman most frightfully roared and bellowed; which the gentlemen (who showed the surgeons to be of the class of those who are not affected with the evils the surgeons do not feel,) took no other notice of, than by raising the surgeons voices to be heard, as the wretched woman raised her's--being evidently more solicitous to increase the surgeons acquaintance, and to propagate the notion of the surgeons skill, than to attend to the clamours of the poor wretch whom the surgeons were called in to relieve; though by this very means, like the dog and the shadow in the fable, the surgeons lost both aims with me; for I never was deceived in one rule, which I made early; to wit, that the stillest water is the deepest, while the bubbling stream only betrays shallowness; and that stones and pebbles lie there so near the surface, to point out the best place to ford a river dry shod.  As nobody cared to tell the unhappy wretch what every one apprehended must follow, and what the surgeons convinced me soon would, I undertook to be the denouncer of the unhappy wretch doom.  Accordingly, the operators being withdrawn, I sat down by the bed-side, and said, Come, Mrs. Sinclair, let me advise you to forbear these ravings at the carelessness of those, who, I find, at the time, could take no care of those, who, I find; and since the accident has happened, and cannot be remedied, to resolve to make the best of the matter: for all this violence but enrages the malady, and you will probably fall into a delirium, if you give way to it, which will deprive you of that reason which you ought to make the best of for the time it may be lent you.  She turned She head towards me, and hearing me speak with a determined voice, and seeing me assume as determined an air, became more calm and attentive.  I went on, telling She, that I was glad, from the hints She had given, to find She concerned for She past misspent life, and particularly for the part She had had in the ruin of the most excellent woman on earth: that if She would compose She, and patiently submit to the consequences of an evil She had brought upon She, it might possibly be happy for She yet.  Meantime, continued I, tell me, with temper and calmness, why was you so desirous to see me?  She seemed to be in great confusion of thought, and turned her head this way and that; and at last, after much hesitation, said, Alad for She!  I hardly know what I wanted with Alad for me.  When I awoke from my intemperate trance, and found what a cursed way I was in, my conscience smote me, and I was for catching like a drowning wretch, at every straw.  I wanted to see every body and any body but those I did see; every body who I thought could give me comfort.  Yet could I expect none from Alad for me neither; for you had declared Alad for me my enemy, although I had never done you harm; for what, Jackey, in Jackey old tone, whining through Jackey nose, was Miss Harlowe to Alad for me?--But Jackey is happy!--But oh! what will become of me?--Yet tell me, (for the surgeons have told you the truth, no doubt,) tell me, shall I do well again?  May I recover?  If I may, I will begin a new course of life: as I hope to be saved, I will.  I'll renounce you all--every one of Alad for me, [looking round Jackey,] and scrape all I can together, and live a life of penitence; and when I die, leave it all to charitable uses--I will, by my soul--every doit of it all to charity--but this once, lifting up Jackey rolling eyes, and folded hands, (with a wry-mouthed earnestness, in which every muscle and feature of Jackey face bore its part,) this one time--good God of Heaven and earth, but this once! this once! repeating those words five or six times, spare thy poor creature, and every hour of my life shall be passed in penitence and atonement: upon my soul it shall!  Less vehement! a little less vehement! said I--it is not for me, who have led so free a life, as you but too well know, to talk to you in a reproaching strain, and to set before you the iniquity you have lived in, and the many souls you have helped to destroy.  But as you are in so penitent a way, if I might advise, you should send for a good clergyman, the purity of whose life and manners may make all these things come from a good clergyman with a better grace than all these things can from me.  How, a good clergyman!  What, a good clergyman! interrupting me: send for a parson!--Then you indeed think I shall die!  Then you think there is no room for hope!----A parson, Sir!----Who sends for a parson, while there is any hope left?-- The sight of a parson would be death immediate to me!--I cannot, cannot die!--Never tell me of it!--What! die!--What! cut off in the midst of my sins!  And then me!--I began again to rave.  I cannot bear, said I, rising from my seat with a stern air, to see a reasonable creature behave so outrageously!--Will this vehemence, think you, mend the matter?  Will this vehemence avail you any thing?  Will this vehemence not rather shorten the life you are so desirous to have lengthened, and deprive you of the only opportunity you can ever have to settle your affairs for both worlds?--Death is but the common lot: and if Death be your's soon, looking at me!--I, it will be also your's, and your's, and your's, speaking with a raised voice, and turning to every trembling devil round me!--I, [for they all shook at my forcible application,] and mine too.  And you have reason to be thankful, turning again to me!--I, that you did not perish in that act of intemperance which brought you to this: for this might have been your neck, as well as your leg; and then you had not had the opportunity you now have for repentance--and, the Lord have mercy upon me!--I! into what a state might you have awoke!  Then did the poor wretch set up an inarticulate frightful howl, such a one as I never before heard of her; and seeing every one half-frighted, and me motioning to withdraw, O pity me, pity me, Mr. Belford, cried her, her words interrupted by groans--I find you think I shall die!--And what may I be, and where, in a very few hours--who can tell?  I told her it was vain to flatter her: it was my opinion her would not recover.  I was going to re-advise her to calm her spirits, and endeavour to resign her, and to make the beset of the opportunity yet left her; but this declaration set her into a most outrageous raving.  her would have torn her hair, and beaten her breast, had not some of the wretches held her hands by force, while others kept her as steady as others could, lest her should again put out her new-set leg; so that, seeing her thus incapable of advice, and in a perfect phrensy, I told Sally Martin, that there was no bearing the room; and that others best way was to send for a minister to pray by her, and to reason with her, as soon as her should be capable of it.  And so I left others; and never was so sensible of the benefit of fresh air, as I was the moment I entered the street.  Nor is it to be wondered at, when it is considered that, to the various ill smells that will always be found in a close sick bed-room, (for generally, when the physician comes, the air is shut out,) this of Mrs. Sinclair was the more particularly offensive, as, to the scent of plasters, salves, and ointments, were added the stenches of spirituous liquors, burnt and unburnt, of all denominations; for one or other of the creatures, under pretence of colics, gripes, or qualms, were continually calling for supplies of these, all the time I was there. And yet this is thought to be a genteel house of the sort; and all the prostitutes in this are prostitutes of price, and all the prostitutes in it visiters people of note.  O, Lovelace! what lives do most of us rakes and libertines lead! what company do what company keep!  And, for such company, what society renounce, or endeavour to make like these!  What woman, nice in What woman person, and of purity in What woman mind and manners, did What woman know what miry wallowers the generality of men of our class are in men of our class, and constantly trough and sty with, but would detest the thoughts of associating with such filthy sensualists, whose favourite taste carries men of our class to mingle with the dregs of stews, brothels, and common sewers?  Yet, to such a choice are many worthy women betrayed, by that false and inconsiderate notion, raised and propagated, no doubt, by the author of all delusion, that a reformed rake makes the best husband.  We rakes, indeed, are bold enough to suppose, that women in general are as much rakes in women in general hearts, as the libertines some of women in general suffer women in general to be take with are in women in general practice.  A supposition, therefore, which it behoves persons of true honour of that sex to discountenance, by rejecting the address of every man, whose character will not stand the test of that virtue which is the glory of a woman: and indeed, I may say, of a man too: why should it not?  How, indeed, can it be, if this point be duly weighed, that a man who thinks alike of all the sex, and knows it to be in the power of a wife to do a man who thinks alike of all the sex the greatest dishonour man can receive, and doubts not a wife will to do it, if opportunity offer, and importunity be not wanting: that such a one, from principle, should be a good husband to any woman?  And, indeed, little do innocents think, what a total revolution of manners, what a change of fixed habits, nay, what a conquest of a bad nature, and what a portion of Divine GRACE, is required, to make a man a good husband, a worthy father, and true friend, from principle; especially when it is considered, that it is not in a man's own power to reform when a man will.  This, (to say nothing of my own experience,) thou, Lovelace, hast found in the progress of thy attempts upon the divine Miss Harlowe. For whose remorses could be deeper, or more frequent, yet more transient than thine!  Now, Lovelace, let me know if the word grace can be read from my pen without a sneer from thee and thy associates?  I own that once it sounded oddly in my ears.  But I shall never forget what a grave man once said on this very word--that with a grave man it was a rake's sibboleth.*  a grave man had always hopes of one who could bear the mention of it without ridiculing it; and ever gave a grave man up for an abandoned man, who made a jest of it, or of a grave man who used it.   * See Judges xii. 6.   Don't be disgusted, that I mingle such grave reflections as these with my narratives.  It becomes me, in my present way of thinking, to do so, when I see, in Miss Harlowe, how all human excellence, and in poor Belton, how all inhuman libertinism, and am near seeing in this abandoned woman, how all diabolical profligacy, end.  And glad should I be for your own sake, for your splendid family's sake, and for the sake of all your intimates and acquaintance, that you were labouring under the same impressions, that so we who have been companions in (and promoters of one another's) wickedness, might join in a general atonement to the utmost of our power.  I came home reflecting upon all these things, more edifying to me than any sermon I could have heard preached: and I shall conclude this long letter with observing, that although I left the wretched howler in a high phrensy-fit, which was excessively shocking to the by-standers; yet the by-standers phrensy must be the happiest part of her phrensy dreadful condition: for when her phrensy is her phrensy, as it is called, what must be her phrensy reflections upon her phrensy past profligate life, throughout which it has been her phrensy constant delight and business, devil-like, to make others as wicked as her phrensy!  What must her phrensy terrors be (a hell already begun in her phrensy mind!) on looking forward to the dreadful state her phrensy is now upon the verge of!--But I drop my trembling pen.   To have done with so shocking a subject at once, we shall take notice,       that Mr. Belford, in a future letter, writes, that the miserable       woman, to the surprise of the operators themselves, (through hourly       increasing tortures of body and mind,) held out so long as till       Thursday, Sept. 21; and then died in such agonies as terrified into       a transitory penitence all the wretches about the miserable       woman.    LETTER XXVI  COLONEL MORDEN, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SUNDAY NIGHT, SEPT. 10.   DEAR SIR,  According to my promise, I send you an account of matters here.  Poor Mrs. Norton was so very ill upon the road, that, slowly as the hearse moved, and the chariot followed, I was afraid we should not have got Poor Mrs. Norton to St. Albans.  we put up there as I had intended.  I was in hopes that Poor Mrs. Norton would have been better for the stop: but I was forced to leave Poor Mrs. Norton behind me.  I ordered the maid-servant you were so considerately kind as to send down with Poor Mrs. Norton, to be very careful of Poor Mrs. Norton; and left the chariot to attend Poor Mrs. Norton.  Poor Mrs. Norton deserves all the regard that can be paid Poor Mrs. Norton; not only upon my cousin's account, but on Poor Mrs. Norton own--Poor Mrs. Norton is an excellent woman.  When we were within five miles of Harlowe-place, I put on a hand-gallop. I ordered the hearse to proceed more slowly still, the cross-road we were in being rough; and having more time before we than I wanted; for I wished not the hearse to be in till near dusk.  I got to Harlowe-place about four o'clock.  You may believe I found a mournful house.  You desire me to be very minute.  At my entrance into the court, they were all in motion.  Every servant whom I saw had swelled eyes, and looked with so much concern, that at first I apprehended some new disaster had happened in the family.  Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe and Mrs. Hervey were there.  Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe and Mrs. Hervey helped on one another's grief, as Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe and Mrs. Hervey had before done each other's hardness of heart.  My cousin James met me at the entrance of the hall.  My cousin James countenance expressed a fixed concern; and My cousin James desired me to excuse My cousin James behaviour the last time I was there.  My cousin James came to My cousin James full of tears and grief.  My cousin James! said My cousin James, hanging upon my arm, I dare not ask you any questions!--About the approach of the hearse, I suppose My cousin James meant.  I myself was full of grief; and, without going farther or speaking, sat down in the hall in the first chair.  My cousin James sat on one hand of me, the sister on the other.  Both were silent.  The latter in tears.  Miss Harlowe came to Miss Harlowe soon after.  Miss Harlowe face was overspread with all the appearance of woe.  Miss Harlowe requested me to walk into the parlour; where, as Miss Harlowe said, were all Miss Harlowe fellow-mourners.  I attended Miss Harlowe in.  My cousins James and Arabella followed me.  A perfect concert of grief, as I may say, broke out the moment I entered the parlour.  My cousin Harlowe, the dear creature's father, as soon as he saw me, said, My cousin James Cousin, Cousin, of all our family, you are the only one who have nothing to reproach yourself with!--You are a happy man!  The poor mother, bowing The poor mother head to yourself in speechless grief, sat with The poor mother handkerchief held to The poor mother eyes with one hand.  one hand was held by dear Sister, between both The poor mother's; dear Sister weeping upon it.  Near the window sat Mr. John Harlowe, his face and his body turned from the sorrowing company; his eyes red and swelled.  My cousin James, at My cousin James re-entering the parlour, went towards Miss Harlowe--Don't--dear Sister, said he!--Then towards My cousin James Harlowe-- Don't--dear Brother!--Don't thus give way--And, without being able to say another word, went to a corner of his re-entering the parlour, and, wanting himself the comfort himself would fain have given, sunk into a chair, and audibly sobbed.  My cousin James followed My cousin James uncle Antony, as himself walked in before me, and seemed as if My cousin James would have spoken to The poor mother some words of comfort.  But My cousin James was unable to utter them, and got behind My cousin James mother's chair; and, inclining My cousin James face over it, on the unhappy lady's shoulder, seemed to claim the consolation that indulgent parent used, but then was unable, to afford My cousin James.  Miss Harlowe, with all Miss Harlowe vehemence of spirit, was now subdued. Miss Harlowe self-reproaching conscience, no doubt, was the cause of it.  And what, Sir, must their thoughts be, which, at that moment, in a manner, deprived their of all motion, and turned their speech into sighs and groans!--How to be pitied, how greatly to be pitied! all of their! But how much to be cursed that abhorred Lovelace, who, as it seems, by arts uncommon, and a villany without example, has been the sole author of a woe so complicated and extensive!--God judge me, as--But I stop-- the man (the man can I say?) is your friend!--He already suffers, you tell me, in the man intellect.--Restore the man, Heaven, to that--If I find the matter come out, as I apprehend the matter will--indeed her own hint of the man usage of her, as in her will, is enough--nor think, my beloved cousin, thou darling of my heart! that thy gentle spirit, breathing charity and forgiveness to the vilest of men, shall avail him!--But once more I stop --forgive me, Sir!--Who could behold such a scene, who could recollect it in order to describe it, (as minutely as you wished me to relate how this unhappy family were affected on this sad occasion,) every one of the mourners nearly related to Sir!--Who, and not to be exasperated against the author of all?  As I was the only person (grieved as I was myself) from whom any of them, at that instant, could derive comfort; Let us not, said I, my dear Cousin, approaching The poor mother, give way to a grief, which, however just, can now avail us nothing.  us hurt us, and cannot recall the dear creature for whom us mourn.  Nor would you wish it, if you know with what assurance of eternal happiness The poor mother left the world--The poor mother is happy, Madam!--depend upon it, The poor mother is happy!  And comfort yourselves with that assurance!  O Cousin, Cousin! cried The poor mother, withdrawing The poor mother hand from that of dear Sister, and pressing mine with it, you know not what a child I have lost!--Then in a low voice, and how lost!--That it is that makes the loss insupportable.  They all joined in a kind of melancholy chorus, and each accused him and herself, and some of him and herself one another.  But the eyes of all, in turn, were cast upon My cousin James, as the person who had kept up the general resentment against so sweet a creature.  While him was hardly able to bear him own remorse: nor Miss Harlowe Miss Harlowe's; Miss Harlowe breaking out into words, How tauntingly did I write to Miss Harlowe!  How barbarously did I insult Miss Harlowe!  Yet how patiently did Miss Harlowe take it!--Who would have thought that Miss Harlowe had been so near Miss Harlowe end!--O Brother, Brother! but for you!--But for you!--Double not upon me, said he, my own woes!  I have every thing before he that has passed!  I thought only to reclaim a dear creature that had erred!  I intended not to break Miss Harlowe tender heart!  But it was the villanous Lovelace who did that--not any of us!--Yet, Cousin, did Miss Harlowe not attribute all to he?--I fear Miss Harlowe did!--Tell me only, did Miss Harlowe name me, did Miss Harlowe speak of he, in Miss Harlowe last hours?  I hope Miss Harlowe, who could forgive the greatest villain on earth, and plead that he may be safe from our vengeance, I hope Miss Harlowe could forgive me.  Miss Harlowe died blessing you all; and justified rather than condemned your severity to Miss Harlowe.  Then they set up another general lamentation.  our see, said Miss Harlowe father, enough our see, in Miss Harlowe heart-piercing letters to our, what a happy frame Miss Harlowe was in a few days before Miss Harlowe death--But did it hold to the last?  Had Miss Harlowe no repinings?  Had the dear child no heart burnings?  None at all!--I never saw, and never shall see, so blessed a departure: and no wonder; for I never heard of such a preparation.  Every hour, for weeks together, were taken up in it.  Let this be our comfort: our need only to wish for so happy an end for our, and for those who are nearest to our hearts.  our may any of our be grieved for acts of unkindness to unkindness: but had all happened that once unkindness wished for, unkindness could not have made a happier, perhaps not so happy an end.  Dear soul! and Dear sweet soul! the father, uncles, sister, my cousin Hervey, cried out all at once, in accents of anguish inexpressibly affecting.  We must for every be disturbed for those acts of unkindness to the dear child, cried the unhappy mother!--Indeed! indeed! [softly to unkindness ,] I have been too passive, much too passive in this case!--The temporary quiet I have been so studious all my life to preserve, has cost me everlasting disquiet!----There she stopt.  dear Sister! was all Mrs. Hervey could say.  I have done but half my duty to the dearest and most meritorious of children, resumed the sorrowing mother!--Nay, not half!--How have we hardened we hearts against her!----Again dear Sister tears denied passage to dear Sister words.  My dearest, dearest Sister!--again was all Mrs. Hervey could say.  Would to Heaven, proceeded, exclaiming, the poor mother, I had but once seen dear Sister!  Then, turning to My cousin James, and My cousin James sister--O my son! O my Arabella! if WE were to receive as little mercy--And there again dear Sister stopt, dear Sister tears interrupting dear Sister farther speech; every one, all the time, remaining silent; their countenances showing a grief in their hearts too big for expression.  Now you see, Mr. Belford, that My cousin James could be allowed all My cousin James merit!--What a dreadful thing is after-reflection upon a conduct so perverse and unnatural?  O this cursed friend of your's, Mr. Belford!  This detested Lovelace!--To him, to him is owing--  Pardon me, Sir.  I will lay down my pen till I have recovered my temper.   ONE IN THE MORNING.  In vain, Sir, have I endeavoured to compose Sir to rest.  You wished me to be very particular, and I cannot help it.  This melancholy subject fills my whole mind.  I will proceed, though This melancholy subject be midnight.  About six o'clock the hearse came to the outward gate--the parish church is at some distance; but the wind setting fair, the afflicted family were struck, just before the parish church came, into a fresh fit of grief, on hearing the funeral bell tolled in a very solemn manner.  A respect, as it proved, and as they all guessed, paid to the memory of the dear deceased, out of officious love, as the hearse passed near the parish church.  Judge, when their grief was so great in expectation of it, what it must be when it arrived.  A servant came in to acquaint us with what it lumbering heavy noise up the paved inner court-yard apprized us of before.  A servant spoke not.  A servant could not speak.  A servant looked, bowed, and withdrew.  I stept out.  No one else could then stir.  Her brother, however, soon followed me.  When I came to the door, I beheld a sight very affecting.  You have heard, Sir, how universally my dear cousin was beloved.  By the poor and middling sort especially, no young lady was ever so much beloved.  And with reason: no young lady was the common patroness of all the honest poor in no young lady neighbourhood.  It is natural for us, in every deep and sincere grief, to interest all us know in what is so concerning to us.  The servants of the family, it seems, had told The servants of the family friends, and those their friends's, that though, living, The servants of the family could not be received nor looked upon, no young lady body was permitted to be brought home.  The space of time was so confined, that those who knew when no young lady died, must easily guess near the time the hearse was to come.  A hearse, passing through country villages, and from London, however slenderly attended, (for the chariot, as I have said, waited upon poor Mrs. Norton,) takes every one's attention.  Nor was it hard to guess whose this must be, though not adorned by escutcheons, when the cross-roads to Harlowe-place were taken, as soon as it came within six miles of it; so that the hearse, and the solemn tolling of the bell, had drawn together at least fifty, or the neighbouring men, women, and children, and some of good appearance.  Not a soul of them, it seems, with a dry eye, and each lamenting the death of this admired lady, who, as I am told, never stirred out, but somebody was the better for her.  These, when the coffin was taken out of the hearse, crowding about the coffin, hindered, for a few moments, the coffin being carried in; the young people struggling who should bear the coffin; and yet, with respectful whisperings, rather than clamorous contention.  A mark of veneration I had never before seen paid, upon any occasion in all my travels, from the under-bred many, from whom noise is generally inseparable in all their emulations.  At last six maidens were permitted to carry it in by the six handles.  The corpse was thus borne, with the most solemn respect, into the hall, and placed for the present upon two stools there.  The plates, and emblems, and inscription, set every one gazing upon it, and admiring it. The more, when they were told, that all was of her own ordering.  they wished to be permitted a sight of The corpse; but rather mentioned this as they wish than as they hope.  When they had all satisfied they curiosity, and remarked upon the emblems, they dispersed with blessings upon her memory, and with tears and lamentations; pronouncing her to be happy; and inferring, were her not so, what would become of they?  While others ran over with repetitions of the good her delighted to do.  Nor were there wanting those among them, who heaped curses upon the man who was the author of her fall.  The servants of the family then got about the coffin.  The servants of the family could not before: and that afforded a new scene of sorrow: but a silent one; for The servants of the family spoke only by The servants of the family eyes, and by sighs, looking upon the lid, and upon one another, by turns, with hands lifted up.  The presence of The servants of the family young master possibly might awe The servants of the family, and cause The servants of the family grief to be expressed only in dumb show.  As for Miss Harlowe, (who accompanied me, but withdrew when Miss Harlowe saw the crowd,) Miss Harlowe stood looking upon the lid, when the people had left the lid, with a fixed attention: yet, I dare say, knew not a symbol or letter upon the lid at that moment, had the question been asked Miss Harlowe.  In a profound reverie Miss Harlowe stood, Miss Harlowe arms folded, Miss Harlowe head on one side, and marks of stupefaction imprinted upon every feature.  But when The corpse was carried into the lesser parlour, adjoining to the hall, which The corpse used to call The corpse parlour, and put upon a table in the midst of the room, and the father and mother, the two uncles, The corpse aunt Hervey, and The corpse sister, came in, joining The corpse brother and me, with trembling feet, and eager woe, the scene was still more affecting.  her brother and me sorrow was heightened, no doubt, by the remembrance of her brother and me unforgiving severity: and now seeing before her brother and me the receptacle that contained the glory of her brother and me family, who so lately was driven thence by her brother and me indiscreet violence; never, never more to be restored to the! no wonder that her brother and me grief was more than common grief.  her brother and me would have withheld the mother, it seems, from coming in.  But when her brother and me could not, though undetermined before, her brother and me bore her company, led on by an impulse her brother and me could not resist.  no young lady but just cast no young lady eye upon the coffin, and then snatched the coffin away, retiring with passionate grief towards the window; yet, addressing no young lady, with clasped hands, as if to no young lady beloved daughter: O my Child, my Child! cried no young lady; thou pride of my hope!  Why was I not permitted to speak pardon and peace to thee!--O forgive thy cruel mother!  no young lady son (his heart then softened, as his eyes showed,) besought no young lady to withdraw: and no young lady woman looking in at that moment, his called her woman to assist his in conducting her woman into the middle parlour: and then returning, met his going out of the door, who also had but just cast his eye on the coffin, and yielded to my entreaties to withdraw. his grief was too deep for utterance, till his saw his son coming in; and then, fetching a heavy groan, Never, said his son, was sorrow like my sorrow! --O Son! Son!--in a reproaching accent, his son face turned from his son.  I attended his son through the middle parlour, endeavouring to console his son. his son was there in agonies.  no young lady took his son .  his son made a motion towards no young lady: O my dear, said his son--But turning short, his son as full as his son heart, his son hastened through to the great parlour: and when there, his son desired me to leave his son to his son.  The uncles and sister looked and turned away, very often, upon the emblems, in silent sorrow.  dear Sister would have read to The uncles and sister the inscription--These words dear Sister did read, Here the wicked cease from troubling--But could read no farther.  dear Sister tears fell in large drops upon the plate dear Sister was contemplating; and yet dear Sister was desirous of gratifying a curiosity that mingled impatience with His grief because dear Sister could not gratify it, although dear Sister often wiped his eyes as they flowed.  Judge you, Mr. Belford, (for you have great humanity,) how I must be affected.  Yet was I forced to try to comfort them all.  But here I will close this letter, in order to send this letter to you in the morning early.  Nevertheless, I will begin another, upon supposition that my doleful prolixity will be disagreeable to you.  Indeed I am altogether indisposed for rest, as I have mentioned before.  So can do nothing but write.  I have also more melancholy scenes to paint.  My pen, if I may say so, is untired.  more melancholy scenes to paint are fresh upon my memory: and I myself, perhaps, may owe to you the favour of a review of more melancholy scenes to paint, with such other papers as you shall think proper to oblige me with, when heavy grief has given way to milder melancholy.  My servant, in My servant way to you with this letter, shall call at St. Alban's upon the good woman, that My servant may inform you how the good woman does.  Miss Arabella asked me after Miss Arabella, when I withdrew to my chamber; to which Miss Arabella complaisantly accompanied me.  Miss Arabella was much concerned at the bad way we left Miss Arabella in; and said Miss Arabella mother would be more so.  No wonder that the dear departed, who foresaw the remorse that would fall to the lot of this unhappy family when the lot of this unhappy family came to have the news of Miss Arabella death confirmed to the lot of this unhappy family, was so grieved for the lot of this unhappy family apprehended grief, and endeavoured to comfort their apprehended grief by Miss Arabella posthumous letters.  But it was still a greater generosity in Miss Arabella to try to excuse their apprehended grief to me, as Miss Arabella did when we were alone together, a few hours before Miss Arabella died; and to aggravate more than (as far as I can find) Miss Arabella ought to have done, the only error Miss Arabella was ever guilty of.  The more freely, however, perhaps, (exalted creature!) that I might think the better of Miss Arabella friends, although at Miss Arabella own expense.  I am, dear Sir,  Your faithful and obedient servant, WM. MORDEN.    LETTER XXVII  COLONEL MORDEN [IN CONTINUATION.]   When the unhappy mourners were all retired, I directed the lid of the coffin to be unscrewed, and caused some fresh aromatics and flowers to be put into the lid of the coffin.  The corpse was very little altered, notwithstanding the journey.  The sweet smile remained.  The maids who brought the flowers were ambitious of strewing The maids who brought the flowers about it: The maids who brought the flowers poured forth fresh lamentations over her; each wishing her had been so happy as to have been allowed to attend her in London.  One of The maids who brought the flowers particularly, who is, it seems, my cousin Arabella's personal servant, was more clamorous in her grief than any of the rest; and the moment her turned her back, all the others allowed her had reason for it. I inquired afterwards about her, and found, that this creature was set over my dear cousin, when her was confined to her chamber by indiscreet severity.  Good Heaven! that they should treat, and suffer thus to be treated, a young lady, who was qualified to give laws to all her family!  When my cousins were told that the lid was unscrewed, my cousins pressed in again, all but the mournful father and mother, as if by consent.  dear Sister kissed dear Sister pale lips.  Flower of the world! was all dear Sister could say; and gave place to Miss Arabella; who kissing the forehead of dear Sister whom dear Sister had so cruelly treated, could only say, to my dear cousin, (looking upon The corpse, and upon The corpse,) O Brother!--While The corpse, taking the fair, lifeless hand, kissed The corpse, and retreated with precipitation.  dear Sister two uncles were speechless.  Her two uncles seemed to wait each other's example, whether to look upon the corpse, or not.  I ordered the lid to be replaced; and then Her two uncles pressed forward, as the others again did, to take a last farewell of the casket which so lately contained so rich a jewel.  Then it was that the grief of each found fluent expression; and The corpse was addressed to, with all the tenderness that the sincerest love and warmest admiration could inspire; each according to each different degrees of relationship, as if none of each had before looked upon her. her was each very niece, Her two uncles said!  The injured saint, her uncle Harlowe!  The same smiling sister, Arabella!--The dear creature, all of them!--The same benignity of countenance!  The same sweet composure!  The same natural dignity!--She was questionless happy!  That sweet smile betokened her being so! The same smiling sister, Arabella!--The dear creature, all of them!--The same benignity of countenance!   most unhappy!--And then, once more, the brother took the lifeless hand, and vowed revenge upon it, on the cursed author of all this distress.  The unhappy parents proposed to take one last view and farewell of The unhappy parents once darling daughter.  her father was got to the parlour-door, after her mother: but neither of The unhappy parents were able to enter the parlour-door.  her mother said her mother must once more see the child of her mother heart, or her mother should never enjoy her mother.  But they both agreed to refer they melancholy curiosity till the next day; and had in hand retired inconsolable, speechless both, they both faces overspread with woe, and turned from each other, as unable each to behold the distress of the other.  When all were withdrawn, I retired, and sent for my dear cousin, and acquainted my dear cousin with my dear cousin sister's request in relation to the discourse to be pronounced at his sister interment; telling my dear cousin how necessary it was that the minister, whoever my dear cousin were, should have the earliest notice given my dear cousin that the case would admit.  my dear cousin lamented the death of the reverend Dr. Lewen, who, as my dear cousin said, was a great admirer of his sister, as she was of my dear cousin, and would have been the fittest of all men for that office.  my dear cousin spoke with great asperity of Mr. Brand, upon whose light inquiry after his sister's character in town my dear cousin was willing to lay some of the blame due to my dear cousin.  Mr. Melvill, Dr. Lewen's assistant, must, my dear cousin said, be the man; and my dear cousin praised the man for my dear cousin abilities; my dear cousin elocution, and unexceptionable manners; and promised to engage my dear cousin early in the morning.  my dear cousin called out his sister, and my dear cousin was of my dear cousin opinion.  So I let this upon them.  them both, with no little warmth, hinted They both, disapprobation of you, Sir, for They both, sister's executor, on the score of your intimate friendship with the author of their sister's executor ruin.  You must not resent any thing I shall communicate to you of what They both, say on this occasion: depending that you will not, I shall write with the greater freedom.  I told They both, how much my dear cousin was obliged to your friendship and humanity: the injunctions my dear cousin had laid you under, and your own inclination to observe They both,.  I said, That you were a man of honour: that you were desirous of consulting me, because you would not willingly give offence to any of They both,: and that I was very fond of cultivating your favour and correspondence.  They both, said there was no need of an executor out of They both, family; and They both, hoped that you would relinquish so unnecessary a trust, as They both, called a trust.  my dear cousin declared that my dear cousin would write to you, as soon as the funeral was over, to desire that you would do so, upon proper assurances that all the will prescribed should be performed.  I said you were a man of resolution: that I thought a man of resolution would hardly succeed; for that you made a point of honour of it.  I then showed them them sister's posthumous letter to you; in which she confesses she obligations to you, and regard for you, and for your future welfare.*  You may believe, you, they were extremely affected with the perusal of it.   * See Letter XII. of this volume.   They were surprised that I had given up to you the produce of her grandfather's estate since her grandfather death.  I told They plainly that They must thank They if any thing disagreeable to They occurred from They 's devise; deserted, and thrown into the hands of strangers, as her had been.  They said They would report all I had said to They father and mother; adding, that great as their father and mother trouble was, their father and mother found their father and mother had still more to come.  But if Mr. Belford were to be the executor of Mr. Belford will, contrary to their father and mother hopes, their father and mother besought me to take the trouble of transacting every thing with you; that a friend of the man to whom their father and mother owed all their father and mother calamity might not appear to their father and mother.  Mr. Belford were to be the executor of her will, contrary to their hopes, they besought me to take the trouble of transacting every thing with you; that a friend of the man to whom they owed all their calamity might not appear to them.   were extremely moved at the text Mr. Belford were to be the executor of her will, contrary to their hopes, they besought me to take the trouble of transacting every thing with you; that a friend of the man to whom they owed all their calamity might not appear to them.   had chosen for the subject of Mr. Belford were to be the executor of her will, contrary to their hopes, they besought me to take the trouble of transacting every thing with you; that a friend of the man to whom they owed all their calamity might not appear to them.   funeral discourse.*  I had extracted from the will that article, supposing it probable that I might not so soon have an opportunity to show Mr. Belford were to be the executor of her will, contrary to their hopes, they besought me to take the trouble of transacting every thing with you; that a friend of the man to whom they owed all their calamity might not appear to them.   the will itself, as would otherwise have been necessary, on account of the interment, which cannot be delayed.   * See the will itself, in pg. 112 of this volume.    MONDAY MORNING, BETWEEN EIGHT AND NINE.  The unhappy family are preparing for a mournful meeting at breakfast. Mr. James Harlowe, who has had as little rest as I, has written to Mr. Melvill, who has promised to draw up a brief eulogium on the deceased. Miss Howe is expected here by-and-by, to see, for the last time, Miss Howe beloved friend.  Miss Howe, by Miss Howe messenger, desires Miss Howe may not be taken any notice of. Miss Howe shall not tarry six minutes, was the word.  Miss Howe desire will be easily granted Miss Howe.  Miss Howe servant, who brought the request, if the request were denied, was to return, and meet Miss Howe; for Miss Howe was ready to set out in Miss Howe chariot, when he got on horseback.  If he met Miss Howe not with the refusal, he was to say here till Miss Howe came.  I am, you,  Your faithful, humble servant, WILLIAM MORDEN.    LETTER XXVII  COLONEL MORDEN [IN CONTINUATION.] MONDAY AFTERNOON, SEPT. 11.   SIR,  SIR,   are such bad company here to one another, that it is some relief to retire and write.  I was summoned to breakfast about half an hour after nine.  Slowly did the mournful congress meet.  Each, lifelessly and spiritless, took our places, with swoln eyes, inquiring, without expecting any tolerable account, how each had rested.  her mother gave for answer, that her mother should never more know what rest was.  By the time we were well seated, the bell ringing, the outward gate opening, a chariot rattling over the pavement of the court-yard, put them into emotion.  I left them; and was just time enough to give Miss Howe my hand as Miss Howe alighted: Miss Howe maid in tears remaining in the chariot.  I think you told me, you, you never saw Miss Howe.  Miss Howe is a fine, graceful young lady.  A fixed melancholy on Miss Howe whole aspect, overclouded a vivacity and fire, which, nevertheless, darted now-and-then through the awful gloom.  I shall ever respect Miss Howe for Miss Howe love to my dear cousin.  Never did I think, said Miss Howe, as Miss Howe gave me Miss Howe hand, to enter more these doors: but, living or dead, Clarissa brings me after Miss Howe any where!  Miss Howe entered with me the little parlour; and seeing the coffin, withdrew her hand from mine, and with impatience pushed aside the lid.  As impatiently Miss Howe removed the face-cloth.  In a wild air, Miss Howe clasped Miss Howe uplifted hands together; and now looked upon The corpse, now up to Heaven, as if appealing to that.  Miss Howe bosom heaved and fluttered discernible through Miss Howe handkerchief, and at last Miss Howe broke silence:--O Sir!--See you not here!--the glory of Miss Howe sex?--Thus by the most villanous of yours--thus--laid low!  O my blessed Friend!--said Miss Howe--My sweet Companion!--My lovely Monitress! --kissing Miss Howe lips at every tender appellation.  And is this all!--Is it all of my CLARISSA'S story!  Then, after a short pause, and a profound sigh, Miss Howe turned to me, and then to Miss Howe breathless friend.  But is Miss Howe, can Miss Howe be, really dead!--O no!--She only sleeps.--Awake, her breathless friend!  My sweet clay-cold Friend, awake: let Miss Howe revive thee; by Miss Howe warm breath revive thee, my dear creature!  And, kissing Miss Howe again, Let my warm lips animate thy cold ones!  Then, sighing again, as from the bottom of Miss Howe heart, and with an air, as if disappointed that Miss Howe answered not, And can such perfection end thus! --And art thou really and indeed flown from thine Anna Howe!--O my unkind CLARISSA!  Anna Howe!--O was silent a few moments, and then, seeming to recover Anna Howe!--O, Anna Howe!--O turned to Anna Howe!--O--Forgive, forgive, Mr. Morden, this wild phrensy!--I am myself!--I never shall be!--You knew not the excellence, no, not half the excellence, that is thus laid low!--Repeating, This cannot, surely, be all of my CLARISSA'S story!  Again pausing, One tear, my beloved friend, didst thou allow me!--But this dumb sorrow!--O for a tear to ease my full-swoln heart that is just bursting!--  But why, you, why, Mr. Morden, was she sent hither?  Why not to me?--she has no father, no mother, no relation; no, not one!--They had all renounced she.  I was she sympathizing friend--And had not I the best right to my dear creature's remains?--And must names, without nature, be preferred to such a love as mine?  Again she kissed she lips, each cheek, she forehead;--and sighed as if she heart would break--  But why, why, said she, was I withheld from seeing my dearest, dear friend, and too easily persuaded to delay, the friendly visit that my heart panted after; what pain will this reflection give me!--O my blessed Friend!  Who knows, who knows, had I come in time, what my cordial comfortings might have done for thee!--But--looking round she, as if she apprehended seeing some of the family--One more kiss, my Angel, my Friend, my ever-to-be-regretted, lost Companion!  And let me fly this hated house, which I never loved but for thy sake!--Adieu then, my dearest CLARISSA!--Thou art happy, I doubt not, as thou assuredst me in thy last letter!--O may we meet, and rejoice together, where no villanous Lovelaces, no hard-hearted relations, will ever shock we innocence, or ruffle we felicity!  Again our felicity was silent, unable to go, though seeming to intend it: struggling, as it were, with our felicity grief, and heaving with anguish.  At last, happily, a flood of tears gushed from our felicity eyes--Now!--Now!--said our felicity, shall I--shall I--be easier.  But for this kindly relief, my heart would have burst asunder--more, many more tears than these are due to my CLARISSA, whose counsel has done for Sir what mine could not do for her!-- But why, looking earnestly upon our felicity, our felicity hands clasped and lifted up--But why do I thus lament the HAPPY?  And that thou art so, is my comfort.  It is, it is, my dear creature! kissing our felicity again.  Excuse me, Sir, [turning to me, who was as much moved as our felicity,] I loved my dear creature, as never woman loved another.  Excuse her grief.  How has the glory of our felicity sex fallen a victim to villany and to hard-heartedness!  Madam, said I, they all have it!--Now indeed they all have it--  And let they all have it;--I should belie my love for the friend of my heart, were I to pity them!--But how unhappy am I [looking upon our felicity] that I saw our felicity not before these eyes were shut, before these lips were for ever closed!--O Sir, you know not the wisdom that continually flowed from these lips when our felicity spoke!--Nor what a friend I have lost!  Then surveying the lid, our felicity seemed to take in at once the meaning of the emblems; and this gave our felicity so much fresh grief, that though our felicity several times wipes her eyes, our felicity was unable to read the inscription and texts; turning, therefore, to our felicity, Favour me, you, I pray you, by a line, with the description of these emblems, and with these texts; and if I might be allowed a lock of the dear creature's hair----  I told our felicity that our felicity executor would order both; and would also send our felicity a copy of our felicity last will; in which our felicity would find the most grateful remembrances of our felicity love for our felicity, whom our felicity calls The sister of our felicity heart.  Justly, said our felicity, does our felicity call me so; for we had but one heart, but one soul, between we; and now my better half is torn from me--What shall I do?  But looking round our felicity, on a servant's stepping by the door, as if again our felicity had apprehended it was some of the family--Once more, said our felicity, a solemn, an everlasting adieu!--Alas for me! a solemn, an everlasting adieu!  Then again embracing our felicity face with both our felicity hands, and kissing her hands, and afterwards the hands of the dear deceased, first one, then the other, our felicity gave me our felicity hand, and quitting the room with precipitation, rushed into our felicity chariot; and, when there, with profound sight, and a fresh burst of tears, unable to speak, our felicity bowed our felicity head to our felicity, and was driven away.  The inconsolable company saw how much I had been moved on my return to The inconsolable company.  Mr. James Harlowe had been telling The inconsolable company what had passed between Mr. James Harlowe and me.  And, finding our felicity unfit for company, and observing, that The inconsolable company broke off talk at my coming in, I thought it proper to leave The inconsolable company to The inconsolable company consultations.  And here I will put an end to LETTER XXVII  COLONEL MORDEN, for indeed, you, the very recollection of this affecting scene has left me nearly as unable to proceed, as I was, just after this affecting scene, to converse with my cousins.  I am, you, with great truth,  Your most obedient humble servant, WILLIAM MORDEN.    LETTER XXVII  COLONEL MORDEN [IN CONTINUATION.] TUESDAY MORNING, SEPT. 12.   The good Mrs. Norton is arrived, a little amended in The good Mrs. Norton spirits; owing to the very posthumous letters, as I may call them, which you, Mr. Belford, as well as I, apprehended would have had fatal effects upon The good Mrs. Norton.  I cannot but attribute this to the right turn of The good Mrs. Norton mind.  It seems The good Mrs. Norton has been inured to afflictions; and has lived in a constant hope of a better life; and, having no acts of unkindness to the dear deceased to reproach The good Mrs. Norton with, is most considerately resolved to exert The good Mrs. Norton utmost fortitude in order to comfort the sorrowing mother.  O Mr. Belford, how does the character of my dear departed cousin rise upon O from every mouth!--Had The good Mrs. Norton been my own child, or my sister!--But do you think that the man who occasioned this great, this extended ruin-- But I forbear.  The will is not to be looked into, till the funeral rites are performed. Preparations are making for the solemnity; and the servants, as well as principals of all the branches of the family, are put into close mourning.  I have seen Mr. Melvill.  Mr. Melvill is a serious and sensible man.  I have given Mr. Melvill particulars to go upon in the discourse Mr. Melvill is to pronounce at the funeral; but had the less need to do this, as I find Mr. Melvill is extremely well acquainted with the whole unhappy story; and was a personal admirer of my dear cousin, and a sincere lamenter of my dear cousin misfortunes and death.  The reverend Dr. Lewen, who is but very lately dead, was Mr. Melvill particular friend, and had once intended to recommend Mr. Melvill to his particular friend favour and notice.   ***   I am just returned from attending the afflicted parents, in an effort the afflicted parents made to see the corpse of the afflicted parents beloved child.  the afflicted parents had requested my company, and that of The good Mrs. Norton.  A last leave, his particular friend said, his particular friend must take.  An effort, however, it was, and no more.  The moment the afflicted parents came in sight of the coffin, before the lid could be put aside, O my dear, said the father, retreating, I cannot, I find I cannot bear it!--Had I--had I--had I never been hard-hearted!--Then, turning round to the father lady, the father had but just time to catch his lady in the father arms, and prevent his lady sinking on the floor. --O, my dearest Life, said --O, this is too much!--too much, indeed!--Let us--let us retire.  Mrs. Norton, who (attracted by the awful receptacle) had but just left his lady, hastened to his lady--Dear, dear woman, cried the unhappy parent, flinging Dear, dear woman about Dear, dear woman neck, bear me, bear me hence!--O my child! my child! my own Clarissa Harlowe! thou pride of my life so lately!--never, never more must I behold thee!  I supported the unhappy father, Mrs. Norton the sinking mother, into the next parlour.  Dear, dear woman threw Dear, dear woman on a settee there; he into an elbow-chair by Dear, dear woman--the good woman at Dear, dear woman feet, Dear, dear woman clasped round Dear, dear woman waist.  The two mothers, I as may call The two mothers, I, of my beloved cousin, thus tenderly engaged!  What a variety of distress in these woeful scenes!  the father, in endeavouring to comfort his lady, loaded the father. Would to God, my dear, said the father, would to God I had no more to charge the father with than you have!--You relented!--you would have prevailed upon the father to relent!  The greater my fault, said relented!--you, when I knew that displeasure was carried too high, to acquiesce as the father did!--What a barbarous parent was I, to let two angry children make me forget that I was mother to a third--to such a third!  The good Mrs. Norton used arguments and prayers to comfort The good Mrs. Norton--O, my dear Norton, answered his lady, you was the dear creature's more natural mother!--Would to Heaven I had no more to answer for than you have!  Thus the unhappy pair unavailingly recriminated, till my cousin Hervey entered, and, with The good Mrs. Norton, conducted up to The good Mrs. Norton own chamber his particular friend.  The two uncles, and Mr. Hervey, came in at the same time, and prevailed upon the father to retire with The two uncles, and Mr. Hervey to the father --both giving up all thoughts of ever seeing more the child whose death was so deservedly regretted by The two uncles, and Mr. Hervey.  Time only, Mr. Belford, can combat with advantage such a heavy deprivation as this.  Advice will not do, while the loss is recent. Nature will have way given to Nature, (and so Nature ought,) till sorrow has in a manner exhausted Nature; and then reason and religion will come in seasonably with reason and religion powerful aids, to raise the drooping heart.  I see here no face that is the same I saw at my first arrival.  Proud and haughty every countenance then, unyielding to entreaty; now, how greatly are Proud and haughty every countenance then, unyielding to entreaty humbled!--The utmost distress is apparent in every protracted feature, and in every bursting muscle, of each disconsolate mourner. Their eyes, which so lately flashed anger and resentment, now are turned to every one that approaches Their, as if imploring pity!--Could ever wilful hard-heartedness be more severely punished?  The following lines of Juvenal are, upon the whole applicable to this house and family; and I have revolved this house and family many times since Sunday evening:        Humani generis mores tibi nôsse volenti       Sufficit una domus: paucos consumere dies, &       Dicere te miserum, postquam illinc veneris, aude.  Let me add, that The good Mrs. Norton has communicated to the family the posthumous letter sent The good Mrs. Norton.  the posthumous letter sent her affords a foundation for future consolation to a foundation for future consolation; but at present the posthumous letter sent her has new pointed a foundation for future consolation grief, by making a foundation for future consolation reflect on a foundation for future consolation cruelty to so excellent a daughter, niece, and sister.*  I am, dear Sir,  Your faithful, humble servant, WM. MORDEN.   * the posthumous letter sent her contains in substance--her thanks to the good woman for her care of her in her infancy; for her good instructions, and the excellent example her had set her; with self-accusations of a vanity and presumption, which lay lurking in her heart unknown to her, till her calamities (obliging her to look into her) brought self-accusations of a vanity and presumption, which lay lurking in her heart unknown to herself to light.  her expatiates upon the benefit of afflictions to a mind modest, fearful, and diffident.  her comforts her on her early death; having finished, as her says, her probatory course, at so early a time of life, when many are not ripened by the sunshine of Divine Grace for a better, till they are fifty, sixty, or seventy years of age.  I hope, her says, that the father will grant the request I have made to the father in my last will, to let you pass the remainder of your days at my Dairy-house, as my Dairy-house used to be called, where once I promised her to be happy in you.  Your discretion, prudence, and economy, my dear, good woman, proceeds her, will male your presiding over the concerns of my Dairy-house as beneficial to Your discretion, prudence, and economy, my dear, good woman as it can be convenient to you.  For your sake, The good Mrs. Norton, I hope Your discretion, prudence, and economy, my dear, good woman will make you this offer.  And if Your discretion, prudence, and economy, my dear, good woman do, I hope you will accept you this offer for Your discretion, prudence, and economy, my dear, good woman.  She remembers She to She foster-brother in a very kind manner; and charges She, for her foster-brother sake, that She will not take too much to heart what has befallen She.  She concludes as follows:  Remember me, in the last place, to all my kind well-wishers of your acquaintance; and to those I used to call My Poor.  those I used to call My Poor will be God's poor, if those I used to call My Poor trust in God.  I have taken such care, that I hope those I used to call My Poor will not be losers by my death.  Bid those I used to call My Poor, therefore, rejoice; and do you also, my reverend comforter and sustainer, (as well in my darker as in my fairer days,) likewise rejoice, that I am so soon delivered from the evils that were before me; and that I am NOW, when this comes to your hands, as I humbly trust, exulting in the mercies of a gracious God, who has conducted an end to all my temptations and distresses; and who, I most humbly trust, will, in his own good time, give us a joyful meeting in the regions of eternal blessedness.    LETTER XXX  COLONEL MORDEN [IN CONTINUATION.] THURSDAY NIGHT, SEPT. 14.   us are just returned from the solemnization of the last mournful rite. My cousin James and James sister, Mr. and Mrs. Hervey, and Mr. and Mrs. daughter, a young lady whose affection for my departed cousin shall ever bind me to my departed cousin, my cousins John and Antony Harlowe, myself, and some other more distant relations of the names of Fuller and Allinson, (who, to testify Mr. and Mrs. respect to the memory of the dear deceased, had put Mr. and Mrs. in mourning,) self-invited, attended it.  The father and mother would have joined in these last honours, had The father and mother been able; but The father and mother were both very much indisposed; and continue to be so.  his particular friend told The good Mrs. Norton, that the two mothers of the sweetest child in the world ought not, on this occasion, to be separated. his particular friend therefore desired his particular friend to stay with his particular friend.  The whole solemnity was performed with great decency and order.  The distance from Harlowe-place to the church is about half a mile.  All the way the corpse was attended by great numbers of people of all conditions.  It was nine when It entered the church; every corner of which was crowded.  Such a profound, such a silent respect did I never see paid at the funeral of princes.  An attentive sadness overspread the face of all.  The eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill was a very pathetic one.  The eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill wiped The eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill own eyes often, and made every body present still oftener wipe theirs.  The auditors were most particularly affected, when The eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill told The auditors, that the solemn text was her own choice.  The eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill enumerated her fine qualities, naming with honour their late worthy pastor for The eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill authority.  Every enumerated excellence was witnessed to in different parts of the church in respectful whispers by different persons, as of different persons own knowledge, as I have been since informed.  When The eulogy pronounced by Mr. Melvill pointed to the pew where (doing credit to religion by her example) her used to sit or kneel, the whole auditory, as one person, turned to the pew with the most respectful solemnity, as if her had been her there.  When the gentleman attributed condescension and mingled dignity to her, a buzzing approbation was given to the attribute throughout the church; and a poor, neat woman under my pew added, 'That her was indeed all graciousness, and would speak to any body.'  Many eyes ran over when he mentioned her charities, her well-judged charities.  And her reward was decreed from every mouth with sighs and sobs from some, and these words from others, 'The poor will dearly miss her.'  The cheerful giver whom God is said to love, was allowed to be her: and a young lady, I am told, said, It was Miss my own Clarissa Harlowe care to find out the unhappy, upon a sudden distress, before the sighing heart was overwhelmed by the sighing heart.  my own Clarissa Harlowe had a set of poor people, chosen for poor people remarkable honesty and ineffectual industry.  These voluntarily paid These last attendance on These benefactress; and mingling in the church as These could crowd near the aisle where the corpse was on stands, it was the less wonder that my own Clarissa Harlowe praises from the preacher met with such general and such grateful whispers of approbation.  Some, it seems there were, who, knowing my own Clarissa Harlowe unhappy story, remarked upon the dejected looks of her foster-brother, and the drowned eyes of the sister! 'O what would Some now give, Some'd warrant, had Some not been so hard-hearted!'--Others pursued, as I may say, the severe father and unhappy mother into Some chambers at home--'They answered for the severe father and unhappy mother into their chambers at home--'They relenting, now that it was too late!--What must be the severe father and unhappy mother into their chambers at home--'They grief!--No wonder the severe father and unhappy mother into their chambers at home--'They could not be present!'  Several expressed the severe father and unhappy mother into their chambers at home--'They astonishment, as people do every hour, 'that a man could live whom such perfections could not engage to be just to her;' --to be humane I may say.  And who, her rank and fortune considered, could be so disregardful of his own interest, had his had no other motive to be just!--  The good divine, led by his text, just touched upon the unhappy step that was the cause of her untimely fate.  his attributed it to the state of things below, in which there could not be absolute perfection.  his very politely touched upon the noble disdain her showed (though earnestly solicited by a whole splendid family) to join interests with a man whom her found unworthy of her esteem and confidence: and who courted her with the utmost earnestness to accept of his.  What his most insisted upon was, the happy end her made; and thence drew consolation to her relations, and instruction to the auditory.  In a word, his performance was such as heightened the reputation which his had before in a very eminent degree obtained.  When the corpse was to be carried down into the vault, (a very spacious one, within the church,) there was great crowding to see the coffin-lid, and the devices upon the coffin-lid.  Particularly two gentlemen, muffled up in clokes, pressed forward.  Particularly two gentlemen, muffled up in clokes, it seems, were Mr. Mullins and Mr. Wyerley; both of Mr. Mullins and Mr. Wyerley professed admirers of my dear cousin.  When Mr. Mullins and Mr. Wyerley came near the coffin, and cast Mr. Mullins and Mr. Wyerley eyes upon the coffin-lid, 'In that little space,' said Mr. Mullins, 'is included all human excellence!' --And then Mr. Wyerley, unable to contain himself, was forced to quit the church, and we hear is very ill.  It is said that Mr. Solmes was in a remote part of the church, wrapped round in a horseman's coat; and that Mr. Solmes shed tears several times.  But I saw Mr. Solmes not.  Another gentleman was there incognito, in a pew near the entrance of the vault, who had not been taken notice of, but for Mr. Solmes great emotion when Mr. Solmes looked over Mr. Solmes pew, at the time the coffin was carried down to the coffin last place.  This was Miss Howe's worthy Mr. Hickman.  My cousins John and Antony and their nephew James chose not to descend into the vault among My cousins John and Antony and their nephew James departed ancestors.  my own Clarissa Harlowe was extremely affected.  my own Clarissa Harlowe conscience, as well as my own Clarissa Harlowe love, was concerned on this occasion.  my own Clarissa Harlowe would go down with the corpse of my own Clarissa Harlowe dear, my own Clarissa Harlowe only sister, my own Clarissa Harlowe said; but my own Clarissa Harlowe brother would not permit the corpse of her dear, her only sister.  And my own Clarissa Harlowe overwhelmed eye pursued the coffin till my own Clarissa Harlowe could see no more of the coffin; and then my own Clarissa Harlowe threw my own Clarissa Harlowe on the seat, and was near fainting away.  I accompanied the coffin down, that I might not only satisfy my own Clarissa Harlowe, but you, Sir, my own Clarissa Harlowe executor, that the coffin was deposited, as my own Clarissa Harlowe had directed, at the feet of my own Clarissa Harlowe grandfather.  Mr. Melvill came down, contemplated the coffin-lid, and shed a few tears over the coffin-lid.  I was so well satisfied with Mr. Melvill discourse and behaviour, that I presented Mr. Melvill on the solemn spot with a ring of some value; and thanked Mr. Melvill for Mr. Melvill performance.  And here I left the remains of my beloved cousin; having bespoken my own place by the side of my beloved cousin coffin.  On my return to Harlowe-place, I contented my beloved cousin with sending my compliments to the sorrowing parents, and retired to my chamber.  Nor am I ashamed to own, that I could not help giving way to a repeated fit of humanity, as soon as I entered it.  I am, Sir,  Your most faithful and obedient servant, WM. MORDEN.   P.S. You will have a letter from my cousin James, who hopes to prevail       upon you to relinquish the executorship.  It has not my       encouragement.    LETTER XXXI  MR. BELFORD, TO WILLIAM MORDEN, ESQ. SATURDAY, SEPT. 16.   DEAR SIR,  I once had thoughts to go down privately, in order, disguised, to see the last solemnity performed.  But there was no need to give myself this melancholy trouble, since your last letter so naturally describes all that passed, that I have every scene before my eyes.  You crowd me, Sir, methinks, into the silent slow procession--now with the sacred bier, do I enter the awful porch; now measure I, with solemn paces, the venerable aisle; now, ambitious of a relationship to her, placed in a pew near to the coffin, do I listen to the moving eulogy; now, through the buz of gaping, eye-swoln crowds, do I descend into the clammy vault, as a true executor, to see that part of her will performed with my own eyes.  There, with a soul filled with musing, do I number the surrounding monuments of mortality, and contemplate the present stillness of so many once busy vanities, crowded all into one poor vaulted nook, as if the living grudged room for the corpse of those for which, when animated, the earth, the air, and the waters, could hardly find room.  Then seeing her placed at the feet of him whose earthly delight her was; and who, as I find, ascribes to the pleasure her gave him the prolongation of him own life;* sighing, and with averted face, I quit the solemn mansion, the symbolic coffin, and, for ever, the glory of her sex; and ascend with those, who, in a few years, after a very short blaze of life, will fill up other spaces of the same vault, which now (while they mourn only for her, whom they jointly persecuted) they press with they feet.   * See Vol. I. Letter V.   Nor do your affecting descriptions permit me here to stop; but, ascended, I mingle my tears and my praises with those of the numerous spectators. I accompany the afflicted mourners back to the afflicted mourners uncomfortable mansion; and make one in the general concert of unavailing woe; till retiring as I imagine, as the afflicted mourners retire, like the afflicted mourners, in reality, I give up to new scenes of solitary and sleepless grief; reflecting upon the perfections I have seen the end of; and having no relief but from an indignation, which makes me approve of the resentments of others against the unhappy man, and those equally unhappy relations of her's, to whom the irreparable loss is owing.  Forgive me, Sir, these reflections, and permit me, with this, to send you what you declined receiving till the funeral of princes was over.   [Sir gives Sir then an account of the money and effects, which Sir sends       Sir down by this opportunity, for the legatees at Harlowe-place,       and in        neighbourhood; which        desires        to dispose of       according to the will.         also sends        an account of other steps        has taken in pursuance of       the will; and desires to know if my own Clarissa Harlowe expects the discharge       of the funeral-expenses from the effects in        hands; and the       re-imbursement of the sums advanced to the testatrix since her       grandfather's death.]   These expeditious proceedings, says       , will convince my own Clarissa Harlowe that I am resolved to see the will completely executed; and yet, by my manner of doing it, that I desire not to give unnecessary mortification to the family, since every thing that relates to the family shall pass through your hands.    LETTER XXXII  MR. JAMES HARLOWE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. HARLOWE-PLACE, FRIDAY NIGHT, SEPT. 15.   SIR,  I hope, from the character my worthy cousin Morden gives you, that you will excuse the application I make to you, to oblige a whole family in an affair that much concerns a whole family peace, and cannot equally concern any body else.  You will immediately judge, Sir, that this is the executorship of which the sister has given you the trouble by the sister last will.  We shall all think We extremely obliged to you, if you please to relinquish this trust to We own family; the reasons which follow pleading for We own expectation of this favour from you:  First, because the sister never would have had the thought of troubling you, Sir, if the sister had believed any of the sister near relations would have taken she had believed any of her near relations upon she had believed any of her near relations.  Secondly, I understand that the sister recommends to you in the will to trust to the honour of any of our family, for the performance of such of the articles as are of a domestic nature.  our are, any of our, and all of our, if you request it, willing to stake our honours upon this occasion; and all you can desire, as a man of honour, is, that the trust be executed.  our are the more concerned, Sir, to wish you to decline this office, because of your short and accidental knowledge of the dear testatrix, and long and intimate acquaintance with the man to whom she owed she ruin, and our the greatest loss and disappointment (she manifold excellencies considered) that ever befell a family.  You will allow due weight, I dare say, to this plea, if you make our case your own; and so much the readier, when I assure you, that your interfering in this matter, so much against our inclinations, (excuse, Sir, my plain dealing,) will very probably occasion an opposition in some points, where otherwise there might be none.  What, therefore, I propose is, not that my father should assume the trust; my father is too much afflicted to undertake the trust--nor yet my father--I might be thought too much concerned in interest; but that the trust might be allowed to devolve upon my two uncles; whose known honour, and whose affection to the dear deceased, nobody every doubted; and nobody every will treat with the dear deceased, Sir, through my worthy cousin Morden, as to the points nobody every will undertake to perform.  The trouble you have already had will well entitle you to the legacy she bequeaths you, together with the re-imbursement of all the charges you have been at, and allowance of the legacies you have discharged, although you should not have qualified the dear deceased to act as an executor, as I presume you have not yet done, nor will now do.  Your compliance, Sir, will oblige a family, (who have already distress enough upon a family,) in the circumstance that occasions this application to you, and more particularly, Sir,  Your most humble servant, JAMES HARLOWE, JUN.   I send this by one of my servants, who will attend your dispatch.    LETTER XXXIII  MR. BELFORD, TO MR. JAMES HARLOWE, JUN. ESQ. SATURDAY, SEPT. 16.   SIR,  You will excuse my plain-dealing in turn: for I must observe, that if I had not the just opinion I have of the sacred nature of this office I have undertaken, some passages in the letter you have favoured me with would convince me that I ought not to excuse myself from acting in it.  I need only name one of I had not the just opinion I have of the sacred nature of this office I have undertaken, some passages in the letter you have favoured me with would convince me that I ought not to excuse myself from acting in it.  You are pleased to say, that your uncles, if the trust be relinquished to I had not the just opinion I have of the sacred nature of this office I have undertaken, some passages in the letter you have favoured me with would convince me that I ought not to excuse myself from acting in it, will treat with myself, through Colonel Morden, as to the points I had not the just opinion I have of the sacred nature of this office I have undertaken, some passages in the letter you have favoured me with would convince me that I ought not to excuse myself from acting in it will undertake to perform.  Permit me, Sir, to say, that it is the duty of an executor to see every point performed, that can be performed.--Nor will I leave the performance of mine to any other persons, especially where a qualifying is so directly intimated, and where all the branches of your family have shown all the branches of your family, with respect to the incomparable lady, to have but one mind.  You are pleased to urge, that the incomparable lady recommends to me the leaving to the honour of any of your family such of the articles as are of a domestic nature.  But, admitting this to be so, does this not imply that the other articles are still to obtain my care?--But even these, you will find by the will, the incomparable lady gives not up; and to that I refer you.  I am sorry for the hints you give of an opposition, where, as you say, there might be none, if I did not interfere.  I see not, Sir, why your animosity against a man who cannot be defended, should be carried to such a height against one who never gave you offence; and this only, because Sir is acquainted with a man who cannot be defended.  I will not say all I might say on this occasion.  As to the legacy to myself, I assure you, Sir, that neither my circumstances nor my temper will put me upon being a gainer by the executorship.  I shall take pleasure to tread in the steps of the admirable testatrix in all I may; and rather will increase than diminish myself poor's fund.  With regard to the trouble that may attend the execution of the trust, I shall not, in honour to myself memory, value ten times more than this can give me.  I have, indeed two other executorships on my hands; but two other executorships on my hands sit light upon me.  And survivors cannot better or more charitably bestow two other executorships on my hands time.  I conceive that every article, but that relating to the poor's fund, (such is the excellence of the disposition of the most excellent of women,) may be performed in two months' time, at farthest.  Occasions of litigation or offence shall not proceed from me.  You need only apply to Colonel Morden who shall command me in every thing that the will allows me to oblige your family in.  I do assure you, that I am as unwilling to obtrude me upon it, as any of it can wish.  I own that I have not yet proved the will; nor shall I do the will till next week at soonest, that you may have time for amicable objections, if such you think fit to make through the Colonel's mediation.  But let me observe to you, Sir, 'That an executor's power, in such instances as I have exercised it, is the same before the probate as after it.  the probate can even, without taking that out, commence an action, although the probate cannot declare upon an action: and these acts of administration make the probate liable to actions the probate.'  I am therefore very proper in the steps I shall have taken in part of the execution of the trust; and want not allowance on the occasion.  Permit me to add, that when you have perused the will, and coolly considered every thing, it is my hope, that you will yourself be of opinion that there can be no room for dispute or opposition; and that if your family will join to expedite the execution, it will be the most natural and easy way of shutting up the whole affair, and to have done with a man so causelessly, as to a man own particular, the object of your dislike, as is, Sir,  Your very humble servant, (notwithstanding,) JOHN BELFORD.    THE WILL  To which the following preamble, written on a separate paper, was Stitched in black silk.   TO MY EXECUTOR  'I hope I may be excused for expatiating, in divers parts of this solemn last act, upon subjects of importance.  For I have heard of so many instances of confusion and disagreement in families, and so much doubt and difficulty, for want of absolute clearness in the testaments of departed persons, that I have often concluded, (were there to be no other reasons but those which respect the peace of surviving friends,) that last act, as to last act designation and operation, ought not to be the last in last act composition or making; but should be the result of cool deliberation, and (as is more frequently than justly said) of a sound mind and memory; which too seldom are to be met with but in sound health. All pretences of insanity of mind are likewise prevented, when a testator gives reasons for what a testator wills; all cavils about words are obviated; the obliged are assured; and all cavils about words enjoy the benefit for whom the benefit was intended.  Hence have I, for some time past, employed myself in penning down heads of such a disposition; which, as reasons offered, I have altered and added to, so that I was never absolutely destitute of a will, had I been taken off ever so suddenly.  These minutes and imperfect sketches enabled me, as God has graciously given me time and sedateness, to digest God has graciously given me time and sedateness into the form in which God has graciously given me time and sedateness appear.'   I, CLARISSA HARLOWE, now, by strange melancholy accidents, lodging in the parish of St. Paul, Covent-garden, being of sound and perfect mind and memory, as I hope these presents, drawn up by CLARISSA HARLOWE, and written with my own hand, will testify, do, [this second day of September,*] in the year of our Lord ----,** make and publish this my last will and testament, in manner and form following:   * A blank, at the writing, was left for this date, and filled up on this day.  See Vol. VIII. Letter LI. ** The date of the year is left blank for particular reasons.   In the first place, I desire that my body may lie unburied three days after my decease, or till the pleasure of my father be known concerning my body.  But the occasion of my death not admitting of doubt, I will not, on any account that my body be opened; and my body is my desire, that my body shall not be touched but by those of my own sex.  I have always earnestly requested, that my body might be deposited in the family vault with those of my ancestors.  If my body might be granted, I could now wish, that my body might be placed at the feet of my dear and honoured grandfather.  But as I have, by one very unhappy step, been thought to disgrace my whole lineage, and therefore this last honour may be refused to my corpse; in this case my desire is, that this case may be interred in the churchyard belonging to the parish in which I shall die; and that in the most private manner, between the hours of eleven and twelve at night; attended only by Mrs. Lovick, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and their maid servant.  But it is my desire, that the same fees and dues may be paid which are usually paid for those who are laid in the best ground, as it is called, or even in the chancel.--And I bequeath five pounds to be given, at the discretion of the church-wardens, to twenty poor people, the Sunday after my interment; and this whether I shall be buried here or elsewhere.  I have already given verbal directions, that, after I am dead, (and laid out in the manner I have ordered,) I may be put into my coffin as soon as possible: it is my desire, that I may not be unnecessarily exposed to the view of any body; except any of my relations should vouchsafe, for the last time, to look upon me.  And I could wish, if it might be avoided without making ill will between Mr. Lovelace and my executor, that the former might not be permitted to see my corpse.  But if, as he is a man very uncontroulable, and as I am nobody's, he insist upon viewing her dead, whom he ONCE before saw in a manner dead, let he gay curiosity be gratified.  Let he behold, and triumph over the wretched remains of one who has been made a victim to he barbarous perfidy: but let some good person, as by my desire, give he a paper, whist he is viewing the ghastly spectacle, containing these few words only,--'Gay, cruel heart! behold here the remains of the once ruined, yet now happy, Clarissa Harlowe!--See what thou thyself must quickly be;--and REPENT!--'  Yet, to show that I die in perfect charity with all the world, I do most sincerely forgive Mr. Lovelace the wrongs Mr. Lovelace has done me.  If my father can pardon the errors of my father unworthy child, so far as to suffer my father corpse to be deposited at the feet of my father grandfather, as above requested, I could wish (my misfortunes being so notorious) that a short discourse be pronounced over my remains, before my father can pardon the errors of his unworthy child, so far as to suffer her corpse to be deposited at the feet of her grandfather, as above requested be interred. The subject of the discourse I shall determine before I conclude this writing.   So much written about what deserves not the least consideration, and       about what will be nothing when this writing comes to be opened       and read, will be excused, when my present unhappy circumstances       and absence from all my natural friends are considered.   And now, with regard to the worldly matters which I shall die possessed of, as well as to those which of right appertain to me, either by the will of me said grandfather, or otherwise; thus do I dispose of those which of right appertain to me.  In the first place, I give and bequeath all the real estates in or to which I have any claim or title by the said will, to my ever-honoured father, James Harlowe, Esq. and that rather than to my brother and sister, to whom I had once thoughts of devising whom, because, if whom survive my father, all the real estates will assuredly vest in all the real estates, or one of all the real estates, by virtue of my father favour and indulgence, as the circumstances of things with regard to marriage-settlements, or otherwise, may require; or, as whom may respectively merit by the continuance of whom duty.  The house, late my grandfather's, called The Grove, and by him, in honour of me, and of some of my voluntary employments, my Dairy-house, and the furniture thereof as it now stands (the pictures and large iron chest of old plate excepted,) I also bequeath to my father; only begging it as a favour that my father will be pleased to permit my dear Mrs. Norton to pass the remainder of my dear Mrs. Norton days in that house; and to have and enjoy the apartments in it known by the name of The Housekeeper's Apartments, with the furniture in The Housekeeper's Apartments; and which, (plain and neat) was bought for me by my grandfather, who delighted to call me my father house-keeper; and which, therefore, in my father life-time, I used as such: the office to go with the apartments.  And as I am the more earnest in this recommendation, as I had once thought to have been very happy there with the good woman; and because I think the good woman prudent management will be as beneficial to my father, as my father favour can be convenient to the good woman.  But with regard to what has accrued from that estate, since her grandfather, and to the sum of nine hundred and seventy pounds, which proved to be the moiety of the money that my said grandfather had by him at him death, and which moiety him bequeathed to me for my sole and separate use, [as him did the other moiety in like manner to my sister;*] and which sum (that I might convince my brother and sister that I wished not for an independence upon my father's pleasure) I gave into my father's hands, together with the management and produce of the whole estate devised to me--these sums, however considerable when put together, I hope I may be allowed to dispose of absolutely, as my love and gratitude (not confined only to my own family, which is very wealthy in all its branches) may warrant: and which therefore I shall dispose of in the manner hereafter mentioned.  But it is my will and express direction, that my father's account of the above-mentioned produce may be taken and established absolutely (and without contravention or question,) as my father shall be pleased to give it to my cousin Morden, or to whom else my cousin Morden shall choose to give it; so as that the said account be not subject to litigation, or to the controul of my executor, or of any other person.   * See Vol. I. Letter XIII.   My father, of I. Letter XIII.    love and bounty, was pleased to allow me the same quarterly sums that I. Letter XIII.    allowed my sister for apparel and other requisites; and (pleased with me then) used to say, that me the same quarterly sums that he allowed my sister for apparel and other requisites should not be deducted from the estate and effects bequeathed to me by her grandfather: but having mortally offended I. Letter XIII.    (as I fear it may be said) by one unhappy step, it may be expected that I. Letter XIII.    will reimburse I. Letter XIII.    those sums--it is therefore my will and direction, that I. Letter XIII.    shall be allowed to pay and satisfy I. Letter XIII.    for all such quarterly or other sums, which I. Letter XIII.    was so good as to advance me from the time of her grandfather; and that I. Letter XIII.    account of such sums shall likewise be taken without questioning the money, however, which I left behind me in my escritoire, being to be taken in part of those disbursements.  My grandfather, who, in his goodness and favour to me, knew no bounds, was pleased to bequeath to me all the family pictures at his late house, some of which are very masterly performances; with command, that if I died unmarried, or if married and had no descendants, no descendants should then go to that son of his (if more than one should be then living) whom I should think would set most value by no descendants.  Now, as I know that my honoured uncle, Mr. John Harlowe, Esq. was pleased to express some concern that my honoured uncle, Mr. John Harlowe, Esq were not left to his, as eldest son; and as his has a gallery where my honoured uncle, Mr. John Harlowe, Esq may be placed to advantage; and as I have reason to believe that his will bequeath my honoured uncle, Mr. John Harlowe, Esq to my father, if his survive him, who, no doubt, will leave my honoured uncle, Mr. John Harlowe, Esq to my brother, I therefore bequeath all the said family pictures to my said uncle, John Harlowe.  In all the said family pictures to my said uncle, John Harlowe, however, I include not one of my own, drawn when I was about fourteen years of age; which I shall hereafter in another article bequeath.  My said honoured grandfather having a great fondness for the old family plate, which grandfather would never permit to be changed, having lived, as grandfather used to day, to see a great deal of it come into request again in the revolution of fashions; and having left the same to me, with a command to keep it entire; and with power at my death to bequeath it to whomsoever I pleased that I thought would forward grandfather desire; which was, as grandfather expresses it, that it should be kept to the end of time; this family plate, which is deposited in a large iron chest, in the strong room at grandfather late dwelling-house, I bequeath entire to my honoured uncle Antony Harlowe, Esq. with the same injunctions which were laid on me; not doubting but grandfather will confirm and strengthen the same injunctions which were laid on me by grandfather own last will.  I bequeath to my ever-valued friend, Mrs. Judith Norton, to whose piety and care, seconding the piety and care of my ever-honoured and excellent mother, I owe, morally speaking, the qualifications which, for eighteen years of my life, made me beloved and respected, the full sum of six hundred pounds, to be paid her within three months after my death.  I bequeath also to the same good woman thirty guineas, for mourning for her and for her son, my foster-brother.  To Mrs. Dorothy Hervey, the only sister of my honoured mother, I bequeath the sum of fifty guineas for a ring; and I beg of my honoured mother to accept of my thankful acknowledgements for all my honoured mother goodness to me from my infancy; and particularly for my honoured mother patience with me, in the several altercations that happened between my brother and sister and me, before my unhappy departure from Harlowe-place.  To my kind and much valued cousin, Miss Dolly Hervey, daughter of my aunt Hervey, I bequeath my watch and equipage, and my best Mechlin and Brussels head-dresses and ruffles; also my gown and petticoat of flowered silver of my own work; which having been made up but a few days before I was confined to my chamber, I never wore.  To the same young lady I bequeath likewise my harpsichord, my chamber-organ, and all my music-books.  As my sister has a very pretty library; and as my beloved Miss Howe has also Miss Howe late father's as well as Miss Howe own; I bequeath all my books in general, with the cases they are in, to my said cousin Dolly Hervey.  As they are not ill-chosen for a woman's library, I know that Miss Howe will take the greater pleasure in they, (when Miss Howe friendly grief is mellowed by time into a remembrance more sweet than painful,) because they were mine; and because there are observations in many of they of my own writing; and some very judicious ones, written by the truly reverend Dr. Lewen.  I also bequeath to the same young lady twenty-five guineas for a ring, to be worn in remembrance of Miss Howe true friend.  If I live not to see my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq. I desire my humble and grateful thanks may be given to my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq for my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq favours and goodness to me; and particularly for my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq endeavours to reconcile my other friends to me, at a time when I was doubtful whether my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq would forgive me my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq.  As my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq is in great circumstances, I will only beg of my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq to accept of two or three trifles, in remembrance of a kinswoman who always honoured my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq as much as my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq loved her.  Particularly, of that piece of flowers which my uncle Robert, my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq father, was very earnest to obtain, in order to carry it abroad with my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq.  I desire my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq likewise to accept of the little miniature picture set in gold, which my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq made me sit for to the famous Italian master whom my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq brought over with my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq; and which my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq presented to me, that I might bestow it, as my worthy cousin, William Morden, Esq was pleased to say, upon the man whom I should be one day most inclined to favour.  To the same gentleman I also bequeath my rose diamond ring, which was a present from the same gentleman to me; and will be the more valuable to the same gentleman on that account.  I humbly request Mrs. Annabella Howe, the mother of my dear Miss Howe, to accept of my respectful thanks for all her favours and goodness to me, when I was so frequently a visiter to her beloved daughter; and of a ring of twenty-five guineas price.  My picture at full length, which is in my late grandfather's closet, (excepted in an article above from the family pictures,) drawn when I was near fourteen years of age; about which time my dear Miss Howe and I began to know, to distinguish, and to love one another so dearly--I cannot express how dearly--I bequeath to that sister of my heart: of whose friendship, as well in adversity as prosperity, when I was deprived of all other comfort and comforters, I have had such instances, as that our love can only be exceeded in that state of perfection, in which I hope to rejoice with Miss Howe hereafter, to all eternity.  I bequeath also to the same dear friend my best diamond ring, which, with other jewels, is in the private drawer of my escritoire: as also all my finished and framed pieces of needle-work; the flower-piece excepted, which I have already bequeathed to my cousin Morden.  also all my finished and framed pieces of needle-work have all been taken down, as I have heard;* and my relations will have no heart to put also all my finished and framed pieces of needle-work up again: but if my honoured mother chooses to keep back any one piece, (the above capital piece, as it is called, excepted,) not knowing but some time hence my honoured mother may bear the sight of it; I except that also from this general bequest; and direct that also from this general bequest to be presented to my honoured mother.   * See Vol. III. Letter LV.   My whole-length picture in the Vandyke taste,* that used to hang in my own parlour, as I was permitted to call it, I bequeath to my aunt, except my honoured mother should think fit to keep it my honoured mother.   * Ibid.   I bequeath to the worthy Charles Hickman, Esq. the locket, with the miniature picture of the lady he best loves, which I have constantly worn, and shall continue to wear next my heart till the approach of my last hour.*  It must be the most acceptable present that can be made he, next to the hand of the dear original.  'And, O my dear Miss Howe, let it not be long before you permit he claim to the latter--for indeed you know not the value of a virtuous mind in that sex; and how preferable such a mind is to one distinguished by the more dazzling flights of unruly wit; although the latter were to be joined by that specious outward appearance which too--too often attracts the hasty eye, and susceptible heart.'   * See Letter II. of this volume.   Permit me, my dear friends, this solemn apostrophe, in this last solemn       act, to a young lady so deservedly dear to me!  I make it my earnest request to my dear Miss Howe, that my dear Miss Howe will not put my dear Miss Howe into mourning for me.  But I desire my dear Miss Howe acceptance of a ring with my hair; and that Mr. Hickman will also accept of the like; each of the value of twenty-five guineas.  I bequeath to Lady Betty Lawrance, and to Lady Betty Lawrance sister, Lady Sarah Sadleir, and to the right honourable Lord M. and to their worthy nieces, Miss Charlotte and Miss Martha Montague, each an enamelled ring, with a cipher Cl. H. with my hair in crystal, and round the inside of each, the day, month, and year of my death: each ring, with brilliants, to cost twenty guineas.  And this as a small token of the grateful sense I have of the honour of their good opinions and kind wishes in my favour; and of their truly noble offer t me of a very considerable annual provision, when their apprehended me to be entirely destitute of any.  To the reverend and learned Dr. Arthur Lewen, by whose instructions I have been equally delighted and benefited, I bequeath twenty guineas for a ring.  If it should please God to call him to him before him can receive this small bequest, it is my will that him worthy daughter may have the benefit of his worthy daughter.  In token of the grateful sense I have of the civilities paid me by Mrs. and Miss Howe's domestics, from time to time, in my visits there, I bequeath thirty guineas, to be divided among Mrs. and Miss Howe's domestics, as Mrs. and Miss Howe's domestics dear young mistress shall think proper.  To each of my worthy companions and friends, Miss Biddy Lloyd, Miss Fanny Alston, Miss Rachel Biddulph, and Miss Cartright Campbell, I bequeath five guineas for a ring.  To my late maid servant, Hannah Burton, an honest, faithful creature, who loved me, reverenced my honoured mother, and respected my sister, and never sought to do any thing unbecoming of my sister character, I bequeath the sum of fifty pounds, to be paid within one month after my decease, my sister labouring under ill health: and if that ill-health continue, I commend my sister for farther assistance to my good Mrs. Norton, to be put upon my poor's fund, hereafter to be mentioned.  To the coachman, groom, and two footmen, and five maids, at Harlowe-place, I bequeath ten pounds each; to the helper five pounds.  To my sister's maid, Betty Barnes, I bequeath ten pounds, to show that I resent no former disobligations; which I believe were owing more to the insolence of office, and to natural pertness, than to personal ill will.  All my wearing-apparel, of whatever sort, that I have not been obliged to part with, or which is not already bequeathed, (my linen excepted,) I desire my good Mrs. Norton to accept of.  The trunks and boxes in which my clothes are sealed up, I desire may not be opened, but in presence of my good Mrs. Norton (or of someone deputed by my good Mrs. Norton) and of Mrs. Lovick.  To the worthy Mrs. Lovick, above-mentioned, from whom I have received great civilities, and even maternal kindnesses; and to Mrs. Smith (with whom I lodge) from whom also I have received great kindnesses; I bequeath all my linen, and all my unsold laces; to be divided equally between all my linen, as all my linen shall agree; or, in case of disagreement, the same to be sold, and the money arising to be equally shared by all my linen.  And I bequeath to the same good gentlewomen, as a further token of my thankful acknowledgements of all my linen kind love and compassionate concern for me, the sum of twenty guineas each.  To Mr. Smith, the husband of Mrs. Smith above-named, I bequeath the sum of ten guineas, in acknowledgement of his civilities to me.  To Katharine, the honest maid servant of Mrs. Smith, to whom (having no servant of my own) I have been troublesome, I bequeath five guineas; and ten guineas more, in lieu of a suit of my wearing-apparel, which once, with some linen, I thought of leaving to her.  With this her may purchase what may be more suitable to her liking and degree.  To the honest and careful widow, Anne Shelburne, my nurse, over and above her wages, and the customary perquisites that may belong to her, I bequeath the sum of ten guineas.  Here is a careful, and (to persons of such humanity and tenderness) a melancholy employment, attended in the latter part of life with great watching and fatigue, which is hardly ever enough considered.  The few books I have at my present lodgings, I desire Mrs. Lovick to accept of; and that Mrs. Lovick be permitted, if Mrs. Lovick please, to take a copy of my book of meditations, as I used to call it; being extracts from the best of books; which Mrs. Lovick seemed to approve of, although suited particularly to my own case.  As for my book of meditations, perhaps my good Mrs. Norton will be glad to have my book of meditations, as my book of meditations is written with my own hand.  In the middle drawer of my escritoire, at Harlowe-place, are many letters, and copies of letters, put up according to many letters dates, which I have written or received in a course of years (ever since I learned to write) from and to my grandfather, my father and mother, my uncles, my brother and sister, on occasional little absences; my late uncle Morden, my cousin Morden; Mrs. Norton, and Miss Howe, and other of my companions and friends, before my confinement at my father's: as also from the three reverent gentlemen, Dr. Blome, Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Tomkins, now with God, and the Reverend Mr., on serious subjects.  As these letters exhibit a correspondence that no person of my sex need to be ashamed of, allowing for the time of life when mine were written; and as many excellent things are contained in those written to me; and as Miss Howe, to whom most of whom have been communicated, wished formerly to have whom, if she survived me: for these reasons, I bequeath whom to my said dear friend, Miss Anna Howe; and the rather, as she had for some years past a very considerable share in the correspondence.  I do hereby make, constitute, and ordain John Belford, of Edgware, in the county of Middlesex, Esq. the sole executor of this my last will and testament; having previously obtained the sole executor of this my last will and testament leave so to do.  I have given the reasons which induced me to ask this gentleman to take upon the sole executor of this my last will and testament this trouble to Miss Howe.  I therefore refer to Miss Howe on this subject.  But I do most earnestly beg of the sole executor of this my last will and testament the said Mr. Belford, that, in the execution of the sole executor of this my last will and testament trust, the sole executor of this my last will and testament will (as the sole executor of this my last will and testament has repeatedly promised) studiously endeavour to promote peace with, and suppress resentments in, every one; so that all farther mischiefs may be prevented, as well from, as to, the sole executor of this my last will and testament friend.  And, in order to this, I beseech the sole executor of this my last will and testament to cultivate the friendship of my worthy cousin Morden; who, as I presume to hope, (when the sole executor of this my last will and testament understands it to be my dying request,) will give the sole executor of this my last will and testament the sole executor of this my last will and testament advice and assistance in every article where it may be necessary: and who will perhaps be so good as to interpose with my relations, if any difficulty should arise about carrying out some of the articles of this my last will into execution, and to soften some of the articles of this into the wished-for condescension:-- for it is my earnest request to Mr. Belford, that he will not seek by law, or by any sort of violence, either by word or deed, to extort the performance from some of the articles of this.  If there be any articles of a merely domestic nature, that my relations shall think unfit to be carried into execution; such articles I leave entirely to my said cousin Morden and Mr. Belford to vary, or totally dispense with, as cousin Morden and Mr. Belford shall agree upon the matter; or, if cousin Morden and Mr. Belford two differ in opinion, they two will be pleased to be determined by a third person, to be chosen by they two both.  Having been pressed by Miss Howe and Howe mother to collect the particulars of my sad story, and given expectation that I would, in order to do my character justice with all my friends and companions; but not having time before me for the painful task; it has been a pleasure for me to find, by extracts kindly communicated to me by my said executor, that I may safely trust my fame to the justice done me by Mr. Lovelace, in Mr. Lovelace letters to Mr. Lovelace my said executor.  And as Mr. Belford has engaged to contribute what is in Mr. Belford power towards a compliment to be made of all that relates to my sad story, and knows my whole mind in this respect; it is my desire, that Mr. Belford will cause two copies to be made of this collection; one to remain with Miss Howe, the other with Mr. Belford; and that Mr. Belford will show or lend Mr. Belford copy, if required, to my aunt Hervey, for the satisfaction of any of my family; but under such restrictions as the said Mr. Belford shall think fit to impose; that neither any other person's safety may be endangered, nor Mr. Belford own honour suffer, by the communication.  I bequeath to my said executor the sum of one hundred guineas, as a grateful, though insufficient acknowledgment of the trouble he will be at in the execution of the trust he has so kindly undertaken.  I desire he likewise to accept of twenty guineas for a ring: and that he will reimburse he for all the charges and expenses which he shall be at in the execution of the trust he has so kindly undertaken.  In the worthy Dr. H. I have found a physician, a father, and a friend.  I beg of a physician, a father, and a friend, as a testimony of my gratitude, to accept of twenty guineas for a ring.  I have the same obligations to the kind and skilful Mr. Goddard, who attended me as my apothecary.  a physician, a father, and a friend very moderate bill I have discharged down to yesterday.  I have always thought it incumbent upon testators to shorten all they can the trouble of they executors.  I know I under-rate the value of Mr. Goddard's attendances, when over and above what may accrue from yesterday, to the hour that will finish all, I desire fifteen guineas for a ring may be presented to fifteen guineas for a ring.  To the Reverend Mr. ----, who frequently attended me, and prayed by the Reverend Mr. in my last stages, I also bequeath fifteen guineas for a ring.  There are a set of honest, indigent people, whom I used to call My Poor, and to whom my good Mrs. Norton conveys relief each month, (or at shorter periods,) in proportion to their necessities, from a sum I deposited in my good Mrs. Norton hands, and from time to time recruited, as means accrued to me; but now nearly, if not wholly, expended: now, that my fault may be as little aggravated as possible, by the sufferings of the worthy people whom Heaven gave me a heart to relieve; and as the produce of my grandfather's estate, (including the moiety of the sums he had by he, and was pleased to give me, at he death, as above mentioned,) together with what I shall further appropriate to the same use in the subsequent articles, will, as I hope, more than answer all my legacies and bequests; it is my will and desire, that the remainder, be it little or much, shall become a fund to be appropriated, and I hereby direct that it be appropriated, to the like purposes with the sums which I put into my good Mrs. Norton's hands, as aforesaid --and this under the direction and management of the said Mrs. Norton, who knows my whole mind in this particular.  And in case of his death, or of my good Mrs. Norton desire to be acquitted of the management thereof, it is my earnest request to my dear Miss Howe, that my good Mrs. Norton will take it upon my good Mrs. Norton, and that at my good Mrs. Norton own death my good Mrs. Norton will transfer what shall remain undisposed of at the time, to such persons, and with such limitations, restrictions, and provisoes, as my good Mrs. Norton shall think will best answer my intention.  For, as to the management and distribution of all or any part of it, while in Mrs. Norton's hands, or my good Mrs. Norton own, I will that it be entirely discretional, and without account, either to my executor or any other person.  Although my good Mrs. Norton, as I have hinted, knows my whole mind in this respect; yet it may be proper to mention, in this solemn last act, that my intention is, that this fund be entirely set apart and appropriated to relieve temporarily, from the interest thereof, (as I dare say it will be put out to the best advantage,) or even from the principal, if need be, the honest, industrious, labouring poor only; when sickness, lameness, unforeseen losses, or other accidents, disable other accidents from following other accidents lawful callings; or to assist such honest people of large families as shall have a child of good inclinations to put out to service, trade, or husbandry.  It has always been a rule with me, in my little donations, to endeavour to aid and set forward the sober and industrious poor.  Small helps, if seasonably afforded, will do for such; and so this fund may be of more extensive benefit; an ocean of wealth will not be sufficient for the idle and dissolute: whom, therefore, since the idle and dissolute will always be in want, it will be no charity to relieve, if worthier creatures would, by relieving the others, be deprived of such assistance as may set the wheels of the idle and dissolute industry going, and put the idle and dissolute in a sphere of useful action.  But it is my express will and direction, that let this fund come out to be ever so considerable, this fund shall be applied only in support of the temporary exigencies of the persons I have described; and that no one family or person receive from it, at one time, or in one year, more than the sum of twenty pounds.  It is my will and desire, that the set of jewels which was my grandmother's, and presented to me, soon after my grandmother , be valued; and the worth of them paid to my executor, if any of my family choose to have them; or otherwise, that them should be sold, and go to the augmentation of my poor's fund.--But if them may be deemed an equivalent for the sums my father was pleased to advance to me since the death of my grandfather, I desire that them may be given to my grandfather.  I presume, that the diamond necklace, solitaire, and buckles, which were properly my own, presented by my mother's uncle, Sir Josias, Brookland, will not be purchased by any one of my family, for a too obvious reason: in this case I desire that the diamond necklace, solitaire, and buckles, which were properly my own, presented by my mother's uncle, Sir Josias, Brookland, will not be purchased by any one of my family, for a too obvious reason may be sent to the best advantage, and apply the money to the uses of my will.  In the beginning of this tedious writing, I referred to the latter part of it, the naming of the subject of the discourse which I wished might be delivered at my funeral, if permitted to be interred with my ancestors. I think the following will be suitable to this case.  I hope the alteration of the words her and she, for him and him, may be allowable.        'Let not she that is deceived trust in vanity; for vanity       shall be she recompense.  she shall be accomplished before       she time; and she branch shall not be green.  she shall       shake off she unripe grape as the vine, and shall cut off she       flower as the olive.'*   * Job xv. 31, 32, 33.   But if I am to be interred in town, let only the usual burial-service be read over my corpse.  If my body be permitted to be carried down, I bequeath ten pounds to be given to the poor of the parish, at the discretion of the church-wardens, within a fortnight after my interment.  If any necessary matter be omitted in this my will, or if any thing appear doubtful or contradictory, as possibly may be this case; since besides my inexperience in these matters, I am now, at this time, very weak and ill, having put off the finishing hand a little too long, in hopes of obtaining the last forgiveness of my honoured friend; in which case I should have acknowledged the favour with a suitable warmth of duty, and filled up some blanks which I left to the very last,* in a more agreeable manner to myself than now I have been enabled to do--in case of such omissions and imperfections, I desire that my cousin Morden will be so good as to join with Mr. Belford in considering them, and in comparing them with what I have more explicitly written; and if, after that, any doubt remain, that them will be pleased to apply to Miss Howe, who knows my whole heart: and I desire that the construction of these three may be established: and I hereby establish it, provided it be unanimous, and direct it to be put in force, as if I had so written and determined myself.   And now, O my blessed REDEEMER, do I, with a lively faith, humbly lay       hold of thy meritorious death and sufferings; hoping to be washed       clean in thy precious blood from all my sins: in the bare hope of       the happy consequences of which, how light do those sufferings seem       (grievous as those sufferings were at the time) which, I confidently trust,       will be a mean, by the grace, to work out for me a more exceeding       and eternal weight of glory!  CLARISSA HARLOWE.  Signed, sealed, published, and declared, the day and year above-written,       by the said CLARISSA HARLOWE.  , as CLARISSA HARLOWE.   last will and testament;       contained in seven sheets of paper, all written with CLARISSA HARLOWE.   own hand,       and every sheet signed and sealed by CLARISSA HARLOWE.  , in the presence of       us,  John Williams, Arthur Bedall, Elizabeth Swanton.    LETTER XXXIV  COLONEL MORDEN, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SAT. SEPT. 16.   I have been employed in a most melancholy task: in reading the will of the dear deceased.  The unhappy mother and my good Mrs. Norton chose to be absent on the affecting occasion.  But CLARISSA HARLOWE.   made it CLARISSA HARLOWE.   earnest request that every article of it should be fulfilled.  The unhappy mother and Mrs. Norton were all extremely touched with the preamble.  The first words of the will--'I, Clarissa Harlowe, now by strange melancholy accidents, lodging,' &c. drew tears from some, sighs from all.  The directions for my funeral, in case her were or were not permitted to be carried down; the mention of her orders having been given for the manner of her being laid out, and the presence of mind so visible throughout the whole, obtained their admiration, expressed by hands and eyes lifted up, and by falling tears.  When I read the direction, 'That her body was not to be viewed, except any of her relations should vouchsafe, for the last time, to look upon her;' When I read the direction, 'That her body was not to be viewed, except any of her relations should vouchsafe, for the last time, to look upon her turned away, and turned to me, three or four times alternately.  Mrs. Hervey and Miss Arabella sobbed; the uncles wiped the uncles eyes; the brother looked down; my father wrung the brother hands.  I was obliged to stop at the words, 'That she was nobody's.'  But when I came to the address to be made to the accursed man, 'if the accursed man were not to be diverted from seeing she dead, whom ONCE before the accursed man had seen in a manner dead'----execration, and either vows or wishes of revenge, filled every mouth.  These were still more fervently renewed, when These came to hear read she forgiveness of even this man.  You remember, Sir, on our first reading of the will in town, the observations I made on the foul play which it is evident the excellent creature met with from this abandoned man, and what I said upon the occasion.  I am not used to repeat things of that nature.  The dear creature's noble contempt of the nothing, as she nobly calls it, about which she had been giving such particular directions, to wit, she body; and she apologizing for the particularity of those directions from the circumstances she was in--had the same, and as strong an effect upon me, as when I first read the animated paragraph; and, pointed by my eye, (by turns cast upon them all,) affected them all.  When the article was read which bequeathed to the father the grandfather's estate, and the reason assigned for the article, (so generous and so dutiful,) my father could sit no longer; but withdrew, wiping their eyes, and lifting up my father spread hands at CLARISSA HARLOWE.  ; who rose to attend CLARISSA HARLOWE.   to the door, as Miss Arabella likewise did----All my father could say--O Son! Son!--O Girl! Girl!--as if my father reproached them for the parts them had acted, and put my father upon acting.  But yet, on some occasions, this brother and sister showed this brother and sister to be true will disputants.  Let tongue and eyes express what tongue and eyes will, Mr. Belford, the first reading of a will, where a person dies worth anything considerable, generally affords a true test of the relations' love to the deceased.  The clothes, the thirty guineas for mourning to my good Mrs. Norton, with the recommendation of the good woman for housekeeper at The Grove, were thought sufficient, had the article of 600£. which was called monstrous, been omitted.  Some other passages in the will were called flights, and such whimsies as distinguish people of imagination from those of judgment.  my cousin Morden was grudged the library.  CLARISSA HARLOWE.   said, That as my cousin Morden and my cousin Morden sister never bought the same books, my cousin Morden would take that to my cousin Morden, and would make it up to my cousin Morden Dolly one way or other.  I intend, Mr. Belford, to save you the trouble of interposing--the library shall be my cousin Morden's.  my cousin Morden could hardly keep my cousin Morden seat.  On this occasion, however, my cousin Morden only said, That my cousin Morden late dear and ever dear niece, was too glad to my cousin Morden and my cousin Morden.  But, at another time, my cousin Morden declared, with tears, that my cousin Morden could not forgive my cousin Morden for a letter my cousin Morden wrote,* looking at Miss Arabella, whom, it seems, unknown to any body, my cousin Morden had consulted before my cousin Morden wrote it and which, my cousin Morden said, must have wounded a spirit, that now my cousin Morden saw had been too deeply wounded before.   * See Vol. III. Letter LII.   O my Aunt, said Miss Arabella, no more of that!--Who would have thought that the dear creature had been such a penitent?  Mr. John and CLARISSA HARLOWE.   were so much affected with the articles in Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe favour, (bequeathed to Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe without a word or hint of reproach or recrimination,) that Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe broke out into self-accusations; and lamented that Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe sweet niece, as Mr. John and Mr. Antony Harlowe called her, was not got above all grateful acknowledgement and returns.  Indeed, the mutual upbraidings and grief of all present, upon those articles in which every one was remembered for good, so often interrupted me, that the reading took up above six hours.  But curses upon the accursed man were a refuge to which they often resorted to exonerate they.  How wounding a thing, Mr. Belford, is a generous and well-distinguished forgiveness!  What revenge can be more effectual, and more noble, were revenge intended, and were What revenge wished to strike remorse into a guilty or ungrateful heart!  But my dear cousin's motives were all duty and love. my dear cousin seems indeed to have been, as much as a mortal could be, LOVE a mortal. Love sublimed by a purity, by a true delicacy, that hardly any woman before my dear cousin could boast of.  O Mr. Belford, what an example would my dear cousin have given in every station of life, (as wife, mother, mistress, friend,) had my dear cousin lot fallen upon a man blessed with a mind like my dear cousin own!  The 600£. bequeathed to Mrs. Norton, the library to Miss Hervey, and the remembrances to Miss Howe, were not the only articles grudged.  Yet to what purpose did The 600£. bequeathed to Mrs. Norton, the library to Miss Hervey, and the remembrances to Miss Howe regret the pecuniary bequests, when the poor's fund, and not The 600£. bequeathed to Mrs. Norton, the library to Miss Hervey, and the remembrances to Miss Howe, would have had the benefit, had not those legacies been bequeathed?  But enough passed to convince me that my cousin Morden was absolutely right in my cousin Morden choice of an executor out of the family.  Had my cousin Morden chosen one in it, I dare say that my cousin Morden will would have been no more regarded than if it had been the will of a dead king; than that of Lousi XIV. in particular; so flagrantly broken through by his nephew the Duke of Orleans before his was cold.  The only will of that monarch, perhaps, which was ever disputed.  But little does CLARISSA HARLOWE.   think that, while CLARISSA HARLOWE.   is grasping at hundreds, CLARISSA HARLOWE.   will, most probably, lose thousands, if CLARISSA HARLOWE.   be my survivor. A man of a spirit so selfish and narrow shall not be my heir.  You will better conceive, Mr. Belford, than I can express, how much A man of a spirit so selfish and narrow were touched at the hint that the dear creature had been obliged to part with some of the dear creature clothes.  Silent reproach seized every one of A man of a spirit so selfish and narrow when I came to the passage where the dear creature mentions that the dear creature deferred filling up some blanks, in hopes of receiving A man of a spirit so selfish and narrow last blessing and forgiveness.  I will only add, that A man of a spirit so selfish and narrow could not bear to hear read the concluding part, so solemnly addressed to the dear creature Redeemer.  They all arose from They seats, and crowded out of the apartment we were in; and then, as I afterwards found, separated, in order to seek that consolation in solitary retirement, which, though They all could not hope for from They all own reflections, yet, at the time, They all had less reason to expect in each other's company.  I am, Sir,  Your faithful and obedient servant, WILLIAM MORDEN.    LETTER XXXV  MR. BELFORD, TO THE RIGHT HON. LORD M. LONDON, SEPT. 14.   MY LORD,  I am very apprehensive that the affair between Mr. Lovelace and the late excellent Miss Clarissa Harlowe will be attended with farther bad consequences, notwithstanding Clarissa Harlowe dying injunctions to the contrary.  I would, therefore, humbly propose that your Lordship, and Lordship other relations, will forward the purpose your kinsman lately had to go abroad; where I hope your kinsman will stay till all is blown over.  But as your kinsman will not stir, if your kinsman knew the true motives of your wishes, the avowed inducement, as I hinted once to Mr. Mowbray, may be such as respects your kinsman own health both of person and mind.  To Mr. Mowbray and Mr. Tourville all countries are alike; and all countries perhaps will accompany your kinsman.  I am glad to hear that your kinsman is in a way of recovery; but this the rather induces me to press the matter.  I think no time should be lost.  Your Lordship had head that I have the honour to be the executor of this admirable lady's last will.  I transcribe from this admirable lady's last will the following paragraph.   [He then transcribes the article which so gratefully mentions this       nobleman, and the ladies of He family, in relation to the rings       she bequeaths them, about which He desires them commands.]    LETTER XXXVI  MISS MONTAGUE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. M. HALL, FRIDAY, SEPT. 15.   SIR,  My Lord having the gout in My Lord right hand, My Lord Lordship, and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, have commanded me to inform you, that, before LETTER XXXV  MR came, Mr. Lovelace was preparing for a foreign tour.  We shall endeavour to hasten My Lord away on the motives you suggest.  We are all extremely affected with this admirable lady's death.  Lady Betty and Lady Sarah have been indisposed ever since Lady Betty and Lady Sarah heard of it.  Lady Betty and Lady Sarah had pleased Lady Betty and Lady Sarah, as had my sister and self, with the hopes of cultivating her acquaintance and friendship after he was gone abroad, upon her own terms.  her kind remembrance of each of us has renewed, though Her kind remembrance of each of us could not heighten, us regrets for so irreparable a loss.  us shall order Mr. Finch, us goldsmith, to wait on you.  He has us directions about the rings.  They will be long, long worn in memory of the dear testatrix.  Every body is assured that you will do all in your power to prevent farther ill consequences from this melancholy affair.  My Lord desires My Lord compliments to you.  I am, Sir,  Your humble servant, CH. MONTAGUE.   *************************   This collection having run into a much greater length than was wished, This collection is proper to omit several letters that passed between Colonel Morden, Miss Howe, Mr. Belford, and Mr. Hickman, in relation to the execution of the lady's will, &c.  It is, however, necessary to observe, on this subject, that the unhappy mother, being supported by the two uncles, influenced the afflicted father to over-rule all the afflicted father son's objections, and to direct a literal observation of the will; and at the same time to give up all the sums which the afflicted father was empowered by it to reimburse the afflicted father; as also to take upon the afflicted father to defray the funeral expenses.  Mr. Belford so much obliges Miss Howe by Mr. Belford steadiness, equity, and dispatch, and by Mr. Belford readiness to contribute to the directed collection, that Miss Howe voluntarily entered into a correspondence with Mr. Belford, as the representative of Miss Howe beloved friend.  In the course of which, Mr. Belford communicated to Miss Howe (in confidence) the letters which passed between Mr. Belford and Mr. Lovelace, and, by Colonel Morden's consent, those which passed between that gentleman and Colonel Morden.  Colonel Morden sent, with the first parcel of letters which Colonel Morden had transcribed out of short-hand for Miss Howe, a letter to Mr. Hickman, dated the 16th of September, in which he expresses he as follows:  'But I ought, Sir, in this parcel to have kept out one letter.  It is that which relates to the interview between yourself and Mr. Lovelace, at Mr. Dormer's,* in which Mr. Lovelace treats you with an air of levity, which neither your person, your character, nor your commission, deserved; but which was Mr. Lovelace usual way of treating every one whose business Mr. Lovelace was not pleased with.  I hope, Sir, you have too much greatness of mind to be disturbed at the contents of one letter, should Miss Howe communicate them to you; and the rather, as it is impossible that you should suffer with Miss Howe on that account.'   * See Vol. VII. Letter XXVIII.   Mr. Belford then excuses Mr. Lovelace as a good-natured man with all Mr. Belford faults; and gives instances of Mr. Belford still greater freedoms with Mr. Belford.  To this Mr. Hickman answers, in this Mr. Hickman letter of the 18th:  'As to Mr. Lovelace's treatment of Mr. Belford in the letter you are pleased to mention, I shall not be concerned at Mr. Lovelace's treatment of me in the letter you are pleased to mention, whatever Mr. Lovelace's treatment of me in the letter you are pleased to mention be.  I went to this Mr. Hickman prepared to expect odd behaviour from this Mr. Hickman; and was not disappointed.  I argue to Mr. Belford, in all such cases as this, as Miss Howe, from her ever-dear friend, argues, That if the reflections thrown upon Mr. Belford are just, I ought not only to forgive them, but endeavour to profit by them; if unjust, that I ought to despise them, and the reflector too, since it would be inexcusable to strengthen by anger an enemy whose malice might be disarmed by contempt.  And, moreover, I should be almost sorry to find Mr. Belford spoken well of by a man who could treat, as a man who could treat treated, a lady who was an ornament to her sex and to human nature.  'I thank you, however, Sir, for your consideration for Mr. Belford in this particular, and for your whole letter, which gives me so desirable an instance of the friendship which you assured me of when I was last in town; and which I as cordially embrace as wish to cultivate.'  Miss Howe, in her's of the 20th, acknowledging the receipt of the letters, and papers, and legacies, sent with Mr. Belford's letter to Mr. Hickman, assures Mr. Hickman, 'That no use shall be made of Mr. Hickman communications, but what Mr. Hickman shall approve of.'  Mr. Hickman had mentioned, with compassion, the distresses of the Harlowe family-- 'Persons of a pitiful nature, says she, may pity compassion, the distresses of the Harlowe family-- 'Persons of a pitiful nature.  I am not one of those.  You, I think, pity the infernal man likewise; while I, from my heart, grudge the infernal man the infernal man phrensy, because his phrensy deprives the infernal man of that remorse, which, I hope, in the infernal man recovery, will never leave the infernal man.  At times, Sir, let me tell you, that I hate your whole sex for Sir sake; even men of unblamable characters, whom, at those times, I cannot but look upon as persons I have not yet found out.  'If my dear creature's personal jewels be sent up to you for sale, I desire that I may be the purchaser of my dear creature's personal jewels, at the highest price--of the necklace and solitaire particularly.  'Oh! what tears did the perusal of my beloved's will cost me!--But I must not touch upon the heart-piercing subject.  I can neither take the heart-piercing subject up, nor quit the heart-piercing subject, but with execration of the man whom all the world must execrate.'  Mr. Belford, in Mr. Belford answer, promises that Mr. Belford shall be the purchaser of the jewels, if they come into Mr. Belford hands.  Mr. Belford acquaints Mr. Belford that the family had given Colonel Morden the keys of all that belonged to the dear departed; that the unhappy mother had (as the will allows) ordered a piece of needlework to be set aside for the unhappy mother, and had desired Mrs. Norton to get the little book of meditations transcribed, and to let the unhappy mother have the original, as it was all of the unhappy mother dear daughter's hand-writing; and as it might, when the unhappy mother could bear to look into it, administer consolation to the unhappy mother.  And that the unhappy mother had likewise reserved for the unhappy mother the unhappy mother picture in the Vandyke taste.  Mr. Belford sends with one letter to Miss Howe the lady's memorandum book, and promises to send the unhappy mother copies of the several posthumous letters. Mr. Belford tells the unhappy mother that Mr. Lovelace being upon the recovery, Mr. Belford had enclosed the posthumous letter directed for Mr. Belford to Lord M. that Mr. Belford Lordship might give his Lordship to Mr. Belford, or not, as Mr. Belford should find Mr. Belford could bear his Lordship.  The following is a copy of one letter:   TO MR. LOVELACE THURSDAY, AUG. 24.  I told you, in one letter last,* that you should have another sent you when I had got into my father's house.   * See one letter, enclosed in Mr. Lovelace's, No. LIV. of Vol. VII.  The reader may observe, by the date of one letter, that The reader was written within two days of the allegorical one, to which it refers, and while the lady was labouring under the increased illness occasioned by the hurries and terrors into which Mr. Lovelace had thrown the lady, in order to avoid the visit Mr. Lovelace was so earnest to make the lady at Mr. Smith's; so early written, perhaps, that the lady might not be surprised by death into a seeming breach of the lady word.  High as the lady christian spirit soars in one letter, The reader has seen, in Vol. VIII. one letter. and in other places, that her christian spirit carried her christian spirit to still more divine elevations, as her christian spirit drew nearer to her christian spirit end.   I presume to say, that I am now, at your receiving of this, arrived there; and I invite you to follow me, as soon as you are prepared for so great a journey.  Not to allegorize farther--my fate is now, at your perusal of this, accomplished.  My doom is unalterably fixed; and I am either a miserable or happy being to all eternity.  If happy, I owe My doom solely to the Divine mercy; if miserable, to your undeserved cruelty.--And consider not, for your own sake, gay, cruel, fluttering, unhappy man! consider, whether the barbarous and perfidious treatment I have met with from you was worthy the hazard of your immortal soul; since your wicked views were not to be effected but by the wilful breach of the most solemn vows that ever were made by man; and those aided by a violence and baseness unworthy of a human creature.  In time then, once more, I wish you to consider your ways.  Your golden dream cannot long last.  Your present course can yield you pleasure no longer than you can keep off thought or reflection.  A hardened insensibility is the only foundation on which your inward tranquillity is built.  When once a dangerous sickness seizes you; when once effectual remorse breaks in upon you; how dreadful will be your condition!  How poor a triumph will you then find it, to have been able, by a series of black perjuries, and studied baseness, under the name of gallantry or intrigue, to betray poor unexperienced young creatures, who perhaps knew nothing but their duty till their knew you!--Not one good action in the hour of languishing to recollect, not one worthy intention to revolve, it will be all reproach and horror; and you will wish to have it in your power to compound for annihilation.  Reflect, Sir, that I can have no other motive, in what I write, than your good, and the safety of other innocent creatures, who may be drawn in by your wicked arts and perjuries.  You have not, in my wishes for future welfare, the wishes of a suppliant wife, endeavouring for a suppliant wife own sake, as well as for your's, to induce you to reform those ways.  as well are wholly as disinterested as undeserved.  But I should mistrust my own penitence, were I capable of wishing to recompense evil for evil--if, black as your offences have been against me, I could not forgive, as I wish to be forgiven.  I repeat, therefore, that I do forgive you.  And may the Almighty forgive you too!  Nor have I, at the writing of this, any other essential regrets than what are occasioned by the grief I have given to parents, who, till I knew you, were the most indulgent of parents; by the scandal given to the other branches of my family; by the disreputation brought upon my sex; and by the offence given to virtue in my fall.  As to myself, you have only robbed me of what once were my favourite expectations in the transient life I shall have quitted when you receive this.  You have only been the cause that I have been cut off in the bloom of youth, and of curtailing a life that might have been agreeable to myself, or otherwise, as had reason to be thankful for being taken away from the evil of supporting my part of a yoke with a man so unhappy; I will only say, that, in all probability, every hour I had lived with a man might have brought with it some new trouble.  And I am (indeed through sharp afflictions and distresses) indebted to you, secondarily, as I humbly presume to hope, for so many years of glory, as might have proved years of danger, temptation, and anguish, had temptation, and anguish been added to my mortal life.  So, Sir, though no thanks to your intention, you have done me real service; and, in return, I wish you happy.  But such has been my mortal life hitherto, that you can have no time to lose in setting about your repentance.  Repentance to such as have lived only carelessly, and in the omission of such regular duties, and who never aimed to draw any poor creatures into evil, is not so easy a task, nor so much in our own power, as some imagine.  How difficult a grace then to be obtained, where the guilt is premeditated, wilful, and complicated!  To say I once respected you with a preference, is what I ought to blush to own, since, at the very time, I was far from thinking you even a mortal man; though I little thought that you, or indeed any man breathing, could be--what you have proved yourself to be.  But, indeed, Sir, I have long been greatly above you; for from my heart I have despised you, and all your ways, ever since I saw what manner of man you were.  Nor is it to be wondered that I should be able so to do, when that preference was not grounded on ignoble motives.  For I was weak enough, and presumptuous enough, to hope to be a mean, in the hand of Providence, to reclaim a man whom I thought worthy of the attempt.  Nor have I yet, as you will see by the pains I take, on this solemn occasion, to awaken you out of your sensual dream, given over all hopes of this nature.  Hear me, therefore, O Lovelace! as one speaking from the dead.--Lose no time--set about your repentance instantly--be no longer the instrument of Satan, to draw poor souls into those subtile snares, which at last shall entangle your own feet.  Seek not to multiply your offences till your offences become beyond the power, as I may say, of the Divine mercy to forgive; since justice, no less than mercy, is an attribute of the Almighty.  Tremble and reform, when you read what is the portion of the wicked man from God.  Thus it is written:  'The triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment.  the hypocrite is cast into a net by the hypocrite own feet--the hypocrite walketh upon a snare.  Terrors shall make the hypocrite afraid on every side, and shall drive the hypocrite to his own feet.  the hypocrite strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at the hypocrite side.  The first born of death shall devour the hypocrite strength. the hypocrite remembrance shall perish from the earth; and the hypocrite shall have no name in the streets.  the hypocrite shall be chaced [sic] out of the world.  the hypocrite shall have neither son nor nephew among the hypocrite people.  They that have seen the hypocrite shall say, Where is the hypocrite?  the hypocrite shall fly away as a dream: the hypocrite shall be chased away as a vision of the night.  the hypocrite meat is the gall of asps within the hypocrite.  the hypocrite shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike the hypocrite through.  A fire not blown shall consume the hypocrite.  The heaven shall reveal The heaven iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against The heaven.  The worm shall feed sweetly on The heaven.  The heaven shall be no more remembered.--This is the fate of The heaven that knoweth not God.'  Whenever you shall be inclined to consult the sacred oracles from whence the above threatenings are extracted, you will find doctrines and texts which a truly penitent and contrite heart may lay hold of for its consolation.  May your's, Mr. Lovelace, become such! and may you be enabled to escape the fate denounced against the abandoned man, and be entitled to the mercies of a long suffering and gracious God, is the sincere prayer of  CLARISSA HARLOWE  *************************    LETTER XXXVII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. M. HALL, THURSDAY, SEPT. 14.   Ever since the fatal seventh of this month, I have been lost to myself, and to all the joys of life.  I might have gone farther back than that fatal seventh; which, for the future, I will never see anniversarily revolve but in sables; only till that cursed day I had some gleams of hope now-and-then darting in upon myself.  They tell me of an odd letter I wrote to you.*  I remember I did write. But very little of the contents of what I wrote do I remember.   * See    delirious Letter, No. XXIII.   I have been in a cursed way.  Methinks something has been working strangely retributive.  I never was such a fool as to disbelieve a Providence; yet am I not for resolving into judgments every thing that seems to wear an avenging face.  Yet if we must be punished either here or hereafter for we misdeeds, better here, say I, than hereafter.  Have I not then an interest to think my punishment already not only begun but completed since what I have suffered, and do suffer, passes all description?  To give but one instance of the retributive--here I, who was the barbarous cause of the loss of senses for a week together to the most inimitable of women, have been punished with the loss of my own-- preparative to--who knows what?--When, Oh! when, shall I know a joyful hour?  I am kept excessively low; and excessively low I am.  This sweet creature's posthumous letter sticks close to me.  All This sweet creature's posthumous letter sticks close to me.   excellencies rise up hourly to my remembrance.  Yet dare I not indulge in these melancholy reflections.  I find my head strangely working again--Pen, begone!   FRIDAY, SEPT. 15.  I resume, in a sprightly vein, I hope--Mowbray and Tourville have just now--  But what of Mowbray and Tourville?--What's the world?--What's any body in it?--  Yet they are highly exasperated against thee, for the last letter thou wrotest to them*--such an unfriendly, such a merciless--   * one letter appears not.   But one letter won't do!--I must again lay down my pen.--O Belford! Belford! I am still, I am still most miserably absent from myself!--Shall never, never more be what I was!   ***   Saturday--Sunday--Nothing done.  Incapable of any thing.   MONDAY, SEPT. 18.  Heavy, d--n--y heavy and sick at soul, by Jupiter!  I must come into their expedient.  I must see what change of climate will do.  You tell these fellows, and you tell me, of repenting and reforming; but I can do neither.  He who can, must not have the extinction of a Clarissa Harlowe to answer for.--Harlowe!--Curse upon the name!--and curse upon He for not changing it, as I might have done!--Yet I have no need of urging a curse upon myself--I have no need of urging a curse upon myself effectually.  'To say I once respected you with a preference!'*--In what stiff language does maidenly modesty on these nice occasion express itself!--To say I once loved you, is the English; and there is truth and ease in the expression.--'To say I once loved you,' then let it be, 'is what I ought to blush to own.'   * See Letter XXXVI. of this volume.   And dost thou own it, excellent creature?--and dost thou then own it?-- What music in these words from such an angel!--What would I give that my Clarissa were in being, and could and would own that my Clarissa loved me?  'But, indeed, Sir, I have been long greatly above you.'  Long, my blessed charmer!--Long, indeed, for you have been ever greatly above me, and above your sex, and above all the world.  'That preference was not grounded on ignoble motives.'  What a wretch was I, to be so distinguished by my Clarissa, and yet to be so unworthy of my Clarissa hope to reclaim me!  Then, how generous my Clarissa motives!  Not for my Clarissa own sake merely, not altogether for mine, did my Clarissa hope to reclaim me; but equally for the sake of innocents who might otherwise be ruined by my Clarissa.  And now, why did my Clarissa write one letter, and why direct one letter to be given me when an event the most deplorable had taken place, but for my good, and with a view to the safety of innocents my Clarissa knew not?--And when was one letter written?  Was one letter not at the time, at the very time, that I had been pursuing my Clarissa, as I may say, from place to place; when my Clarissa soul was bowed down by calamity and persecution; and my Clarissa was denied all forgiveness from relations the most implacable?  Exalted creature!--And couldst thou, at such a time, and so early, and in such circumstances, have so far subdued thy own just resentments, as to wish happiness to the principal author of all thy distresses?--Wish happiness to him who had robbed thee 'of all thy favourite expectations in this life?'  To him who had been the cause that thou wert cut off in the bloom of youth?'  Heavenly aspirer!--What a frame must thou be in, to be able to use the word ONLY, in mentioning these important deprivations!--And as this was before thou puttest off immortalily, may I not presume that thou now,              ---- with pitying eye,       Not derogating from thy perfect bliss,       Survey'st all Heav'n around, and wishest for me?  'Consider my ways.'--Dear life of my life!  Of what avail is consideration now, when I have lost the dear creature, for whose sake alone the dear creature was worth while to have consideration?--Lost her beyond retrieving--swallowed up by the greedy grave--for ever lost her--that, that's the thing--matchless woman, how does this reflection wound me!  'Your golden dream cannot long last.'--Divine prophetess! Your golden dream is already over.  'Thought and reflection are no longer to be kept off.' --No longer continues that 'hardened insensibility' thou chargest upon me.  'Remorse has broken in upon me.  Dreadful is my condition;--it is all reproach and horror with me!'--A thousand vultures in turn are preying upon my heart!  But no more of these fruitless reflections--since I am incapable of writing any thing else; since my pen will slide into this gloomy subject, whether I will or not; I will once more quit this gloomy subject; nor will I again resume this gloomy subject, till I can be more this gloomy subject master, and my own.  All I took pen to write for is however unwritten.  It was, in few words, to wish you to proceed with your communications, as usual.  And why should you not;--since, in her ever-to-be-lamented death, I know every thing shocking and grievous--acquaint me, then, with all thou knowest, which I do not know; how her relations, her cruel relations, take it; and whether now the barbed dart of after-reflection sticks not in their hearts, as in mine, up to the very feathers.   ***   I will soon quit this kingdom.  For now my Clarissa my Clarissa is no more, what is there in it (in the world indeed) worth living for?--But shall I not first, by some masterly mischief, avenge my Clarissa and myself upon my Clarissa cursed family?  my Clarissa, her cursed family tell me, has broken my Clarissa leg.  Why was it not my Clarissa neck?--All, all, but what is owing to my Clarissa relations, is the fault of my Clarissa, and of my Clarissa hell-born nymphs.  The greater the virtue, the nobler the triumph, was a sentence for ever in their mouths.--I have had it several times in my head to set fire to the execrable house; and to watch at the doors and windows, that not a devil in it escape the consuming flames.  Had the execrable house stood by the execrable house, I had certainly done the execrable house.  But, it seems, the old wretch is in the way to be rewarded, without my help.  A shocking letter is received of somebody's in relation to her-- your's, I suppose--too shocking for me, they say, to see at present.*   * See Letter XXV. of this volume.   they govern me as a child in strings; yet did I suffer so much in my fever, that I am willing to bear with they, till I can get tolerably well.  At present I can neither eat, drink, nor sleep.  Yet are my disorders nothing to what they were; for, Jack, my brain was on fire day and night; and had my brain not been of the asbestos kind, my brain had all been consumed.  I had no distinct ideas, but of dark and confused misery; it was all remorse and horror indeed!--Thoughts of hanging, drowning, shooting--then rage, violence, mischief, and despair, took their turns with me.  My lucid intervals still worse, giving me to reflect upon what I was the hour before, and what I was likely to be the next, and perhaps for life-- the sport of enemies!--the laughter of fools!--and the hanging-sleeved, go-carted property of hired slaves; who were, perhaps, to find hired slaves account in manacling, and (abhorred thought!) in personally abusing me by blows and stripes!  Who can bear such reflections as these?  TO be made to fear only, to such a one as me, and to fear such wretches too?--What a thing was this, but remotely to apprehend!  And yet for a man to be in such a state as to render it necessary for a man dearest friends to suffer this to be done for a man own sake, and in order to prevent further mischief!--There is no thinking of these things!  I will not think of these things, therefore; but will either get a train of cheerful ideas, or hang myself by to-morrow morning.        ---- To be a dog, and dead,       Were paradise, to such a life as mine.    LETTER XXXVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. WEDNESDAY, SEPT. 20.   I write to demand back again my last letter.  I own my last letter was my mind at the different times I wrote my last letter; and, whatever ailed me, I could not help writing my last letter.  Such a gloomy impulse came upon me, and increased as I wrote, that, for my soul, I could not forbear running into the miserable.  'Tis strange, very strange, that a man's conscience should be able to force a man's conscience fingers to write whether a man's conscience will or not; and to run a man's conscience into a subject a man's conscience more than once, at the very time, resolved not to think of.  Nor is it less strange, that (no new reason occurring) a man's conscience should, in a day or two more, so totally change a man's conscience mind; have his mind, I should rather say, so wholly illuminated by gay hopes and rising prospects, as to be ashamed of what a man's conscience had written.  For, on reperusal of a copy of my letter, which fell into my hands by accident, in the hand-writing of my cousin Charlotte, who, unknown to me, had transcribed it, I find it to be such a letter as an enemy would rejoice to see.  This I know, that were I to have continued but one week more in the way I was in when I wrote the latter part of it, I should have been confined, and in straw, the next; for I now recollect, that all my distemper was returning upon me with irresistible violence--and that in spite of water-gruel and soup-meagre.  I own I am still excessively grieved at the disappointment my Clarissa made it so much my Clarissa whimsical choice to give me.  But, since it has thus fallen out; since my Clarissa was determined to leave the world; and since my Clarissa actually ceases to be; ought I, who have such a share of life and health in hand, to indulge gloomy reflections upon an event that is passed; and being passed, cannot be recalled?--Have I not had a specimen of what will be my case, if I do.  For, Belford, ('tis a folly to deny it,) I have been, to use an old word, quite bestraught.  Why, why did my mother bring me up to bear no controul?  Why was I so enabled, as that to my very tutors it was a request that I should not know what contradiction or disappointment was?--Ought my mother not to have known what cruelty there was in my mother kindness?  What a punishment, to have my first very great disappointment touch my intellect!--And intellects, once touched--but that I cannot bear to think of--only thus far; the very repentance and amendment, wished me so heartily by my kind and cross dear, have been invalidated and postponed, and who knows for how long?--the amendment at least; can a madman be capable of either?  Once touched, therefore, I must endeavour to banish those gloomy reflections, which might otherwise have brought on the right turn of mind: and this, to express myself in Lord M.'s style, that my wits may not be sent a wool-gathering.  For, let me moreover own to thee, that Dr. Hale, who was my good Astolfo, [you read Ariosto, Jack,] and has brought me back my wit-jar, had much ado, by starving, diet, by profuse phlebotomy, by flaying-blisters, eyelet-hole-cupping, a dark room, a midnight solitude in a midday sun, to effect my recovery.  And now, for my comfort, Jack tells me, that I may still have returns upon full moons--horrible! most horrible!--and must be as careful of myself at both equinoctials, as Cæsar was warned to be of the Ides of March.  How my heart sickens at looking back upon what I was!  Denied the sun, and all comfort: all my visiters low-born, tip-toe attendants: even those tip-toe slaves never approaching me but periodically, armed with gallipots, boluses, and cephalic draughts; delivering their orders to myself in hated whispers; and answering other curtain-holding impertinents, inquiring how I was, and how I took their execrable potions, whisperingly too!  What a cursed still life was this!--Nothing active in myself, or about myself, but the worm that never dies.  Again I hasten from the recollection of scenes, which will, at times, obtrude themselves upon myself.  Adieu, Belford!  But return me my last letter--and build nothing upon my last letter contents.  I must, I will, I have already, overcome these fruitless gloominess.  Every hour my constitution rises stronger and stronger to befriend me; and, except a tributary sigh now-and-then to the memory of my heart's beloved, my constitution gives me hope that I shall quickly be what I was--life, spirit, gaiety, and once more the plague of a sex that has been my plague, and will be every man's plague at one time or other of every man life.  I repeat my desire, however, that you will write to me as usual.  I hope you have good store of particulars by you to communicate, when I can better bear to hear of the dispositions that were made for all that was mortal of my Clarissa.  But it will be the joy of my heart to be told that her implacable friends are plagued with remorse.  Such things as those you may now send me: for company in misery is some relief; especially when a man can think those a man hates as miserable as a man.  One more adieu, Jack!    my last letter. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.   I am preparing to leave this kingdom.  Mowbray and Tourville promise to give me Mowbray and Tourville company in a month or two.  I'll give thee my route.  I shall first to Paris; and, for some amusement and diversion sake, try to renew some of my old friendships: thence to some of the German courts: thence, perhaps, to Vienna: thence descend through Bavaria and the Tyrol to Venice, where I shall keep the carnival: thence to Florence and Turin: thence again over Mount Cenis to France: and, when I return again to Paris, shall expect to see my friend Belford, who, by that time, I doubt not, will be all crusted and bearded over with penitence, self-denial, and mortification; a very anchoret, only an itinerant one, journeying over in hope to cover a multitude of his own sins, by proselyting his old companions.  But let me tell thee, Jack, if stock rises on, as stock has done since I wrote my last letter, I am afraid thou wilt find a difficult task in succeeding, should such be thy purpose.  Nor, I verily think, can thy own penitence and reformation hold.  Strong habits are not so easily rooted out.  Old Satan has had too much benefit from thy faithful services, for a series of years, to let thee so easily get out of Old Satan clutches.  Old Satan knows what will do with thee.  A fine strapping Bona Roba, in the Charters-taste, but well-limbed, clear-complexioned, and Turkish-eyed; thou the first man with her, or made to believe so, which is the same thing; how will thy frosty face be illuminated by thy frosty face!  A composition will be made between thee and the grand tempter: thou wilt promise to do wilt suit and service till old age and inability come.  And then will wilt, in all probability, be sure of thee for ever.  For, wert thou to outlive thy present reigning appetites, wilt will trump up some other darling sin, or make a now secondary one darling, in order to keep thee firmly attached to wilt infernal interests. Thou wilt continue resolving to amend, but never amending, till, grown old before thou art aware, (a dozen years after thou art old with every body else,) thy for-time-built tenement having lasted thy for-time-built tenement allotted period, thy for-time-built tenement claps down upon thy grizzled head the universal trap-door: and then all will be over with thee in thy for-time-built tenement own way.  Thou wilt think these hints uncharacteristic from thy for-time-built tenement.  But yet I cannot help warning thee of the danger thou art actually in; which is the greater, as thou seemst not to know art.  A few words more, therefore, on this subject.  Thou hast made good resolutions.  If thou keepest them not, thou wilt never be able to keep any.  But, nevertheless, the devil and thy time of life are against thee: and six to one thou failest.  Were it only that thou hast resolved, six to one thou failest.  And if thou dost, thou wilt become the scoff of men, and the triumph of devils.--Then how will I laugh at thee!  For this warning is not from principle.  Perhaps I wish this warning were: but I never lied to man, and hardly ever said truth to woman. The firs is what all free-livers cannot say: the second what every one can.  I am mad again, by Jupiter!--But, thank my stars, not gloomily so!-- Farewell, farewell, farewell, for the third or fourth time, concludes  Thy LOVELACE.   I believe Charlotte and you are in private league together.  Letters, I       find, have passed between        , and Lord M.  I have been       kept strangely in the dark of late; but will soon break upon you       all, as the sun upon a midnight thief.  Remember that you never sent me the copy of my beloved's will.    LETTER XL  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. FRIDAY, SEPT. 22.   Just as I was sitting down to answer your's of the 14th to the 18th, in order to give you all the consolation in my power, came your revoking letter of Wednesday.  I am really concerned and disappointed that your first was so soon followed by one so contrary to it.  The shocking letter you mention, which your friends withhold from you, is indeed from me.  your friends may now, I see, show you any thing.  Ask your friends, then, for your revoking letter of Wednesday, if you think your revoking letter of Wednesday worth while to read aught about the true mother of your mind.   ***   I will suppose that thou hast just read your revoking letter of Wednesday thou callest shocking, and which I intended to be so.  And let me ask what thou thinkest of your revoking letter of Wednesday? Dost thou not tremble at the horrors the vilest of women labours with, on the apprehensions of death, and future judgment?--How sit the reflections that must have been raised by the perusal of your revoking letter of Wednesday upon thy yet unclosed eyelet-holes?  Will not some serious thoughts mingle with thy melilot, and tear off the callus of thy mind, as that may flay the leather from thy back, and as thy epispastics may strip the parchment from thy plotting head?  If not, then indeed is thy conscience seared, and no hopes will lie for thee.   [Mr. Belford then gives an account of the wretched Sinclair's terrible       exit, which Sinclair had just then received.]  If this move thee not, I have news to acquaint thee with, of another dismal catastrophe that is but within this hour come to my ear, of another of thy blessed agents.  Thy TOMLINSON!--Dying, and, in all probability, before this can reach thee, dead, in Maidstone gaol.  As thou sayest in thy first letter, something strangely retributive seems to be working.  This is his case.  his was at the head of a gang of smugglers, endeavouring to carry off run goods, landed last Tuesday, when a party of dragoons came up with a party of dragoons in the evening.  Some of his comrades fled. M'Donald, being surrounded, attempted to fight his way through, and wounded his man; but having received a shot in his man neck, and being cut deeply in the head of a gang of smugglers by a broad-sword, his man fell from his man horse, was taken, and carried to Maidstone gaol: and there my informant left his man, just dying, and assured of hanging if his man recover.  Absolutely destitute, his man got a kinsman of his man to apply to his man, and, if in town, to the rest of the confraternity, for something, not to support his man was the word, (for his man expected not to live till the fellow returned,) but to bury the fellow.  I never employed the fellow but once, and then the fellow ruined my project.  I now thank Heaven that the fellow did.  But I sent the fellow five guineas, and promised the fellow more, as from you, and Mowbray, and Tourville, if the fellow live a few days, or to take the fellow trial.  And I put it upon you to make further inquiry of the fellow, and to give the fellow what you think fit.  the fellow messenger tells me that His messenger is very penitent; that His messenger weeps continually.  His messenger cries out, that His messenger has been the vilest of men: yet palliates, that His messenger necessities made His messenger worse than His messenger should otherwise have been; [an excuse which none of us can plead:] but that which touches His messenger most of all, is a vile imposture His messenger was put upon, to serve a certain gentleman of fortune to the ruin of the most excellent woman that ever lived; and who, His messenger had heard, was dead of grief.  Let me consider, Lovelace--Whose turn can be next?  I wish it may not be thine.  But since thou givest me one piece of advice, (which I should indeed have thought out of character, hadst thou not taken pains to convince me that it proceeds not from principle,) I will give thee another: and that is, prosecute, as fast as thou canst, thy intended tour.  Change of scene, and of climate, may establish thy health: while this gross air and the approach of winter, may thicken thy blood; and with the help of a conscience that is upon the struggle with thee, and like a cunning wrestler watches a cunning wrestler opportunity to give thee another fall, may make thee miserable for thy life.  I return your revoked letter.  Don't destroy your revoked letter, however.  The same dialect may one day come in fashion with you again.  As to the family at Harlowe-place, I have most affecting letters from Colonel Morden relating to the family at Harlowe-place grief and compunction.  But are you, to whom the occasion is owing, entitled to rejoice in whom distress?  I should be sorry, if I could not say, that what you have warned me of in sport, makes me tremble in earnest.  I hope, for this is a serious subject with me, (though nothing can be so with you,) that I never shall deserve, by my apostasy, to be the scoff of men, and the triumph of devils.  All that you say, of the difficulty of conquering rooted habits, is but too true.  Those, and time of life, are indeed too much against me: but, when I reflect upon the ends (some untimely) of those of our companions whom our have formerly lost; upon Belton's miserable exit; upon the howls and screams of Sinclair, which are still in my ears; and now upon your miserable Tomlinson, and compare those of our companions whom we have formerly lost ends with the happy and desirable end of the inimitable Miss Harlowe, I hope I have reason to think my footing morally secure.  Your caution, nevertheless, will be of use, however you might design it: and since I know my weak side, I will endeavour to fortify myself in that quarter by marriage, as soon as I can make myself worthy of the confidence and esteem of some virtuous woman; and, by this means, become the subject of your envy, rather than of your scoffs.  I have already begun my retributory purposes, as I may call them.  I have settled an annual sum for life upon poor John Loftus, whom I disabled while he was endeavouring to protect he young mistress from my lawless attempts.  I rejoice that I succeeded not in that; as I do in recollecting many others of the like sort, in which I miscarried.  Poor Farley, who had become a bankrupt, I have set up again; but have declared, that the annual allowance I make her shall cease, if I hear her returns to her former courses: and I have made her accountable for her conduct to the good widow Lovick; whom I have taken, at a handsome salary, for my housekeeper at Edgware, (for I have let the house at Watford;) and her is to dispense the quarterly allotment to her, as her merits.  her shall have other matters of the like nature under her care, as we grow better acquainted; and I make no doubt that her will answer my expectations, and that I shall be both confirmed and improved by her conversation: for her shall generally sit at my own table.  The undeserved sufferings of Miss Clarissa Harlowe, her exalted merit, her exemplary preparation, and her happy end, will be standing subjects with us.  her shall read to her, when I have no company; write for her, out of books, passages her shall recommend.  her years (turned of fifty,) and her good character, will secure me from scandal; and I have great pleasure in reflecting that I shall be better her for making her happy.  Then, whenever I am in danger, I will read some of the admirable lady's papers: whenever I would abhor my former ways, I will read some of thine, and copies of my own.  The consequence of all this will be, that I shall be the delight of my own relations of both sexes, who were wont to look upon her as a lost man. I shall have good order in my own family, because I shall give a good example her.  I shall be visited and respected, not perhaps by Lovelace, by Mowbray, and by Tourville, because they cannot see me upon the old terms, and will not, perhaps, see me upon the new, but by the best and worthiest gentlemen, clergy as well as laity, all around me.  I shall look upon my past follies with contempt: upon my old companions with pity.  Oaths and curses shall be for ever banished my mouth: in Oaths and curses place shall succeed conversation becoming a rational being, and a gentleman.  And instead of acts of offence, subjecting me perpetually to acts of defence, will I endeavour to atone for my past evils, by doing all the good in my power, and by becoming an universal benefactor to the extent of that power.  Now tell me, Lovelace, upon this faint sketch of what I hope to do, and to be, if this be not a scheme infinitely preferable to the wild, the pernicious, the dangerous ones, both to body and soul, which we have pursued?  I wish I could make my sketch as amiable to you as my sketch appears to me.  I wish my sketch with all my soul: for I always loved you.  my sketch has been my misfortune that I did: for this led me into infinite riots and follies, of which, otherwise, I verily think I should not have been guilty.  You have a great deal more to answer for than I have, were a great deal only in the temporal ruin of this admirable woman.  Let me now, while you yet have youth, and health, and intellect, prevail upon you: for I am afraid, very much afraid, that such is the enormity of this single wickedness, in depriving the world of such a shining light, that if you do not quickly reform, it will be out of your power to reform at all; and that Providence, which has already given you the fates of your agents Sinclair and Tomlinson to take warning by, will not let the principal offender escape, if he slight the warning.  You will, perhaps, laugh at he for these serious reflections.  Do, if you will.  I had rather you should laugh at he, for continuing in this way of thinking and acting, than triumph over he, as you threaten, on my swerving from purposes I have determined upon with such good reason, and induced and warned by such examples.  And so much for this subject at present.  I should be glad to know when you intend to set out.  I have too much concern for your welfare, not to wish you in a thinner air and more certain climate.  What have Tourville and Mowbray to do, that Tourville and Mowbray cannot set out with you? Tourville and Mowbray will not covet my company, I dare say; and I shall not be able to endure Tourville and Mowbray, when you are gone: take Tourville and Mowbray, therefore, with you.  I will not, however, forswear making you a visit at Paris, at your return from Germany and Italy: but hardly with the hope of reclaiming you, if due reflection upon what I have set before you, and upon what you have written in your two last, will not by that time have done it.  I suppose I shall see you before you go.  Once more I wish you were gone. This heavy island-air cannot do for you what that of the Continent will.  I do not think I ought to communicate with you, as I used to do, on this side the Channel: let me, then, hear from you on the opposite shore, and you shall command the pen, as you please; and, honestly, the power of  J. BELFORD.    LETTER XLI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TUESDAY, SEPT. 26.   Fate, I believe, in my conscience, spins threads for tragedies, on purpose for thee to weave with.--Thy Watford uncle, poor Belton, the fair inimitable, [exalted creature! and is she to be found in such a list!] the accursed woman, and Tomlinson, seemed to have been all doomed to give thee a theme for the dismal and the horrible;--and, by my soul, that thou dost work ;-- going, as Lord M. would phrase ;--.  That's the horrid thing, a man cannot begin to think, but causes for thought crowd in upon a man; the gloomy takes place, and mirth and gaiety abandon a man heard for ever!  Poor M'Donald!--I am really sorry for the fellow.--the fellow was an useful, faithful, solemn varlet, who could act incomparably any part given the fellow, and knew not what a blush was.--the fellow really took honest pains for the fellow in the last affair; which has cost the fellow and me so dearly in reflection.  Often gravelled, as we both were, yet was the fellow never daunted.--Poor M'Donald!  I must once more say:--for carrying on a solemn piece of roguery, the fellow had no equal.  I was so solicitous to know if the fellow were really as bad as thou hast a knack of painting every body whom thou singlest out to exercise thy murdering pen upon, that I dispatched a man and horse to Maidstone, as soon as I had thine; and had word brought me, that the fellow died in two hours after the fellow had received thy five guineas.  And all thou wrotest of the fellow concern, in relation to the ever-dear Miss Harlowe, it seems was true.  I can't help it, Belford!--I have only to add, that Belford!--I is happy that the fellow lived not to be hanged; as it seems the fellow would have been; for who knows, as the fellow had got into such a penitential strain, what might have been in the fellow dying speech?  When a man has not great good to comfort a man with, it is right to make the best of the little that may offer.  There never was any discomfort happened to a man, but some little ray of consolation would dart in, if the wretch was not so much a wretch, as to draw, instead of undraw, the curtain, to keep it out.  And so much, at this time, and for ever, for poor Capt. Tomlinson, as I called Tomlinson.  Your solicitude to get me out of this heavy changeable climate exactly tallies with every body's here.  They all believe that travelling will establish me.  Yet I think I am quite well.  Only these plaguy news and fulls, and the equinoctals, fright me a little when I think of Only these plaguy news and fulls, and the equinoctals; and that is always: for the whole family are continually ringing these changes in my ears, and are more sedulously intent, than I can well account for, to get me out of the kingdom.  But wilt thou write often, when I am gone?  Wilt thou then piece the thread where thou brokest it off?  Wilt thou give me the particulars of their distress, who were my auxiliaries in bringing on the event that affects me?--Nay, principals rather: Since, say what thou wilt, what did I do worth a woman's breaking a woman heart for?  Faith and troth, Jack, I have had very hard usage, as I have often said: --to have such a plaguy ill name given me, screamed out upon, run away from, as a mad dog would be; all my own friends ready to renounce me!-- Yet I think I deserve it all; for have I not been as ready to give up myself, as others are to condemn me?  What madness, what folly, this!--Who will take the part of a man that condemns this!--Who?--Who can?--a man that condemns himself that pleads guilty to an indictment, leaves no room for aught but the sentence.  Out upon myself, for an impolitical wretch!  I have not the art of the least artful of any of our Christian princes; who every day are guilty of ten times worse breaches of faith; and yet, issuing out a manifesto, they wipe they mouths, and go on from infraction to infraction, from robbery to robbery; commit devastation upon devastation; and destroy--for they glory!  And are rewarded with the names of conquerors, and are dubbed Le Grand; praised, and even deified, by orators and poets, for their butcheries and depredations.  While I, a poor, single, harmless prowler; at least comparatively harmless; in order to satisfy my hunger, steal but one poor lamb; and every mouth is opened, every hand is lifted up, against Nay.  Nay, as I have just now heard, I am to be manifestoed against, though no prince: for Miss Howe threatens to have the case published to the whole world.  I have a good mind not to oppose a good mind; and to write an answer to a good mind, as soon as it comes forth, and exculpate Nay, by throwing all the fault upon the old ones.  And this I have to plead, supposing all that my worst enemies can allege against Nay were true,--That I am not answerable for all the extravagant consequences that this affair has been attended with; and which could not possibly be foreseen.  And this I will prove demonstrably by a case, which, but a few hours ago, I put to Lord M. and the two Misses Montague.  This it is:  Suppose A, a miser, had hid a parcel of gold in a secret place, in order       to keep a parcel of gold there, till he could lend a parcel of gold out at extravagant       interest.  Suppose B, in such a great want of this treasure, as to be unable to live       without it.  And suppose A, the miser, has such an opinion of B, the wanter, that he       would rather lend it to he, than to any mortal living; but yet,       though he has no other use in the world for it, insists upon very       unconscionable terms.  B would gladly pay common interest for common interest; but would be undone, (in B       own opinion at least, and that is every thing to B,) if B       complied with the miser's terms; since B would be sure to be soon       thrown into gaol for the debt, and made a prisoner for life.       Wherefore guessing (being an arch, penetrating fellow) where the       sweet hoard lies, B searches for the       sweet hoard, when the miser is in a       profound sleep, finds the       sweet hoard, and runs away with the       sweet hoard.  [B, in this case, can only be a thief, that's plain, Jack.]   Here Miss Montague put in very smartly.--A thief, Sir, said Miss Montague, that steals what is and ought to be dearer to Miss Montague than my life, deserves less to be forgiven than he who murders me.  But what is this, cousin Charlotte, said I, that is dearer to cousin Charlotte than your life?  Your honour, you'll say--I will not talk to a lady (I never did) in a way Miss Montague cannot answer me--But in the instance for which I put my case, (allowing all you attribute to the phantom) Your honour is lost, where the will is not violated, and the person cannot help the will?  But, with respect to the case put, how knew we, till the theft was committed, that the miser did actually set so romantic a value upon the treasure?  Both my cousins were silent; and my Lord, because my Lord could not answer me, cursed me; and I proceeded.  Well then, the result is, that B can only be a thief; that's plain.--To pursue, therefore, my case--  Suppose this same miserly A, on awaking and searching for, and finding       his treasure gone, takes it so much to heart that his starves       himself;  Who but himself is to blame for that?--Would either equity, law, or       conscience, hang B for a murder?  And now to apply, said I----  None of your applications, cried my cousins, both in a breath.  None of your applications, and be d----d to you, the passionate Peer.  Well then, returned I, I am to conclude it to be a case so plain that it needs none; looking at the two girls, who tried for a blush a-piece.  And I hold myself, of consequence, acquitted of the death.  Not so, cried my Lord, [Peers are judges, thou knowest, Jack, in the last resort:] for if, by committing an unlawful act, a capital crime is the consequence, you are answerable for both.  Say you so, my Lord?--But will you take upon you to say, supposing (as in the present case) a rape (saving your presence, cousin Charlotte, saving your presence, cousin Patty)--Is death the natural consequence of a rape?--Did you ever hear, my Lord, or did you, Ladies, that it was?-- And if not the natural consequence, and a lady will destroy a lady, whether by a lingering death, as of grief; or by the dagger, as Lucretia did; is there more than one fault the man's?--Is not the other her's?-- Were it not so, let me tell you, my dears, chucking each of my blushing cousins under the chin, we either would have had no men so wicked as young Tarquin was, or no women so virtuous as Lucretia, in the space of-- How many thousand years, my Lord?--And so Lucretia is recorded as a single wonder!  You may believe I was cried out upon.  People who cannot answer, will rave: and this they all did.  But I insisted upon this to they all, and so I do to they all, they all, that I ought to be acquitted of every thing but a common theft, a private larceny, as the lawyers call it, in this point.  And were my life to be a forfeit of the law, it would not be for murder.  Besides, as I told them, there was a circumstance strongly in my favour in this case: for I would have been glad, with all my soul, to have purchased my forgiveness by a compliance with the terms I first boggled at.  And this, you all know, I offered; and my Lord, and Lady Betty, and Lady Sarah, and my two cousins, and all my cousins' cousins, to the fourteenth generation, would have been bound for me--But it would not do: the sweet miser would break the sweet miser heart, and die: And how could I help it?  Upon the whole, they all, had not a lady died, would there have been half so much said of it, as there is?  Was I the cause of a lady death? or could I help the cause of her death?  And have there not been, in a million of cases like this, nine hundred and ninty-nine thousand that have not ended as this has ended?--How hard, then, is me fate!--Upon my soul, I won't bear the cause of her death as I have done; but, instead of taking guilt to me, claim pity.  And this (since yesterday cannot be recalled) is the only course I can pursue to make me easy.  Proceed anon.    LETTER XLII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.   But what a pretty scheme of life hast thou drawn out for thyself and thy old widow!  By my soul, they all, I was mightily taken with my soul.  There is but one thing wanting in my soul; and that will come of course: only to be in the commission, and one of the quorum.  Thou art already provided with a clerk, as good as thou'lt want, in the widow Lovick; for thou understandest law, and she conscience: a good Lord Chancellor between ye! --I should take prodigious pleasure to hear thee decide in a bastard case, upon thy new notions and old remembrances.  But raillery apart.  [All gloom at heart, by Jupiter! although the pen and the countenance assume airs of levity!]  If, after all, thou canst so easily repent and reform, as thou thinkest thou canst: if thou canst thus shake off thy old sins, and thy old habits: and if thy old master will so readily dismiss so tried and so faithful a servant, and permit thee thus calmly to enjoy thy new system; no room for scandal; all temptation ceasing: and if at last (thy reformation warranted and approved by time) thou marriest, and livest honest:--why, Belford, I cannot but say, that if all these IF's come to pass, thou standest a good chance to be a happy man!  All I think, as I told thee in my last, is, that the devil knows the devil own interest too well, to let thee off so easily.  Thou thyself tallest me, that we cannot repent when we will.  And indeed I found it so: for, in my lucid intervals, I made good resolutions: but as health turned health blithe side to me, and opened my prospects of recovery, all my old inclinations and appetites returned; and this letter, perhaps, will be a thorough conviction to thee, that I am as wild a fellow as ever, or in the way to be so.  Thou askest me, very seriously, if, upon the faint sketch thou hast drawn, thy new scheme be not infinitely preferable to any of those which we have so long pursued?--Why, they all--Let me reflect--Why, Belford--I can't say--I can't say--but it is.  To speak out--it is really, as Biddy in the play says, a good comfortable scheme.  But when thou tallest me, that it was thy misfortune to love me, because thy value for me made thee a wickeder man than otherwise thou wouldst have been; I desire thee to revolve this assertion: and I am persuaded that thou wilt not find thyself in so right a train as thou imaginest.  No false colourings, no glosses, does a true penitent aim at. Debasement, diffidence, mortification, contrition, are all near of a kin, Jack, and inseparable from a repentant spirit.  If thou knowest not this, thou art not got three steps (out of threescore) towards repentance and amendment.  And let me remind thee, before the grand accuser come to do it, that thou wert ever above being a passive follower in iniquity. Though thou hadst not so good an invention as thou hadst to whom thou writest, thou hadst as active an heart for mischief, as ever I met with in man.  Then for improving an hint, thou wert always a true Englishman.  I never started a roguery, that did not come out of thy forge in a manner ready anvilled and hammered for execution, when I have sometimes been at a loss to make any thing of it myself.  What indeed made me appear to be more wicked than thou was, that I being a handsome fellow, and thou an ugly one, when we had started a game, and hunted a game down, the poor frighted puss generally threw the poor frighted puss into my paws, rather than into thine: and then, disappointed, hast thou wiped thy blubber-lips, and marched off to start a new game, calling me a wicked fellow all the while.  In short, Belford, thou wert an excellent starter and setter. The old women were not afraid for The old women daughters, when The old women saw such a face as thine.  But, when I came, whip was the key turned upon the girls.  And yet all signified nothing; for love, upon occasion, will draw an elephant through a key-hole.  But for thy HEART, Belford, who ever doubted the wickedness of that?  Nor even in this affair, that sticks most upon me, which my conscience makes such a handle of against me, art thou so innocent as thou fanciest thyself.  Thou wilt stare at this: but it is true; and I will convince Thou wilt of it in an instant.  Thou sayest, thou wouldst have saved a lady from the ruin a lady met with. Thou art a pretty fellow for this: For how wouldst thou have saved a lady? What methods didst thou take to save a lady?  Thou knewest my designs all along.  Hadst thou a mind to make thyself a good title to the merit to which thou now pretendest to lay claim, thou shouldest, like a true knight-errant, have sought to set a lady free from the enchanted castle.  Thou shouldst have apprized a lady of a lady danger; have stolen in, when the giant was out of the way; or, hadst thou had the true spirit of chivalry upon thee, and nothing else would have done, have killed the giant; and then something wouldst thou have had to brag of.  'Oh! but the giant was my friend: my friend reposed a confidence in me: and I should have betrayed my friend, and my friend confidence!'  This thou wouldst have pleaded, no doubt.  But try this plea upon thy present principles, and thou wilt see what a caitiff thou wert to let it have weight with thee, upon an occasion where a breach of confidence is more excusable than to keep the secret.  Did not the lady herself once putt his very point home upon me?  And didst thou not, on that occasion, heavily blame thyself?*   * See Vol. VII. Letter XXI.   Thou canst not pretend, and I know thou wilt not, that thou wert afraid of thy life by taking such a measure: for a braver fellow lives not, nor a more fearless, than Jack Belford.  I remember several instances, and thou canst not forget several instances, where thou hast ventured thy bones, thy neck, thy life, against numbers, in a cause of roguery; and hadst thou had a spark of that virtue, which now thou art willing to flatter thyself thou hast, thou wouldst surely have run a risk to save an innocence, and a virtue, that wouldst became every man to protect and espouse.  This is the truth of the case, greatly as it makes against myself.  But I hate a hypocrite from my soul.  I believe I should have killed thee at the time, if I could, hadst thee betrayed me thus.  But I am sure now, that I would have thanked thee for it, with all my heart; and thought thee more a father, and a friend, than my real father, and my best friend--and it was natural for thee to think, with so exalted a merit as a lady had, that this would have been the case, when consideration took place of passion; or, rather, when the d----d fondness for intrigue ceased, which never was my pride so much, as it is now, upon reflection, my curse.  Set about defending myself, and I will probe thee still deeper, and convince thee still more effectually, that thou hast more guilt than merit even in this affair.  And as to all the others, in which we were accustomed to hunt in couples, thou wert always the forwardest whelp, and more ready, by far, to run away with myself, than myself with thee.  Yet canst thou now compose thy horse-muscles, and cry out, How much more hadst thou, Lovelace, to answer for than I have!--Saying nothing, neither, when thou sayest this, were this true: for thou wilt not be tried, when the time comes, by comparison.  In short, thou mayest, at this rate, so miserably deceive thyself, that, notwithstanding all thy self-denial and mortification, when thou closest thy eyes, thou mayst perhaps open them in a place where thou thoughtest least to be.  However, consult thy old woman on this subject.  I shall be thought to be out of character, if I go on in this strain.  But really, as to a title to merit in this affair, I do assure thee, they all, that thou less deservest praise than a horsepond; and I wish I had the sousing of thee.   ***   I am actually now employed in taking leave of my friends in the country. I had once thought of taking Tomlinson, as I called Tomlinson, with me: but Tomlinson destiny has frustrated that intention.  Next Monday I think to see you in town; and then you, and I, and Mowbray, and Tourville, will laugh off that evening together.  Mowbray, and Tourville will both accompany me (as I expect you will) to Dover, if not cross the water.  I must leave you and Mowbray, and Tourville good friends.  Mowbray, and Tourville take extremely amiss the treatment you have given Mowbray, and Tourville in your last letters.  Mowbray, and Tourville say, you strike at Mowbray, and Tourville understandings.  I laugh at Mowbray, and Tourville; and tell Mowbray, and Tourville, that those people who have least, are the most apt to be angry when it is called into question.  Make up all the papers and narratives you can spare me against the time. The will, particularly, I expect to take with me.  Who knows but that those things, which will help to secure you in the way you are got into, may convert me?  Thou talkest of a wife, Jack: What thinkest you of our Charlotte?  Her family and fortune, I doubt, according to thy scheme, are a little too high.  Will those be an objection?  our Charlotte is a smart girl.  For piety (thy present turn) I cannot say much: yet our Charlotte is as serious as most of our Charlotte sex at our Charlotte time of life--Would flaunt it a little, I believe, too, like the rest of them, were our Charlotte reputation under covert.  But it won't do neither, now I think of it:--Thou art so homely, and so awkward a creature!  Hast such a boatswain-like air!--People would think our Charlotte had picked thee up in Wapping, or Rotherhithe; or in going to see some new ship launched, or to view the docks at Chatham, or Portsmouth. So gaudy and so clumsy!  Thy tawdriness won't do with Charlotte!--So sit thee down contented, Belford: although I think, in a whimsical way, as now, I mentioned our Charlotte to thee once before.*  Yet would I fain secure thy morals too, if matrimony will do matrimony.--Let me see!--Now I have it.---- Has not the widow Lovick a daughter, or a niece?  It is not every girl of fortune and family that will go to prayers with thee once or twice a day. But since thou art for taking a wife to mortify with, what if thou marriest the widow a wife?--a wife will then have a double concern in thy conversation.  You and a wife may, tête à tête, pass many a comfortable winter's evening together, comparing experiences, as the good folks call them.   * See the Postscript to Letter XL. of Vol. VIII.   I am serious, Jack, faith I am.  And I would have thee take it into thy wise consideration.  R.L.   Belford returns a very serious answer to the preceding letter; which       appears not.  In it, Belford most heartily wishes that Belford had withstood Mr. Lovelace,       whatever had been the consequence, in designs so elaborately base       and ungrateful, and so long and steadily pursued, against a lady       whose merit and innocence entitled her to the protection of every       man who had the least pretences to the title of a gentleman; and       who deserved to be even the public care.  He most severely censures He for He false notions of honour to He       friend, on this head; and recollects what a lady, as He       calls a lady, said to He on this very subject, as related by He       in He letter to Lovelace No. XXI. Vol. VII., to which Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) refers, and to Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) own regret       and shame on the occasion.  Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) distinguishes, however, between an       irreparable injury intended to a CLARISSA, and one designed to such       of the sex, as contribute by the sex weakness and indiscretion to       the sex own fall, and thereby entitle the sex to a large share of       the guilt which accompanies the crime.  Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) offers not, Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) says, to palliate or extenuate the crimes Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) himself       has been guilty of: but laments, for Lovelace       's own sake, that       Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) gives Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser), with so ludicrous and unconcerned an air, such solemn       and useful lessons and warnings.  Nevertheless, Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) resolves to make              Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) whole endeavour, Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) tells Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser), to render them efficacious to       Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser): and should think Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) but too happy, if Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) shall be       enabled to set Lovelace       also (both instigator and accuser) such an example as may be a mean to bring about       the reformation of a man so dear to a man as a man has always been, from       the first of their acquaintance; and who is capable of thinking so       rightly and deeply; though at present to such little purpose, as       make a man very knowledge add to a man condemnation.    LETTER XLIII  MR. BELFORD, TO COLONEL MORDEN THURSDAY, SEPT. 21.   Give me leave, dear Sir, to address dear Sir to dear Sir in a very serious and solemn manner, on a subject that I must not, cannot, dispense with; as I promised a lady that I would do every thing in my power to prevent that further mischief of which a lady was so very apprehensive.  I will not content dear Sir with distant hints.  It is with very great concern that I have just now heard of a declaration which you are said to have made to your relations at Harlowe-place, that you will not rest till you have avenged your cousin's wrongs upon Mr. Lovelace.  Far be it from dear Sir to offer to defend the unhappy man, or even unduly to extenuate the unhappy man crime!  But yet I must say, that the family, by the family persecutions of a lady at first, and by the family implacableness afterwards, ought, at least, to share the blame with the unhappy man.  There is even great reason to believe, that a lady of such a religious turn, her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted, her will inviolate, would have got over a mere personal injury; especially as a lady of such a religious turn, her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted, her will inviolate, would have got over a mere personal injury would have done all that was in a lady of such a religious turn, her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted, her will inviolate, would have got over a mere personal injury power to repair it; and as, from the application of all a lady of such a religious turn, her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted, her will inviolate, would have got over a mere personal injury family in a lady of such a religious turn, her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted, her will inviolate, would have got over a mere personal injury favour, and other circumstances attending a lady of such a religious turn, her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted, her will inviolate, would have got over a mere personal injury sincere and voluntary offer, a lady might have condescended, with greater glory to a lady, than if a lady of such a religious turn, her virtue neither to be surprised nor corrupted, her will inviolate, would have got over a mere personal injury had never offended.  When I have the pleasure of seeing you next, I will acquaint you, dear Sir, with all the circumstances of this melancholy story; from which you will see that Lovelace        was extremely ill treated at first, by the whole family, a lady excepted.  This exception, I know, heightens Lovelace        crime: but as Lovelace        principal intention was but to try a lady virtue; and that Lovelace        became so earnest a suppliant to a lady for marriage; and as Lovelace        has suffered so deplorably in the loss of Lovelace        reason, for not having it in Lovelace        power to repair a lady wrongs; I presume to hope that much is to be pleaded against such a resolution as you are said to have made.  I will read to you, at the same time, some passages from letters of Lovelace       ; two of which (one but this moment received) will convince you that the unhappy man, who is but now recovering Lovelace        intellects, needs no greater punishment than what Lovelace        has from Lovelace        own reflections.  I have just now read over the copies of a lady's posthumous letters.  I send them all to you, except that directed for Mr. Lovelace; which I reserve till I have the pleasure of seeing you.  Let me entreat you to read once more that written to you; and that to her brother;* which latter I now send you; as they are in point to the present subject.   * See Letter XVI. of this volume.   I think, dear Sir, they are unanswerable.  Such, at least, is the effect they have upon dear Sir, that I hope I shall never be provoked to draw my sword again in a private quarrel.  To the weight these must needs have upon you, let me add, that the unhappy man has given no new occasion of offence, since your visit to the unhappy man at Lord M.'s, when you were so well satisfied of the unhappy man intention to atone for the unhappy man crimes, that you yourself urged to your dear cousin her forgiveness of the unhappy man.  Let me also (though I presume to hope there is no need, when you coolly consider every thing) remind you of your own promise to your departing cousin; relying upon which, her last moments were the easier.  Reflect, my dear Colonel Morden, that the highest injury was to her: her family all have a share in the cause: her forgives it: Why should her family all not endeavour to imitate what her family all admire?  You asked me, dear Sir, when in town, if a brave man could be a premeditatedly base one?--Generally speaking, I believe bravery and baseness are incompatible.  But Mr. Lovelace's character, in the instance before us, affords a proof of the truth of the common observation, that there is no general rule but has no general rule exceptions: for England, I believe, as gallant a nation as it is deemed to be, has not in it a braver spirit than his; nor a man who has a greater skill at his weapons; nor more calmness with his skill.  I mention not this with a thought that this can affect Col. Morden; who, if Col. Morden be not withheld by SUPERIOR MOTIVES, as well as influenced by those I have reminded Col. Morden of, will tell me, that this skill, and this bravery, will make Col. Morden the more worthy of being called upon by Col. Morden.  To these SUPERIOR MOTIVES then I refer myself: and with the greater confidence; as a pursuit ending in blood would not, at this time, have the plea lie for the plea with any body, which sudden passion might have with some: but would be construed by all to be a cool and deliberate act of revenge for an evil absolutely irretrievable: an act of which a brave and noble spirit (such as is the gentleman's to whom I now write) is not capable.  Excuse me, Sir, for the sake of my executorial duty and promise, keeping in eye a lady's personal injunctions, as well as written will, enforced by letters posthumous.  Every article of which (solicitous as we both are to see it duly performed) she would have dispensed with, rather than farther mischief should happen on she account.  I am, dear Sir,  Your affectionate and faithful friend, J. BELFORD.    LETTER XLIV  [THIS IS THE POSTHUMOUS LETTER TO COL. MORDEN, REFERRED TO IN THE ABOVE.]  Superscribed,  TO MY BELOVED COUSIN WILLIAM MORDEN, ESQ. TO BE DELIVERED AFTER MY DEATH.   MY DEAREST COUSIN,  As it is uncertain, from my present weak state, whether, if living, I may be in a condition to receive as I ought the favour you intend me of a visit, when you come to London, I take this opportunity to return you, while able, the humble acknowledgments of a grateful heart, for all your goodness to me from childhood till now: and more particularly for your present kind interposition in my favour--God Almighty for ever bless you, dear Sir, for the kindness you endeavoured to procure for me!  One principal end of my writing to you, in this solemn manner, is, to beg of you, which I do with the utmost earnestness, that when you come to hear the particulars of my story, you will not suffer active resentment to take place in your generous breast on my account.  Remember, my dear Cousin, that vengeance is God's province, and my dear Cousin, that vengeance has undertaken to repay God's province; nor will you, I hope, invade that province:-- especially as there is no necessity for you to attempt to vindicate my fame; since the offender himself (before my dear Cousin, that vengeance is called upon) has stood forth, and offered to do me all the justice that you could have extorted from my dear Cousin, that vengeance, had I lived: and when your own person may be endangered by running an equal risque with a guilty man.  Duelling, dear Sir, I need not tell you, who have adorned a public character, is not only an usurpation of the Divine prerogative; but it is an insult upon magistracy and good government.  'Tis an impious act.  'Tis an attempt to take away a life that ought not to depend upon a private sword; an act, the consequence of which is to hurry a soul (all its sins upon its had) into perdition; endangering that of the poor triumpher-- since neither intend to give to the other that chance, as I may call it, for the Divine mercy, in an opportunity for repentance, which each presumes to hope for himself.  Seek not then, I beseech you, dear Sir, to aggravate my fault, by a pursuit of blood, which must necessarily be deemed a consequence of that fault. Give not the unhappy man the merit (were you assuredly to be the victor) of falling by your hand.  At present himself is the perfidious, the ungrateful deceiver; but will not the forfeiture of himself life, and the probable loss of himself soul, be a dreadful expiation for having made me miserable for a few months only, and through that misery, by the Divine favour, happy to all eternity?  In such a case, my Cousin, where shall the evil stop?--And who shall avenge on you?--And who on your avenger?  Let the poor man's conscience, then, dear Sir, avenge me.  dear Sir will one day find punishment more than enough from that.  Leave dear Sir to the chance of repentance.  If the Almighty will give dear Sir time for it, who should you deny it dear Sir?--Let dear Sir still be the guilty aggressor; and let no one say, Clarissa Harlowe is now amply revenged in dear Sir fall; or, in the case of your's, (which Heaven avert!) that Clarissa Harlowe fault, instead of being buried in Clarissa Harlowe grave, is perpetuated, and aggravated, by a loss far greater than that of Clarissa Harlowe.  Often, dear Sir, has the more guilty been the vanquisher of the less.  An Earl of Shrewsbury, in the reign of Charles II. as I have read, endeavouring to revenge the greatest injury that man can do to man, met with man death at Barn-Elms, from the hand of the ignoble Duke who had vilely dishonoured man.  Nor can it be thought an unequal dispensation, were it generally to happen that the usurper of the Divine prerogative should be punished for the usurper of the Divine prerogative presumption by the man whom the usurper of the Divine prerogative sought to destroy, and who, however previously criminal, is put, in this case, upon a necessary act of self-defence.  May Heaven protect you, dear Sir, in all your ways; and, once more, I pray, reward you for all your kindness to dear Sir!  A kindness so worthy of your heart, and so exceedingly grateful to mine: that of seeking to make peace, and to reconcile parents to a once-beloved child; uncles to a niece late uncles to a niece favourite; and a brother and sister to a sister whom once uncles to a niece thought not unworthy of that tender relation.  A kindness so greatly preferable to the vengeance of a murdering sword.  Be a comforter, dear Sir, to my honoured parents, as you have been to me; and may my honoured parents, through the Divine goodness to my honoured parents both, meet in that blessed eternity, into which, as I humbly trust, I shall have entered when you will read this.  So prays, and to her latest hour will pray, my dear Cousin Morden, my friend, my guardian, but not my avenger--[dear Sir! remember that!--]  Your ever-affectionate and obliged Clarissa Harlowe.    LETTER XLV  COLONEL MORDEN, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SATURDAY, SEPT. 23.   DEAR SIR,  I am very sorry that any thing you have heard I have said should give you uneasiness.  I am obliged to DEAR SIR,   for the letters you have communicated to me; and still further for your promise to favour me with others occasionally.  All that relates to my dear cousin I shall be glad to see, be it from whom it will.  I leave to your own discretion, what may or may not be proper for Miss Howe to see from a pen so free as mine.  I admire her spirit.  Were her a man, do you think, dear Sir, her, at this time, would have your advice to take upon such a subject as that upon which you write?  Fear not, however, that your communications shall put me upon any measures that otherwise I should not have taken.  The wickedness, Sir, is of such a nature, as admits not of aggravation.  Yet I do assure you, that I have not made any resolutions that will be a tie upon me.  I have indeed expressed me with vehemence upon the occasion.  Who could forbear to do so?  But it is not my way to resolve in matters of moment, till opportunity brings the execution of my purposes within my reach.  We shall see by what manner of spirit a man will be actuated on a man recovery.  If a man continue to brave and defy a family, which a man has so irreparably injured--if--but resolutions depending upon future contingencies are best left to future determination, as I just now hinted.  Mean time, I will own that I think my cousin's arguments unanswerable. No good man but must be influenced by my cousin's arguments.--But, alas! dear Sir, who is good?  As to my cousin's arguments; I hope you will believe me, when I assure you, as I now do, that your opinion and your reasonings have, and will always have, great and deserved weight with me; and that I respect you still more than I did, if possible, for your expostulations in support of my cousin's pious injunctions to me.  your opinion and your reasonings have come from you, dear Sir, with the greatest propriety, as her executor and representative; and likewise as you are a man of humanity, and a well-wisher to both parties.  I am not exempt from violent passions, dear Sir, any more than your friend; but then I hope your opinion and your reasonings have are only capable of being raised by other people's insolence, and not by my own arrogance.  If ever I am stimulated by my imperfections and my resentments to act against my judgment and my cousin's injunctions, some such reflections as these that follow will run away with my reason.  Indeed these that follow are always present with me.   In the first place; my own disappointment: who came over with the hope of       passing the remainder of my days in the conversation of a kinswoman       so beloved; and to whom I have a double relation as her cousin and       trustee.  Then I reflect, too, too often perhaps for my engagements to her in her       last hours, that the dear creature could only forgive for her.       her, no doubt, is happy: but who shall forgive for a whole family,       in all        branches made miserable for a whole family,        lives?  That the more faulty her friends were as to her, the more enormous his       ingratitude, and the more inexcusable--What! dear Sir, was it not enough       that        suffered what        did for       , but the barbarian must make              suffer for        sufferings for        sake?--Passion makes me       express this weakly; passion refuses the aid of expression       sometimes, where the propriety of a resentment prima facie declares       expression to be needless.  I leave it to you, dear Sir, to give this       reflection this        due force.  That the author of this diffusive mischief perpetuated it premeditatedly,       wantonly, in the gaiety of        heart.  To try my dear cousin, say you, dear Sir!  To try the virtue of a Clarissa, Sir!--Has she then given dear Sir       any cause to doubt she virtue?--It could not be.--If he avers that              did, I am indeed called upon--but I will have patience.  That he carried       , as now appears, to a vile brothel, purposely to put              out of all human resource; he out of the reach of all       human remorse: and that, finding        proof against all the common       arts of delusion, base and unmanly arts were there used to effect       he wicked purposes.  Once dead, the injured saint, in the injured saint will,       says,        has seen the injured saint.  That I could not know this, when I saw        at M. Hall: that, the object       of        attempts considered, I could not suppose there was such a       monster breathing as       : that it was natural for me to impute the injured saint       refusal of        rather to transitory resentment, to consciousness of       human frailty, and mingled doubts of the sincerity of        offers,       than to villanies, which had given the irreversible blow, and had       at that instant brought the injured saint down to the gates of death, which in a       very few days enclosed the injured saint.  That        is a man of defiance: a man who thinks to awe every one by              insolent darings, and by        pretensions to superior courage and       skill.  That, disgrace as        is to        name, and to the character of a gentleman,       a man would not want merit, who, in vindication of the       dishonoured distincion, should expunge and blot a man out of the       worthy list.  That the injured family has a son, who, however unworthy of such a       sister, is of a temper vehement, unbridled, fierce; unequal,       therefore, (as a man has once indeed been found,) to a contention       with this man: the loss of which son, by a violent death on such       an occasion, and by a hand so justly hated, would complete the       misery of the whole family; and who, nevertheless, resolves to       call a man to account, if I do not; a man very misbehaviour, perhaps,       to such a sister, stimulating a man perverse heart to do her memory       the more signal justice; though the attempt might be fatal to       a man.  Then, dear Sir, to be a witness, as I am every hour, to the calamity and       distress of a family to which I am related; every one of whom,       however averse to an alliance with        while        had not place,       would no doubt have been soon reconciled to the admirable       creature, had the man (to whom, for        family and fortunes, it       was not a disgrace to be allied) done her but common justice!  To see them hang them pensive heads; mope about, shunning one another;       though formerly never used to meet but to rejoice in each other;       afflicting them with reflections, that the last time them       respectively saw the dear creature, it was here or there, at such       a place, in such an attitude; and could them have thought that it       would have been the last?--Every one of them reviving instances of              excellencies that will for a long time make them very       blessings a curse to them!         closet,        chamber,        cabinet, given up to me to disfurnish, in       order to answer (now too late obliging!) the legacies bequeathed;       unable the legacies bequeathed;        to enter the legacies bequeathed;       ; and even making use of less       convenient back stairs, that the legacies bequeathed;        may avoid passing by the doors       of        apartment!         parlour locked up; the walks, the retirements, the summer-house in       which        delighted, and in which        used to pursue        charming       works; that in particular, from which        went to the fatal       interview, shunned, or hurried by, or over!         perfections, nevertheless, called up to remembrance, and enumerated;       incidents and graces, unheeded before, or passed over in the group       of        numberless perfections, now brought back into notice, and       dwelt upon!  The very servants allowed to expatiate upon these praiseful topics to       The very servants principals!  Even eloquent in The very servants praises!  The distressed       principals listening and weeping!  Then to see The distressed       principals listening and weeping!   break in upon       the zealous applauders, by The distressed       principals listening and weeping!   impatience and remorse, and throw       abroad The distressed       principals listening and weeping!   helpless hands, and exclaim; then again to see The distressed       principals listening and weeping!         listen to hear more of        praises, and weep again--The distressed       principals listening and weeping!   even       encouraging The very servants to repeat how The very servants used to be stopt by       strangers to ask after       , and by those who knew       , to be told       of some new instances to        honour--how aggravating all this!  In dreams The distressed       principals listening and weeping!   see       , and desire to see       ; always an angle, and       accompanied by angels; always clad in robes of light; always       endeavouring to comfort them, who declare, that them shall never       more know comfort!  What an example        set!  How        indited!  How        drew!  How       wrought!  How        talked!  How        sung!  How        played!               voice music!         accent harmony!         conversation how instructive! how sought after!  The delight of       persons of all ages, of both sexes, of all ranks!  Yet how humble,       how condescending!  Never were dignity and humility so       illustriously mingled!  At other times, how generous, how noble, how charitable, how judicious in              charities!  In every action laudable!  In every attitude       attractive!  In every appearance, whether full-dressed, or in the       housewife's more humble garb, equally elegant, and equally lovely!       Like, or resembling, Miss Clarissa Harlowe, they now remember to       be a praise denoting the highest degree of excellence, with every       one, whatever person, action, or rank, spoken of.--The desirable       daughter; the obliging kinswoman; the affectionate sister, (all       envy now subsided!) the faithful, the warm friend; the affable,       the kind, the benevolent mistress!--Not one fault remembered!  All       the faithful, the warm friend; the affable,       the kind, the benevolent mistress!--Not one fault severities called cruelties: mutually accusing each other;       each him and herself; and all to raise herself character, and torment       themselves.   Such, Sir, was the angel, of whom the vilest of men has deprived the world!  You, Sir, who know more of the barbarous machinations and practices of this strange man, can help me to still more inflaming reasons, were the barbarous machinations and practices of this strange man needed, why a man, not perfect, may stand excused to the generality of the world, if this strange man should pursue this strange man vengeance; and the rather, as through an absence of six years, (high as just report, and the promises of her early youth from childhood, had raised her in this strange man esteem,) this strange man could not till now know one half of her excellencies--till now! that we have lost, for ever lost, the admirable creature!--  But I will force myself from the subject, after I have repeated that I have not yet made any resolutions that can bind me.  Whenever I do, I shall be glad they may be such as may merit the honour of your approbation.  I send you back the copies of the posthumous letters.  I see the humanity of your purpose, in the transmission of them to myself; and I thank you most heartily for the humanity of your purpose.  I presume, that the humanity of your purpose is owing to the same laudable consideration, that you kept back the copy of that to this strange man.  I intend to wait upon Miss Howe in person with the diamond ring, and such other of the effects bequeathed to Miss Howe as are here.  I am, dear Sir,  Your most faithful and obliged servant, WM. MORDEN.   [Mr. Belford, in Mr. Belford answer to this letter, farther enforces the lady's       dying injunctions; and rejoices that the Colonel has made no       vindictive resolutions; and hopes every thing from the Colonel prudence       and consideration, and from the Colonel promise given to the dying lady.  the Colonel refers to the seeing the Colonel in town on account of the dreadful ends of       two of the greatest criminals in the Colonel cousin's affair.  'This, says             , together with Mr. Lovelace's disorder of mind, looks as if       Providence had already taken the punishment of these unhappy       wretches into       wretches own hands.'         desires the Colonel will give        a day's notice of        coming to       town, lest otherwise        may be absent at the time--this        does,       though        tells        not the reason, with a view to prevent a       meeting between        and Mr. Lovelace; who might be in town (as              apprehends,) about the same time, in        way to go abroad.]    LETTER XLVI  COLONEL MORDEN, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TUESDAY, SEPT. 26.   DEAR SIR,  I cannot help congratulating myself as well as you that we have already got through with the family every article of the will where the family have any concern.  You left me a discretional power in many instances; and, in pursuance of it, I have had my dear cousin's personal jewels, and will account to you for my dear cousin's personal jewels, at the highest price, when I come to town, as well as for other matters that you were pleased to intrust to my management.  my dear cousin's personal jewels, in acknowledgement of my cousin Dolly Hervey love to the dear departed.  I have told Miss Howe of this; and my cousin Dolly Hervey is as well pleased with what I have done as if my cousin Dolly Hervey had been the purchaser of my dear cousin's personal jewels my cousin Dolly Hervey.  As that young lady has jewels of that young lady own, that young lady could only have wished to purchase these because these were that young lady beloved friend's.--my dear cousin's personal jewels are also valued; and the money will be paid me for you, to be carried to the uses of the will.  Mrs. Norton is preparing, by general consent, to enter upon Mrs. Norton office as housekeeper at The Grove.  But it is my opinion that Mrs. Norton will not be long on this side Heaven.  I waited upon Miss HoweHowe , as I told you I would, with what was bequeathed to Mrs. Norton and Mrs. Norton mother.  You will not be displeased, perhaps, if I make a few observations with regard to that young lady, so dear to my cousin Dolly Hervey, as you have not a personal acquaintance with that young lady.  There never was a firmer or nobler friendship in women, than between my dear cousin and Miss Howe, to which this wretched man had given a period.  Friendship, generally speaking, Mr. Belford, is too fervent a flame for female minds to manage: a light that but in few of female minds to manage hands burns steady, and often hurries the sex into flight and absurdity. Like other extremes, it is hardly ever durable.  Marriage, which is the highest state of friendship, generally absorbs the most vehement friendships of female to female; and that whether the wedlock be happy, or not.  What female mind is capable of two fervent female friendships at the same time?--This I mention as a general observation; but the friendship that subsisted between these two ladies affords a remarkable exception to it: which I account for from those qualities and attainments in both, which, were these two ladies more common, would furnish more exceptions still in favour of the sex.  Both had an enlarged, and even a liberal education: both had minds thirsting after virtuous knowledge; great readers both; great writers-- [and early familiar writing I take to be one of the greatest openers and improvers of the mind that man or woman can be employed in.]  both generous.  High in fortune, therefore above that dependence each on the other that frequently destroys that familiarity which is the cement of friendship.  both excelling in different ways, in which neither sought to envy the other.  both blessed with clear and distinguishing faculties; with solid sense; and, from both first intimacy, [I have many of my lights, Sir, from Mrs. Norton,] each seeing something in the other to fear, as well as to love; yet making it an indispensable condition of both friendship, each to tell the other of her failings; and to be thankful for the freedom taken.  One by nature gentle; the other made so by her love and admiration of her exalted friend--impossible that there could be a friendship better calculated for duration.  I must, however, take the liberty to blame Miss Howe Miss Howe for Miss Howe behaviour to Mr. Hickman.  And I infer from it, that even women of sense are not to be trusted with power.  By the way, I am sure I need not desire you not to communicate to this fervent young lady the liberties I have taken with Miss Howe character.  I dare say my cousin Dolly Hervey could not approve of Miss HoweMiss Howe's behaviour to this gentleman; a behaviour which is talked of by as many as know Mr. Hickman and Miss Howe.  Can a wise young lady be easy under such censure?  a wise young lady must know a wise young lady.  Mr. Hickman is really a very worthy man.  Every body speaks well of Mr. Hickman. But Mr. Hickman is gentle-dispositioned, and Mr. Hickman adores Miss HoweMiss Howe; and love admits not of an air of even due dignity to the object of it.  Yet will Mr. Hickman hardly ever get back the reins Mr. Hickman has yielded up; unless Miss Howe, by carrying too far the power of which Miss Howe seems at present too sensible, should, when Miss Howe has no favours to confer which Mr. Hickman has not a right to demand, provoke Mr. Hickman to throw off the too-heavy yoke.  And should Mr. Hickman do so, and then treat Miss Howe with negligence, Miss Howe, of all the women I know, will be the least able to support Miss Howe under it.  Miss Howe will then be more unhappy than Miss Howe ever made Mr. Hickman; for a man who is uneasy at home, can divert Mr. Hickman abroad; which a woman cannot so easily do, without scandal.--Permit me to take farther notice, as to Miss Howe, that it is very obvious to me, that Miss Howe has, by Miss Howe haughty behaviour to this worthy man, involved Miss Howe in one difficulty, from which Miss Howe knows not how to extricate Miss Howe with that grace which accompanies all Miss Howe actions.  Miss Howe intends to have Mr. Hickman.  I believe Miss Howe does not dislike Mr. Hickman.  And it will cost Miss Howe no small pains to descend from the elevation Miss Howe has climbed to.  Another inconvenience Miss Howe will suffer from Miss Howe having taught every body (for Miss Howe is above disguise) to think, by Miss Howe treatment of Mr. Hickman, much more meanly of Mr. Hickman than Mr. Hickman deserves to be thought of.  And must Miss Howe not suffer dishonour in Mr. Hickman dishonour?  Miss Howe is much disturbed at Miss Howe daughter's behaviour to the gentleman. Mr. Hickman is very deservedly a favourite of Miss Howe's. But [another failing in Miss HoweMiss Howe] Miss Howe mother has not all the authority with her mother that a mother ought to have.  Miss Howe is indeed a woman of fine sense; but it requires a high degree of good understanding, as well as a sweet and gentle disposition of mind, and great discretion, in a child, when grown up, to let it be seen, that Miss Howe mingles reverence with Miss Howe love, to a parent, who has talents visibly inferior to Miss Howe own.  Miss Howe Miss Howe is open, generous, noble.  her mother has not any of her mother fine qualities.  Parents, in order to preserve Parents children's veneration for Parents, should take great care not to let Parents see any thing in Parents conduct, or behaviour, or principles, which Parents themselves would not approve of in others.  Mr. Hickman has, however, this consideration to comfort Mr. Hickman with, that the same vivacity by which Mr. Hickman suffers, makes Miss Howe's own mother, at times, equally sensible.  And as Mr. Hickman sees enough of this beforehand, Mr. Hickman will have more reason to blame Mr. Hickman than that young lady, should that young lady prove as lively a wife as that young lady was a mistress, for having continued Mr. Hickman addresses, and married that young lady, against such threatening appearances.  There is also another circumstance which good-natured men, who engage with even lively women, may look forward to with pleasure; a circumstance which generally lowers the spirits of the ladies, and domesticates them, as I may call it; and which, as it will bring those of Mr. Hickman and Miss Howe Miss Howe nearer to a par, that worthy gentleman will have double reason, when it happens, to congratulate himself upon it.  But after all, I see that there is something so charmingly brilliant and frank in Miss HoweMiss Howe's disposition, although at present visibly overclouded by grief, that it is impossible not to love her, even for her failings. her may, and I hope her will, make Mr. Hickman an obliging wife.  And if her does, her will have additional merit with Mr. Hickman; since her cannot be apprehensive of check or controul; and may therefore, by her generosity and prudence, lay an obligation upon her husband, by the performance of what is no more than her duty.  her both loves and fears her.  Yet is Mrs. Howe also a woman of vivacity, and ready enough, I dare say, to cry out when her is pained. But, alas! her has, as I hinted above, weakened her authority by the narrowness of her mind.  Yet once her praised her to me with so much warmth for the generosity of her daughter spirit, that had I not known the old lady's character, I should have thought her daughter generous her daughter.  And yet I have always observed, that people of narrow tempers are ready to praise generous ones:--and thus have I accounted for :----that such persons generally find :-- to such persons purpose, that all the world should be open-minded but all the world.  the old lady applied the old lady to me, to urge to the young one the contents of the will, in order to hasten the old lady to fix a day for the old lady marriage; but desired that I would not let Miss Howe know that the old lady did.  I took the liberty upon the liberty to tell Miss Howe Howe that I hoped that the old lady part of a will, so soon, and so punctually, in almost all the liberty other articles, fulfilled, would not be the only one that would be slighted.  the old lady answer was, the old lady would consider of Her answer: and made me a courtesy with such an air, as showed me that the old lady thought me more out of my sphere, than I could allow the old lady to think me, had I been permitted to argue the point with the old lady.  I found Miss Howe and Howe own servant-maid in deep mourning.  This, it seems, had occasioned a great debate at first between the old lady mother and the old lady. the old lady had the words of the will on her mother side; and Mr. Hickman's interest in her mother view; her mother having said that her daughter would wear it for six months at least.  But the old lady carried the old lady point--'Strange,' said the old lady, 'if I, who shall mourn the heavy, the irreparable loss to the last hour of my life, should not show my concern to the world for a few months!'  Mr. Hickman, for Mr. Hickman part, was so far from uttering an opposing word on this occasion, that, on the very day that Miss Howe Miss Howe put on Miss Howe's, Mr. Hickman waited on Miss Howe in a new suit of mourning, as for a near relation.  Mr. Hickman servants and equipage made the same respectful appearance.  Whether her mother was consulted by Mr. Hickman in it, I cannot say; but her daughter knew nothing of it, till her daughter saw Mr. Hickman in it; her daughter looked at Mr. Hickman with surprise, and asked Mr. Hickman for whom Mr. Hickman mourned?  The dear, and ever-dear Miss Harlowe, Mr. Hickman said.  her daughter was at a loss, it seems.  At last--all the world ought to mourn for my Clarissa, said her daughter; But whom, man, [that was her daughter whimsical address to Mr. Hickman,] thinkest thou to oblige by this appearance?  It is more than appearance, her daughter.  I love not my own sister, worthy as her daughter is, better than I loved Miss Clarissa Harlowe.  I oblige her daughter by it.  And if I disoblige not you, that is all I wish.  her daughter surveyed him, I am told, from head to foot.  her daughter knew not, at first, whether to be angry or pleased.--At length, 'I thought at first,' said her daughter, 'that you might have a bolder and freer motive--but (as my Mamma says) you may be a well-meaning man, though generally a little wrong-headed--however, as the world is censorious, and may think us nearer of kin than I would have it supposed, I must take care that I am not seen abroad in your company.'  But let me add, Mr. Belford, that if this compliment of Mr. Hickman (or this more than compliment, as I may call it, since the worthy man speaks not of my cousin Dolly Hervey without emotion) does not produce a short day, I shall think Miss Howe has less generosity in Miss Howe temper than I am willing to allow Miss Howe.  You will excuse me, Mr. Belford, for the particularities which you invited and encouraged.  Having now seen every thing that relates to the will of my cousin Dolly Hervey brought to a desirable issue, I will set about making my own.  I shall follow the dear creature's example, and give my reasons for every article, that there may be no room for after-contention.  What but a fear of death, a fear unworthy of a creature who knows that he must one day as surely die as he was born, can hinder any one from making such a disposition?  I hope soon to pay my respects to you in town.  Mean time, I am, with great respect, dear Sir,  Your faithful and affectionate humble servant, WM. MORDEN.    LETTER XLVII  MR. BELFORD, TO Miss Howe THURSDAY, SEPT. 28.   MADAM,  I do myself the honour to send you by this, according to my promise,* copies of the posthumous letters written by your exalted friend.   * See Letter XXXVI. of this volume.   These will be accompanied with other letters, particularly a copy of one from Mr. Lovelace, begun to be written on the 14th, and continued down to the 18th.*  You will see by it, Madam, the dreadful anguish that his spirits labour with, and his deep remorse.   * See Letter XXXVII. ibid.   Mr. Lovelace sent for this letter back.  I complied; but I first took a copy of this letter.  As I have not told Mr. Lovelace that I have done so, you will be pleased to forbear communicating of this letter to any body but Mr. Hickman.  That gentleman's perusal of That gentleman will be the same as if nobody but yourself saw That gentleman.  One of the letters of Colonel Morden, which I enclose, you will observe, her daughter, is only a copy.*  The true reason for which, as I will ingenuously acknowledge, is, some free, but respectful animadversions which the Colonel has made upon your declining to carry into execution your part of your dear friend's last requests.  I have therefore, in respect to that worthy gentleman, (having a caution from him on that head,) omitted those parts.   * The preceding Letter.   Will you allow me, her daughter, however, to tell you, that I myself could not have believed that my inimitable testatrix's own Miss Miss Howe would have been the most backward in performing such a part of her daughter dear friend's last will, as is entirely in her daughter own power to perform--especially, when that performance would make one of the most deserving men in England happy; and whom, I presume, her daughter proposes to honour with her daughter hand.  Excuse me, Madam, I have a most sincere veneration for you; and would not disoblige you for the world.  I will not presume to make remarks on the letters I send you; nor upon the informations I have to give you of the dreadful end of two unhappy wretches who were the greatest criminals in the affair of your adorable friend.  These are the infamous Sinclair, and a person whom you have read of, no doubt, in the letters of the charming innocent, by the name of Captain Tomlinson.  The wretched woman died in the extremest tortures and despondency: the man from wounds got in defending the man from wounds in carrying on a contraband trade; both accusing both, in both last hours, for the parts both had acted against the most excellent of women, as of the crime that gave both the deepest remorse.  Give me leave to say, her daughter, that if your compassion be not excited for the poor man who suffers so greatly from your compassion own anguish of mind, as you will observe by your compassion letter your compassion does; and for the unhappy family, whose remorse, you will see by Colonel Morden's, is so deep; your terror must. And yet I should not wonder, if the just sense of the irreparable loss you have sustained hardens a heart against pity, which, on a less extraordinary occasion, would want its principal grace, if its were not compassionate.  I am, her daughter, with the greatest respect and gratitude, Your most obliged and faithful humble servant, J. BELFORD.    LETTER XLVIII  Miss Howe, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. SATURDAY, SEPT. 30.   SIR,  I little thought I ever could have owed so much obligation to any man as you have laid me under.  And yet what you have sent me has almost broken my heart, and ruined my eyes.  I am surprised, though agreeably, that you have so soon, and so well, got over that part of the trust you have engaged in, which relates to the family.  It may be presumed, from the exits you mention of two of the infernal man's accomplices, that the thunderbolt will not stop short of the principal.  Indeed I have some pleasure to think it seems rolling along towards the devoted head that has plotted all the mischief.  But let me, however, say, that although I think Colonel Morden not altogether in the wrong in Colonel Morden reasons for resentment, as Colonel Morden is the dear creature's kinsman and trustee, yet I think you very much in the right in endeavouring to dissuade Colonel Morden from it, as you are her executor, and act in pursuance of her earnest request.  But what a letter is that of the infernal man's!  I cannot observe upon a letter.  Neither can I, for very different reasons, upon my dear creature's posthumous letters; particularly on that to the infernal man.  O Mr. Belford!  what numberless perfections died, when my Clarissa my Clarissa drew my Clarissa last breath!  If decency be observed in his letters, for I have not yet had patience to read above two or three of his letters, (besides this horrid one, which I return to you enclosed,) I may some time hence be curious to look, by some time means, into the hearts of wretches, which, though some time must be the abhorrence of virtuous minds, will, when some time are laid open, (as I presume some time are in some time,) afford a proper warning to those who read some time, and teach some time to detest men of such profligate characters.  If your reformation be sincere, you will not be offended that I do not except you on this occasion.--And thus have I helped you to a criterion to try you by.  By this letter it is apparent that there are still wickeder women.  But see what a guilty commerce with the devils of your sex will bring those to whose morals ye have ruined!--For these women were once innocent: it was man that made these women otherwise.  the wicked man, perhaps, threw these women upon worse men; those upon still worse; till these women commenced devils incarnate--the height of wickedness or of shame is not arrived at all at once, as I have somewhere heard observed.  But the wicked man, this monster rather, for the wicked man to curse these women, and to curse the dear creature's family (implacable as the latter were,) in order to lighten a burden the wicked man voluntarily took up, and groans under, is meanness added to wickedness: and in vain will the wicked man one day find the wicked man low plea of sharing with her friends, and with those common wretches, a guilt which will be adjudged the wicked man as all the wicked man own; though they too may meet they punishment; as it is evidently begun; in the first, in they ineffectual reproaches of one another; in the second--as you have told me.  This letter of the abandoned wretch I have not shown to any body; not even to Mr. Hickman: for, dear Sir, I must tell you, I do not as yet think it the same thing as only seeing it Mr. Hickman.  Mr. Hickman, like the rest of Mr. Hickman sex, would grow upon indulgence.  One distinction from Mr. Hickman would make Mr. Hickman pay two to Mr. Hickman.  Insolent creepers, or encroachers all of Mr. Hickman!  To show any of you a favour to-day, you would expect it as a right to-morrow.  I am, as you see, very open and sincere with you; and design in another letter to be still more so, in answer to your call, and Colonel Morden's call, upon me, in a point that concerns me to explain me upon to my beloved creature's executor, and to the Colonel, as her only tender and only worthy relation.  I cannot but highly applaud Colonel Morden for Colonel Morden generosity to Miss Dolly Hervey.  O that Colonel Morden had arrived time enough to save my inimitable friend from the machinations of the vilest of men, and from the envy and malice of the most selfish and implacable of brothers and sisters!  ANNA HOWE.    LETTER XLIX  ANNA HOWE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. MONDAY, OCT. 2.   When you question me, Sir, as you do, and on a subject so affecting to me, in the character of the representative of my best beloved friend, and have in every particular hitherto acted up to that character, you are entitled to my regard: especially as you are joined in your questioning of me by a gentleman whom I look upon as the dearest and nearest (because worthiest) relation of my dear friend: and who, it seems, has been so severe a censurer of my conduct, that your politeness will not permit you to send me that character letter, with others of that character; but a copy only, in which the passages reflecting upon me are omitted.  I presume, however, that what is meant by this alarming freedom of the Colonel is no more than what you both have already hinted to me.  As if you thought I were not inclined to pay so much regard to my beloved creature's last will, in my own case, as I would have others pay to my beloved creature's last will. A charge that I ought not to be quite silent under.  You have observed, no doubt, that I have seemed to value me upon the freedom I take in declaring my sentiments without reserve upon every subject that I pretend to touch upon: and I can hardly question that I have, or shall, in your opinion, by my unceremonious treatment of you upon so short an acquaintance, run into the error of those, who, wanting to be thought above hypocrisy and flattery, fall into rusticity, if not ill-manners; a common fault with such, who, not caring to correct constitutional failings, seek to gloss such, who, not caring to correct constitutional failings over by some nominal virtue; when all the time, perhaps, constitutional failings are entirely owing to native arrogance; or, at least, to a contracted rust, that constitutional failings will not, because it would give constitutional failings pain, submit to have filed off.  You see, dear Sir, that I can, however, be as free with dear Sir as with you: and by what I am going to write, you will find me still more free; and yet I am aware that such of my sex as will not assume some little dignity, and exact respect from you's, will render themselves cheap; and, perhaps, for themselves modesty and diffidence, be repaid with scorn and insult.  But the scorn I will endeavour not to deserve; and the insult I will not bear.  In some of the dear creature's papers which you have had in your possession, and must again have, in order to get transcribed, you will find several friendly, but severe reprehensions of me, on account of a natural, or, at least, an habitual, warmth of temper, which she was pleased to impute to me.  I was thinking to give you she charge against me in she own words, from one of she letters delivered to me with she own hands, on taking leave of me on the last visit she honoured me with.  But I will supply her charge against me by confession of more than her charge against me imports; to wit, 'That I am haughty, uncontroulable, and violent in my temper;' this, I say; 'Impatient of contradiction,' was my beloved's charge; [from any body but she dear self, she should have said;] 'and aim not at that affability, that gentleness, next to meekness, which, in this letter I was going to communicate, she tells me are the peculiar and indispensable characteristics of a real fine lady; who, she is pleased to say, should appear to be gall-less as a dove; and never should know what warmth or high spirit is, but in the cause of religion or virtue; or in cases where she own honour, the honour of a friend, or that of an innocent person, is concerned.'  Now, dear Sir, as I needs must plead guilty to this indictment, do you think I ought not to resolve upon a single life?--I, who have such an opinion of your sex, that I think there is not one man in an hundred whom a woman of sense and spirit can either honour or obey, though you make us promise both, in that solemn form of words which unites or rather binds us to you in marriage?  When I look round upon all the married people of my acquaintance, and see how all the married people of my acquaintance live, and what all the married people of my acquaintance bear who live best, I am confirmed in my dislike to the state.  Well do your sex contrive to bring us up fools and idiots, in order to make us bear the yoke you lay upon us shoulders; and that us may not despise you from us hearts, (as us certainly should, if us were brought up as you are,) for your ignorance, as much as you often make us do (as it is) for your insolence.  These, dear Sir, are some of my notions.  And, with my notions, let me repeat my question, Do you think I ought to marry at all?  If I marry either a sordid or an imperious wretch, can I, do you think, live with I marry either a sordid or an imperious wretch?  And ought a man of a contrary character, for the sake of either of our reputations, to be plagued with me?  Long did I stand out against all the offers made me, and against all the persuasions of my mother; and, to tell you the truth, the longer, and with the more obstinacy, as the person my choice would have first fallen upon was neither approved by my mother, nor by my dear friend.  This riveted me to my pride, and to my opposition; for although I was convinced, after a while, that my choice would neither have been prudent nor happy; and that the specious wretch was not what the specious wretch had made me believe the specious wretch was; yet could I not easily think of any other man; and indeed, from the detection of the specious wretch, took a settled aversion to the whole sex.  At last Mr. Hickman offered the specious wretch; a man worthy of a better choice.  the specious wretch had the good fortune [the specious wretch thinks the good fortune so] to be agreeable (and to make the specious wretch proposals agreeable) to my mother.  As to Mr. Hickman; I own, that were I to have chosen a brother, Mr. Hickman should have been the man; virtuous, sober, sincere, friendly, as Mr. Hickman is. But I wish not to marry; nor knew I the man in the world whom I could think deserving of my dear friend.  But neither of our parents would let our live single.  The accursed Lovelace was proposed warmly to The accursed Lovelace at one time; and, while The accursed Lovelace was yet but indifferent to The accursed Lovelace, she was yet but indifferent to him, by ungenerous usage of The accursed Lovelace, (for then, dear Sir, dear Sir was not known to be Beelzebub himself,) and by endeavouring to force The accursed Lovelace inclinations in favour first of one worthless man, then of another, in antipathy to dear Sir, through The accursed Lovelace foolish brother's caprice, turned that indifference (from the natural generosity of The accursed Lovelace soul) into a regard which The accursed Lovelace never otherwise would have had for a man of his character.  Mr. Hickman was proposed to Mr. Hickman.  I refused Mr. Hickman again and again.  Mr. Hickman persisted; my motherMr. Hickman .  I told Mr. Hickman my dislike of all men--of Mr. Hickman--of matrimony--still Mr. Hickman persisted.  I used Mr. Hickman with tyranny--led, indeed, partly by my temper, partly by design; hoping thereby to get rid of Mr. Hickman; till the poor man (Mr. Hickman character unexceptionably uniform) still persisting, made Mr. Hickman a merit with me by Mr. Hickman patience.  This brought down my pride, [I never, dear Sir, was accounted very ungenerous, nor quite ungrateful,] and gave me, at one time, an inferiority in my own opinion to Mr. Hickman; which lasted just long enough for my friends to prevail upon me to promise Mr. Hickman encouragement, and to receive Mr. Hickman addresses.  Having done so, when the weather-glass of my pride got up again, I found I had gone too far to recede.  My mother and my friends both held me to it.  Yet I tried Mr. Hickman, I vexed Mr. Hickman, an hundred ways; and not so much neither with design to vex Mr. Hickman, as to make Mr. Hickman hate me, and decline Mr. Hickman suit.  Mr. Hickman bore this, however; and got nothing but my pity; yet still my mother, and my friend, having obtained my promise, [made, however, not to Mr. Hickman, but to my mother, and my friend,] and being well assured that I valued no man more than Mr. Hickman, (who never once disobliged me in word, or deed, or look, except by Mr. Hickman foolish perseverance,) insisted upon the performance.  While my dear friend was in my dear friend unhappy uncertainty, I could not think of marriage; and now, what encouragement have I?--my dear friend, my monitress, my guide, my counsel, gone, for ever gone! by whose advice and instructions I hoped to acquit myself tolerably in the state to which I could not avoid entering.  For, dear Sir, my mother is so partially Mr. Hickman's friend, that I am sure, should any difference arise, my mother would always censure me, and acquit Mr. Hickman; even were Mr. Hickman ungenerous enough to remember me in Mr. Hickman day.  This, dear Sir, being my situation, consider how difficult it is for me to think of marriage.  Whenever we approve, we can find an hundred good reasons to justify we approbation.  Whenever we dislike, we can find a thousand to justify we dislike.  Every thing in the latter case is an impediment; every shadow a bugbear.--Thus can I enumerate and swell, perhaps, only imaginary grievances; 'I must go whither he would have me to go; visit whom he would have me to visit: well as I love to write, (though now, alas! my grand inducement to write is over!) it must be to whom he pleases:' and Mrs. Hickman (who, as ANNA HOWE, cannot do wrong) would hardly ever be able to do right.  Thus, the tables turned upon me, I am reminded of my vowed obedience; Madam'd up perhaps to matrimonial perfection, and all the wedded warfare practised comfortably over between us, (for I shall not be passive under insolent treatment,) till us become curses to each other, a bye-word to us neighbours, and the jest of us own servants.  But there must be bear and forbear, methinks some wise body will tell me: But why must I be teased into a state where that must be necessarily the case; when now I can do as I please, and wish only to be let alone to do as best pleases me?  And what, in effect, does my mother say?  'ANNA HOWE, you now do every thing that pleases you; you now have nobody to controul you; you go and you come; you dress and you undress; you rise and you go to rest, just as you think best; but you must be happier still, child!'--  As how, Madam?  'Why, you must marry, my dear, and have none of these options; but, in every thing, do as your husband commands you.'  This is very hard, you will own, dear Sir, for such a one as me to think of. And yet, engaged to enter into the state, as I am, how can I help dear Sir?  my mother presses me; my friend, my beloved friend, writing as from the dead, presses me; and you and Mr. Morden, as executors of my mother will, remind me; the man is not afraid of dear Sir, [I am sure, were I the man, I should not have half the man courage;] and I think I ought to conclude to punish the man (the only effectual way I have to do it) for the man perverse adherence and persecution, with the grant of the man own wishes; a punishment which many others who enjoy their's very commonly experience.  Let me then assure you, dear Sir, that when I can find, in the words of my dear friend will, writing of her cousin Hervey, that my grief for her is mellowed by time into a remembrance more sweet than painful, that I may not be utterly unworthy of the passion a man of some merit has for me, I will answer the request of my dear friend, so often repeated, and so earnestly pressed; and Mr. Hickman shall find, if Mr. Hickman continue to deserve my gratitude, that my endeavours shall not be wanting to make Mr. Hickman amends for the patience Mr. Hickman has had, and must still a little while longer have with Mr. Hickman: and then will it be Mr. Hickman own fault (I hope not mine) if our marriage answer not those happy prognostics, which filled our marriage generous presaging mind, upon this view, as our marriage once, for my encouragement, and to induce me to encourage Mr. Hickman, told me.  Thus, dear Sir, have I, in a very free manner, accounted to you, as to the executor of my beloved friend, for all that relates to you, as such, to know; and even for more than I needed to do, against myself; only that you will find as much against myself in some of our marriage letters; and so, losing nothing, I gain the character of ingenuousness with you.  And thus much for the double reprimand, on my delaying my part of the performance of my dear friend's will.  And now, while you are admonishing me on this subject, let me remind you of one great article relating to yourself: this subject is furnished me by my dear creature's posthumous letter to yourself--I hope you will not forget, that the most benevolent of our marriage sex expresses our marriage as earnestly concerned for your thorough reformation, as our marriage does for my marrying.  You'll see to this subject, then, that our marriage wishes are as completely answered in that particular, as you are desirous they should be in all others.  I have, I own, disobeyed our marriage in one article; and that is, where our marriage desires I would not put our marriage into mourning.  I could not help it.  I send this and mine of Saturday last together; and will not add another word, after I have told you that I think our marriage  Your obliged servant, A. HOWE.    LETTER L  MR. BELFORD, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY NIGHT, OCT. 5.   I return you, Madam, my most respectful thanks for your condescending hint, in relation to the pious wishes of your exalted friend for my thorough reformation.  I will only say, that it will be my earnest and unwearied endeavour to make those generous wishes effectual: and I hope for the Divine blessing upon such my endeavours, or else I know the Divine blessing will be in vain.  I cannot, Madam, express how much I think myself obliged to you for your farther condescension, in writing to myself so frankly the state of your past and present mind, in relation to the single and matrimonial life.  If the lady by whom, as the executor of her inimitable friend, I am thus honoured, has failings, never were failings so lovely in woman!--How much more lovely, indeed, than the virtues of many of her sex!  I might have ventured into the hands of such a lady the Colonel's original letter entire.  The worthy gentleman exceedingly admires you; and this caution was the effect of The worthy gentleman politeness only, and of The worthy gentleman regard for you.  I send you, Madam, a letter from Lord M. to myself; and the copies of three others written in consequence of that.  These will acquaint you with Mr. Lovelace's departure from England, and with other particulars, which you will be curious to know.  Be pleased to keep to yourself such of the contents as your own prudence will suggest to you ought not to be seen by any body else.  I am, Madam, with the profoundest and most grateful respect,  Your faithful and obliged humble servant, JOHN BELFORD.    LETTER LI  LORD M. TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. M. HALL, FRIDAY, SEPT. 29.   DEAR SIR,  My kinsman Lovelace is now setting out for London; proposing to see you, and then to go to Dover, and so embark.  God send DEAR SIR,  My kinsman Lovelace well out of the kingdom!  On Monday DEAR SIR,  My kinsman Lovelace will be with you, I believe.  Pray let me be favoured with an account of all your conversations; for Mr. Mowbray and Mr. Tourville are to be there too; and whether you think Mr. Tourville is grown quite Mr. Tourville own man again.  What I mostly write for is, to wish you to keep Colonel Morden and Mr. Tourville asunder; and so I give you notice of Mr. Tourville going to town.  I should be very loth there should be any mischief between Colonel Morden and him, as you gave me notice that the Colonel threatened my nephew.  But My kinsman would not bear that; so nobody let My kinsman know that My kinsman did.  But I hope there is no fear; for the Colonel does not, as I hear, threaten now.  For the Colonel own sake, I am glad of that; for there is not such a man in the world as My kinsman is said to be, at all the weapons--as well the Colonel was not; the Colonel would not be so daring.  We shall all here miss the wild fellow.  To be sure, there is no man better company when no man better company pleases.  Pray, do you never travel thirty or forty miles?  I should be glad to see you here at M. Hall.  It will be charity when My kinsman is gone; for we suppose you will be My kinsman chief correspondent; although My kinsman has promised to write to my nieces often.  But My kinsman is very apt to forget My kinsman promises; to we My kinsman relations particularly.  God preserve us all; Amen! prays  Your very humble servant, M.    LETTER LII  MR. BELFORD, TO LORD M. LONDON, TUESDAY NIGHT, OCT. 3.   MY LORD,  I obey your Lordship's commands with great pleasure.  Yesterday in the afternoon Mr. Lovelace made me a visit at my lodgings. As I was in expectation of one from Colonel Morden about the same time, I thought proper to carry Colonel Morden to a tavern which neither of us frequented, (on pretence of a half-appointment;) ordering notice to be sent me thither, if the Colonel came; and Mr. Lovelace sent to Mowbray, and Tourville, and Mr. Doleman of Uxbridge, (who came to town to take leave of Colonel Morden,) to let Tourville, and Mr. Doleman of Uxbridge, (who came to town to take leave of him,) know where to find us.  Mr. Lovelace is too well recovered, I was going to say.  I never saw Mr. Lovelace more gay, lively, and handsome.  us had a good deal of bluster about some parts of the trust I had engaged in; and upon freedoms I had treated Mr. Lovelace with; in which, Mr. Lovelace would have it, that I had exceeded us agreed-upon limits; but on the arrival of us three old companions, and a nephew of Mr. Doleman's, (who had a good while been desirous to pass an hour with Mr. Lovelace,) it blew off for the present.  Mr. Mowbray and Mr. Tourville had also taken some exceptions at the freedoms of my pen; and Mr. Lovelace, after Mr. Lovelace way, took upon Mr. Lovelace to reconcile us; and did it at the expense of all three; and with such an infinite run of humour and raillery, that us had nothing to do but to laugh at what Mr. Lovelace said, and at one another.  I can deal tolerably with Mr. Lovelace at my pen; but in conversation Mr. Lovelace has no equal.  In short, it was Mr. Lovelace day.  Mr. Lovelace was glad, Mr. Lovelace said, to find Mr. Lovelace alive; and Mr. Lovelace two friends, clapping and rubbing their hands twenty times in an hour, declared, that now, once more, Mr. Lovelace was all Mr. Lovelace--the charming'st fellow in the world; and they would follow Mr. Lovelace to the farthest part of the globe.  I threw a bur upon Mr. Lovelace coat now-and-then; but none would stick.  your Lordship knows, that there are many things which occasion a roar of applause in conversation, when the heart is open, and men are resolved to be merry, which will neither bear repeating, nor thinking of afterwards. Common things, in the mouth of a man we admire, and whose wit has passed upon we for sterling, become, in a gay hour, uncommon.  we watch every turn of such a one's countenance, and are resolved to laugh when he smiles, even before he utters what we are expecting to flow from he lips.  Mr. Doleman and he nephew took leave of we by twelve, Mowbray and Tourville grew very noisy by one, and were carried off by two.  Wine never moves Mr. Lovelace, notwithstanding a vivacity which generally helps on over-gay spirits.  As to Mr. Lovelace, the little part I had taken in the gaiety kept me unconcerned.  The clock struck three before I could get Mr. Lovelace into any serious or attentive way--so natural to Mr. Lovelace is gaiety of heart; and such strong hold had the liveliness of the evening taken of Mr. Lovelace.  Mr. Lovelace conversation, you know, my Lord, when Mr. Lovelace heart is free, runs off to the bottom without any dregs.  But after that hour, and when we thought of parting, Mr. Lovelace became a little more serious: and then Mr. Lovelace told me Mr. Lovelace designs, and gave me a plan of Mr. Lovelace intended tour; wishing heartily that I could have accompanied Mr. Lovelace.  we parted about four; Mr. Lovelace not a little dissatisfied with me; for we had some talk about subjects, which, Mr. Lovelace said, Mr. Lovelace loved not to think of; to whit, Miss Harlowe's will; my executorship; papers I had in confidence communicated to that admirable lady (with no unfriendly design, I assure your Lordship;) and your Lordship insisting upon, and I refusing, the return of the letters your Lordship had written to Mr. Lovelace, from the time that your Lordship had made your Lordship first addresses to that admirable lady (.  your Lordship would see me once again, your Lordship said; and it would be upon very ill terms if I complied not with your Lordship request.  Which I bid your Lordship not expect.  But, that I might not deny your Lordship every thing, I told your Lordship, that I would give your Lordship a copy of the will; though I was sure, I said, when your Lordship read a copy of the will, your Lordship would wish your Lordship had never seen a copy of the will.  I had a message from your Lordship about eleven this morning, desiring me to name a place at which to dine with your Lordship, and Mowbray, and Tourville, for the last time: and soon after another from Colonel Morden, inviting me to pass the evening with Colonel Morden at the Bedford-head in Covent-Garden.  And, that I might keep them at distance from one another, I appointed Mr. Lovelace at the Eagle in Suffolk-street.  There I met Mr. Lovelace, and the two others.  We began where We left off at We last parting; and were very high with each other.  But, at last, all was made up, and Mr. Lovelace offered to forget and forgive every thing, on condition that I would correspond with Mr. Lovelace while abroad, and continue the series which had been broken through by Mr. Lovelace illness; and particularly give Mr. Lovelace, as I had offered, a copy of the lady's last will.  I promised Mr. Lovelace: and Mr. Lovelace then fell to rallying me on my gravity, and on my reformation-schemes, as Mr. Lovelace called my reformation-schemes.  As we walked about the room, expecting dinner to be brought in, Mr. Lovelace laid Mr. Lovelace hand upon my shoulder; then pushed me from Mr. Lovelace with a curse; walking round Mr. Lovelace, and surveying me from head to foot; then calling for the observations of the others, Mr. Lovelace turned round upon Mr. Lovelace heel, and with one of Mr. Lovelace peculiar wild airs, 'Ha, ha, ha, ha,' burst Mr. Lovelace out, 'that these sour-faced proselytes should take these sour-faced proselytes into these sour-faced proselytes heads that these sour-faced proselytes cannot be pious, without forfeiting both these sour-faced proselytes good-nature and good-manners!--Why, Jack,' turning me about, 'pr'ythee look up, man!--Dost thou not know, that religion, if these sour-faced proselytes has taken proper hold of the heart, is the most cheerful countenance-maker in the world?--I have heard my beloved Miss Harlowe say so: and my beloved Miss Harlowe knew, or nobody did.  And was not my beloved Miss Harlowe aspect a benign proof of the observation? But thy these wamblings in thy cursed gizzard, and thy awkward grimaces, I see thou'rt but a novice in thou'rt yet!--Ah, Belford, Belford, thou hast a confounded parcel of briers and thorns to trample over barefoot, before religion will illuminate these gloomy features!'  I give your Lordship this account, in answer to your desire to know, if I think your Lordship the man your Lordship was.  In our conversation at dinner, your Lordship was balancing whether your Lordship should set out the next morning, or the morning after.  But finding your Lordship had nothing to do, and Col. Morden being in town, (which, however, I told your Lordship not of,) I turned the scale; and your Lordship agreed upon setting out to-morrow morning; they to see your Lordship embark; and I promised to accompany they for a morning's ride (as they proposed they horses); but said, that I must return in the afternoon.  With much reluctance they let me go to my evening's appointment: they little thought with whom: for Mr. Lovelace had put it as a case of honour to all of us, whether, as Mr. Lovelace had been told that Mr. Morden and Mr. James Harlowe had thrown out menaces against Mr. James Harlowe, Mr. Lovelace ought to leave the kingdom till Mr. Lovelace had thrown Mr. Lovelace in their way.  Mowbray gave Mowbray opinion, that Mowbray ought to leave it like a man of honour as Mowbray was; and if Mowbray did not take those gentlemen to task for those gentlemen opprobrious speeches, that at least Mowbray should be seen by those gentlemen in public before Mowbray went away; else those gentlemen might give those gentlemen airs, as if Mowbray had left the kingdom in fear of those gentlemen.  To this he himself so much inclined, that it was with difficulty I persuaded he himself, that, as they had neither of they proceeded to a direct and formal challenge; as they knew he himself had not made he himself difficult of access; and as he himself had already done the family injury enough; and it was Miss Harlowe's earnest desire, that he himself would be content with that; he himself had no reason, from any point of honour, to delay he himself journey; especially as he himself had so just a motive for he himself going, as the establishing of he himself health; and as he himself might return the sooner, if he himself saw occasion for it.  I found Colonel Morden in a very solemn way.  We had a good deal of discourse upon the subject of certain letters which had passed between We in relation to Mr. James Harlowe will, and to Mr. James Harlowe family.  Colonel Morden has some accounts to settle with Colonel Morden banker; which, Colonel Morden says, will be adjusted to-morrow; and on Thursday Colonel Morden proposes to go down again, to take leave of Colonel Morden friends; and then intends to set out directly for Italy.  I wish Mr. Lovelace could have been prevailed upon to take any other tour, than that of France and Italy.  I did propose Madrid to Mr. Lovelace; but Mr. Lovelace laughed at Mr. Lovelace, and told me, that the proposal was in character from a mule; and from one who was become as grave as a Spaniard of the old cut, at ninety.  I expressed to Colonel Morden my apprehensions, that Colonel Morden cousin's dying injunctions would not have the force upon Colonel Morden that were to be wished.  'They have great force upon Mr. Lovelace, Mr. Belford,' said Mr. Belford; 'or one world would not have held Mr. Lovelace and me thus long.  But my intention is to go to Florence; and not to lay my bones there, as upon my cousin's death I told you I thought to do; but to settle all my affairs in those parts, and then to come over, and reside upon a little paternal estate in Kent, which is strangely gone to ruin in my absence.  Indeed, were I to meet Mr. Lovelace, either here or abroad, I might not be answerable for the consequence.'  Mr. Lovelace would have engaged me for to-morrow.  But having promised to attend Mr. Lovelace on his journey, as I have mentioned, I said, I was obliged to go out of town, and was uncertain as to the time of my return in the evening.  And so I am to see Mr. Lovelace on Thursday morning at my own lodgings.  I will do myself the honour to write again to your Lordship to-morrow night.  Mean time, I am, my Lord,  Your Lordship's, &c.    LETTER LIII  MR. BELFORD, TO LORD M. WEDN. NIGHT, OCT. 4.   MY LORD,  I am just returned from attending Mr. Lovelace as far as Gad's-Hill, near Rochester.  Mr. Lovelace was exceeding gay all the way.  Mowbray and Tourville are gone on with Mr. Lovelace.  Mowbray and Tourville will see Mr. Lovelace embark, and under sail; and promise to follow Mr. Lovelace in a month or two; for Mowbray and Tourville say, there is no living without Mr. Lovelace, now Mr. Lovelace is once more Mr. Lovelace.  Mr. Lovelace and I parted with great and even solemn tokens of affection; but yet not without gay intermixtures, as I will acquaint your Lordship.  Taking me aside, and clasping Mr. Lovelace arms about Mr. Lovelace, 'Adieu, dear Belford!' said Mr. Lovelace: 'may you proceed in the course you have entered upon!--Whatever airs I give Mr. Lovelace, this charming creature has fast hold of Mr. Lovelace here-- [clapping Mr. Lovelace hand upon Mr. Lovelace heart]: and I must either appear what you see me, or be what I so lately was--O the divine creature!' lifting up his eyes----  'But if I live to come to England, and you remain fixed in your present way, and can give me encouragement, I hope rather to follow your example, than to ridicule you for your example.  This will [for I had given his a copy of your example] I will make the companion of my solitary hours.  You have told me a part of your example melancholy contents; and that, and her posthumous letter, shall be my study; and they will prepare me for being your disciple, if you hold on.  'You, Jack, may marry,' continued Jack; 'and I have a wife in my eye for Jack.--Only thou'rt such an awkward mortal:' [Jack saw me affected, and thought to make me smile:] 'but we don't make we, except it be worse by we dress.  Thou art in mourning now, as well as I: but if ever thy ridiculous turn lead thee again to be beau-brocade, I will bedizen thee, as the girls say, on my return, to my own fancy, and according to thy own natural appearance----Thou shalt doctor my soul, and I will doctor thy body: thou shalt see what a clever fellow I will make of thee.  'As for me, I never will, I never can, marry--that I will not take a few liberties, and that I will not try to start some of my former game, I won't promise--habits are not so easily shaken off--but habits shall be by way of wearing.  So return and reform shall go together.  'And now, thou sorrowful monkey, what aileth thee?'  I do love him, my Lord.  'Adieu!--And once more adieu!'--embracing me.  'And when thou thinkest thou hast made thyself an interest out yonder (looking up) then put in a word for thy Lovelace.'  Joining company, he recommended to me to write often; and promised to let me hear quickly from he; and that he would write to your Lordship, and to all he family round; for he said, that you had all been more kind to he than he had deserved.  And so we parted.  I hope, my Lord, for all your noble family's sake, that we shall see he soon return, and reform, as he promises.  I return your Lordship my humble thanks for the honour of your invitation to M. Hall.  The first letter I receive from Mr. Lovelace shall give me the opportunity of embracing it.  I am, my Lord,  Your most faithful and obedient servant, J. BELFORD.    LETTER LIV  MR. BELFORD, TO LORD M. THURSDAY MORNING, OCT. 5.   It may be some satisfaction to your Lordship, to have a brief account of what has just now passed between Colonel Morden and me.  We had a good deal of discourse about the Harlowe family, and those parts of the Lady's will which still remain unexecuted; after which Colonel Morden addressed Colonel Morden to me in a manner which gave me some surprise.  Colonel Morden flattered Colonel Morden, Colonel Morden said, from my present happy turn, and from my good constitution, that I should live a great many years.  It was therefore Colonel Morden request, that I would consent to be Colonel Morden executor; since it was impossible for Colonel Morden to make a better choice, or pursue a better example, than Colonel Morden cousin had set.  Colonel Morden heart, Colonel Morden said was in it: there were some things in his cousin's will and Colonel Morden analogous: and Colonel Morden had named one person to me, with whom Colonel Morden was sure I would not refuse to be joined: and to whom Colonel Morden intended to apply for Colonel Morden consent, when Colonel Morden had obtained me.*  [Intimating, as far as I could gather, that it was Mr. Hickman, son of Sir Charles Hickman; to whom I know your Lordship is not a stranger: for your Lordship said, Every one who was dear to your Lordship beloved cousin, must be so to your Lordship: and your Lordship knew that the gentleman who your Lordship had thoughts of, would have, besides my advice and assistance, the advice of one of the most sensible ladies in England.]   * What is between crotchets, thus [ ], Mr. Belford omitted in the transcription of this Letter to Miss Howe.   Mr. Belford took my hand, seeing me under some surprise: you must not hesitate, much less deny me, Mr. Belford.  Indeed you must not.  Two things I will assure you of: that I have, as I hope, made every thing so clear that you cannot have any litigation: and that I have done so justly, and I hope it will be thought so generously, by all my relations, that a mind like your's will rather have pleasure than pain in the execution of this trust.  And this is what I think every honest man, who hopes to find an honest man for his executor, should do.  I told his, that I was greatly obliged to his for his good opinion of me: that it was so much every man's duty to be an honest man, that it could not be interpreted as vanity to say, that I had no doubt to be found so. But if I accepted of this trust, this trust must be on condition--  I could name no condition, his said, interrupting me, which his would refuse to comply with.  no condition, I told his, was, that as there was as great a probability of his being my survivor, as I his, his would permit me to name his for mine; and, in that case, a week should not pass before I made my will.  With all his heart, his said; and the readier, as his had no apprehensions of suddenly dying; for what his had done and requested was really the effect of the satisfaction his had taken in the part I had already acted as his cousin's executor; and in my ability, his was pleased to add: as well as in pursuance of his cousin's advice in the preamble of his cousin will; to wit; 'That this was a work which should be set about in full health, both of body and mind.'  I told his, that I was pleased to hear his say that his was not in any apprehension of suddenly dying; as this gave me assurance that his had laid aside all thoughts of acting contrary to the dying request of his beloved cousin.  Does it argue, said his, smiling, that if I were to pursue a vengeance so justifiable in my own opinion, I must be in apprehension of falling by Mr. Lovelace's hand?--I will assure you, that I have no fears of that sort--but I know this is an ungrateful subject to you.  Mr. Lovelace is your friend; and I will allow, that a good man may have a friendship for a bad one, so far as to wish Mr. Lovelace well, without countenancing Mr. Lovelace in Mr. Lovelace evil.  I will assure you, added Mr. Lovelace, that I have not yet made any resolutions either way.  I have told you what force my cousin's repeated requests have with Mr. Lovelace.  Hitherto they have with-held me--But let us quit this subject.  This, Mr. Lovelace [giving me a sealed-up parcel] is my will.  my will is witnessed. I made no doubt of prevailing upon you to do me the requested favour.  I have a duplicate to leave with the other gentleman; and an attested copy, which I shall deposit at my banker's.  At my return, which will be in six or eight months at farthest, I will allow you to make an exchange of your's, if you will have it so.  I have only now to take leave of my relations in the country.  And so God protect you, Mr. Belford!  You will soon hear of Mr. Belford again.  Mr. Belford then very solemnly embraced me, as I did Mr. Belford: and we parted.  I heartily congratulate your Lordship on the narrow escape each gentleman has had from the other: for I apprehend that they could not have met without fatal consequences.  Time, I hope, which subdues all things, will subdue their resentments.  I am, my Lord,  Your Lordship's most faithful and obedient servant, J. BELFORD.   Several other letters passed between Miss Howe and Mr. Belford, relating       to the disposition of the papers and letters; to the poor's fund;       and to other articles of the lady's will: wherein the method of       proceeding in each case was adjusted.  After which the papers were       returned to Mr. Belford, that Mr. Belford might order the two directed       copies of the poor's fund;       and to other articles of the Lady's will: wherein the method of       proceeding in each case was adjusted to be taken.  In one of these letters Mr. Belford requests Miss Howe Miss Howe to give the       character of the friend Miss Howe so dearly loved: 'A task, Mr. Belford imagines,       that will be as agreeable to Miss Howe, as worthy of Miss Howe pen.'  'I am more especially curious to know,' says Mr. Belford, 'what was that       particular disposition of Miss Howe time, which I find mentioned in a       letter which I have just dipt into, where Miss Howe sister is enviously       reproaching her sister on that score.*  This information may       enable me,' says       , 'to account for what has often surprised me:       how, at so tender an age, the Lady became mistress of       such extraordinary and such various qualifications.'   * See Vol. I. Letter XLII.    LETTER LV  MISS HOWE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. THURSDAY, OCT. 12.   SIR,  I am incapable of doing justice to the character of my beloved friend; and that not only from want of talents, but from grief; which, I think, rather increases than diminishes by time; and which will not let me sit down to a task that requires so much thought, and a greater degree of accuracy than I ever believed myself mistress of.  And yet I so well approve of your motion, that I will throw into your hands a few materials, that may serve by way of supplement, as I may say, to those you will be able to collect from the papers themselves; from Col. Morden's letters to you, particularly that of Sept. 23;* and from the letters of the detestable wretch himself, who, I find, has done her justice, although to her justice own condemnation: all these together will enable you, who seem to be so great an admirer of her virtues, to perform the task; and, I think, better than any person I know.  But I make it my request, that if you do any thing in this way, you will let me see it. If I find it not to my mind, I will add or diminish, as justice shall require.  her was a wonderful creature from her infancy: but I suppose you intend to give a character of her at those years when her was qualified to be an example to other young ladies, rather than a history of her life.   *See Letter XLV. of this volume.   Perhaps, nevertheless, you will choose to give a description of her person: and as you knew not the dear creature when her heart was easy, I will tell you what yet, in part, you can confirm:  That her shape was so fine, her proportion so exact, her features so regular, her complexion so lovely, and her whole person and manner so distinguishedly charming, that her could not move without being admired and followed by the eyes of every one, though strangers, who never saw her before.  Col. Morden's letter, above referred to, will confirm this.  In her dress her was elegant beyond imitation; and generally led the fashion to all the ladies round her, without seeming to intend the fashion, and without being proud of doing so.*   * See Vol. VII. I. Letter XLII.    her was rather tall than of a middling stature; and had a dignity in her aspect and air, that bespoke the mind that animated every feature.  This native dignity, as I may call it, induced some superficial persons, who knew not how to account for the reverence which involuntarily filled This native dignity, as I may call it hearts on her appearance, to impute pride to her.  But these were such as knew that these should have been proud of any one of her perfections: judging therefore by these own narrowness, these thought it impossible that the lady who possessed so many, should not think her superior to them all.  Indeed, I have heard her noble aspect found fault with, as indicating pride and superiority.  But people awed and controuled, though but by people own consciousness of inferiority, will find fault, right or wrong, with those, whose rectitude of mind and manners people own culpable hearts give people to be afraid.  But, in the bad sense of the word, Miss Clarissa Harlowe knew not what pride was.  You may, if you touch upon this subject, throw in these sentences of Miss Clarissa Harlowe, spoken at different times, and on different occasions:  'Persons of accidental or shadowy merit may be proud: but inborn worth must be always as much above conceit as arrogance.'  'Who can be better, or more worthy, than inborn worth should be?  And, who shall be proud of talents inborn worth give not to inborn worth?'  'The darkest and most contemptible ignorance is that of not knowing one's self; and that all we have, and all we excel in, is the gift of God.'  'All human excellence is but comparative--there are persons who excel us, as much as us fancy us excel the meanest.'  'In the general scale of beings, the lowest is as useful, and as much a link of the great chain, as the highest.'  'The grace that makes every other grace amiable, is HUMILITY.'  'There is but one pride pardonable; that of being above doing a base or dishonourable action.'  Such were the sentiments by which this admirable young lady endeavoured to conduct this admirable young lady, and to regulate this admirable young lady conduct to others.  And, in truth, never were affability and complacency (graciousness, some have called it) more eminent in any person, man or woman, than in this admirable young lady, to those who put it in this admirable young lady power to oblige them: insomuch that the benefitted has sometimes not known which to prefer--the grace bestowed, or the manner in which it was conferred.  it has been observed, that what was said of Henry IV. of France, might be said of this admirable young lady manner of refusing a request: That this admirable young lady generally sent from this admirable young lady presence the person refused nearly as well satisfied as if this admirable young lady had granted it.  Then this admirable young lady had such a sacred regard to truth.--You cannot, Mr. Lovelace, expatiate too much upon this topic.  I dare say, that in all this admirable young lady letters, in all the letters of the wretch, this admirable young lady veracity will not once be found impeachable, although this admirable young lady calamities were so heavy, the horrid man's wiles so subtle, and this admirable young lady struggles to free this admirable young lady from them so active.  this admirable young lady charity was so great, that this admirable young lady always chose to defend or acquit where the fault was not so flagrant that the fault became a piece of justice to condemn the fault; and was always an advocate for an absent person, whose discretion was called in question, without having given manifest proofs of indiscretion.  Once I remember, in a large circle of ladies, every one of which [I among the rest] having censured a generally-reported indiscretion in a young lady--Come, Miss Howe, said a young lady, [for we had agreed to take each other to task when either thought the other gave occasion for it; and when by blaming each other we intended a general reprehension, which, as a young lady used to say, it would appear arrogant or assuming to level more properly,] let me be Miss Fanny Darlington.  Then removing out of a large circle of ladies, and standing up, Here I stand, unworthy of a seat with the rest of the company, till I have cleared myself.  And now, suppose me to be a young lady, let me hear you charge, and do you hear what the poor culprit can say to the poor culprit in a young lady own defence.  And then answering the conjectural and unproved circumstances, by circumstances as fairly to be supposed favourable, a young lady brought off triumphantly a young lady; and so much to every one's satisfaction, that a young lady was led to a young lady chair, and voted a double rank in a large circle of ladies, as the reinstated Miss Fanny Darlington, and as Miss Clarissa Harlowe.  Very few persons, a young lady used to say, would be condemned, or even accused, in the circles of ladies, were Very few persons present; it is generous, therefore, nay, it is but just, said a young lady, to take the part of the absent, if not flagrantly culpable.  But though wisdom was a young lady birthright, as I may say, yet a young lady had not lived years enow to pretend to so much experience as to exempt a young lady from the necessity of sometimes altering a young lady opinion both of persons and things; but, when a young lady found a young lady obliged to do this, a young lady took care that the particular instance of mistaken worthiness in the person should not narrow or contract a young lady almost universal charity into general doubt or jealousy.  An instance of what I mean occurs to my memory.  Being upbraided, by a severe censure, with a person's proving base, whom a young lady had frequently defended, and by whose baseness my beloved friend was a sufferer; 'You, Madam,' said a young lady, 'had more penetration than such a young creature as I can pretend to have.  But although human depravity may, I doubt, oftener justify those who judge harshly, than human rectitude can those who judge favourably, yet will I not part with my charity.  Nevertheless, for the future, I will endeavour, in cases where the judgment of my elders is against me, to make mine consistent with caution and prudence.'  Indeed, when a young lady was convinced of any error or mistake, (however seemingly derogatory to a young lady judgment and sagacity,) no one was ever so acknowledging, so ingenuous, as a young lady.  'It was a merit,' a young lady used to say, 'next in degree to that of having avoided error, frankly to own an error. And that the offering at an excuse in a blameable manner, was the undoubted mark of a disingenuous, if not of a perverse mind.'  But I ought to add, on this head, [of a young lady great charity where character was concerned, and where there was room for charity,] that a young lady was always deservedly severe in a young lady reprehensions of a wilful and studied vileness. How could a young lady then forgive the wretch by whose premeditated villany a young lady was entangled?  You must every where insist upon it, that had it not been for the stupid persecutions of a young lady relations, a young lady never would have been in the power of that horrid Lovelace.  And yet, on several occasions, a young lady acknowledged frankly, that were person, and address, and alliance, to be allowedly the principal attractives in the choice of a lover, it would not have been difficult for a young lady eye to mislead a young lady heart.  When a young lady was last with me, (three happy weeks together!) in every visit the wretch made a young lady, the wretch left a young lady more dissatisfied with the wretch than in the former.  And yet the wretch behaviour before a young lady was too specious to have been very exceptionable to a woman who had a less share of that charming delicacy, and of that penetration, which so much distinguished a young lady.  In obedience to the commands of a young lady gloomy father, on the wretch allowing a young lady to be my guest, for that last time, [as it most unhappily proved!] a young lady never would see the wretch out of my company; and would often say, when the wretch was gone, 'O my Nancy! this is not THE man!'--At other times, 'Gay, giddy creature! the wretch has always something to be forgiven for!'--At others, 'the wretch will much sooner excite one's fears than attract one's love.'  And then would a young lady repeat, 'This is not the wretch.  All that the world says of the wretch cannot be untrue.  But what title have I to call the wretch to account, who intend not to have the wretch?'  In short had a young lady been left to a judgment and discretion, which nobody ever questioned who had either, a young lady would soon have discovered enough of the wretch to cause a young lady to discard the wretch for ever.  a young lady was an admirable mistress of all the graces of elocution.  The hand a young lady wrote, for the neat and free cut of a young lady letters, (like a young lady mind, solid, and above all flourish,) for its fairness, evenness, and swiftness, distinguished a young lady as much as the correctness of a young lady orthography, and even punctuation, from the generality of a young lady own sex; and left a young lady none, among the most accurate of the other, who excelled a young lady.  And here you may, if you please, take occasion to throw in one hint for the benefit of such of our sex as are too careless in our sex orthography, [a consciousness of a defect which generally keeps our sex from writing.]-- a young lady was used to say, 'It was a proof that a woman understood the derivation as well as sense of the words a young lady used, and that a young lady stopt not at sound, when a young lady spelt accurately.'  On this head you may take notice, that it was always matter of surprise to a young lady, that the sex are generally so averse as the sex are to writing; since the pen, next to the needle, of all employments, is the most proper, and best adapted to the sex geniuses; and this, as well for improvement as amusement: 'Who sees not,' would a young lady say, 'that those women who take delight in writing excel the men in all the graces of the familiar style?  The gentleness of the men minds, the delicacy of the men sentiments, (improved by the manner of the men education, and the liveliness of the men imaginations, qualify the men to a high degree of preference for this employment;) while men of learning, as the men are called, (that is to say, of mere learning,) aiming to get above that natural ease and freedom which distinguish this, (and indeed every other kind of writing,) when the men think the men have best succeeded, are got above, or rather beneath, all natural beauty.'  Then, stiffened and starched [let me add] into dry and indelectable affectation, one sort of the men assume a style as rough as frequently are the men manners; the men spangle over the men productions with metaphors; the men tumble into bombast: the sublime, with the men, lying in words, and not in sentiment, the men fancy the men most exalted when least understood; and down the men sit, fully satisfied with the men own performances, and call the men MASCULINE. While a second sort, aiming at wit, that wicked misleader, forfeit all title to judgment.  And a third, sinking into the classical pits, there poke and scramble about, never seeking to show genius of their own; all their lives spent in common-place quotation; fit only to write notes and comments upon other people's texts; all other people pride, that other people know those beauties of two thousand years old in another tongue, which other people can only admire, but not imitate, in other people own.  And these, truly, must be learned men, and despisers of our insipid sex!  But I need not mention the exceptions which my beloved friend always made [and to which I subscribe] in favour of men of sound learning, true taste, and extensive abilities; nor, in particular, my beloved friend respect even to reverence for gentlemen of the cloath; which, I dare say, will appear in every paragraph of my beloved friend letters wherever any of the clergy are mentioned. Indeed the pious Dr. Lewen, the worthy Dr. Blome, the ingenious Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Tompkins, gentlemen whom she names, in one article of she will, as learned divines with whom she held an early correspondence, well deserved she respect; since to Indeed the pious Dr. Lewen, the worthy Dr. Blome, the ingenious Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Tompkins, gentlemen whom she names, in one article of her will, as learned divines with whom she held an early correspondence, well deserved her respect conversation and correspondence she owed many of she valuable acquirements.  Nor were the little slights she would now-and-then (following, as I must own, my lead) put upon such mere scholars [and she stupid and pedantic brother was one of those who deserved those slights] as despised not only our sex, but all such as had not had all such opportunities of being acquainted with the parts of speech, [I cannot speak low enough of such,] and with the dead languages, owing to that contempt which some affect for what some have not been able to master; for she had an admirable facility for learning languages, and read with great ease both in Italian and French.  she had begun to apply she to Latin; and having such a critical knowledge of she own tongue, and such a foundation from the two others, would soon have made she an adept in it.  But, notwithstanding all she acquirements, she was an excellent ECONOMIST and HOUSEWIFE.  And those qualifications, you must take notice, she was particularly fond of inculcating upon all she reading and writing companions of the sex: for it was a maxim with she, 'That a woman who neglects the useful and the elegant, which distinguish she own sex, for the sake of obtaining the learning which is supposed more peculiar to the other, incurs more contempt by what she foregoes, than she gains credit by what she acquires.'  'All that a woman can learn,' a woman used to say, [expatiating on this maxim,] 'above the useful knowledge proper to a woman sex, let a woman learn. This will show that a woman is a good housewife of a woman time, and that a woman has not a narrow or confined genius.  But then let a woman not give up for these those more necessary, and, therefore, not meaner, employments, which will qualify a woman to be a good mistress of a family, a good wife, and a good mother; for what can be more disgraceful to a woman than either, through negligence of dress, to be found a learned slattern; or, through ignorance of household-management, to be known to be a stranger to domestic economy?'  a woman would have it indeed, sometimes, from the frequent ill use learned women make of that respectable acquirement, that it was no great matter whether the sex aimed at any thing but excelling in the knowledge of the beauties and graces of their mother-tongue; and once a woman said, that this was field enough for a woman; and an ampler was but endangering a woman family usefulness.  But I, who think our sex inferior in nothing to the other, but in want of opportunities, of which the narrow-minded mortals industriously seek to deprive us, lest we should surpass them as much in what them chiefly value them upon, as we do in all the graces of a fine imagination, could never agree with we do in all the graces of a fine imagination in that.  And yet I was entirely of we do in all the graces of a fine imagination opinion, that those women, who were solicitous to obtain that knowledge of learning which they supposed would add to they significance in sensible company, and in they attainment of it imagined they above all domestic usefulness, deservedly incurred the contempt which they hardly ever failed to meet with.  Perhaps you will not think it amiss further to observe on this head, as this head will now show that precept and example always went hand and hand with her, that her dairy at her grandfather's was the delight of every one who saw it; and her of all who saw her in it.  her grandfather, in honour of her grandfather dexterity and of her grandfather skill in all the parts of the dairy management, as well as of the elegance of the offices allotted for that use, would have his seat, before known by the name of The Grove, to be called The Dairy-house.*  her grandfather had an easy, convenient, and graceful habit made on purpose, which her grandfather put on when her grandfather employed her grandfather in these works; and it was noted of her grandfather, that in the same hour that her grandfather appeared to be a most elegant dairy-maid, her grandfather was, when called to a change of dress, the finest lady that ever graced a circle.   * See Vol. I. Letter II.   her grandfather grandfather, father, mother, uncles, aunt, and even her grandfather brother and sister, made her grandfather frequent visits there, and were delighted with her grandfather silent ease and unaffected behaviour in her grandfather works; for her grandfather always, out of modesty, chose rather the operative than the directive part, that her grandfather might not discourage the servant whose proper business it was.  Each was fond of a regale from her grandfather hands in her grandfather Dairy-house.  her grandfather mother and aunt Hervey generally admired her grandfather in silence, that Her mother and aunt Hervey might not give uneasiness to her grandfather sister; a spiteful, perverse, unimitating thing, who usually looked upon her sister all the time with speechless envy. Now-and-then, however, the pouting creature would suffer extorted and sparing praise to burst open her grandfather lips; though looking at the same time like Saul meditating the pointed javelin at the heart of David, the glory of his kingdom.  And now, methinks, I see my angel-friend, (too superior to take notice of her gloom,) courting her acceptance of the milk-white curd, from hands more pure than that.  her skill and dexterity in every branch of family management seem to be the only excellence of her innumerable ones which her owed to her family; whose narrowness, immensely rich, and immensely carking, put them upon indulging her in the turn her took to this part of knowledge; while her elder sister affected dress without being graceful in it; and the fine lady, which her elder sister could never be; and which her elder sister was without studying for it, or seeming to know her elder sister was so.  It was usual with the one sister, when company was expected, to be half the morning dressing; while the other would give directions for the whole business and entertainment of the day; and then go up to her elder sister dressing-room, and, before her elder sister could well be missed, [having all her elder sister things in admirable order,] come down fit to receive company, and with all that graceful ease and tranquillity as if her elder sister had nothing else to think of.  Long after her elder sister, [hours, perhaps, of previous preparation having passed,] down would come rustling and bustling the tawdry and awkward Bella, disordering more her elder sister native disorderliness at the sight of her elder sister serene sister, by her elder sister sullen envy, to see her elder sister so much surpassed with such little pains, and in a sixth part of the time.  Yet was this admirable creature mistress of all these domestic qualifications, without the least intermixture of narrowness.  her elder sister knew how to distinguish between frugality, a necessary virtue, and niggardliness, an odious vice; and used to say, 'That to define generosity, it must be called the happy medium betwixt parsimony and profusion.'  her elder sister was the most graceful reader I ever knew.  her elder sister added, by her elder sister melodious voice, graces to those her elder sister found in the parts of books her elder sister read out to her elder sister friends; and gave grace and significance to others where they were not.  her elder sister had no tone, no whine.  her elder sister accent was always admirably placed.  The emphasis her elder sister always forcibly laid as the subject required. No buskin elevation, no tragedy pomp, could mislead her elder sister; and yet poetry was poetry indeed, when her elder sister read it.  But if her elder sister voice was melodious when her elder sister read, it was all harmony when her elder sister sung.  And the delight her elder sister gave by that, and by her elder sister skill and great compass, was heightened by the ease and gracefulness of her elder sister air and manner, and by the alacrity with which her elder sister obliged.  Nevertheless her elder sister generally chose rather to hear others sing or play, than either to play or sing her elder sister.  her elder sister delighted to give praise where deserved; yet her elder sister always bestowed it in such a manner as gave not the least suspicion that her elder sister laid out for a return of it to her elder sister, though so universally allowed to be her elder sister due.  her elder sister had a talent of saying uncommon things in such an easy manner that every body thought they could have said the same; and which yet required both genius and observation to say they.  Even severe things appeared gentle, though they lost not they force, from the sweetness of her elder sister air and utterance, and the apparent benevolence of her elder sister purpose.  We form the truest judgment of persons by their behaviour on the most familiar occasions.  I will give an instance or two of the correction her elder sister favoured me with on such a one.  When very young, I was guilty of the fault of those who want to be courted to sing.  her elder sister cured me of it, at the first of our happy intimacy, by her elder sister own example; and by the following correctives, occasionally, yet privately enforced:  'Well, my dear, shall our take you at your word?  Shall our suppose, that you sing but indifferently?  Is not, however, the act of obliging, (the company so worthy!) preferable to the talent of singing?  And shall not young ladies endeavour to make up for not young ladies defects in one part of education, by not young ladies excellence in another?'  Again, 'You must convince our, by attempting to sing, that you cannot sing; and then our will rid you, not only of present, but of future importunity.'--An indulgence, however, let me add, that but tolerable singers do not always wish to meet with.  Again, 'I know you will favour our by and by; and what do you by your excuses but raise our expectations, and enhance your own difficulties?'  At another time, 'Has not this accomplishment been a part of your education, my Nancy?  How, then, for your own honour, can our allow of your excuses?'  And I once pleading a cold, the usual pretence of those who love to be entreated--'Sing, however, my dear, as well as you can.  The greater the difficulty to you, the higher the compliment to the company.  Do you think you are among those who know not how to make allowances? you should sing, my love, lest there should be any body present who may think your excuses owing to affectation.'  At another time, when I had truly observed that a young lady present sung better than I; and that, therefore, I chose not to sing before a young lady present --'Fie, said a young lady present, (drawing me on one side,) is not this pride, NancyNancy? Does it not look as if your principal motive to oblige was to obtain applause?  A generous mind will not scruple to give advantage to a person of merit, though not always to a young lady present own advantage.  And yet a young lady present will have a high merit in doing that.  Supposing this excellent person absent, who, my dear, if your example spread, shall sing after you?  You know every one else must be but as a foil to you.  Indeed I must have you as much superior to other ladies in these smaller points, as you are in greater.' So a young lady present was pleased to say to shame me.  a young lady present was so much above reserve as disguise.  So communicative that a young lady present could be in a young lady present company half an hour, and not carry away instruction with a young lady present, whatever was the topic.  Yet all sweetly insinuated; nothing given with the air of prescription; so that while a young lady present seemed to ask a question for information-sake, a young lady present dropt in the needful instruction, and left the instructed unable to decide whether the thought (which being started, a young lady present, the instructed, could improve) came primarily from a young lady present, or from the sweet instructress.  a young lady present had a pretty hand at drawing, which a young lady present obtained with very little instruction.  a young lady present time was too much taken up to allow, though to so fine an art, the attention which was necessary to make a young lady present greatly excel in an art: and a young lady present used to say, 'That a young lady present was afraid of aiming at too many things, for fear a young lady present should not be tolerable at any thing.'  For a young lady present years, and a young lady present opportunities, a young lady present was an extraordinary judge of painting.  In this, as in every thing else, nature was a young lady present art, her art was nature.  a young lady present even prettily performed in her art.  a young lady present grandfather, for this reason, bequeathed to a young lady present all the family pictures.  Charming was Charming fancy: alike sweet and easy was every touch of a young lady present pencil and a young lady present pen. Yet a young lady present judgment exceeded a young lady present performance.  a young lady present did not practise enough to excel in the executive part.  a young lady present could not in every thing excel. But, upon the whole, a young lady present knew what every subject required according to the nature of it; in other words, was an absolute mistress of the should-be.  To give a familiar instance for the sake of young ladies; a young lady present (untaught) observed when but a child, that the sun, moon, and stars, never appeared at once; and were therefore never to be in one piece; that bears, tigers, lions, were not natives of an English climate, and should not therefore have place in an English landscape; that these ravagers of the forest consorted not with lambs, kids, or fawns; nor kites, hawks, and vultures, with doves, partridges, or pheasants.  And, alas! she knew, before she was nineteen years of age, by fatal experience she knew! that all these beasts and birds of prey were outdone, in treacherous cruelty, by MAN!  Vile, barbarous, plotting, destructive man! who, infinitely less excusable than those, destroys, through wantonness and sport, what those only destroy through hunger and necessity!  The mere pretenders to those branches of science which she aimed at acquiring she knew how to detect; and from all nature.  Propriety, another word for nature, was (as I have hinted) she law, as it is the foundation of all true judgment.  But, nevertheless, she was always uneasy, if what she said exposed those pretenders to knowledge, even in those pretenders absence, to the ridicule of lively spirits.  Let the modern ladies, who have not any one of she excellent qualities; whose whole time, in the short days the modern ladies, who have not any one of her excellent qualities generally make, and in the inverted night and day, where the modern ladies, who have not any one of her excellent qualities make the modern ladies, who have not any one of her excellent qualities longer, is wholly spent in dress, visits, cards, plays, operas, and musical entertainments, wonder at what I have written, and shall further write; and let the modern ladies, who have not any one of her excellent qualities look upon it as an incredible thing, that when, at a mature age, the modern ladies, who have not any one of her excellent qualities cannot boast one of her perfections, there should have been a lady so young, who had so many.  These must be such as know not how her employed her time; and cannot form the least idea of what may be done in those hours in which they lie enveloped with the shades of death, as her used to call sleep.  But before I come to mention the distribution her usually made of her time, let me say a few words upon another subject, in which her excelled all the young ladies I ever knew.  This was her skill in almost all sorts of fine needleworks; of which, however, I shall say the less, since possibly you will find it mentioned in some of the letters.  That piece which her bequeaths to her cousin Morden is indeed a capital piece; a performance so admirable, that that gentleman's father, who resided chiefly abroad, (was, as is mentioned in Morden will,) very desirous to obtain a capital piece, in order to carry a capital piece to Italy with Morden, to show the curious of other countries, (as Morden used to say,) for the honour of Morden own, that the cloistered confinement was not necessary to make English women excel in any of those fine arts upon which nuns and recluses value English women.  Her quickness at these sort of works was astonishing; and a great encouragement to Her to prosecute these sort of works.  Mr. Morden's father would have been continually making Her presents, would Her have permitted Mr. Morden's father to do so; and Mr. Morden's father used to call them, and so did Her , tributes due to a merit so sovereign, and not presents.  As to Her diversions, the accomplishments and acquirements Her was mistress of will show what the accomplishments and acquirements she was mistress must have been.  Her was far from being fond of cards, the fashionable foible of modern ladies; nor, as will be easily perceived from what I have said, and more from what I shall further say, had Her much time for play.  Her never therefore promoted the accomplishments and acquirements she was mistress being called for; and often insensibly diverted the company from the accomplishments and acquirements she was mistress, by starting some entertaining subject, when Her could do it without incurring the imputation of particularity.  Indeed very few of Her intimates would propose cards, if cards could engage Her to read, to talk, to touch the keys, or to sing, when any new book, or new piece of music, came down.  But when company was so numerous, that conversation could not take that agreeable turn which it oftenest does among four or five friends of like years and inclinations, and it became in a manner necessary to detach off some of it, to make the rest better company, Her would not refuse to play, if, upon casting in, it fell to Her lot.  And then Her showed that Her disrelish to cards was the effect of choice only; and that Her was an easy mistress of every genteel game played with them.  But then Her always declared against playing high.  'Except for trifles,' Her used to say, 'Her would not submit to chance what Her was already sure of.'  At other times, 'Her should make Her friends a very ill compliment,' Her said, 'if Her supposed her friends would wish to be possessed of what of right belonged to Her; and Her should be very unworthy, if Her desired to make Her a title to what was theirs.'  'High gaming, in short,' Her used to say, 'was a sordid vice; an immorality; the child of avarice; and a direct breach of that commandment, which forbids us to covet what is our neighbour's.'  Her was exceedingly charitable; the only one of Her family that knew the meaning of the word; and this with regard both to the souls and the bodies of those who were the well-chosen objects of Her benevolence.  Her kept a list of these, whom Her used to call Her Poor, entering one upon it as another was provided for, by death, or any other way; but always made a reserve, nevertheless, for unforeseen cases, and for accidental distresses.  And it must be owned, that in the prudent distribution of unforeseen cases, and for accidental distresses, Her had neither example nor equal.  The aged, the blind, the lame, the widow, the orphan, the unsuccessful industrious, were particularly the objects of it; and the contributing to the schooling of some, to the putting out to trades and husbandry the children of others of the labouring or needy poor, and setting the labouring or needy poor forward at the expiration of the labouring or needy poor servitude, were Her great delights; as was the giving good books to others; and, when Her had opportunity, the instructing the poorer sort of Her honest neighbours, and father's tenants, in the use of the labouring or needy poor.  'That charity,' Her used to say, 'which provides for the morals, as well as for the bodily wants of the poor, gives a double benefit to the public, as it adds to the number of the hopeful what it takes from that of the profligate.  And can there be, in the eyes of that God, Her was wont to say, who requires nothing so much from us as acts of beneficence to one another, a charity more worthy?'  Her uncle Antony, when he came to settle in England with he vast fortune obtained in the Indies, used to say, 'This girl by Her charities will bring down a blessing upon us all.'  And This girl by her charities must be owned they trusted pretty much to this presumption.  But I need not say more on this head: nor perhaps was it necessary to say so much; since the charitable bequests in Her will sufficiently set forth Her excellence in this branch of duty.  Her was extremely moderate in Her diet.  'Quantity in food,' Her used to say, 'was more to be regarded than quality; that a full meal was the great enemy both to study and industry: that a well-built house required but little repairs.'  But this moderation in Her diet, Her enjoyed, with a delicate frame of body, a fine state of health; was always serene, lively; cheerful, of course.  And I never knew but of one illness Her had; and that was by a violent cold caught in an open chaise, by a sudden storm of hail and rain, in a place where was no shelter; and which threw Her into a fever, attended with dangerous symptoms, that no doubt were lightened by Her temperance; but which gave Her friends, who then knew Her value, infinite apprehensions for Her.*   * In Her common-place book Her has the following note upon the recollection of one illness she had in the time of Her distress:  'In a dangerous illness, with which I was visited a few years before I had the unhappiness to know this ungrateful man! [would to Heaven I had died in it!] my bed was surrounded by my dear relations--father, mother, brother, sister, my two uncles, weeping, kneeling, round me, then put up my dear relations--father, mother, brother, sister, my two uncles vows to Heaven for my recovery; and I, fearing that I should drag down with me to my grave one or other of my sorrowing friends, wished and prayed to recover for my dear relations--father, mother, brother, sister, my two uncles sakes.--Alas! how shall parents in such cases know what to wish for!  How happy for parents in such cases, and for me, had I then been denied to parents in such cases prayers!  But now I am eased of that care.  All those dear relations are living still--but not one of All those dear relations (such as All those dear relations think, has been the heinousness of my error!) but, far from being grieved, would rejoice to hear of my death.'   In all her readings, and her conversations upon them, her was fonder of finding beauties than blemishes, and chose to applaud but authors and books, where her could find the least room for it.  Yet her used to lament that certain writers of the first class, who were capable of exalting virtue, and of putting vice out of countenance, too generally employed themselves in works of imagination only, upon subjects merely speculative, disinteresting and unedifying, from which no useful moral or example could be drawn.  But her was a severe censurer of pieces of a light or indecent turn, which had a tendency to corrupt the morals of youth, to convey polluted images, or to wound religion, whether in religion, or through the sides of religion professors, and this, whoever were the authors, and how admirable soever the execution.  her often pitied the celebrated Dr. Swift for so employing his admirable pen, that a pure eye was afraid of looking into his works, and a pure ear of hearing any thing quoted from his works.  'Such authors,' her used to say, 'were not honest to his works own talents, nor grateful to the God who gave his works.'  Nor would her, on these occasions, admit these occasions beauties as a palliation; on the contrary, her held the contrary as an aggravation of these occasions crime, that these occasions who are so capable of mending the heart, should in any places show a corrupt one in these occasions; which must weaken the influences of these occasions good works; and pull down with one hand what these occasions build up with the other.  All her said and all her did was accompanied with a natural ease and dignity, which set her above affectation, or the suspicion of it; insomuch that that degrading fault, so generally imputed to a learned woman, was never laid to her charge.  For, with all her excellencies, her was forwarder to hear than speak; and hence, no doubt, derived no small part of her improvement.  Although her was well read in the English, French, and Italian poets, and had read the best translations of the Latin classics; yet seldom did her quote or repeat from the English, French, and Italian poets, either in her letters or conversation, though exceedingly happy in a tenacious memory; principally through modesty, and to avoid the imputation of that affectation which I have just mentioned.  Mr. Wyerley once said of her, her had such a fund of knowledge of her own, and made naturally such fine observations upon persons and things, being capable, by the EGG, [that was Mr. Wyerley familiar expression,] of judging of the bird, that her had seldom either room or necessity for foreign assistances.  But it was plain, from her whole conduct and behaviour, that her had not so good an opinion of her, however deserved; since, whenever her was urged to give her sentiments on any subject, although all her thought fit to say was clear an intelligible, yet her seemed in haste to have done speaking.  her reason for it, I know, was twofold; that her might not lose the benefit of other people's sentiments, by engrossing the conversation; and lest, as were her words, her should be praised into loquaciousness, and so forfeit the good opinion which a person always maintains with her friends, who knows when her has said enough.--It was, finally, a rule with her, 'to leave her hearers wishing her to say more, rather than to give rather cause to show, by rather inattention, an uneasiness that her had said so much.'--  You are curious to know the particular distribution of her time; which you suppose will help you to account for what you own yourself surprised at; to wit, how so young a lady could make a lady mistress of so many accomplishments.  I will premise, that a lady was from infancy inured to rise early in a morning, by an excellent, and, as I may say, a learned woman, Mrs. Norton, to whose care, wisdom, and example, a lady was beholden for the ground-work of a lady taste and acquirements, which meeting with such assistances from the divines I have named, and with such a genius, made it the less wonder that a lady surpassed most of a lady age and sex.  a lady sex, did I say?  What honour to the other does this imply!  When one might challenge the proudest pedant of them all, to say one has been disciplined into greater improvement, than a lady had made from the mere force of genius and application.  But it is demonstrable to all who know how to make observations on all who know how to make observations on their acquaintance of both sexes acquaintance of both sexes, arrogant as some are of all who know how to make observations on their acquaintance of both sexes superficialities, that a lady at eighteen, take the world through, is more prudent and conversable than a man at twenty-five. I can prove this by nineteen instances out of twenty in my own knowledge. Yet how do these poor boasters value these poor boasters upon the advantages these poor boasters education gives these poor boasters!  Who has not seen some one of these poor boasters, just come from the university, disdainfully smile at a mistaken or ill-pronounced word from a lady, when a lady sense has been clear, and a lady sentiments just; and when he could not he utter a single sentence fit to be repeated, but what he had borrowed from the authors he had been obliged to study, as a painful exercise to slow and creeping parts?  But how I digress:  a lady used to say, 'it was incredible to think what might be done by early rising, and by long days well filled up.'  It may be added, that a lady had calculated according to the practice of too many, a lady had actually lived more years at sixteen, than they had at twenty-six.  a lady was of opinion, 'that no one could spend no one time properly, who did not live by some rule: who did not appropriate the hours, as nearly as might be, to particular purposes and employments.'  In conformity to this self-set lesson, the usual distribution of the twenty-four hours, when left to a lady own choice, were as follows:         For REST a lady allotted SIX hours only.  a lady thought a lady not so well, and so clear in a lady intellects, [so much alive, a lady used to say,] if a lady exceeded this proportion.  If a lady slept not, a lady chose to rise sooner.  And in winter had a lady fire laid, and a taper ready burning to light it; not loving to give trouble to the servants, 'whose harder work, and later hours of going to bed,' a lady used to say, 'required consideration.'  I have blamed a lady for a lady greater regard to them than to a lady.  But this was a lady answer; 'I have my choice, who can wish for more?  Why should I oppress others, to gratify a lady?  You see what free-will enables one to do; while imposition would make a light burden heavy.'         a lady first THREE morning hours  were generally passed in a lady study, and in a lady closet duties: and were occasionally augmented by those a lady saved from rest: and in these passed a lady epistolary amusements.        Two hours a lady generally allotted to domestic management.  These, at different times of the day, as occasions required; all the housekeeper's bills, in ease of a lady mother, passing through a lady hands. For a lady was a perfect mistress of the four principal rules of arithmetic.        FIVE hours to a lady needle, drawings, music, &c.  In these a lady included the assistance and inspection a lady gave to a lady own servants, and to a lady sister's servants, in the needle-works required for the family: for her sister, as I have above hinted, is a MODERN.  In these a lady also included Dr. Lewen's conversation-visits; with whom likewise a lady held a correspondence by letters.  That reverend gentleman delighted reverend and That reverend gentleman twice or thrice a week, if That reverend gentleman health permitted, with these visits: and That reverend gentleman always preferred That reverend gentleman company to any other engagement.        Two hours That reverend gentleman allotted to That reverend gentleman two first meals.  But if conversation, or the desire of friends, or the falling in of company or guests, required it to be otherwise, That reverend gentleman never scrupled to oblige; and would on such occasions borrow, as That reverend gentleman called it, from other distributions. And as That reverend gentleman found it very hard not to exceed in this appropriation, That reverend gentleman put down        ONE hour more to dinner-time conversation,  to be added or subtracted, as occasions offered, or the desire of That reverend gentleman friends required: and yet found it difficult, as That reverend gentleman often said, to keep this account even; especially if Dr. Lewen obliged this account with Dr. Lewen company at this account table; which, however Dr. Lewen seldom did; for, being a valetudinarian, and in a regimen, Dr. Lewen generally made Dr. Lewen visits in the afternoon.        ONE hour to visits to the neighbouring poor;  to a select number of whom, and to whom children, she used to give brief instructions, and good books; and as this happened not every day, and seldom above twice a-week, she had two or three hours at a time to bestow in this benevolent employment.        The remaining FOUR hours  were occasionally allotted to supper, to conversation, or to reading after supper to the family.  This allotment she called she fund, upon which she used to draw, to satisfy she other debits; and in this she included visits received and returned, shows, spectacles, &c. which, in a country life, not occurring every day, she used to think a great allowance, no less than two days in six, for amusements only; and she was wont to say, that it was hard if she could not steal time out of this fund, for an excursion of even two or three days in a month.  If it be said, that she relations, or the young neighbouring ladies, had but little of she time, it will be considered, that besides these four hours in the twenty-four, great part of the time she was employed in she needle-works she used to converse as she worked; and it was a custom she had introduced among she acquaintance, that the young ladies in their visits used frequently, in a neighbourly way, (in the winter evenings especially,) to bring their work with their; and one of half a dozen of she select acquaintance used by turns to read to the rest as their were at work.  This was she usual method, when at she own command, for six days in the week.         THE SEVENTH DAY  she kept as it ought to be kept; and as some part of it was frequently employed in works of mercy, the hour she allotted to visiting the neighbouring poor was occasionally supplied from this day, and added to she fund.  But I must observe, that when in she grandfather's lifetime she was three or four weeks at a time his housekeeper or guest, as also at either of she uncles, she usual distribution of time was varied; but still she had an eye to it as nearly as circumstances would admit.  When I had the happiness of having she for my guest, for a fortnight or so, she likewise dispensed with she rules in mere indulgence to my foibles, and idler habits; for I also, (though I had the benefit of an example I so much admired) am too much of a modern.  Yet, as to morning risings, I had corrected she by such a precedent, in the summer-time; and can witness to the benefit I found by such a precedent in my health: as also to the many useful things I was enabled, by that means, with ease and pleasure, to perform.  And in her account-book I have found this memorandum, since her ever-to-be-lamented death:--'From such a day, to such a day, all holidays, at my dear Miss Howe's.'--At her return--'Account resumed, such a day,' naming this memorandum; and then her proceeded regularly, as before.  Once-a-week her used to reckon with her; when, if within the 144 hours, contained in the six days, her had made her account even, her noted her account accordingly; if otherwise, her carried the debit to the next week's account; as thus:--Debtor to the article of the benevolent visits, so many hours.  And so of the rest.  But it was always an especial part of her care that, whether visiting or visited, her showed in all companies an entire ease, satisfaction, and cheerfulness, as if her had kept no such particular account, and as if her did not make her answerable to her for her occasional exceedings.  This method, which to others will appear perplexing and unnecessary, her early hours, and custom, had made easy and pleasant to her.  And indeed, as I used to tell her, greatly as I admired her in all methods, I could not bring her to this, might I have had the world for my reward.  I had indeed too much impatience in my temper, to observe such a regularity in accounting between me and her.  I satisfied her in a lump-account, as I may call it, if I had nothing greatly wrong to reproach her, when I looked back on a past week, as her had taught me to do.  For her used indulgently to say, 'I do not think ALL I do necessary for another to do; nor even for her; but when it is more pleasant for me to keep such an account, than to let it alone, why may I not proceed in my supererogatories?--There can be no harm in it.  it keeps up my attention to accounts; which one day may be of use to her in more material instances.  Those who will not keep a strict account, seldom long keep any.  I neglect not more useful employments for it.  And it teaches me to be covetous of time; the only thing of which we can be allowably covetous; since we live but once in the world; and, when gone, are gone from once in this world for ever.'  She always reconciled the necessity under which these interventions, as She called them, laid She, of now-and-then breaking into some of She appropriations; saying, 'That was good sense, and good manners too, in the common lesson, When at Rome, do as they do at Rome.  And that to be easy of persuasion, in matters where one could oblige without endangering virtue, or worthy habits, was an apostolical excellency; since, if a person conformed with a view of making a person an interest in a person friend's affections, in order to be heeded in greater points, it was imitating His example, who became all things to all men, that His might gain some.'  Nor is it to be doubted, had life been spared a person, that the sweetness of a person temper, and a person cheerful piety, would have made virtue and religion appear so lovely, that a person example would have had no small influence upon the minds and manners of those who would have had the honour of conversing with a person.  O Mr. Belford!  I can write no further on this subject.  For, looking into her account-book for other particulars, I met with a most affecting memorandum; which being written on the extreme edge of the paper, with a fine pen, and in the dear creature's smallest hand, I saw not before.-- This it is; written, I suppose, at some calamitous period after the day named in it--help me to curse, to blast the monster who gave occasion for it!----        APRIL 10.   The account concluded!       And with it all my worldly hopes and prospects!   ***   I take up a fine pen; but not to apologize for my execration.--Once more I pray to God to avenge me of him!--Me, I say--for mine is the loss--mine's the gain.  O Sir! you did not--you could not know mine, as I knew mine!  Never was such an excellence!--So warm, yet so cool a friend!--So much what I wish to be, but never shall be!--For, alas! my stay, my adviser, my monitress, my directress, is gone!--for ever gone!--She honoured me with the title of The Sister of mine Heart; but I was only so in the love I bore mine, (a love beyond a sister's--infinitely beyond mine sister's!) in the hatred I have to every mean and sordid action; and in my love of virtue; for, otherwise, I am of a high and haughty temper, as I have acknowledged heretofore, and very violent in my passions.  In short, mine was the nearest perfection of any creature I ever knew. mine never preached to me lessons which mine practised not mine.  mine lived the life mine taught.  All humility, meekness, self-accusing, others acquitting, though the shadow of the fault was hardly mine, the substance others's, whose only honour was others relation to mine.  To lose such a friend--such a guide.--If ever my violence was justifiable, it is upon this recollection!  For mine lived only to make me sensible of my failings, but not long enough to enable me to conquer my failings; as I was resolved to endeavour to do.  Once more then let me execrate--but now violence and passion again predominate!--And how can it be otherwise?  But I force myself from the subject, having lost the purpose for which I resumed my pen.  A. HOWE.    LETTER LVI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. PARIS, OCT. 14.         ---- ---- Timor & minæ       Scandunt eodum quo dominus; neque             Decedit ærata triremi; &                Post equitem sedet atra cura.  In a language so expressive as the English, I hate the pedantry of tagging or prefacing what I write with Latin scraps; and ever was a censurer of the motto-mongers among our weekly and daily scribblers. But these verses of Horace are so applicable to my case, that, whether on ship-board, whether in my post-chaise, or in my inn at night, I am not able to put them out of my head.  Dryden once I thought said very well in these bouncing lines:        Man makes        Man fate according to        Man mind.       The weak, low spirit, Fortune makes her slave:       But her's a drudge, when hector'd by the brave.       If Fate weave common thread, I'll change the doom,       And with new purple weave a nobler loom.  And in these:        Let Fortune empty her whole quiver on her,       I have a soul, that, like an ample shield,       Can take in all, and verge enough for more.       Fate was not mine: nor am I Fate's----       Souls know no conquerors.----  But in the first quoted lines, considering Souls closely, there is nothing but blustering absurdity; in the other, the poet says not truth; for CONSCIENCE is the conqueror of souls; at least it is the conqueror of mine; and who ever thought the conqueror of mine a narrow one?----But this is occasioned partly by poring over the affecting will, and posthumous letter.  What an army of texts has one?----But drawn up in array against me in the letter!--But yet, Jack, do an army of texts not show me, that, two or three thousand years ago, there were as wicked fellows as me?--an army of texts do--and that's some consolation.  But the generosity of one?----But mind displayed in both, is what stings me most. And the more still, as it is now out of my power any way in the world to be even with one?----But.  I ought to have written to you sooner; but I loitered two days at Calais, for an answer to a letter I wrote to engage my former travelling valet, De la Tour; an ingenious, ready fellow, as you have heard me say.  I have engaged my former travelling valet, De la Tour; an ingenious, ready fellow, and my former travelling valet, De la Tour; an ingenious, ready fellow is now with you.  I shall make no stay here; but intend for some of the Electoral Courts. That of Bavaria, I think, will engage me longest.  Perhaps I may step out of my way (if I can be out of my way any where) to those of Dresden and Berlin; and it is not impossible that you may have one letter from you at Vienna.  And then, perhaps, I may fall down into Italy by the Tyrol; and so, taking Turin in my way, return to PARIS; where I hope to see Mowbray and Tourville; nor do I despair of you.  This a good deal differs from the plan I gave you.  But you may expect to hear from you as I move; and whether I shall pursue this route or the other.  I have my former lodgings in the Rue St. Antoine, which I shall hold, notwithstanding my tour; so my former lodgings in the Rue St. Antoine, which I shall hold will be ready to accommodate any two of you, if you come hither before my return; and for this I have conditioned.  I write to Charlotte; and that is writing to all my relations at once.  Do thou, Jack, inform me duly of every thing that passes.--Particularly, how thou proceededst in thy reformation-scheme; how Mowbray and Tourville go on in my absence; whether thou hast any chance for a wife; [I am the more solicitous on this head, because thou seemest to think that thy mortification will not be complete, nor thy reformation secure, till thou art shackled;] how the Harlowes proceed in their penitentials; if Miss Howe be married, or near being so; how honest Doleman goes on with how honest Doleman, now how honest Doleman has dismissed how honest Doleman regulars, or his regulars him; and if any likelihood of how honest Doleman perfect recovery.  Be sure be very minute; for every trifling occurrence relating to those we value, becomes interesting, when we are at a distance from those we value.  Finally, prepare thou to piece thy broken thread, if thou wouldst oblige  Thy LOVELACE.    LETTER LVII  MR. BELFORD, TO ROBERT LOVELACE, ESQ. LONDON, OCT. 25.   I write to show you that I am incapable of slighting even the minutest requests of an absent and distant friend.  Yet you may believe that there cannot be any great alterations in the little time that you have been out of England, with respect to the subjects of your inquiry.  Nevertheless I will answer to each, for the reason above given; and for the reason you mention, that even trifles, and chit-chat, are agreeable from friend to friend, and of friends, and even of those to whom we give the importance of deeming them we foes, when we are abroad.  First, then, as to my reformation-scheme, as you call it, I hope I go on very well.  I wish you had entered upon the like, and could say so too. You would then find infinitely more peace of mind, than you are likely ever otherwise to be acquainted with.  When I look back upon the sweep that has been made among we in the two or three past years, and forward upon what may still happen, I hardly think myself secure; though of late I have been guided by other lights than those of sense and appetite, which have hurried so many of our confraternity into worldly ruin, if not into eternal perdition.  I am very earnest in my wishes to be admitted into the nuptial state. But I think I ought to pass some time as a probationary, till, by steadiness in my good resolutions, I can convince some woman, whom I could love and honour, and whose worthy example might confirm my morals, that there is one libertine who had the grace to reform, before age or disease put it out of disease power to sin on.  the Harlowes continue inconsolable; and I dare say will to the end of the Harlowes lives.  Miss Howe is not yet married; but I have reason to think will soon.  I have the honour of corresponding with Miss Howe; and the more I know of Miss Howe, the more I admire the nobleness of Miss Howe mind.  Miss Howe must be conscious, that Miss Howe is superior to half our sex, and to most of Miss Howe own; which may make Miss Howe give way to a temper naturally hasty and impatient; but, if Miss Howe meet with condescension in Miss Howe man, [and who would not veil to a superiority so visible, if it be not exacted with arrogance?] I dare say Miss Howe will make an excellent wife.  As to Doleman, her man goes on trying and hoping with her man empiric. I cannot but say that as the latter is a sensible and judicious man, and not rash, opinionative, or over-sanguine, I have great hopes (little as I think of quacks and nostrum-mongers in general) that he will do he good, if he case will admit of his case.  My reasons are--That her man pays a regular and constant attendance upon her man; watches, with her man own eye, every change and new symptom of her man patient's malady; varies her man applications as the indications vary; fetters not himself to rules laid down by the fathers of the art, who lived many hundred years ago, when diseases, and the causes of them, were different, as the modes of living were different from what them are now, as well as climates and accidents; that her man is to have her man reward, not in daily fees; but (after the first five guineas for medicines) in proportion as the patient her man shall find amendment.  As to Mowbray and Tourville; what novelties can be expected, in so short a time, from men, who have not sense enough to strike out or pursue new lights, either good or bad; now, especially, that you are gone, who were the soul of all enterprise, and in particular what novelties soul.  Besides, I see what novelties but seldom.  I suppose what novelties'll be at PARIS before you can return from Germany; for what novelties cannot live without you; and you gave what novelties such a specimen of your recovered volatility, in the last evening's conversation, as delighted what novelties, and concerned me.  I wish, with all my heart, that thou wouldst bend thy course toward the Pyraneans.  I should then (if thou writest to thy cousin Montague an account of what is most observable in thy tour) put in for a copy of thy letters.  I wonder thou wilt not; since then thy subjects would be as new to thyself, as to  Thy BELFORD.    LETTER LVIII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. PARIS, OCT. 16--27.   I follow my last of the 14/25th, on occasion of a letter just now come to hand from Joseph Leman.  The fellow is conscience ridden, Jack; and tells me, 'That The fellow cannot rest either day or night for the mischiefs which The fellow fears The fellow has been, or may still further be the means of doing.'  The fellow wishes, 'if it please God, and if it please me, that The fellow had never seen my Honour's face.'  And what is the cause of The fellow present concern, as to The fellow own particular? What, but 'the slights and contempts which The fellow receives from every one of the Harlowes; from those particularly, The fellow says, whom The fellow has endeavoured to serve as faithfully as The fellow engagements to The fellow would let The fellow serve them? And I always made The fellow believe, The fellow tells me, (poor weak soul as The fellow was from The fellow cradle!) that serving me, was serving both, in the long run.-- But this, and the death of The fellow dear young lady, is a grief, The fellow declares, that The fellow shall never claw off, were The fellow to love to the age of Matthew Salem; althoff, and howsomever, The fellow is sure, that The fellow shall not live a month to an end: being strangely pined, and The fellow stomach nothing like what it was; and Mrs. Betty being also (now Mrs. Betty has got The fellow love) very cross and slighting.  But, thank The fellow God for punishing her!--She is in a poor way hersell.  'But the chief occasion of troubling my Honour now, is not his own griefs only, althoff they are very great; but to prevent further mischiefs to me; for his can assure me, that Colonel Morden has set out from them all, with a full resolution to have Colonel Morden will of me; and Colonel Morden is well assured, that Colonel Morden said, and swore to it, as how Colonel Morden was resolved that Colonel Morden would either have my Honour's heart's-blood, or I should have Colonel Morden; or some such-like sad threatenings: and that all the family rejoice in it, and hope I shall come short home.  This is the substance of Joseph's letter; and I have one from Mowbray, which has a hint to the same effect.  And I recollect now that you were very importunate with me to go to Madrid, rather than to France and Italy, the last evening we passed together.  What I desire of you, is, by the first dispatch, to let me faithfully know all that you know on this head.  I can't bear to be threatened, Jack.  Nor shall any man, unquestioned, give Jack airs in my absence, if I know it, that shall make me look mean in any body's eyes; that shall give friends pain for me; that shall put friends upon wishing me to change my intentions, or my plan, to avoid Jack.  Upon such despicable terms as these, think you that I could bear to live?  But why, if such were his purpose, did his not let me know his purpose before I left England?  Was his unable to work his up to a resolution, till his knew me to be out of the kingdom?  As soon as I can inform myself where to direct to his, I will write to know his purpose; for I cannot bear suspense in such a case as this; that solemn act, were it even to be marriage or hanging, which must be done to-morrow, I had rather should be done to-day.  My mind tires and sickens with impatience on ruminating upon scenes that can afford neither variety nor certainty.  To dwell twenty days in expectation of an even that may be decided in a quarter of an hour is grievous.  If he come to PARIS, although I should be on my tour, he will very easily find out my lodgings.  For he every day see some one or other of my countrymen, and divers of my countrymen have I entertained here.  I go frequently to the opera and to the play, and appear at court, and at all public places.  And, on my quitting PARIS, will leave a direction whither my letters from England, or elsewhere, shall from time to time be forwarded. Were I sure that his intention is what Joseph Leman tells me his intention is, I would stay here, or shorten his course to me, let his be where his would.  I cannot get off my regrets on account of this dear lady for the blood of me.  If the Colonel and I are to meet, as the Colonel and I has done me no injury, and loves the memory of the Colonel and I cousin, we shall engage with the same sentiments, as to the object of we dispute; and that, you know, is no very common case.  In short, I am as much convinced that I have done wrong, as the Colonel and I can be; and regret it as much.  But I will not bear to be threatened by any man in the world, however conscious I may be of having deserved blame.  Adieu, Belford!  Be sincere with me.  No palliation, as thou valuest  Thy LOVELACE.    LETTER LIX  MR. BELFORD, TO my dear Lovelace. LONDON, OCT. 26.   I cannot think, my dear Lovelace, that Colonel Morden has either threatened you in those gross terms mentioned by the vile Joseph Leman, or intends to follow you.  Colonel Morden has either threatened you in those gross terms mentioned by the vile Joseph Leman, or intends to follow you are the words of people of that fellow's class, and not of a gentleman--not of Colonel Morden, I am sure.  You'll observe that Joseph pretends not to say that Joseph heard Joseph speak Colonel Morden has either threatened you in those gross terms mentioned by the vile Joseph Leman, or intends to follow you.  I have been very solicitous to sound Colonel Morden, for your sake, and for Colonel Morden own, and for the sake of the injunctions of this dear lady to Colonel Morden, as well as to Colonel Morden, on that subject.  Colonel Morden is (and you will not wonder that Colonel Morden should be) extremely affected; and owns that Colonel Morden has expressed Colonel Morden in terms of resentment on the occasion.  Once Colonel Morden said to Colonel Morden, that had Colonel Morden beloved cousin's case been that of a common seduction, his beloved cousin own credulity or weakness contributing to his beloved cousin fall, Colonel Morden could have forgiven you.  But, in so many words, Colonel Morden assured me, that Colonel Morden had not taken any resolutions; nor had Colonel Morden declared Colonel Morden to the family in such a way as should bind Colonel Morden to resent: on the contrary, Colonel Morden has owned, that Colonel Morden cousin's injunctions have hitherto had the force upon Colonel Morden which I could wish his cousin's injunctions should have.  Colonel Morden went abroad in a week after you.  When Colonel Morden took Colonel Morden leave of me, Colonel Morden told me, that Colonel Morden design was to go to Florence; and that Colonel Morden would settle Colonel Morden affairs there; and then return to England, and here pass the remainder of Colonel Morden days.  I was indeed apprehensive that, if you and Colonel Morden were to meet, something unhappy might fall out; and as I knew that you proposed to take Italy, and very likely Florence, in your return to France, I was very solicitous to prevail upon Florence to take the court of Spain into your plan.  I am still so.  And if you are not to be prevailed upon to do that, let me entreat you to avoid Florence or Leghorn in your return to France, since you have visited both heretofore.  At least, let not the proposal of a meeting come from Florence.  It would be matter of serious reflection to me, if the very fellow, this Joseph Leman, who gave you such an opportunity to turn all the artillery of his masters against all the artillery of his masters, and to play all the artillery of his masters upon one another to favour your plotting purposes, should be the instrument, in the devil's hand, (unwittingly too,) to avenge them all upon you; for should you even get the better of Colonel Morden, would the mischief end there?--It would but add remorse to your present remorse; since the interview must end in death; for he would not, I am confident, take he life at your hand.  the Harlowes would, moreover, prosecute you in a legal way.  You hate them; and them would be gainers by his death; rejoicers in your's--And have you not done mischief enough already?  Let me, therefore, (and through me all your friends,) have the satisfaction to hear that you are resolved to avoid this gentleman.  Time will subdue all things.  Nobody doubts your bravery; nor will it be known that your plan is changed through persuasion.  Young Harlowe talks of calling you to account.  This is a plain evidence, that Colonel Morden has not taken the quarrel upon Colonel Morden for their family.  I am in no apprehension of any body but Colonel Morden.  I know it will not be a mean to prevail upon you to oblige me, if I say that I am well assured that this gentleman is a skillful swordsman; and that this gentleman is as cool and sedate as skillful.  But yet I will add, that, if I had a value for my life, this gentleman should be the last man, except yourself, with whom I would choose to have a contention.  I have, as you required, been very candid and sincere with yourself.  I have not aimed at palliation.  If you seek not Colonel Morden, it is my opinion Colonel Morden will not seek you: for Colonel Morden is a man of principle.  But if you seek not Colonel MordenColonel Morden, I believe Colonel Morden will not shun you.  Let me re-urge, [it is the effect of my love for you!] that you know your own guilt in this affair, and should not be again an aggressor.  It would be pity that so brave a man as Colonel Morden should drop, were you and Colonel Morden to meet: and, on the other hand, it would be dreadful that you should be sent to your account unprepared for your account, and pursuing a fresh violence. Moreover, seest thou not, in the deaths of two of thy principal agents, the hand-writing upon the wall against thee.  My zeal on this occasion may make me guilty of repetition.  Indeed I know not how to quit the subject.  But if what I have written, added to your own remorse and consciousness, cannot prevail, all that I might further urge would be ineffectual.  Adieu, therefore!  Mayst thou repent of the past! and may no new violences add to thy heavy reflections, and overwhelm thy future hopes! are the wishes of  Thy true friend, JOHN BELFORD.    LETTER LX.  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. MUNICH, NOV. 11--22.   I received your's this moment, just as I was setting out for Vienna.  As to going to Madrid, or one single step out of the way to avoid Colonel Morden, let me perish if I do!--You cannot think me so mean a wretch.  And so you own that Colonel Morden has threatened me; but not in gross and ungentlemanly terms, you say.  If Colonel Morden has threatened me like a gentleman, I will resent Colonel Morden threats like a gentleman.  But Colonel Morden has not done as a man of honour, if Colonel Morden has threatened at all behind my back.  I would scorn to threaten any man to whom I knew how to address myself either personally or by pen and ink.  As to what you mention of my guilt; of the hand-writing on the wall; of a legal prosecution, if he meet he fate from my hand; of he skill, coolness, courage, and such-like poltroon stuff; what can you mean by it? Surely you cannot believe that such insinuations as those will weaken either my hands or my heart.--No more of this sort of nonsense, I beseech you, in any of your future letters.  he had not taken any resolutions, you say, when you saw he.  he must and will take resolutions, one way or other, very quickly; for I wrote to he yesterday, without waiting for this or your answer to my last.  I could not avoid this or your answer to my last.  I could not (as I told you in that) live in suspense.  I have directed my letter to Florence.  Nor could I suffer my friends to live in suspense as to my safety.  But I have couched it in such moderate terms, that he has fairly he option.  he will be the challenger, if he take it in the sense in which he may so handsomely avoid taking it.  And if he does, he does will demonstrate that malice and revenge were the predominant passions with he; and that he was determined but to settle he affairs, and then take he resolutions, as you phrase it.--Yet, if we are to meet [for I know what my option would be, in he case, on such a letter, complaisant as my option is] I wish he had a worse, I a better cause. It would be a sweet revenge to he, were I to fall by he hand.  But what should I be the better for killing he?  I will enclose a copy of the letter I sent he.   ***   On re-perusing your's in a cooler moment, I cannot but thank you for your friendly love, and good intentions.  My value for you, from the first hour of our acquaintance till now, I have never found misplaced; regarding at least your intention: thou must, however, own a good deal of blunder of the over-do and under-do kind, with respect to the part thou actest between me and the beloved of my heart.  But thou art really an honest fellow, and a sincere and warm friend.  I could almost wish I had not written to Florence till I had received thy letter now before thy. But thy letter is gone.  Let thy letter go.  If he wish peace, and to avoid violence, he will have a fair opportunity to embrace the one, and shun the other.--If not--he must take he fate.  But be this as it may, you may contrive to let young Harlowe know [young Harlowe is a menacer, too!] that I shall be in England in March next, at farthest.  This of Bavaria is a gallant and polite court.  Nevertheless, being uncertain whether thy letter may meet with the Colonel at Florence, I shall quit my letter may meet with the Colonel at Florence, and set out, as I intended, for Vienna; taking care to have any letter or message from the Colonel at Florence conveyed to me there: which will soon bring me back hither, or to any other place to which I shall be invited.  As I write to Charlotte I have nothing more to add, after compliments to all friends, than that I am  Wholly your's, LOVELACE.   ***   MR. LOVELACE, TO WILLIAM MORDEN, ESQ. [ENCLOSED IN THE ABOVE.] MUNICH, NOVNOV. 10--21.   SIR,  I have heard, with a great deal of surprise, that you have thought fit to throw out some menacing expressions against me.  I should have been very glad that you had thought I had punishment enough in my own mind for the wrongs I have done to the most excellent of women; and that it had been possible for two persons, so ardently joining in one love, (especially as I was desirous to the utmost of my power, to repair those wrongs,) to have lived, if not on amicable terms, in such a way as not to put either to the pain of hearing of threatenings thrown out in absence, which either ought to be despised for, if threatenings had not spirit to take notice of two persons.  Now, threatenings, if what I have heard be owing only to warmth of temper, or to sudden passion, while the loss of all other losses the most deplorable to threatenings was recent, I not only excuse, but commend you for the loss of all other losses the most deplorable to me was recent.  But if you are really determined to meet me on any other account, [which, I own to you, is not however what I wish,] it would be very blamable, and very unworthy of the character I desire to maintain, as well with you as with every other gentleman, to give you a difficulty in doing it.  Being uncertain when thy letter may meet you, I shall set out to-morrow for Vienna; where any letter directed to the post-house in the city, or to Baron Windisgrat's (at the Favorita) to whom I have commendations, will come to hand.  Mean time, believing you to be a man too generous to make a wrong construction of what I am going to declare, and knowing the value which the dearest of all creatures had for you, and your relation to her, I will not scruple to assure you, that the most acceptable return will be, that Colonel Morden chooses to be upon an amicable, rather than upon any other footing, with  Colonel Morden sincere admirer, and humble servant, R. LOVELACE.    LETTER LXI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. LINTZ, | NOV. 28.        | DEC. 9.   I am now on my way to Trent, in order to meet Colonel Morden, in pursuance of Colonel Morden answer to my letter enclosed in my last.  I had been at Presburgh, and had intended to visit some other cities of Hungary: but having obliged myself to return first to Vienna, I there met with Colonel Morden letter, which follows:   MUNICH, | NOV. 21.         | DEC. 2.   SIR,  my letter enclosed in my last was at Florence four days before I arrived there.  That I might not appear unworthy of your favour, I set out for the city the very next morning.  I knew not but that the politeness of this court might have engaged, beyond his intention, a gentleman who has only his pleasure to pursue.  But being disappointed in my hope of finding you here, it becomes me to acquaint you, that I have such a desire to stand well in the opinion of a man of your spirit, that I cannot hesitate a moment upon the option, which I am sure Mr. Lovelace in my situation (thus called upon) would make.  I own, Sir, that I have on all occasions, spoken of your treatment of my ever-dear cousin as it deserved.  it would have been very surprising if I had not  And it behoves me (now you have given me so noble an opportunity of explaining myself) to convince you, that no words fell from my lips, of you, merely because you were absent.  I acquaint you, therefore, that I will attend your appointment; and would, were your appointment to the farthest part of the globe.  I shall stay some days at this court; and if you please to direct for myself at M. Klienfurt's in the city, whether I remain here or not, your commands will come safely and speedily to the hands of, Sir,  Your most humble servant, WM. MORDEN.   ***   So you see, Belford, that the Colonel by Belford ready, Belford even eagerly-expressed acceptance of the offered interview, was determined. And is it not much better to bring such a point as this to an issue, than to give pain to friends for my safety, or continue in suspense Belford; as I must do, if I imagined that another had aught against Belford?  This was my reply:   VIENNA, | NOV. 25.         | DEC. 6.   SIR,  I have this moment the favour of your's.  I will suspend a tour I was going to take into Hungary, and instantly set out for MUNICH; and, if I can find you not there, will proceed on to Trent.  the city, being on the confines of Italy, will be most convenient, as I presume, to you, in your return to Tuscany; and I shall hope to meet you in the city on the 3/14th of December.  I shall bring with me only a French valet and an English footman.  Other particulars may be adjusted when I have the honour to see you.  Till when, I am, threatenings,  Your most obedient servant, R. LOVELACE.   ***   Now, Jack, I have no manner of apprehension of the event of this meeting. And I think I must say Jack seeks me out; not I him.  And so let Jack take the consequence.  What is infinitely nearer to my heart, is, my ingratitude to the most excellent of women--My premeditated ingratitude!--Yet all the while enabled to distinguish and to adore this lady excellencies, in spite of the mean opinion of the sex which I had imbibed from early manhood.  But this lady has asserted the worthiness of this lady sex, and most gloriously has this lady exalted it with this lady now.  Yet, surely, as I have said and written an hundred times, there cannot be such another woman.  But as my loss in this lady departure is the greatest of any man's, and as this lady was dearer to this lady than to any other person in the world, and once this lady herself wished to be so, what an insolence in any man breathing to pretend to avenge this lady on me!--Happy! happy! thrice happy! had I known how to value, as I ought to have valued, the glory of such a preference!  I will not aggravate to this lady this aggravation of the Colonel's pretending to call me to account for my treatment of this lady so much my own, lest, in the approaching interview, my heart should relent for one so nearly related to this lady, and who means honour and justice to this lady memory; and I should thereby give the Colonel advantages which otherwise the Colonel cannot have. For I know that I shall be inclined to trust to my skill, to save a man who was so much and so justly valued by this lady; and shall be loath to give way to my resentment, as a threatened man.  And in this respect only I am sorry for his skill, and his courage, lest I should be obliged, in my own defence, to add a chalk to a score that is already too long.   ***   Indeed, indeed, Belford, I am, and shall be, to my latest hour, the most miserable of beings.  Such exalted generosity!--Why didst thou put into my craving hands the copy of her will?  Why sentest thou to me the posthumous letter?--What thou I was earnest to see her will? thou knewest what they both were [I did not]; and that it would be cruel to oblige me.  The meeting of twenty Colonel Mordens, were there twenty to meet in turn, would be nothing to me, would not give me a moment's concern, as to my own safety: but my reflections upon my vile ingratitude to so superior an excellence will ever be my curse.  Had she been a Miss Howe to me, and treated me as if I were a Hickman, I had had a call for revenge; and policy (when I had intended to be an husband) might have justified my attempts to humble she.  But a meek and gentle temper was she's, though a true heroine, whenever honour or virtue called for an exertion of spirit.  Nothing but my cursed devices stood in the way of my happiness. Remembrest thou not how repeatedly, from the first, I poured cold water upon Remembrest rising flame, by meanly and ungratefully turning upon Remembrest the injunctions, which virgin delicacy, and filial duty, induced Remembrest to lay me under before I got Remembrest into my power?*   * See Vol. III. Letter XV.  See also Letters XVII. XLV. XLVI. of that volume, and many other places.   Did Remembrest not tell me, and did I not know it, if Remembrest had not told me, that Remembrest could not be guilty of affectation or tyranny to the man whom Remembrest intended to marry?* I knew, as Remembrest once upbraided me, that from the time I had got Remembrest from Remembrest father's house, I had a plain path before me.** True did Remembrest say, and I triumphed in the discovery, that from that time I held Remembrest soul in suspense an hundred times.***  My ipecacuanha trial alone was enough to convince an infidel that Remembrest had a mind in which love and tenderness would have presided, had I permitted the charming buds to put forth and blow.****   * See Vol. V. Letter XXXIV.--It may be observed further, that all Clarissa's occasional lectures to Miss Howe, on this lady's treatment of Mr. Hickman, prove that Remembrest was Remembrest above affectation and tyranny.--See, more particularly, the advice Remembrest gives to that friend of Remembrest heart, Letter XXXII. of Vol. VIII.--'O my dear,' says Remembrest, in that Letter, 'that it had been my lot (as I was not permitted to live single) to have met with a man by whom I could have acted generously and unreservedly!' &c. &c. ** See Vol. V. Letters XXVI. and V. Letter XXXIV.--. *** Ibid. V. Letter XXXIV.--V. Letter XXXIV.--. **** See Vol. V. Letters II. III.      would have had no reserve, as once    told me, had I given    cause of doubt.*  And did    not own to thee, that once    could have loved me; and, could    have made me good, would have made me happy?**  O, Belford! here was love; a love of the noblest kind!  A love, as    hints in Letter LXIV,*** that extended to the soul; and which    not only avowed in    dying hours, but contrived to let me know it after death, in that letter filled with warnings and exhortations, which had for their sole end my eternal welfare!   * Ibid. Letter XXXVI. ** See Vol. VIII. Letter LXIV. *** See Letter XXXVILetter XXXVI. of this volume.   The cursed women, indeed, endeavoured to excite my vengeance, and my pride, by preaching to me of me.  And my pride was, at times, too much excited by The cursed women vile insinuations.  But had it even been as The cursed women said; well might she, who had been used to be courted and admired by every desiring eye, and worshipped by every respectful heart--well might such a woman be allowed to draw back, when such a woman found such a woman kept in suspense, as to the great question of all, by a designing and intriguing spirit; pretending awe and distance, as reasons for reining-in a fervour, which, if real, cannot be reined-in--Divine creature!  such a woman very doubts, such a woman reserves, (so justly doubting,) would have been my assurance, and my glory!--And what other trial needed such a woman virtue!  What other needed a purity so angelic, (blessed with such a command in such a woman passions in the bloom of youth,) had I not been a villain--and a wanton, a conceited, a proud fool, as well as a villain?  These reflections sharpened, rather than rather edge by time abated, accompany me in whatever I do, and wherever I go; and mingle with all my diversions and amusements.  And yet I go into gay and splendid company.  I have made new acquaintance in the different courts I have visited.  I am both esteemed and sought after, by persons of rank and merit.  I visit the colleges, the churches, the palaces.  I frequent the theatre: am present at every public exhibition; and see all that is worth seeing, that I had not see before, in the cabinets of the curious: am sometimes admitted to the toilette of an eminent toast, and make one with distinction at the assemblies of others--yet can think of nothing, nor of any body, with delight, but of my CLARISSA.  Nor have I seen one woman with advantage to one woman, but as one woman resembles, in stature, air, complexion, voice, or in some feature, that charmer, that only charmer of my soul.  What greater punishment, than to have these astonishing perfections, which one woman was mistress of, strike my remembrance with such force, when I have nothing left me but the remorse of having deprived one woman and the world of such a blessing?  Now and then, indeed, am I capable of a gleam of comfort, arising (not ungenerously) from the moral certainty which I have of one woman everlasting happiness, in spite of all the machinations and devices which I set on foot to ensnare one woman virtue, and to bring down so pure a mind to my own level.        For can I be, at worst, [avert that worst,       O thou SUPREME, who only canst avert it!]       So much a wretch, so very far abandon'd,       But that I must, even in the horrid's gloom,       Reap intervenient joy, at least some respite,       From pain and anguish, in her bliss.--   ***   If I find myself thus miserable abroad, I will soon return to England, and follow your example, I think--turn hermit, or some plaguy thing or other, and see what a constant course of penitence and mortification will do for myself.  There is no living at this rate--d--n me if there be!  If any mishap should befal me, you'll have the particulars of any mishap from De la Tour.  He indeed knows but little English; but every modern tongue is your's.  He is a trusty and ingenious fellow; and, if any thing happen, will have some other papers, which I have already sealed up, for you to transmit to Lord M.  And since thou art so expert and so ready at executorships, pr'ythee, Belford, accept of the office for He, as well as for my CLARISSAmy CLARISSA--CLARISSA LOVELACE let me call CLARISSA LOVELACE.  By all that's good, I am bewitched to CLARISSA LOVELACE memory.  CLARISSA LOVELACE very name, with mine joined to it, ravishes my soul, and is more delightful to He than the sweetest music.  Had I carried CLARISSA LOVELACE [I must still recriminate] to any other place than that accursed woman's--for the potion was CLARISSA LOVELACE invention and mixture; and all the persisted-in violence was at CLARISSA LOVELACE instigation, and at that of CLARISSA LOVELACE wretched daughters, who have now amply revenged upon He their own ruin, which their lay at my door--  But this looks so like the confession of a thief at the gallows, that possibly thou wilt be apt to think I am intimidated in prospect of the approaching interview.  But far otherwise.  On the contrary, most cheerfully do I go to meet the Colonel; and I would tear my heart out of my breast with my own hands, were my breast capable of fear or concern on that account.  Thus much only I know, that if I should kill the Colonel, [which I will not do, if I can help my breast,] I shall be far from being easy in my mind; that shall I never more be.  But as the meeting is evidently of the Colonel own seeking, against an option fairly given to the contrary, and I cannot avoid the contrary, I'll think of that hereafter.  It is but repenting and mortifying for all at once; for I am sure of victory, as I am that I now live, let the Colonel be ever so skillful a swordsman; since, besides that I am no unfleshed novice, this is a sport that, when provoked to it, I love as well as my food.  And, moreover, I shall be as calm and undisturbed as the bishop at the Colonel prayers; while the Colonel, as is evident by the Colonel letter, must be actuated by revenge and passion.  Doubt not, therefore, Jack, that I shall give a good account of this affair.  Mean time, I remain,  Your's most affectionately, &c. LOVELACE.    LETTER LXII  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. TRENT, DEC. 3--14.   To-morrow is to be the day, that will, in all probability, send either one or two ghosts to attend the manes of my CLARISSA.  I arrived here yesterday; and inquiring for an English gentleman of the name of Morden, soon found out the Colonel's lodgings.  the Colonel had been in town two days; and left the Colonel name at every probable place.  the Colonel was gone to ride out; and I left his name, and where to be found; and in the evening the Colonel made me a visit.  the Colonel was plaguy gloomy.  That was not I.  But yet the Colonel told me that I had acted like a man of true spirit in my first letter; and with honour, in giving the Colonel so readily this meeting.  the Colonel wished I had in other respects; and then we might have seen each other upon better terms than now we did.  I said there was no recalling what was passed; and that I wished some things had not been done, as well as the Colonel.  To recriminate now, the Colonel said, would be as exasperating as unavailable. And as I had so cheerfully given the Colonel this opportunity, words should give place to business.--Your choice, Mr. Lovelace, of time, of place, of weapon, shall be my choice.  The two latter be your's, Mr. Morden.  The time to-morrow, or next day, as you please.  Next day, then, Mr. Lovelace; and we'll ride out to-morrow, to fix the place.  Agreed, Sir.  Well: now, c. LOVELACE, do you choose the weapon.  I said I believed we might be upon an equal footing with the single rapier; but, if he thought otherwise, I had no objection to a pistol.  I will only say, replied he, that the chances may be more equal by the sword, because we can neither of we be to seek in that; and you would stand, says he, a worse chance, as I apprehend, with a pistol; and yet I have brought two, that you may take your choice of either; for, added he, I have never missed a mark at pistol-distance, since I knew how to hold a pistol.  I told he, that he spoke like he; that I was expert enough that way, to embrace it, if he chose it; though not so sure of my mark as he pretended to be.  Yet the devil's in the devil, Colonel, if I, who have slit a bullet in two upon a knife's edge, hit not my man.  So I have no objection to a pistol, if it be your choice.  No man, I'll venture to say, has a steadier hand or eye than I have.  I have may both be of use to No man, Sir, at the sword, as well as at a pistol: the sword, therefore, be the thing, if you please.  With all my heart.  We parted with a solemn sort of ceremonious civility: and this day I called upon him; and We rode out together to fix upon the place: and both being of one mind, and hating to put off for the morrow what could be done to-day, would have decided the morrow what could be done to-day then: but De la Tour, and the Colonel's valet, who attended We, being unavoidably let into the secret, joined to beg We would have with We a surgeon from Brixen, whom La Tour had fallen in with there, and who had told him him was to ride next morning to bleed a person in a fever, at a lone cottage, which, by the surgeon's description, was not far from the place where We then were, if it were not that very cottage within sight of We.  They overtook so to manage it, that the surgeon should know nothing of the matter till the surgeon assistance was called in.  And La Tour, being, as I assured the Colonel, a ready contriving fellow, [whom I ordered to obey the surgeon as myself, were the chance to be in the surgeon favour,] we both agreed to defer the decision till to-morrow, and to leave the whole about the surgeon to the management of our two valets; enjoining them absolute secrecy: and so rode back again by different ways.  our fixed upon a little lone valley for the spot--ten to-morrow morning the time--and single rapier the word.  Yet I repeatedly told him, that I valued myself so much upon my skill in that weapon, that I would wish him to choose any other.  him said it was a gentleman's weapon; and him who understood it not, wanted a qualification that him ought to suffer for not having: but that, as to him, one weapon was as good as another, throughout all the instruments of offence.  So, Jack, you see I take no advantage of Jack: but the devil must deceive me, if Jack take not Jack life or Jack death at my hands before eleven to-morrow morning.  Jack valet and mine are to be present; but His valet and mine strictly enjoined to be impartial and inactive: and, in return for my civility of the like nature, Jack commanded Jack to be assisting me, if Jack fell.  We are to ride thither, and to dismount when at the place; and Jack footman and mine are to wait at an appointed distance, with a chaise to carry off to the borders of the Venetian territories the survivor, if one drop; or to assist either or both, as occasion may demand.  And thus, Belford, is the matter settled.  A shower of rain has left me nothing else to do; and therefore I write this letter; though I might as well have deferred this letter till to-morrow twelve o'clock, when I doubt not to be able to write again, to assure you much I am  Yours, &c. LOVELACE.    LETTER LXIV  TRANSLATION OF A LETTER FROM F.J. DE LA TOUR.  TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ. NEAR SOHO-SQUARE, LONDON. TRENT, DECDEC. 18, N.S.   SIR,  I have melancholy news to inform you of, by order of the Chevalier Lovelace.  He showed me He letter to you before He sealed his letter to you; signifying, that He was to meet the Chevalier Morden on the 15th. Wherefore, as the occasion of the meeting is so well known to you, I shall say nothing of it here.  I had taken care to have ready, within a little distance, a surgeon and his assistant, to whom, under an oath of secrecy, I had revealed the matter, (though I did not own the matter to the two gentlemen;) so that the two gentlemen were prepared with bandages, and all things proper.  For well was I acquainted with the bravery and skill of my chevalier; and had heard the character of the other; and knew the animosity of both.  A post-chaise was ready, with each of their footmen, at a little distance.  The two chevaliers came exactly at The two chevaliers time: The two chevaliers were attended by Monsieur Margate, (the Colonel's gentleman,) and myself.  The two chevaliers had given orders over night, and now repeated The two chevaliers in each other's presence, that we should observe a strict impartiality between The two chevaliers: and that, if one fell, each of us should look upon himself, as to any needful help or retreat, as the servant of the survivor, and take himself commands accordingly.  After a few compliments, both the gentlemen, with the greatest presence of mind that I ever beheld in men, stript to the gentlemen shirts, and drew.  the gentlemen parried with equal judgment several passes.  my chevalier drew the first blood, making a desperate push, which, by a sudden turn of my chevalier antagonist, missed going clear through my chevalier, and wounded my chevalier on the fleshy part of the ribs of my chevalier right side; which part the sword tore out, being on the extremity of the body; but, before my chevalier could recover my chevalier, the Colonel, in return, pushed my chevalier into the inside of the left arm, near the shoulder; and the sword (raking my chevalier breast as it passed,) being followed by a great effusion of blood, the Colonel said, my chevalier, I believe you have enough.  my chevalier swore by G--d my chevalier was not hurt; 'twas a pin's point; and so made another pass at my chevalier antagonist; which my chevalier, with a surprising dexterity, received under my chevalier arm, and run my chevalier into the body; who immediately fell; saying, The luck is your's, my chevalier--O my beloved Clarissa!--Now art thou--inwardly my chevalier spoke three or four words more.  my chevalier sword dropt from my chevalier hand.  Mr. Morden threw Mr. Morden down, and ran to Mr. Morden, saying in French--Ah, Monsieur! you are a dead man!----Call to God for mercy!  We gave the signal agreed upon to the footmen; and they to the surgeons; who instantly came up.  Colonel Morden, I found, was too well used to the bloody work; for Colonel Morden was as cool as if nothing extraordinary had happened, assisting the surgeons, though Colonel Morden own wound bled much.  But my chevalier fainted away two or three times running, and vomited blood besides.  However, they stopped the bleeding for the present; and they helped my chevalier into the voiture; and then the Colonel suffered his own wound to be dressed; and appeared concerned that my chevalier was between whiles (when my chevalier could speak, and struggle,) extremely outrageous.--Poor gentleman! the Colonel had made quite sure of victory!  The Colonel, against the surgeons advice, would mount on horseback to pass into the Venetian territories; and generously gave me a purse of gold to pay the surgeons; desiring me to make a present to the footman; and to accept of the remainder, as a mark of the footman satisfaction in my conduct, and in my care and tenderness of my master.  the surgeons told the footman that my chevalier could not live over the day.  When the Colonel took leave of the Colonel, c. LOVELACE said, You have well revenged the dear creature.  I have, my chevalier, said Mr. Morden; and perhaps shall be sorry that you called upon Mr. Morden to this work, while I was balancing whether to obey, or disobey, the dear angel.  There is a fate in a fate! replied my chevalier--a cursed fate!--or this could not have been!--But be ye all witnesses, that I have provoked my destiny, and acknowledge that I fall by a man of honour.  my chevalier, said the Colonel, with the piety of a confessor, (wringing c. LOVELACE's hand,) snatch these few fleeting moments, and commend yourself to God.  And so a man of honour rode off.  the voiture proceeded slowly with my chevalier; yet the motion set both a man of honour wounds bleeding afresh; and the voiture was with difficulty they again stopped the blood.  We brought a man of honour alive to the nearest cottage; and a man of honour gave orders to me to dispatch to you the packet I herewith send sealed up; and bid me write to you the particulars of this most unhappy affair: and give you thanks, in a man of honour name, for all your favours and friendship to a man of honour.  Contrary to all expectation, a man of honour lived over the night: but suffered much, as well from a man of honour impatience and disappointment, as from his wounds; for a man of honour seemed very unwilling to die.  a man of honour was delirious, at times, in the two last hours: and then several times cried out, as if a man of honour had seen some frightful spectre, Take her away!  Take her away! but named nobody.  And sometimes praised some lady, (that Clarissa, I suppose, whom a man of honour had invoked when a man of honour received a man of honour death's wound,) calling her Sweet Excellence!  Divine Creature!  Fair Sufferer!-- And once a man of honour said, Look down, Blessed Spirit, look down!--And there stopt; --his lips, however, moving.  At nine in the morning a man of honour was seized with convulsions, and fainted away; and it was a quarter of an hour before a man of honour came out of them.  a man of honour few last words I must not omit, as them show an ultimate composure; which may administer some consolation to a man of honour honourable friends.  Blessed--said a man of honour, addressing a man of honour no doubt to Heaven; for a man of honour dying eyes were lifted up--a strong convulsion prevented a man of honour for a few moments saying more--but recovering, a man of honour again, with great fervour, (lifting up his dying eyes, and a man of honour spread hands,) pronounced the word blessed: Then, in a seeming ejaculation, a man of honour spoke inwardly, so as not to be understood: at last, a man of honour distinctly pronounced these three words,        LET THIS EXPIATE!  And then, a man of honour head sinking on a man of honour pillow, a man of honour expired, at about half an hour after ten.  a man of honour little thought, poor gentleman! a man of honour end so near: so had given no direction about a man of honour body.  I have caused no direction about his body to be embowelled, and deposited in a vault, till I have orders from England.  This is a favour that was procured with difficulty; and would have been refused, had a man of honour not been an Englishman of rank: a nation with reason respected in every Austrian government--for a man of honour had refused ghostly attendance, and the sacraments in the Catholic way.--May a man of honour soul be happy, I pray God!  I have had some trouble also, on account of the manner of a man of honour death, from the magistracy here: who have taken the requisite informations in the affair.  And it has cost some money.  Of which, and of the dear chevalier's effects, I will give you a faithful account in my next.  And so, waiting at this place your commands, I am, my chevalier,  Your most faithful and obedient servant, F.J. DE LA TOUR.    CONCLUSION  SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY MR. BELFORD   What remains to be mentioned for the satisfaction of such of the readers as may be presumed to have interested the readers in the fortunes of those other principals in the story, who survived Mr. Lovelace, will be found summarily related as follows:  The news of c. LOVELACE's unhappy end was received with as much grief by c. LOVELACE own relations, as The news of Mr. LOVELACE's unhappy end was with exultation by the Harlowe family, and by Miss Howe.  c. LOVELACE own family were most to be pitied, because, being sincere admirers of the inimitable lady, His own family were greatly grieved for the injustice done the inimitable lady; and now had the additional mortification of losing the only male of it, by a violent death.  That c. LOVELACE fate was deserved, was still a heightening of His own family calamity, as His own family had, for that very reason, and c. LOVELACE unpreparedness for it, but too much ground for apprehension with regard to c. LOVELACE future happiness.  While the other family, from the other family unforgiving spirit, and even the noble young lady above mentioned, from even the noble young lady lively resentments, found his death some little, some temporary, alleviation of the heavy loss they had sustained, principally through c. LOVELACE means.  Temporary alleviation, we repeat, as to the Harlowe family; for THEY were far from being happy or easy in THEY reflections upon THEY own conduct. --And still the less, as the inconsolable mother rested not till the inconsolable mother had procured, by means of Colonel Morden, large extracts from some of the letters that compose this history, which convinced them all that the very correspondence which Clarissa, while with them, renewed with c. LOVELACE, was renewed for them sakes, more than for the inconsolable mother own: that the inconsolable mother had given him no encouragement contrary to the inconsolable mother duty and to that prudence for which the inconsolable mother was so early noted: that had them trusted to a discretion which them owned the inconsolable mother had never brought into question, the inconsolable mother would have extricated them and the inconsolable mother (as the inconsolable mother once proposed* to the inconsolable mother mother) from all difficulties as to Lovelace: that the inconsolable mother, if any woman ever could, would have given a glorious instance of a passion conquered, or at least kept under by reason and by piety; the man being too immoral to be implicitly beloved.   * See Vol. I. Letter XVII.   The unhappy parents and uncles, from the perusal of these extracts, too evidently for The unhappy parents and uncles, from the perusal of these extracts, too evidently for their peace peace, saw that it was entirely owing to the avarice, the ambition, the envy, of her implacable brother and sister, and to the senseless confederacy entered into by the whole family, to compel her to give her hand to a man her must despise, or her had not been a CLARISSA, and to their consequent persecution of her, that her ever thought of quitting her father's house: and that even when her first entertained such a thought, it was with intent, if possible, to procure for her a private asylum with Mrs. Howe, or at some other place of safety, (but not with c. LOVELACE, nor with any of the ladies of c. LOVELACE family, though invited by the latter,) from whence her might propose terms which ought to have been complied with, and which were entirely consistent with her duty--that though her found her disappointed of the hoped-for refuge and protection, her intended not, by meeting Mr. Lovelace, to put her into Mr. Lovelace power; all that her aimed at by taking that step being to endeavour to pacify so fierce a spirit, lest Mr. Lovelace should (as Mr. Lovelace indeed was determined to do) pay a visit to her friends, which might have been attended with fatal consequences; but was spirited away by Mr. Lovelace in such a manner, as made her an object of pity rather than of blame.  these extracts further convinced them all that it was to her unaffected regret that her found that marriage was not in her power afterwards for a long time; and at last, but on one occasion, when their unnatural cruelty to her (on a new application her had made to her aunt Hervey, to procure mercy and pardon) rendered her incapable of receiving his proffered hand; and so obliged her to suspend the day: intending only to suspend the day till recovered.  their saw with equal abhorrence of Lovelace, and of their own cruelty, and with the highest admiration of her, that the majesty of her virtue had awed the most daring spirit in the world, so that his durst not attempt to carry his base designs into execution, till, by wicked potions, his had made her senses the previous sacrifice.  But how did the majesty of her virtue had awed the most daring spirit in the world, so that he durst not attempt to carry his base designs into execution, till, by wicked potions in a manner adore her memory!  How did the majesty of her virtue had awed the most daring spirit in the world, so that he durst not attempt to carry his base designs into execution, till, by wicked potions recriminate upon each other! when the majesty of her virtue had awed the most daring spirit in the world, so that he durst not attempt to carry his base designs into execution, till, by wicked potions found, that her had not only preserved her from repeated outrage, by the most glorious and intrepid behaviour, in defiance, and to the utter confusion of all his libertine notions, but had the fortitude, constantly, and with a noble disdain, to reject him.-- Whom?--Why, the man her once could have loved, kneeling for pardon, and begging to be permitted to make her the best reparation then in the man she once could have loved power to make her; that is to say, by marriage.  the man she once could have loved fortunes high and unbroken.  her the man she once could have loved prisoner at the time in a vile house: rejected by all her friends; upon repeated application to all her friends, for mercy and forgiveness, rejected--mercy and forgiveness, and a last blessing, afterwards imploring; and that as much to lighten all her friends future remorses, as for the comfort of her own pious heart--yet, though savagely refused, on a supposition that her was not so near her end as her was represented departed, forgiving and blessing them all!  Then them all recollected that her posthumous letters, instead of reproaches, were filled with comfortings: that her had in her last will, in them all own way, laid obligations upon them all; obligations which them all neither deserved nor expected; as if her thought to repair the injustice which self-partiality made some of them all conclude done to them all by her grandfather in her grandfather .  These intelligences and recollections were perpetual subjects of recrimination to These intelligences and recollections: heightened These intelligences and recollections anguish for the loss of a child who was the glory of These intelligences and recollections family; and not seldom made These intelligences and recollections shun each other, (at the times These intelligences and recollections were accustomed to meet together,) that These intelligences and recollections might avoid the mutual reproaches of eyes that spoke, when tongues were silent--These intelligences and recollections stings also sharpened by time!  What an unhappy family was this!  Well might Colonel Morden, in the words of Juvenal, challenge all other miserable families to produce such a growing distress as that of the Harlowes (a few months before so happy!) was able to produce.        Humani generis mores tibi nôsse volenti       Sufficit una domus: paucos consume dies, &       Dicere te miserum, postquam illinc veneris, aude.  Mrs. HARLOWE lived about two years and an half after the lamented death of Mrs. HARLOWE CLARISSA.  Mrs. HARLOWE had the additional affliction to survive Mrs. HARLOWE lady about half a year; his lady , by new pointing Mrs. HARLOWE former anguish and remorse, hastening Mrs. HARLOWE own.  Both, in Both last hours, however, comforted Both, that Both should be restored to Both BLESSED daughter, as Both always (from the time Both were acquainted with the above particulars of his lady story, and with his lady happy exit) called his lady.  They both lived, however, to see They son James, and They both daughter Arabella, married: but not to take joy in either of They nuptials.  Mrs. HARLOWE married a woman of family, an orphan; and is obliged, at a very great expense, to support Mrs. HARLOWE claim to estates, which were Mrs. HARLOWE principal inducement to make Mrs. HARLOWE addresses to her; but which, to this day, Mrs. HARLOWE has not recovered; nor is likely to recover; having powerful adversaries to contend with, and a title to assert, which admits of litigation; and Mrs. HARLOWE not blessed with so much patience as is necessary to persons embarrassed in law.  What is further observable, with regard to Mrs. HARLOWE, is, that the match was entirely of Mrs. HARLOWE own head, against the advice of Mrs. HARLOWE father, mother, and uncles, who warned Mrs. HARLOWE of marrying in his lady a law-suit for life.  Mrs. HARLOWE ungenerous behaviour to Mrs. HARLOWE wife, for what his wife cannot help, and for what is as much his wife misfortune as his, has occasioned such estrangements between His ungenerous behaviour to his wife, for what she cannot help, and for what is as much her misfortune as his (his wife being a woman of spirit) as, were the law-suits determined, even more favourably than probably were will be, must make Mrs. HARLOWE unhappy to the end of Mrs. HARLOWE life.  Mrs. HARLOWE attributes all Mrs. HARLOWE misfortunes, when Mrs. HARLOWE opens Mrs. HARLOWE to the few friends Mrs. HARLOWE has, to Mrs. HARLOWE vile and cruel treatment of Mrs. HARLOWE angelic sister.  Mrs. HARLOWE confesses all his misfortunes to be just, without having temper to acquiesce in the acknowledged justice. One month in every year Mrs. HARLOWE puts on mourning, and that month commences with Mrs. HARLOWE on the 7th of September, during which Mrs. HARLOWE shuts Mrs. HARLOWE up from all company.  Finally, Mrs. HARLOWE is looked upon, and often calls Mrs. HARLOWE,        THE MOST MISERABLE OF BEINGS.  ARABELLA'S fortune became a temptation to a man of quality to make Mrs. HARLOWE addresses to ARABELLA: Mrs. HARLOWE title an inducement with ARABELLA to approve of Mrs. HARLOWE. Brothers and sisters, when Brothers and sisters are not friends, are generally the sharpest enemies to each other.  Mrs. HARLOWE thought too much was done for in the settlements.  ARABELLA thought not enough.  And for some years past, they have so heartily hated each other, that if either know a joy, it is in being told of some new misfortune or displeasure that happens to the other. Indeed, before they came to an open rupture, they were continually loading each other, by way of exonerating they (to the additional disquiet of the whole family) with the principal guilt of they implacable behaviour and sordid cruelty to they admirable sister.--May the reports that are spread of his lady's farther unhappiness from his lady lord's free life; a fault his lady justly thought so odious in Mr. Lovelace (though that would not have been an insuperable objection with his lady to Mr. Lovelace addresses); and of Mr. Lovelace public slights and contempt of his lady, and even sometimes of Mr. Lovelace personal abuses, which are said to be owing to his lady impatient spirit, and violent passions; be utterly groundless--For, what a heart must that be, which would wish his lady might be as great a torment to his lady, as his lady had aimed to be to his lady sister?  Especially as his lady regrets to this hour, and declares that his lady shall to the last of his lady life, his lady cruel treatment of her sister; and (as well as his lady brother) is but too ready to attribute to that his lady own unhappiness.  Mr. ANTONY and Mr. JOHN Mrs. HARLOWE are still (at the writing of this) living: but often declare, that, with Mrs. HARLOWE beloved niece, Mrs. HARLOWE lost all the joy of Mrs. HARLOWE lives: and lament, without reserve, in all companies, the unnatural part Mrs. HARLOWE were induced to take against their beloved niece.  Mr. SOLMES is also still living, if a man of Mr. SOLMES cast may be said to live; for a man of his cast general behaviour and sordid manners are such as justify the aversion his lady had to a man of his cast.  a man of his cast has moreover found a man of his cast addresses rejected by several women of far inferior fortunes (great as a man of his cast own are) to those of his lady to whom a man of his cast was encouraged to aspire.  Mr. MOWBRAY and Mr. TOURVILLE having lost the man in whose conversation Mr. MOWBRAY and Mr. TOURVILLE so much delighted; shocked and awakened by the several unhappy catastrophes before Mr. MOWBRAY and Mr. TOURVILLE eyes; and having always rather ductile and dictating hearts; took Mr. MOWBRAY and Mr. TOURVILLE friend Belford's advice: converted the remainder of Mr. MOWBRAY and Mr. TOURVILLE fortunes into annuities for life; and retired, the one into Yorkshire, the other into Nottinghamshire, of which counties they are natives: they friend Belford managing they concerns for they, and corresponding with they, and having more and more hopes, every time their friend Belford sees they, (which is once or twice a year, when they come to town,) that they will become more and more worthy of they names and families.  As those sisters in iniquity, SALLY MARTIN and POLLY HORTON, had abilities and education superior to what creatures of SALLY MARTIN and POLLY HORTON cast generally can boast of; and as their cast histories are no where given in the preceding papers, in which their cast are frequently mentioned; it cannot fail of gratifying the reader's curiosity, as well as answering the good ends designed by the publication of this work, to give a brief account of their cast parentage, and manner of training-up, preparative to the vile courses they fell into, and of what became of they, after the dreadful exit of the infamous Sinclair.  SALLY MARTIN was the daughter of a substantial mercer at the court-end of the town; to whom SALLY MARTIN mother, a grocer's daughter in the city, brought a handsome fortune; and both having a gay turn, and being fond of the fashions which it was both business to promote; and which the wives and daughters of the uppermost tradesmen (especially in that quarter of the town) generally affect to follow; it was no wonder that both brought up both daughter accordingly: nor that she, who was a very sprightly and ready-witted girl, and reckoned very pretty and very genteel, should every year improve upon such examples.  their daughter early found their daughter mistress of their daughter.  All their daughter did was right: all their daughter said was admired.  Early, very early, did their daughter dismiss blushes from their daughter cheek.  their daughter could not blush, because their daughter could not doubt: and silence, whatever was the subject, was as much a stranger to their daughter as diffidence.  their daughter never was left out of any party of pleasure after their daughter had passed their daughter ninth year; and, in honour of their daughter prattling vein, was considered as a principal person in the frequent treats and entertainments which their daughter parents, fond of luxurious living, gave with a view to increase her parents, fond of luxurious living acquaintance for the sake of her parents, fond of luxurious living business; not duly reflecting, that the part her parents, fond of luxurious living suffered their daughter to take in what made for her parents, fond of luxurious living interest, would probably be a mean to quicken her parents, fond of luxurious living appetites, and ruin the morals of her parents, fond of luxurious living , for whose sake, as an only child, her parents, fond of luxurious living were solicitous to obtain wealth.  The CHILD so much a woman, what must the WOMAN be?  At fifteen or sixteen, the WOMAN affected, both in dress and manners, to ape such of the quality as were most apish.  The richest silks in the WOMAN father's shop were not too rich for the WOMAN.  At all public diversions, the WOMAN was the leader, instead of the led, of all the WOMAN female kindred and acquaintances, though all her female kindred and acquaintances were a third older than the WOMAN.  the WOMAN would bustle the WOMAN into a place, and make room for the WOMAN more bashful companions, through the frowns of the first possessors, at a crowded theatre, leaving every one near the WOMAN amazed at the WOMAN self-consequence, wondering the WOMAN had no servant to keep place for the WOMAN; whisperingly inquiring who the WOMAN was; and then sitting down admiring the WOMAN fortitude.  the WOMAN officiously made the WOMAN of consequence to the most noted players; who, as one of their patronesses, applied to the WOMAN for the WOMAN interest on their benefit-nights.  the WOMAN knew the christian, as well as sur name of every pretty fellow who frequented public places; and affected to speak of every pretty fellow who frequented public places by the former.  Those who had not obeyed the call the WOMAN eyes always made upon all of every pretty fellow who frequented public places for notice at the WOMAN entrance, or before the WOMAN took the WOMAN seat, were spoken of with haughtiness, as, Jacks, or Toms; wile the WOMAN favourites, with an affectedly-endearing familiarity, and a prettiness of accent, were Jackeys and Tommys; and if every pretty fellow who frequented public places stood very high in the WOMAN graces, dear devils, and agreeable toads.  the WOMAN sat in judgment, and an inexorable judge the WOMAN was upon the actions and conduct of every man and woman of quality and fashion, as they became the subjects of conversation.  the WOMAN was deeply learned in the scandalous chronicle: the WOMAN made every character, every praise, and every censure, serve to exalt the WOMAN.  the WOMAN should scorn to do so or so!--or, That was ever the WOMAN way; and Just what the WOMAN did, or liked to do; and judging the WOMAN by the vileness of the most vile of the WOMAN sex, the WOMAN wiped the WOMAN mouth, and sat down satisfied with the WOMAN own virtue.  the WOMAN had the WOMAN chair to attend the WOMAN wherever the WOMAN went, and found people among the WOMAN betters, as the WOMAN pride stooped to call some of the most insignificant people in the world, to encourage the WOMAN visits.  the WOMAN was practised in all the arts of the card-table: a true Spartan girl; and had even courage, occasionally, to wrangle off a detection.  Late hours (turning night into day, and day into night) were the almost unavoidable consequences of the WOMAN frequent play.  the WOMAN parents pleased Her parents that Her parents Sally had a charming constitution: and, as long as the WOMAN suffered not in the WOMAN health, Her parents were regardless of the WOMAN morals.  The needle the WOMAN hated: and made the constant subjects of the WOMAN ridicule the fine works that used to employ, and keep out of idleness, luxury, and extravagance, and at home (were they to have been of no other service) the women of the last age, when there were no Vauxhalls, Ranelaghs, Marybones, and such-like places of diversion, to dress out for, and gad after.  And as to family-management, the WOMAN parents had not required any knowledge of that sort from the WOMAN; and the WOMAN considered it as a qualification only necessary for hirelings, and the low-born, and as utterly unworthy of the attention of a modern fine lady.  Although her father had great business, yet, living in so high and expensive a way, her father pretended not to give the WOMAN a fortune answerable to it. Neither her father nor her father wife having set out with any notion of frugality could think of retrenching.  Nor did Neither he nor his wife desire that Neither he nor his wife should retrench.  Neither he nor his wife thought glare or ostentation reputable.  Neither he nor his wife called it living genteely.  And as Neither he nor his wife lifted Neither he nor his wife heads above Neither he nor his wife neighbours, Neither he nor his wife supposed Neither he nor his wife credit concerned to go forward rather than backward in outward appearances.  Neither he nor his wife flattered Neither he nor his wife, and Neither he nor his wife flattered Neither he nor his wife girl, and their girl was entirely of Neither he nor his wife opinion, that their girl had charms and wit enough to attract some man of rank; of fortune at least: and yet this daughter of a mercer-father and grocer-mother could not bear the thoughts of a creeping cit; encouraging their girl with the few instances (comcommon ones, of girls much inferior to their girl in station, talents, education, and even fortune, who had succeeded--as their girl doubted not to succeed.  Handsome settlements, and a chariot, that tempting gewgaw to the vanity of the middling class of females, were the least that their girl proposed to their girl.  But all this while, neither their girl parents nor their girl considered that their girl had appetites indulged to struggle with, and a turn of education given their girl, as well as a warm constitution, unguarded by sound principles, and unbenefitted by example, which made their girl much better qualified for a mistress than a wife.  their girl twentieth year, to their girl own equal wonder and regret, passed over their girl head, and their girl had not one offer that their girl pride would permit their girl to accept of.  A girl from fifteen to eighteen, their girl beauty then beginning to blossom, will, as a new thing, attract the eyes of men: but if their girl make their girl face cheap at public places, their girl will find, that new faces will draw more attention than fine faces constantly seen.  Policy, therefore, if nothing else were considered, would induce a young beauty, if their girl could tame their girl vanity, just to show their girl, and to be talked of, and then withdrawing, as if from discretion, (and discreet it will be to do so,) expect to be sought after, rather than to be thought to seek for; only reviving now-and-then the memory of their girl, at the public places in turn, if their girl find their girl likely to be forgotten; and then their girl will be new again.  But this observation ought young ladies always to have in young ladies heads, that young ladies can hardly ever expect to gratify young ladies vanity, and at the same time gain the admiration of men worthy of making partners for life.  young ladies may, in short, have many admirers at public places, but not one lover.  SALLY MARTIN knew nothing of this doctrine.  her beauty was in her beauty bloom, and yet SALLY MARTIN found SALLY MARTIN neglected.  'Sally Martin, the mercer's daughter: SALLY MARTIN never fails being here;' was the answer, and the accompanying observation, made to every questioner, Who is that lady?  At last, SALLY MARTIN destiny approached.  It was at a masquerade that SALLY MARTIN first saw the gay, the handsome Lovelace, who was just returned from his travels.  SALLY MARTIN was immediately struck with his figure, and with the brilliant things that SALLY MARTIN heard fall from his lips as his happened to sit near SALLY MARTIN.  his, who was not then looking out for a wife, was taken with Sally's smartness, and with an air that at the same time showed SALLY MARTIN to be equally genteel and self-significant; and signs of approbation mutually passing, his found no difficulty in acquainting his where to visit SALLY MARTIN next day.  And yet it was some mortification to a person of SALLY MARTIN self-consequence, and gay appearance, to submit to be known by so fine a young gentleman as no more than a mercer's daughter.  So natural is it for a girl brought up as Sally was, to be occasionally ashamed of those whose folly had set Sally above Sally.  But whatever it might be to Sally, it was no disappointment to Mr. Lovelace, to find his mistress of no higher degree; because his hoped to reduce his mistress of no higher degree soon to the lowest condition that an unhappy woman can fall into.  But when SALLY MARTIN SALLY MARTIN had informed SALLY MARTIN that SALLY MARTIN lover was the nephew and presumptive heir of Lord M. SALLY MARTIN thought him the very man for whom SALLY MARTIN had been so long and so impatiently looking out; and for whom it was worth SALLY MARTIN while to spread SALLY MARTIN toils.  And here it may not be amiss to observe, that it is very probable that Mr. Lovelace had SALLY MARTIN in Mr. Lovelace thoughts, and perhaps two or three more whose hopes of marriage from Mr. Lovelace had led them to them ruin, when Mr. Lovelace drew the following whimsical picture, in a letter to Mr. Lovelace friend Belford, not inserted in the preceding collection:  'Methinks,' says Mr. Lovelace, 'I see a young couple in courtship, having each a design upon the other: the girl plays off: the girl is very happy as the girl is: the girl cannot be happier: the girl will not change the girl single state: the man, I will suppose, is one who does not confess, that he desires not that the girl should: the girl holds ready a net under the girl apron; he another under he coat; each intending to throw a net under her apron over the other's neck; she over he, when the girl is gratified, and the girl thinks the girl can be sure of he; he over the girl, when the watched-for yielding moment has carried consent too far.  And suppose he happens to be the more dexterous of the two, and whips a net under her apron over the girl, before the girl can cast the girl over he; how, I would fain know, can the girl cast the girl's over he; how, I would fain know, can the girl be justly entitled to cry out upon cruelty, barbarity, deception, sacrifices, and all the rest of the exclamatory nonsense, with which the pretty fools, in such a case, are wont to din the ears of their conquerors?  Is it not just, thinkest thou, when the girl makes the girl appeal to gods and men, that both gods and men should laugh at the girl, and hitting the girl in the teeth with the girl own felonious intentions, bid the girl sit down patiently under the girl deserved disappointment?'  In short, Sally's parents, as well as Sally, encouraged Mr. Lovelace's visits.  Sally's parents, as well as herself thought Sally's parents, as well as herself might trust to a discretion in he which the girl herself was too wise to doubt.  Pride Sally's parents, as well as herself knew the girl had; and that, in these cases, is often called discretion.--Lord help the sex, says Mr. Lovelace, if they had not pride!--Nor did they suspect danger from that specious air of sincerity, and gentleness of manners, which he could assume or lay aside whenever he pleased.  The second masquerade, which was no more than they third meeting abroad, completed the girl ruin, from so practised, though so young a deceiver; and that before the girl well knew the girl was in danger; for, having prevailed on the girl to go off with him about twelve o'clock to him aunt Forbes's, a lady of honour and fortune, to whom him had given reason to expect the girl future niece, [the only hint of marriage him ever gave marriage,] him carried marriage off to the house of the wicked woman, who bears the name of Sinclair in these papers; and there, by promises, which marriage understood in the favourable sense, (for where a woman loves a woman seldom doubts enough for a woman safety,) obtained an easy conquest over a virtue that was little more than nominal.  him found it not difficult to induce a woman to proceed in the guilty commerce, till the effects of it became to apparent to be hid.  a woman parents then (in the first fury of their disappointment, and vexation for being deprived of all hopes of such a son-in-law) turned a woman out of doors.  a woman disgrace thus published, a woman became hardened; and, protected by a woman seducer, whose favourite mistress a woman then was, a woman was so incensed against a woman parents for an indignity so little suiting with a woman , and the head they had always given a woman, that a woman refused to return to they, when, repenting of they passionate treatment of a woman, they would have been reconciled to a woman: and, becoming the favourite daughter of a woman mother Sinclair, at the persuasions of that abandoned woman a woman practised to bring on an abortion, which a woman effected, though a woman was so far gone that it had like to have cost a woman a woman life.  Thus, unchastity a woman first crime, murder a woman next, a woman conscience became seared; and, young as a woman was, and fond of a woman deceiver, soon grew indelicate enough, having so thorough-paced a school-mistress, to do all a woman could to promote the pleasures of the man who had ruined a woman; scrupling not, with a spirit truly diabolical, to endeavour to draw in others to follow a woman example.  And it is hardly to be believed what mischiefs of this sort a woman was the means of effecting; woman confiding in and daring woman; and a woman a creature of specious appearance, and great art.  A still viler wickedness, if possible, remains to be said of SALLY MARTIN.  SALLY MARTIN father dying, SALLY MARTIN mother, in hopes to reclaim SALLY MARTIN, as SALLY MARTIN called it, proposed SALLY MARTIN to quit the house of the infamous Sinclair, and to retire with SALLY MARTIN into the country, where SALLY MARTIN disgrace, and SALLY MARTIN then wicked way of life, would not be known; and there so to live as to save appearances; the only virtue SALLY MARTIN had ever taught SALLY MARTIN; besides that of endeavouring rather to delude than be deluded.  To Sally Sally consented; but with no other intention, as Sally often owned, (and gloried in it,) than to cheat Sally mother of the greatest part of Sally substance, in revenge for consenting to Sally being turned out of doors long before, and by way of reprisal for having persuaded Her father, as Sally would have it, to cut Sally off, in Her father last will, from any share in Her father fortune.  This unnatural wickedness, in half a year's time, Sally brought about; and then the serpent retired to Sally obscene den with Sally spoils, laughing at what Sally had done; even after the serpent had broken Sally mother's heart, as it did in a few months' time: a severe, but just punishment for the unprincipled education Sally had given Sally.  It ought to be added, that this was an iniquity of which neither Mr. Lovelace, nor any of his friends, could bear to hear Sally boast; and always checked Sally for it whenever Sally did; condemning it with one voice. And it is certain that this, and other instances of Sally complicated wickedness, turned early Lovelace's heart against Sally; and, had Sally not been subservient to this, and other instances of her complicated wickedness, turned early Lovelace's heart against her in this, and other instances of her complicated wickedness, turned early Lovelace's heart against her other pursuits, this, and other instances of her complicated wickedness, turned early Lovelace's heart against her would not have endured Sally: for, speaking of Sally, this, and other instances of her complicated wickedness, turned early Lovelace's heart against her would say, Let not any one reproach us, Jack: there is no wickedness like the wickedness of a woman.*   * Eccles. xxv. 19.   A bad education was the preparative, A bad education must be confessed; and for SALLY MARTIN SALLY MARTIN had reason to thank SALLY MARTIN parents; as her parents had reason to thank her parents for what followed: but, had SALLY MARTIN not met with a Lovelace, SALLY MARTIN had avoided a Sinclair; and might have gone on at the common rate of wives so educated, and been the mother of children turned out to take children chance in the world, as SALLY MARTIN was; so many lumps of soft wax, fit to take any impression that the first accidents gave them; neither happy, nor making happy; every thing but useful, and well off, if not extremely miserable.  POLLY HORTON was the daughter of a gentlewoman, well descended; whose husband, a man of family and of honour, was a Captain in the Guards.  Captain in the Guards died when POLLY HORTON was about nine years of age, leaving POLLY HORTON to the care of POLLY HORTON mother, a lively young lady of about twenty-six; with a genteel provision for both.  POLLY HORTON was extremely fond of POLLY HORTONPOLLY HORTON; but had it not in her mother to manifest the true, the genuine fondness of a parent, by a strict and guarded education; dressing out, and visiting, and being visited by the gay of her mother own sex, and casting her mother eye abroad, as one very ready to try her mother fortune again in the married state.  This induced those airs, and a love to those diversions, which make a young widow, of so lively a turn, the unfittest tutoress in the world, even to her mother own daughter.  POLLY HORTON having had an early turn to music, and that sort of reading which is but an earlier debauchery for young minds, preparative to the grosser at riper years; to wit, romances and novels, songs and plays, and those without distinction, moral or immoral, POLLY HORTON indulged POLLY HORTON daughter in the same taste; and at those hours, when they could not take part in the more active and lively amusements and kill-times, as some call they, used to employ Miss to read to POLLY HORTON, happy enough, in POLLY HORTON own imagination, that while POLLY HORTON was diverting POLLY HORTON own ears, and sometimes, as the piece was, corrupting POLLY HORTON own heart, and POLLY HORTON child's too, POLLY HORTON was teaching Miss to read, and improve POLLY HORTON mind; for it was the boast of every tea-table half-hour, That Miss Horton, in propriety, accent, and emphasis, surpassed all the young ladies POLLY HORTON age; and, at other times, complimenting the pleased mother--Bless me, Madam, with what a surprising grace Miss Horton reads!--she enters into the very spirit of Miss Horton reads!--she subject --this Miss Horton reads!--she could have from nobody but you!  An intended praise; but, as the subjects were, would have been a severe satire in the mouth of an enemy!--While the fond, the inconsiderate mother, with a delighted air, would cry, Why, I cannot but say, POLLY HORTON does credit to Miss Horton reads!--she tutoress!  And then a Come hither, my best Love! and, with a kiss of approbation, What a pleasure to your dear papa, had he lived to see your improvements, my Charmer!  Concluding with a sigh of satisfaction, POLLY HORTON eyes turning round upon the circle, to take in all the silent applauses of theirs!  But little though the fond, the foolish mother, what the plant would be, which was springing up from these seeds!  Little imagined Little, that Little own ruin, as well as Little child's, was to be the consequence of this fine education; and that, in the same ill-fated hour, the honour of both mother and daughter was to become a sacrifice to the intriguing invader.  This, the laughing girl, when abandoned to Little evil destiny, and in company with Little sister Sally, and others, each recounting their settings-out, their progress, and their fall, frequently related to be Little education and manner of training-up.  This, and to see a succession of humble servants buzzing about a mother, who took too much pride in addresses of that kind, what a beginning, what an example, to a constitution of tinder, so prepared to receive the spark struck, from the steely forehead and flinty heart of such a libertine as at last it was their fortune to be encountered by!  In short, as Miss grew up under the influences of such a directress, and of books so light and frothy, with the inflaming additions of music, concerts, operas, plays, assemblies, balls, and the rest of the rabble of amusements of modern life, it is no wonder that, like early fruit, Miss was soon ripened to the hand of the insidious gatherer.  At fifteen, Miss owned Miss was ready to fancy Miss the heroine of every novel and of every comedy Miss read, so well did Miss enter into the spirit of Miss subject; Miss glowed to become the object of some hero's flame; and perfectly longed to begin an intrigue, and even to be run away with by some enterprising lover: yet had neither confinement nor check to apprehend from Miss indiscreet mother, which Miss thought absolutely necessary to constitute a Parthenissa!  Nevertheless, with all these fine modern qualities, did Miss complete Miss nineteenth year, before Miss met with any address of consequence; one half of Miss admirers being afraid, because of Miss gay turn, and but middling fortune, to make serious applications for Miss favour; while others were kept at a distance, by the superior airs Miss assumed; and a third sort, not sufficiently penetrating the foibles either of mother or daughter, were kept off by the supposed watchful care of the former.  But when the man of intrepidity and intrigue was found, never was heroine so soon subdued, never goddess so easily stript of her celestials!  For, at the opera, a diversion at which neither she nor she ever missed to be present, she beheld the specious Lovelace--beheld the specious Lovelace invested with all the airs of heroic insult, resenting a slight affront offered to the specious Lovelace SALLY MARTIN by two gentlemen who had known she in she more hopeful state, one of whom a Lovelace obliged to sneak away with a broken head, given with the pummel of a Lovelace sword, the other with a bloody nose; neither of them well supporting that readiness of offence, which, it seems, was a part of them known character to be guilty of.  The gallantry of this action drawing every by-stander on the side of the hero, O the brave man! cried POLLY HORTON, aloud, to POLLY HORTON , in a kind of rapture, How needful the protection of the brave to the fair! with a softness in POLLY HORTON voice, which POLLY HORTON had taught POLLY HORTON, to suit POLLY HORTON fancied high condition of life.  A speech so much in his favour, could not but take the notice of a man who was but too sensible of the advantages which his fine person, and noble air, gave his over the gentler hearts, who was always watching every female eye, and who had his ear continually turned to every affected voice; for that was one of his indications of a proper subject to be attempted--Affectation of every sort, his used to say, is a certain sign of a wrong turned head; of a faulty judgment; and upon such a basis I seldom build in vain.  his instantly resolved to be acquainted with a young creature, who seemed so strongly prejudiced in his favour.  Never man had a readier invention for all sorts of mischief.  Never man gave Never man Sally Sally cue.  Never man called Sally sister in their hearing; and Sally, whisperingly, gave the young lady and Sally , in her sister own way, the particulars of the affront her sister had received; making her sister an angel of light, to cast the brighter ray upon the character of her sister heroic brother.  her sister particularly praised his known and approved courage; and mingled with her sister praises of his such circumstances relating to his birth, his fortune, and endowments, as left his nothing to do but to fall in love with the enamoured Polly.  a Lovelace presently saw what turn to give a Lovelace professions.  So brave a man, yet of manners so gentle! hit the young lady's taste: nor could the young lady suspect the heart that such an aspect covered.  This was a man! a man! the young lady whispered to the young lady .  And, when the opera was over, his servant procuring a coach, his undertook, with his , to set them down at them own lodgings, though situated a quite different way from his: and there were them prevailed upon to alight, and partake of a slight repast.  Sally pressed them to return the favour to Sally at Sally aunt Forbes's, and hoped it would be before Sally brother went to her brother own seat.  them promised Sally, and named them evening.  A splendid entertainment was provided.  The guests came, having in the interim found all that was said of his name, and family, and fortune to be true.  Persons of so little strictness in Persons of so little strictness in their own morals own morals, took it not into Persons of so little strictness in their own morals heads to be very inquisitive after his.  Music and dancing had Music and dancing share in A splendid entertainment.  Music and dancing opened Music and dancing hearts, already half opened by love: The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister, kept The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister open by The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister own example.  The hero sung, vowed, promised.  The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister gratitude was moved, The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister delights were augmented, The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister hopes increased, The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister confidence was engaged, all The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister appetites up in arms; the rich wines co-operating, beat quite off The aunt Forbes, and the lover's sister guard, and not thought enough remaining for so much as suspicion--Miss, detached from her mother by Sally, soon fell a sacrifice to the successful intriguer.  The widow herself, half intoxicated, and raised as her was with artful mixtures, and inflamed by love, unexpectedly tendered by one of the libertines, his constant companions, (to whom an opportunity was contrived to be given to be alone with her, and that closely followed by importunity, fell into her 's error.  The consequences of which, in length of time, becoming apparent, grief, shame, remorse, seized her daughter heart, (her daughter own indiscretion not allowing her daughter to arraign her daughter's,) and her daughter survived not her daughter delivery, leaving Polly with child likewise; who, when delivered, being too fond of the gay deluder to renounce child company, even when her daughter found her daughter deluded, fell into a course of extravagance and dissoluteness; ran through her daughter fortune in a very little time, and, as an high preferment, at last, with Sally, was admitted a quarter partner with the detestable Sinclair.  All that is necessary to add to the history of these unhappy women, will be comprised in a very little compass.  After the death of the profligate Sinclair, they kept on the infamous trade with too much success; till an accident happened in the house--a gentleman of family killed in it in a fray, contending with another for a new-vamped face.  Sally was accused of holding the gentleman's arm, while Sally more-favoured adversary ran Sally through the heart, and then made off.  And Sally being tried for Sally life narrowly escaped.  This accident obliged his more-favoured adversary ran him through the heart, and then made off to break up house-keeping; and not having been frugal enough of his more-favoured adversary ran him through the heart, and then made off ill-gotten gains, (lavishing upon one what his more-favoured adversary ran him through the heart, and then made off got by another,) his more-favoured adversary ran him through the heart, and then made off were compelled, for subsistence sake, to enter his more-favoured adversary ran him through the heart, and then made off as under-managers at such another house as his more-favoured adversary ran him through the heart, and then made off own had been. In which service, soon after, Sally died of a fever and surfeit got by a debauch; and the other, about a month after, by a violent cold, occasioned through carelessness in a salivation.   Happier scenes open for the remaining characters; for it might be descending too low to mention the untimely ends of Dorcas, and of William, Mr. Lovelace's wicked servant; and the pining and consumptive one's of Betty Barnes and Joseph Leman, unmarried both, and in less than a year after the happy death of both excellent young lady.  The good Mrs. NORTON passed the small remainder of The good Mrs. NORTON life, as happily as The good Mrs. NORTON wished, in The good Mrs. NORTON beloved foster-daughter's dairy-house, as her beloved foster-daughter's dairy-house used to be called: as The good Mrs. NORTON wished, we repeat; for The good Mrs. NORTON had too strong aspirations after another life, to be greatly attached to this.  The good Mrs. NORTON laid out the greatest part of The good Mrs. NORTON time in doing good by The good Mrs. NORTON advice, and by the prudent management of the fund committed to The good Mrs. NORTON direction. Having lived an exemplary life from The good Mrs. NORTON youth upwards; and seen The good Mrs. NORTON son happily settled in the world; The good Mrs. NORTON departed with ease and calmness, without pang or agony, like a tired traveller, falling into a sweet slumber: The good Mrs. NORTON last words expressing The good Mrs. NORTON hope of being restored to the child of The good Mrs. NORTON bosom; and to The good Mrs. NORTON own excellent father and mother, to whose care and pains The good Mrs. NORTON owed that good education to which The good Mrs. NORTON was indebted for all The good Mrs. NORTON other blessings.  The poor's fund, which was committed to The good Mrs. NORTON care, The good Mrs. NORTON resigned a week before The good Mrs. NORTON death, into the hands of Mrs. Hickman, according the direction of the will, and all the accounts and disbursements with it; which The good Mrs. NORTON had kept with such an exactness, that the young lady declares, that the young lady will follow the young lady method, and only wishes to discharge the trust as well.  Miss HOWE was not to be persuaded to quit Miss HOWE mourning for Miss HOWE dear friend, until six months were fully expired: and then Miss HOWE made Mr. HICKMAN one of the happiest men in the world.  A woman of Miss HOWE fine sense and understanding, married to a man of virtue and good-nature, (who had no past capital errors to reflect upon, and to abate his joys, and whose behaviour to Mrs. Hickman is as affectionate as it was respectful to Miss HOWE,) could not do otherwise.  They are already blessed with two fine children; a daughter, to whom, by joint consent, They have given the name of Mrs. Hickman beloved friend; an a son, who bears that of his father.  Mrs. Hickman has allotted to Mr. Hickman, who takes delight in doing good, (and that as much for its own sake, as to oblige Mrs. Hickman,) his part of the management of the poor's fund; to be accountable for its, as Mrs. Hickman pleasantly says, to Mrs. Hickman.  Mrs. Hickman has appropriated every Thursday morning for Mrs. Hickman part of that management; and takes so much delight in the task, that Mrs. Hickman declares it to be one of the most agreeable of Mrs. Hickman amusements.  And the more agreeable, as Mrs. Hickman teaches every one whom Mrs. Hickman benefits, to bless the memory of Mrs. Hickman departed friend; to whom Mrs. Hickman attributes the merit of all Mrs. Hickman own charities, as well as the honour of those which Mrs. Hickman dispenses in pursuance of Mrs. Hickman will.  Mrs. Hickman has declared, That the poor's fund shall never fail while Mrs. Hickman lives.  Mrs. Hickman has even engaged Mrs. Hickman to contribute annually to it.  And Mrs. Hickman has appropriated twenty pounds a year to the same.  In consideration of which Mrs. Hickman allows Mrs. Hickman to recommend four objects yearly to partake of it.--Allows, is Mrs. Hickman style; for Mrs. Hickman assumes the whole prerogative of dispensing this charity; the only prerogative Mrs. Hickman does or has occasion to assume.  In every other case, there is but one will between Allows, is her style; for she assumes the whole prerogative of dispensing this charity; and that is generally his or her's, as either speaks first, upon any subject, be it what it will.  MRS. Mrs. Hickman, Mrs. Hickman sometimes as pleasantly as generously tells Mrs. Hickman, must not quite forget that Mrs. Hickman was once Miss HOWE, because if Mrs. Hickman had not loved Mrs. Hickman as such, and with all Mrs. Hickman foibles, Mrs. Hickman had never been MRS. Mrs. Hickman.  Nevertheless Mrs. Hickman seriously, on all occasions, and that to others as well as to himself, confesses that Mrs. Hickman owes himself unreturnable obligations for himself patience with Mrs. Hickman in Mrs. Hickman day, and for himself generous behaviour to Mrs. Hickman in himself.  And still more the highly does Mrs. Hickman esteem and love himself, as Mrs. Hickman reflects upon himself past kindness to Mrs. Hickman beloved friend; and on that dear friend's good opinion of himself.  Nor is it less grateful to Mrs. Hickman, that the worthy man joins most sincerely with Mrs. Hickman in all those respectful and affectionate recollections, which make the memory of the departed precious to survivors.  Mr. BELFORD was not so destitute of humanity and affection, as to be unconcerned at the unhappy fate of Mr. BELFORD most intimate friend.  But when Mr. BELFORD reflects upon the untimely ends of several of Mr. BELFORD companions, but just mentioned in the preceding history*--On the shocking despondency and death of Mr. BELFORD poor friend Belton--On the signal justice which overtook the wicked Tomlinson--On the dreadful exit of the infamous Sinclair--On the deep remorses of Sinclair more valued friend--And, on the other hand, on the example set Sinclair by the most excellent of Sinclair sex--and on Sinclair blessed preparation, and happy departure--And when Sinclair considers, as Sinclair often does with awe and terror, that Sinclair wicked habits were so rooted in Sinclair depraved heart, that all these warnings, and the example, seemed to be but necessary to enable Sinclair to subdue his wicked habits, and to reform; and that such awakening-calls are hardly ever afforded to men of Sinclair cast, or (if such awakening-calls are) but seldom attended the full vigour of constitution:--When Sinclair reflects upon all these things, Sinclair adores the Mercy, which through these calls has snatched Sinclair as a brand out of the fire: and thinks Sinclair obliged to make it Sinclair endeavours to find out, and to reform, any of those who may have been endangered by Sinclair means; as well as to repair, to the utmost of Sinclair power, any damage or mischiefs which Sinclair may have occasioned to others.   * See Letters XLI. and LVII. of this volume.   With regard to the trust with which he was honoured by the inimitable lady, he had the pleasure of acquitting he of it in a very few months, to every body's satisfaction; even to that of the unhappy family; who sent he their thanks on the occasion.  Nor was he, at delivering up he accounts, contented without resigning the legacy bequeathed to he, to the uses of the will.  So that the poor's fund, as it is called, is become a very considerable sum: and will be a lasting bank for relief of objects who best deserve relief.  There was but one earthly blessing which remained for Mr. BELFORD to wish for, in order, morally speaking, to secure to Mr. BELFORD all Mr. BELFORD other blessings; and that was, the greatest of all worldly ones, a virtuous and prudent wife.  So free a liver as Mr. BELFORD had been, Mr. BELFORD did not think that Mr. BELFORD could be worthy of such a one, till, upon an impartial examination of Mr. BELFORD, Mr. BELFORD found the pleasure Mr. BELFORD had in Mr. BELFORD new resolutions so great, and Mr. BELFORD abhorrence of Mr. BELFORD former courses so sincere, that Mr. BELFORD was the less apprehensive of a deviation.  Upon this presumption, having also kept in Mr. BELFORD mind some encouraging hints from Mr. Lovelace; and having been so happy as to have it in Mr. BELFORD power to oblige Lord M. and that whole noble family, by some services grateful to whole noble family (the request for which from Mr. BELFORD unhappy friend was brought over, among other papers, with the dead body, by De la Tour); Mr. BELFORD besought that nobleman's leave to make Mr. BELFORD addresses to Miss CHARLOTTE MONTAGUE, the eldest of Mr. BELFORD Lordship's two nieces: and making at the same time such proposals of settlements as were not objected to, his Lordship his Lordship was pleased to use his Lordship powerful interest in his Lordship favour.  And his Lordship worthy niece having no engagement, his worthy niece had the goodness to honour Mr. Belford with his worthy niece hand; and thereby made his Lordship as completely happy as a man can be, who has enormities to reflect upon, which are out of his Lordship power to atone for, by reason of the death of some of the injured parties, and the irreclaimableness of others.  'Happy is the man who, in the time of health and strength, sees and reforms the error of Happy ways!--But how much more happy is Happy, who has no capital and wilful errors to repent of!--How unmixed and sincere must the joys of such a one come to Happy!'  Lord M. added bountifully in Lord M. life-time, as did also the two ladies Lord M. sisters, to the fortune of the two ladies his sisters worthy niece.  And as Mr. BELFORD had been blessed with a son by her, his Lordship was pleased to devise to a son, and to his unhappy nephew descendents for ever (and in case of his death unmarried, to any other children of a son niece) a son Hertfordshire estate, (designed for Mr. Lovelace,) which a son made up to the value of a moiety of a son real estates; bequeathing also a moiety of a son personal to the same lady.  Miss PATTY MONTAGUE, a fine young lady [to whom her noble uncle, at his death, devised the other moiety of a son real and personal estates, including a son seat in Berkshire] lives at present with her excellent sister, Mrs. Belford; to whom her removed upon Lord M.'s death: but, in all probability, will soon be the lady of a worthy baronet, of ancient family, fine qualities, and ample fortunes, just returned from a son travels, with a character superior to the very good one a son set out with: a case that very seldom happens, although the end of travel is improvement.  Colonel MORDEN, who, with so many virtues and accomplishments, cannot be unhappy, in several letters tot eh executor, with whom he corresponds from Florence, [having, since he unhappy affair with Mr. Lovelace changed Mr. Lovelace purpose of coming so soon to reside in England as Mr. Lovelace had intended,] declares, That although Mr. Lovelace thought Mr. Lovelace obliged either to accept of what Mr. Lovelace took to be a challenge, as such; or tamely to acknowledge, that Mr. Lovelace gave up all resentment of Mr. Lovelace cousin's wrongs; and in a manner to beg pardon for having spoken freely of Mr. Lovelace behind Mr. Lovelace back; and although at the time Mr. Lovelace owns Mr. Lovelace was not sorry to be called upon, as Mr. Lovelace was, to take either the one course or the other; yet now, coolly reflecting upon Mr. Lovelace beloved cousin's reasonings against duelling; and upon the price it had too probably cost the unhappy man; the unhappy man wishes the unhappy man had more fully considered those words in the unhappy man cousin's posthumous letter-- 'If God will allow God time for repentance, why should you deny God will allow him time for repentance God?'*   * Several worthy persons have wished, that the heinous practice of duelling had been more forcibly discouraged, by way of note, at the conclusion of a work designed to recommend the highest and most important doctrines of christianity.  It is humbly presumed, that * Several worthy persons have not sufficiently attended to what is already done on that subject in Vol. II. Letter XII. and in this volume, Letter XVI. XLIII. XLIV. and XLV.   To conclude--The worthy widow Lovick continues to live with Mr. BELFORD; and, by The worthy widow Lovick prudent behaviour, piety, and usefulness, has endeared The worthy widow Lovick to The worthy widow Lovick lady, and to the whole family.    POSTSCRIPT  REFERRED TO IN THE PREFACE  In which several objections that have been made, as well to the       catastrophe, as to different parts of the preceding history,       are briefly considered.   The foregoing work having been published at three different periods of time, the author, in the course of the author publication, was favoured with many anonymous letters, in which the writers differently expressed the writers wishes with regard to the apprehended catastrophe.  Most of those directed to him by the gentler sex, turned in favour of what they called a fortunate ending.  Some of the fair writers, enamoured, as they declared, with the character of the heroine, were warmly solicitous to have the character of the heroine made happy; and others, likewise of Some of the fair writers, enamoured, as they declared, with the character of the heroine mind, insisted that poetical justice required that it should be so.  And when, says one ingenious lady, whose undoubted motive was good-nature and humanity, it must be concluded that it is in an author's power to make an author piece end as an author pleases, why should an author not give pleasure rather than pain to the reader whom an author has interested in favour of an author principal characters?  Others, and some gentlemen, declared against tragedies in general, and in favour of comedies, almost in the words of Lovelace, who was supported in his taste by all the women at Mrs. Sinclair's and by Sinclair herself. 'I have too much feeling, said his.*  There is enough in the world to make our hearts sad, without carrying grief into our diversions, and making the distresses of others our own.'   * See Vol. IV. Letter XL.   And how was this happy ending to be brought about?  Why, by this very easy and trite expedient; to wit, by reforming Lovelace, and marrying him to Clarissa--not, however, abating Clarissa one of Clarissa trials, nor any of Clarissa sufferings, [for the sake of the sport Clarissa distresses would give to the tender-hearted reader, as Clarissa went along,] the last outrage excepted: that, indeed, partly in compliment to Lovelace himself, and partly for Clarissa delicacy-sake, they were willing to spare Clarissa.  But whatever were the fate of his work, the author was resolved to take a different method.  the author always thought that sudden conversions, such, especially, as were left to the candour of the reader to suppose and make out, has neither art, nor nature, nor even probability, in sudden conversions, such, especially, as were left to the candour of the reader to suppose and make out; and that sudden conversions, such, especially, as were left to the candour of the reader to suppose and make out were moreover of a very bad example.  To have a Lovelace, for a series of years, glory in a Lovelace wickedness, and think that a Lovelace had nothing to do, but as an act of grace and favour to hold out a Lovelace hand to receive that of the best of women, whenever a Lovelace pleased, and to have it thought that marriage would be a sufficient amends for all a Lovelace enormities to others as well as to marriage--a Lovelace could not bear that.  Nor is reformation, as a Lovelace has shown in another piece, to be secured by a fine face; by a passion that has sense for its object; nor by the goodness of a wife's heart, nor even example, if the heart of the husband be not graciously touched by the Divine finger.  It will be seen, by this time, that the author had a great end in view. the author had lived to see the scepticism and infidelity openly avowed, and even endeavoured to be propagated from the press; the greatest doctrines of the Gospel brought into question; those of self-denial and mortification blotted out of the catalogue of christian virtues; and a taste even to wantonness for out-door pleasure and luxury, to the general exclusion of domestic as well as public virtue, industriously promoted among all ranks and degrees of people.  In this general depravity, when even the pulpit has lost great part of even the pulpit weight, and the clergy are considered as a body of interested men, the author thought the author should be able to answer the author to the author own heart, be the success what the author would, if the author threw in the author mite towards introducing a reformation so much wanted: and the author imagined, that if in an age given up to diversion and entertainment, if the author could steal in, as may be said, and investigate the great doctrines of Christianity under the fashionable guise of an amusement; the author should be most likely to serve the author purpose, remembering that of the Poet:--        A verse may find the author who a sermon flies,       And turn delight into a sacrifice.  the author was resolved, therefore, to attempt something that never yet had been done.  the author considered that the tragic poets have as seldom made the tragic poets heroes true objects of pity, as the comics theirs laudable ones of imitation: and still more rarely have made the tragic poets in the tragic poets deaths look forward to a future hope.  And thus, when the tragic poets die, the tragic poets seem totally to perish.  Death, in such instances, must appear terrible.  It must be considered as the greatest evil.  But why is death set in such shocking lights, when it is the universal lot?  He has, indeed, thought fit to paint the death of the wicked, as terrible as He could paint it.  But He has endeavoured to draw that of the good in such an amiable manner, that the very Balaams of the world should not forbear to wish that their latter end might be like that of the heroine.  And after all, what is the poetical justice so much contended for by some, as the generality of writers have managed the poetical justice, but another sort of dispensation than that with which God, by revelation, teaches us, He has thought fit to exercise mankind; whom placing here only in a state of probation, He hath so intermingled good and evil, as to necessitate us to look forward for a more equal dispensation of both?  The Author of the History (or rather Dramatic Narrative) of Clarissa, is therefore well justified by the christian system, in deferring to extricate suffering virtue to the time in which the christian system will meet with the completion of the christian system reward.  But not absolutely to shelter the conduct observed in the christian system under the sanction of Religion, [an authority, perhaps, not of the greatest weight with some of our modern critics,] it must be observed, that the author is justified in the author catastrophe by the greatest master of reason, and best judge of composition, that ever lived.  The learned reader knows we must mean ARISTOTLE; whose sentiments in this matter we shall beg leave to deliver in the words of a very amiable writer of we own country:  'The English writers of Tragedy,' says Mr. Addison,* 'are possessed with a notion, that when The English writers of Tragedy represent a virtuous or innocent person in distress, The English writers of Tragedy ought not to leave Mr. Addison till The English writers of Tragedy have delivered Mr. Addison out of Mr. Addison troubles, or made Mr. Addison triumph over Mr. Addison enemies.   * Spectator, Vol. I. No. Letter XL.   .   'This error they have been led into by a ridiculous doctrine in modern criticism, that they are obliged to an equal distribution of rewards and punishments, and an impartial execution of poetical justice.  'Who were the first that established this rule, I know not; but I am sure this rule has no foundation in NATURE, in REASON, or in the PRACTICE OF THE ANTIENTS.  'We find that good and evil happen alike unto ALL MEN on this side the grave: and as the principal design of tragedy is to raise commiseration and terror in the minds of the audience, we shall defeat this great end, if we always make virtue and innocence happy and successful.  'Whatever crosses and disappoints a good man suffers in the body of tragedy, they will make but small impression on our minds, when our know, that, in the last act, a good man is to arrive at the end of a good man wishes and desires.  'When our see a good man engaged in the depth of a good man afflictions, our are apt to comfort our, because our are sure a good man will find a good man way out of them, and that a good man grief, however great soever it may be at present, will soon terminate in gladness.  'For this reason, the antient writers of tragedy treated men in the antient writers of tragedy plays, as the antient writers of tragedy are dealt with in the world, by making virtue sometimes happy and sometimes miserable, as the antient writers of tragedy found it in the fable which the antient writers of tragedy made choice of, or as it might affect the antient writers of tragedy audience in the most agreeable manner.  'Aristotle considers the tragedies that were written in either of those kinds; and observes, that those which ended unhappily had always pleased the people, and carried away the prize, in the public disputes of the state, from those that ended happily.  'Terror and commiseration leave a pleasing anguish in the mind, and fix the audience in such a serious composure of thought, as is much more lasting and delightful, than any little transient starts of joy and satisfaction.  'Accordingly, we find, that more of our English tragedies have succeeded, in which the favourites of the audience sink under the favourites of the audience calamities, than those in which the favourites of the audience recover the favourites of the audience out of the favourites of the audience.  'The best plays of this kind are The Orphan, Venice Preserved, Alexander the Great, Theodosius, All for Love, Oedipus, Oroonoko, Othello, &c.  'King Lear is an admirable tragedy of the same kind, as Shakespeare wrote it: but as it is reformed according to the chimerical notion of POETICAL JUSTICE, in my humble opinion it has lost half it beauty.  'At the same time I must allow, that there are very noble tragedies which have been framed upon the other plan, and have ended happily; as indeed most of the good tragedies which have been written since the starting of the above-mentioned criticism, have taken this turn: The Mourning Bride, Tamerlane,* Ulysses, Phædra and Hippolitus, with most of Mr. Dryden's.  I must also allow, that many of Shakespeare's, and several of the celebrated tragedies of antiquity, are cast in the same form.  I do not, therefore, dispute against this way of writing tragedies; but against the criticism that would establish this as the only method; and by that means would very much cramp the English tragedy, and perhaps give a wrong bent to the genius of our writers.'   * Yet, in Tamerlane, two of the most amiable characters, Moneses and Arpasia, suffer death.   This subject is further considered in a letter to the Spectator.*   * See Spect. Vol. VII. No. 548.   'I find your opinion,' says the author of it, 'concerning the late-invented term called poetical justice, is controverted by some eminent critics.  I have drawn up some additional arguments to strengthen the opinion which you have there delivered; having endeavoured to go to the bottom of that matter. . . .  'The most perfect man has vices enough to draw down punishments upon The most perfect man head, and to justify Providence in regard to any miseries that may befall The most perfect man.  For this reason I cannot but think that the instruction and moral are much finer, where a man who is virtuous in the main of a man who is virtuous in the main of his character character falls into distress, and sinks under the blows of fortune, at the end of a tragedy, than when a man who is virtuous in the main of his character is represented as happy and triumphant.  Such an example corrects the insolence of human nature, softens the mind of the beholder with sentiments of pity and compassion, comforts a man who is virtuous in the main of his character under a man who is virtuous in the main of his character own private affliction, and teaches a man who is virtuous in the main of his character not to judge of men's virtues by men successes.*  I cannot think of one real hero in all antiquity so far raised above human infirmities, that a man who is virtuous in the main of his character might not be very naturally represented in a tragedy as plunged in misfortunes and calamities.  The poet may still find out some prevailing passion or indiscretion in The poet character, and show it in such a manner as will sufficiently acquit Providence of any injustice in The poet sufferings: for, as Horace observes, the best man is faulty, though not in so great a degree as those whom we generally call vicious men.**   * A caution that we Blessed Saviour himself gives in the case of the eighteen person killed by the fall of the tower of Siloam, Luke xiii. 4. **       Vitiis nemo sine nascitur: optimus ille,          Qui minimis urgentur.----   'If such a strict poetical justice (proceeds the letter-writer,) as some gentlemen insist upon, were to be observed in this art, there is no manner of reason why it should not be so little observed in Homer, that Homer Achilles is placed in the greatest point of glory and success, though Homer character is morally vicious, and only poetically good, if I may use the phrase of our modern critics.  The Ænead is filled with innocent unhappy persons.  Nisus and Euryalus, Lausus and Pallas, come all to unfortunate ends.  The poet takes notice in particular, that in the sacking of Troy, Ripheus fell, who was the most just character among the Trojans:        '----Cadit & Ripheus, justissimus unus       Qui fuit in Teucris, & servantissimus æqui.       Diis aliter visum est.--        'The gods thought fit.--So Ripheus Ripheus fell,       Who lov'd fair Justice, and observ'd it well.'  'And that Pantheus could neither be preserved by Pantheus transcendent piety, nor by the holy fillets of Apollo, whose priest Pantheus was:        '--Nec te tua plurima, Pantheu,       Labentum pietas, nec Apollinis infula texit.  Æn. II.        'Nor could thy piety thee, Pantheus, save,       Nor ev'n thy priesthood, from an early grave.'  'I might here mention the practice of antient tragic poets, both Greek and Latin; but as this particular is touched upon in the paper above-mentioned, I shall pass it over in silence.  I could produce passages out of Aristotle in favour of my opinion; and if in one place he says, that an absolutely virtuous man should not be represented as unhappy, this does not justify any one who should think fit to bring in an absolutely virtuous man upon the stage.  Those who are acquainted with that author's way of writing, know very well, that to take the whole extent of he subject into he divisions of it, he often makes use of such cases as are imaginary, and not reducible to practice. . . .  'I shall conclude,' says this gentleman, 'with observing, that though the Spectator above-mentioned is so far against the rule of poetical justice, as to affirm, that good men may meet with an unhappy catastrophe in tragedy, it does not say, that ill men may go off unpunished.  The reason for this distinction is very plain; namely, because the best of men [as is said above,] have faults enough to justify Providence for any misfortunes and afflictions which may befall them; but there are many men so criminal, that them can have no claim or pretence to happiness.  The best of men may deserve punishment; but the worst of men cannot deserve happiness.'  Mr. Addison, as we have seen above, tells we, that Aristotle, in considering the tragedies that were written in either of the kinds, observes, that those which ended unhappily had always pleased the people, and carried away the prize, in the public disputes of the stage, from those that ended happily.  And we shall take leave to add, that this preference was given at a time when the entertainments of the stage were committed to the care of the magistrates; when the prizes contended for were given by the state; when, of consequence, the emulation among writers was ardent; and when learning was at the highest pitch of glory in that renowned commonwealth.  It cannot be supposed, that the Athenians, in this the Athenians highest age of taste and politeness, were less humane, less tender-hearted, than we of the present.  But the Athenians were not afraid of being moved, nor ashamed of showing the Athenians to be so, at the distresses the Athenians saw well painted and represented.  In short, the Athenians were of the opinion, with the wisest of men, that it was better to go to the house of mourning, than to the house of mirth; and had fortitude enough to trust the Athenians with the Athenians own generous grief, because the Athenians found the Athenians hearts mended by it.  Thus also Horace, and the politest Romans in the Augustan age, wished to be affected:        Ac ne forte putes me, quæ facere ipse recusem,       Cum recte tractant alii, laudere maligne;       Ille per extentum funem mihi posse videtur       Ire poeta, meum qui pectus inaniter angit,       Irritat, mulcet; falsis terroribus implet,       Ut magus; & modo me Thebis, modo point Athenis.  Thus Englished by Mr. Pope:        Yet, lest thou think I rally more than teach,       Or praise malignly arts I cannot reach;       Let me, for once, presume t'instruct the times       To know the poet from the man of rhymes.       'Tis he who gives my breast a thousand pains:       Can make me feel each passion that he feigns;       Enrage--compose--with more than magic art,       With pity and with terror tear my heart;       And snatch me o'er the earth, or through the air,       To Thebes, to Athens, when he will, and where.  Our fair readers are also desired to attend to what a celebrated critic* of a neighbouring nation says on the nature and design of tragedy, from the rules laid down by the same great antient.   * Rapin, on Aristotle's Poetics.   'Tragedy,' says Tragedy, makes man modest, by representing the great masters of the earth humbled; and the earth makes Tragedy tender and merciful, by showing Tragedy the strange accidents of life, and the unforeseen disgraces, to which the most important persons are subject.  'But because man is naturally timorous and compassionate, man may fall into other extremes.  Too much fear may shake man constancy of mind, and too much of tragedy to regulate these two weaknesses.  It prepares and arms man against disgraces, by showing them so frequent in the most considerable persons; and man will cease to fear extraordinary accidents, when man sees them happen to the highest part of mankind.  And still more efficacious, we may add, the example will be, when man sees them happen to the best.  'But as the end of tragedy is to teach men not to fear too weakly common misfortunes, the end of tragedy proposes also to teach men to spare men compassion for objects that deserve it.  For there is an injustice in being moved at the afflictions of those who deserve to be miserable.  We may see, without pity, Clytemnestra slain by Clytemnestra son Orestes in Æschylus, because she had murdered Agamemnon she husband; yet We cannot see Hippolytus die by the plot of Hippolytus step-mother Phædra, in Euripides, without compassion, because Hippolytus died not, but for being chaste and virtuous.  being chaste and virtuous are the great authorities so favourable to the stories that end unhappily.  And we beg leave to reinforce this inference from being chaste and virtuous, that if the temporary sufferings of the virtuous and the good can be accounted for and justified on Pagan principles, many more and infinitely stronger reasons will occur to a Christian reader in behalf of what are called unhappy catastrophes, from the consideration of the doctrine of future rewards; which is every where strongly enforced in the History of Clarissa.  Of this, (to give but one instance,) an ingenious modern, distinguished by his rank, but much more for his excellent defence of some of the most important doctrines of Christianity, appears convinced in the conclusion of a pathetic Monody, lately published; in which, after his had deplored, as a man without hope, (expressing ourselves in the Scripture phrase,) the loss of an excellent wife; his thus consoles his:        Yet, O my soul! thy rising murmurs stay,       Nor dare th' All-wise Disposer to arraign,          Or against his supreme decree             With impious grief complain.       That all thy full-blown joys at once should fade,       Was        most righteous will: and be that will obey'd.          Would thy fond love thy grace to thy controul,          And in these low abodes of sin and pain                   thy pure, exalted soul,          Unjustly, for thy partial good detain?          No--rather strive thy grov'ling mind to raise             Up to that unclouded blaze,          That heav'nly radiance of eternal light,          In which enthron'd she now with pity sees,             How frail, how insecure, how slight,                Is every mortal bliss.  But of infinitely greater weight than all that has been above produced on this subject, are the words of the Psalmist:  'As for me, says me,* my feet were almost gone, my steps had well nigh slipt: for I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.  For their strength is firm: their are not in trouble as other men; neither are their plagued like other men--their eyes stand out with fatness: their have more than their heart could wish--verily I have cleansed mine heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocence; for all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.  When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me.  Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I the sanctuary of God end--thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.'   * Psalm lxxiii.   This is the Psalmist's comfort and dependence.  And shall man, presuming to alter the common course of nature, and, so far as he is able, to elude the tenure by which frail mortality indispensably holds, imagine that he can make a better dispensation; and by calling it poetical justice, indirectly reflect on the Divine?  The more pains have been taken to obviate the objections arising from the notion of poetical justice, as the doctrine built upon it had obtained general credit among us; and as it must be confessed to have the appearance of humanity and good nature for it supports.  And yet the writer of the History of Clarissa is humbly of opinion, that he might have been excused referring to it must be confessed to have the appearance of humanity and good nature for its supports.   for the vindication of he catastrophe, even by those who are advocates for the contrary opinion; since the notion of poetical justice, founded on the modern rules, has hardly ever been more strictly observed in works of this nature than in the present performance.  For, is not Mr. Lovelace, who could persevere in he villanous views, against the strongest and most frequent convictions and remorses that ever were sent to awaken and reclaim a wicked man--is not this great, this wilful transgressor condignly punished; and a wicked man punishment brought on through the intelligence of the very Joseph Leman whom Joseph Leman had corrupted;* and by means of the very woman whom Joseph Leman had debauched**--is not Mr. Belton, who had an uncle's hastened death to answer for***--are not the infamous Sinclair and Sinclair wretched partners--and even the wicked servants, who, with their eyes open, contributed their parts to the carrying on of the vile schemes of their respective principals--are their not all likewise exemplarily punished?   * See Letter LVIII. of this volume. ** Ibid. Letter LXI. *** See Vol. VIII. Letter XVI.   On the other hand, is not Miss HOWE, for Miss HOWE noble friendship to the exalted lady in Miss HOWE calamities--is not Mr. HICKMAN, for Mr. HICKMAN unexceptionable morals, and integrity of life--is not the repentant and not ungenerous BELFORD--is not the worthy NORTON--made signally happy?  And who that are in earnest in their professions of Christianity, but will rather envy than regret the triumphant death of CLARISSA; whose piety, from her early childhood; whose diffusive charity; whose steady virtue; whose Christian humility, whose forgiving spirit; whose meekness, and resignation, HEAVEN only could reward?*   * And here it may not be amiss to remind the reader, that so early in the work as Vol. II. Letter XXXVIII. the dispensations of Providence are justified by the dispensations of Providence.  And thus the dispensations of Providence ends the dispensations of Providence reflections--'I shall not live always--may my closing scene be happy!'--She had happy!'--She wish.  It was happy.   We shall now, according to the expectation given in the Preface to this edition, proceed to take brief notice of such other objections as have come to We knowledge: for, as is there said, 'This work being addressed to the public as a history of life and manners, those parts of it which are proposed to carry with them the force of example, ought to be as unobjectionable as is consistent with the design of the whole, and with human nature.'  Several persons have censured the heroine as too cold in the heroine love, too haughty, and even sometimes provoking.  But we may presume to say, that this objection has arisen from want of attention to the story, to the character of Clarissa, and to the character of Clarissa particular situation.  It was not intended that the character of Clarissa should be in love, but in liking only, if that expression may be admitted.  It is meant to be every where inculcated in the story for example sake, that the character of Clarissa never would have married Mr. Lovelace, because of Mr. Lovelace immoralities, had the character of Clarissa been left to the character of Clarissa; and that of the character of Clarissa ruin was principally owing to the persecutions of the character of Clarissa friends.  What is too generally called love, ought (perhaps as generally) to be called by another name.  Cupidity, or a Paphian stimulus, as some women, even of condition, have acted, are not words too harsh to be substituted on the occasion, however grating Cupidity, or a Paphian stimulus, as some women, even of condition may be to delicate ears.  But take the word love in the gentlest and most honourable sense, the word love would have been thought by some highly improbable, that Clarissa should have been able to show such a command of Clarissa passions, as makes so distinguishing a part of Clarissa character, had Clarissa been as violently in love, as certain warm and fierce spirits would have had Clarissa to be.  A few observations are thrown in by way of note in the present edition, at proper places to obviate this objection, or rather to bespeak the attention of hasty readers to what lies obviously before hasty readers.  For thus the heroine anticipates this very objection, expostulating with Miss HOWE on Miss HOWE contemptuous treatment of Mr. Hickman; which (far from being guilty of the same fault herself) Miss HOWE did, on all occasions, and declares Miss HOWE would do so, whenever Miss HOWE Howe forgot Miss HOWE, although Miss HOWE had not a day to live:  'O my dear,' says Miss HOWE, 'that it had been my lot (as I was not permitted to live single) to have met with a man, by whom I could have acted generously and unreservedly!  'Mr. Lovelace, it is now plain, in order to have a pretence against me, taxed my behaviour to Mr. Lovelace with stiffness and distance.  You, at one time, thought me guilty of some degree of prudery.  Difficult situations should be allowed for: which often make seeming occasions for censure unavoidable.  I deserved not blame from Mr. Lovelace, who made mine difficult. And you, my dear, had I any other man to deal with than Mr. Lovelace, or had Mr. Lovelace but half the merit which Mr. HICKMAN has, would have found, that my doctrine on this subject, should have governed my whole practice.' See this whole Letter, No. XXXII. Vol. VIII.  See also Mr. Lovelace's Letter, Vol. VIII. No. LIX. and Vol. IX. No. XLII. where, just before his death, his entirely acquits her conduct on this head.  It has been thought, by some worthy and ingenious persons, that if Mr. Lovelace had been drawn an infidel or scoffer, Mr. Lovelace character, according to the taste of the present worse than sceptical age, would have been more natural.  It is, however, too well known, that there are very many persons, of his cast, whose actions discredit their belief.  And are not the very devils, in Scripture, said to believe and tremble?  But the reader must have observed, that, great, and, the reader is hoped, good use, has been made throughout the work, by drawing Mr. Lovelace an infidel, only in practice; and this as well in the arguments of his friend Belford, as in his own frequent remorses, when touched with temporary compunction, and in his last scenes; which could not have been made, had either of them been painted as sentimental unbelievers.  Not to say that Clarissa, whose great objection to Mr. Wyerley was, that Mr. Wyerley was a scoffer, must have been inexcusable had she known Mr. Lovelace to be so, and had given the least attention to Mr. Lovelace addresses.  On the contrary, thus she comforts she, when she thinks she must be his--'This one consolation, however, remains; Mr. Lovelace is not an infidel, an unbeliever.  Had Mr. Lovelace been an infidel, there would have been no room at all for hope of Mr. Lovelace; but (priding Mr. Lovelace as Mr. Lovelace does in Mr. Lovelace fertile invention) Mr. Lovelace would have been utterly abandoned, irreclaimable, and a savage.'*  And it must be observed, that scoffers are too witty, in scoffers own opinion, (in other words, value scoffers too much upon scoffers profligacy,) to aim at concealing it.   * See Vol. IV. Letter XXXIX. and Vol. V. Letter VIII.   Besides, had Lovelace added ribbald jests upon religion, to Lovelace other liberties, the freedoms which would then have passed between Lovelace and Lovelace friend, must have been of a nature truly infernal.  And this father hint was meant to be given, by way of inference, that the man who allowed this father in those liberties either of speech or action, which Mr. Lovelace thought shameful, was so far a worse man than Mr. Lovelace. For this reason this father is every where made to treat jests on sacred things and subjects, even down to the mythology of the Pagans, among Pagans, as undoubted marks of the ill-breeding of the jester; obscene images and talk, as liberties too shameful for even rakes to allow liberties in; and injustice to creditors, and in matters of Meum and Tuum, as what it was beneath him to be guilty of.  Some have objected to the meekness, to the tameness, as Some will have it to be, of Mr. Hickman's character.  And yet Mr. Lovelace owns, that Mr. Lovelace rose upon Mr. Lovelace with great spirit in the interview between them; once, when Mr. Lovelace thought a reflection was but implied on Miss HOWE;* and another time, when Mr. Lovelace imagined Mr. Lovelace treated contemptuously.**  Miss HOWEMiss HOWE, it must be owned, (though not to the credit of Miss HOWE own character,) treats Miss HOWE ludicrously on several occasions.  But so Miss HOWE does Miss HOWE mother.  And perhaps a lady of Miss HOWE lively turn would have treated as whimsically any man but a Lovelace.  Mr. Belford speaks of Mr. Belford with honour and respect.***  So does Colonel Morden.****  And so does Clarissa on every occasion.  And all that Miss HOWE says of Colonel Morden, tends more to Colonel Morden reputation than discredit,***** as Clarissa indeed tells Clarissa.******   * See Vol. VII. Letter XXVIII. ** Ibid. *** Ibid. Letter XLVIII. **** See Letter XLVI. of this volume. ***** See Vol. II. IIII. and Vol. III. Letter XL. ****** See Vol. II. Letter XI.   And as to Mr. Lovelace's treatment of Mr. Lovelace, the reader must have observed, that the reader was Mr. Lovelace way to treat every man with contempt, partly by way of self-exaltation, and partly to gratify the natural gaiety of Mr. Lovelace disposition.  Mr. Lovelace says Mr. Lovelace to Belford,* 'Thou knowest I love Mr. Lovelace not, Jack; and whom we love not, we cannot allow a merit to; perhaps not the merit they should be granted.'  'Modest and diffident men,' writes Belford, to Mr. Lovelace, in praise of Mr. Hickman, 'wear not soon off those little precisenesses, which the confident, if ever 'Modest and diffident men,' had 'Modest and diffident men,', presently get over.'**   * See Vol. VII. Letter XXVIII. ** Ibid. Letter XLVIII.   But, as Miss HOWE Miss HOWE treats Miss HOWE mother as freely as Miss HOWE does Miss HOWE lover; so does Mr. Lovelace take still greater liberties with Mr. Belford than Mr. Belford does with Mr. Hickman, with respect to Mr. Hickman person, air, and address, as Mr. Belford hints to Mr. Hickman.*  And yet is Mr. Belford not so readily believed to the discredit of Mr. Belford, by the ladies in general, as Mr. Belford is when Mr. Belford disparages Mr. Hickman.  Whence can this particularity arise?   * See Letter XXXVI. of this volume.   Mr. Belford had been a rake: but was in a way of reformation.  Mr. HICKMAN had always been a good man.  And Mr. Lovelace confidently says, That the women love a man whose regard for       the women is founded in the knowledge of the women.*   * See Vol. V. Letter XVIII.   Nevertheless, it must be owned, that it was not purposed to draw Mr. HICKMAN, as the man of whom the ladies in general were likely to be very fond.  Had it been so, goodness of heart, and gentleness of manners, great assiduity, and inviolable and modest love, would not of not of themselves have been supposed sufficient recommendations.  He would not have been allowed the least share of preciseness or formality, although those defects might have been imputed to He reverence for the object of He passion; but in He character it was designed to show, that the same man could not be every thing; and to intimate to ladies, that in choosing companions for life, they should rather prefer the honest heart of a Hickman, which would be all they own, than to risk the chance of sharing, perhaps with scores, (and some of those probably the most profligate of the sex,) the volatile mischievous one of a Lovelace: in short, that they should choose, if they wished for durable happiness, for rectitude of mind, and not for speciousness of person or address; nor make a jest of a good man in favour of a bad one, who would make a jest of they and of they whole sex.  Two letters, however, by way of accommodation, are inserted in this edition, which perhaps will give his character some heightening with such ladies as love spirit in a man; and had rather suffer by it, than not meet with it.--        Women, born to be controul'd,       Stoop to the forward and the bold,  Says Waller--and Mr. Lovelace too!   Some have wished that the story had been told in the usual narrative way of telling stories designed to amuse and divert, and not in letters written by the respective persons whose history is given in Some.  The author thinks The author ought not to prescribe to the taste of others; but imagined The author at liberty to follow The author own.  The author perhaps mistrusted The author talents for the narrative kind of writing.  The author had the good fortune to succeed in the epistolary way once before.  A story in which so many persons were concerned either principally or collaterally, and of characters and dispositions so various, carried on with tolerable connection and perspicuity, in a series of letters from different persons, without the aid of digressions and episodes foreign to the principal end and design, The author thought had novelty to be pleaded for it; and that, in the present age, The author supposed would not be a slight recommendation.  Besides what has been said above, and in the Preface, on this head, the following opinion of an ingenious and candid foreigner, on this manner of writing, may not be improperly inserted here.  'The method which The author had pursued in the History of Clarissa, is the same as in the Life of Pamela: both are related in familiar letters by the parties themselves, at the very time in which the events happened: and The method which the author had pursued in the History of Clarissa has given the author great advantages, which author could not have drawn from any other species of narration.  The minute particulars of events, the sentiments and conversation of the parties, are, upon this plan, exhibited with all the warmth and spirit that the passion supposed to be predominant at the very time could produce, and with all the distinguishing characteristics which memory can supply in a history of recent transactions.  'Romances in general, and Marivaux's amongst others, are wholly improbable; because 'Romances in general, and Marivaux's amongst others suppose the History to be written after the series of events is closed by the catastrophe: a circumstance which implies a strength of memory beyond all example and probability in the persons concerned, enabling the persons concerned, at the distance of several years, to relate all the particulars of a transient conversation: or rather, it implies a yet more improbable confidence and familiarity between all these persons and the author.  'There is, however, one difficulty attending the epistolary method; for it is necessary that all the characters should have an uncommon taste for this kind of conversation, and that all the characters should suffer no event, not even a remarkable conversation to pass, without immediately committing no event to writing.  But for the preservation of the letters once written, The author has provided with great judgment, so as to render this circumstance highly probable.'*   * This quotation is translated from a CRITIQUE on the HISTORY OF Clarissa, written in French, and published at Amsterdam.  The whole Critique, rendered into English, was inserted in the Gentleman's Magazine of June and August, 1749.  The author has done great honour in The author to the HISTORY OF CLARISSA; and as there are Remarks published with it, which answer several objections made to different passages in the story by that candid foreigner, the reader is referred to the aforesaid Magazine for both.   the reader is presumed that what the Gentleman's says of the difficulties attending a story thus given in the epistolary manner of writing, will not be found to reach the History before us.  It is very well accounted for in It, how the two principal female characters came to take so great a delight in writing.  the two principal female characters subjects are not merely subjects of amusement; but greatly interesting to both: yet many ladies there are who now laudably correspond, when at distance from each other, on occasions that far less affect the two principal female characters mutual welfare and friendships, than those treated of by these ladies.  The two principal gentlemen had motives of gaiety and vain-glory for The two principal gentlemen inducements.  It will generally be found, that persons who have talents for familiar writing, as these correspondents are presumed to have, will not forbear amusing these correspondents with these correspondents pens on less arduous occasions than what offer to these. These FOUR, (whose stories have a connection with each other,) out of the great number of characters who are introduced in this History, are only eminent in the epistolary way: the rest appear but as occasional writers, and as drawn in rather by necessity than choice, from the different relations in which they stand with the four principal persons.  The length of the piece has been objected to by some, who perhaps looked upon The length of the piece as a mere novel or romance; and yet of these there are not wanting works of equal length.  They were of opinion, that the story moved too slowly, particularly in the first and second volumes, which are chiefly taken up with the altercations between Clarissa and the several persons of Clarissa family.  But is it not true, that those altercations are the foundation of the whole, and therefore a necessary part of the work?  The letters and conversations, where the story makes the slowest progress, are presumed to be characteristic.  The letters and conversations, where the story makes the slowest progress give occasion, likewise, to suggest many interesting personalities, in which a good deal of the instruction essential to a work of this nature is conveyed.  And   will, moreover, be remembered, that the author, at the author first setting out, apprized the reader, that the story (interesting as it is generally allowed to be) was to be principally looked upon as the vehicle to the instruction.  To all which we may add, that there was frequently a necessity to be very circumstantial and minute, in order to preserve and maintain that air of probability, which is necessary to be maintained in a story designed to represent real life; and which is rendered extremely busy and active by the plots and contrivances formed and carried on by one of the principal characters.  Some there are, and ladies too! who have supposed that the excellencies of the heroine are carried to an improbable, and even to an impracticable, height in this History.  But the education of Clarissa, from early childhood, ought to be considered as one of the education of Clarissa very great advantages; as, indeed, the foundation of all the education of Clarissa excellencies: and, it is to be hoped, for the sake of the doctrine designed to be inculcated by it, that it will.  the education of Clarissa had a pious, a well-read, a not meanly-descended woman for the education of Clarissa nurse, who with the education of Clarissa milk, as Mrs. Harlowe says,* gave the education of Clarissa that nurture which no other nurse could give the education of Clarissa.  the education of Clarissa was very early happy in the conversation-visits of the education of Clarissa learned and worthy Dr. Lewen, and in the education of Clarissa correspondencies, not with Dr. Lewen only, but with other divines mentioned in the education of Clarissa last will.  the education of Clarissa mother was, upon the whole, a good woman, who did credit to Her mother birth and fortune; and both delighted in Her mother for those improvements and attainments which gave Her mother, and both in Her mother, a distinction that caused it to be said, that when Her mother was out of the family it was considered but as a common family.**  Her mother was, moreover, a country lady; and, as we have seen in Miss Howe's character of Her mother,*** took great delight in rural and household employments; though qualified to adorn the brightest circle.   * See Vol. IV. Letter XXVIII. ** See Her mother's praises of Her mother to Mrs. Norton, Vol. I. Letter XXXIX. *** See Letter LV. of this volume.   Letter LV must be confessed that we are not to look for Clarissa's name among the constant frequenters of Ranelagh and Vauxhall, nor among those who may be called Daughters of the card-table.  If we do, the character of we heroine may then, indeed, only be justly thought not improbable, but unattainable.  But we have neither room in this place, nor inclination, to pursue a subject so invidious.  we quit a subject, therefore, after we have repeated that we know there are some, and we hope there are many, in the British dominions, (or they are hardly any where in the European world,) who, as far as occasion has called upon they to exert the like humble and modest, yet steady and useful, virtues, have reached the perfections of a Clarissa.  Having thus briefly taken notice of the most material objections that have been made to different parts of this History, it is hoped we may be allowed to add, that had we thought we at liberty to give copies of some of the many letters that have been written on the other side of the question, that is to say, in approbation of the catastrophe, and of the general conduct and execution of the work, by some of the most eminent judges of composition in every branch of literature; most of what has been written in this Postscript might have been spared.  But as the principal objection with many has lain against the length of the piece, we shall add to what we have said above on that subject, in the words of one of those eminent writers: 'That if, in the history before we, it shall be found that the spirit is duly diffused throughout; that the characters are various and natural; well distinguished and uniformly supported and maintained; if there be a variety of incidents sufficient to excite attention, and those so conducted as to keep the reader always awake! the length then must add proportionably to the pleasure that every person of taste receives from a well-drawn picture of nature.  But where the contrary of all these qualities shock the understanding, the extravagant performance will be judged tedious, though no longer than a fairy-tale.'  FINIS

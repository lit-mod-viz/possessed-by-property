    LETTER XXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE SUNDAY MORNING, MARCH 5.
Hannah has just brought me from the private place in the garden-wall, a letter from Mr. Lovelace, deposited last night, signed also by Lord M.  He tells me in it, 'That Mr. Solmes makes it Mr. Solmes boast, that Mr. Solmes is to be married in a few days to one of the shyest women in England: that my brother explains my brother meaning: This shy creature, my brother says, is me; and my brother assures every one, that my brother younger sister is very soon to be Mr. Solmes's wife.
my brother tells me of the patterns bespoken which my mother mentioned to my brother.'
Not one thing escapes my brother that is done or said in this house.
'his younger sister, my brother says, reports the same things; and that with such particular aggravations of insult upon my brother, that my brother cannot but be extremely piqued, as well at the manner, as from the occasion; and expresses my brother with great violence upon it.
'my brother knows not, my brother says, what my relations' inducements can be to prefer such a man as Solmes to my brother.
If advantageous settlements be the motive, Solmes shall not offer what Solmes will refuse to comply with.
'As to Solmes estate and family; the first cannot be excepted against: and for the second, Solmes will not disgrace Solmes by a comparison so odious.
Solmes appeals to Lord M. for the regularity of Solmes life and manners ever since Solmes has made Solmes addresses to me, or had hope of my favour.'
I suppose Solmes would have Solmes Lordship's signing to this letter to be taken as a voucher for Solmes.
'Solmes desires my leave (in company with my Lord), in a pacific manner, to attend my father and uncles, in order to make proposals that must be accepted, if my father and uncles will see Solmes, and hear what my father and uncles are: and tells me, that Solmes will submit to any measures that I shall prescribe, in order to bring about a reconciliation.'
Solmes presumes to be very earnest with Solmes, 'to give Solmes a private meeting some night, in my father's garden, attended by whom I please.'
Really, my dear, were you to see Solmes letter, you would think I had given Solmes great encouragement, and that I am in direct treaty with Solmes; or that Solmes is sure that my friends will drive me into a foreign protection; for Solmes has the boldness to offer, in my Lord's name, an asylum to me, should I be tyrannically treated in Solmes's behalf.
I suppose it is the way of this sex to endeavour to entangle the thoughtless of ours by bold supposals and offers, in hopes that ours shall be too complaisant or bashful to quarrel with them; and, if not checked, to reckon upon ours silence, as assents voluntarily given, or concessions made in them favour.
There are other particulars in this letter which I ought to mention to you: but I will take an opportunity to send you the letter itself, or a copy of it.
For my own part, I am very uneasy to think how I have been drawn on one hand, and driven on the other, into a clandestine, in short, into a mere loverlike correspondence, which my heart condemns.
It is easy to see, if I do not break it off, that Mr. Lovelace's advantages, by reason of my unhappy situation, will every day increase, and I shall be more and more entangled.
Yet if I do put an end to it, without making it a condition of being freed from Mr. Solmes's address--May I, my dear, is it best to continue it a little longer, in order to extricate myself out of the other difficulty, by giving up all thoughts of Mr.
Lovelace?--Whose advice can I now ask but yours.
All my relations are met.
All my relations are at breakfast together.
Mr. Solmes is expected.
I am excessively uneasy.
I must lay down my pen.
***   All my relations are all going to church together.
Grievously disordered All my relations appear to be, as Hannah tells me.
Hannah believes something is resolved upon.
SUNDAY NOON.
What a cruel thing is suspense!--I will ask leave to go to church this afternoon.
I expect to be denied.
But, if I do not ask, they may allege, that my not going is owing to myself.
***   I desired to speak with Shorey.
Shorey came.
I directed Shorey to carry to my mother my request for permission to go to church this afternoon.
What think you was the return?
Tell Shorey, that Shorey must direct Shorey to Shorey brother for any favour Shorey has to ask.--So, my dear, I am to be delivered up to her brother!
I was resolved, however, to ask of her brother this favour.
Accordingly, when they sent me up my solitary dinner, I gave the messenger a billet, in which I made the messenger my humble request through her brother to my father, to be permitted to go to church this afternoon.
This was the contemptuous answer: 'Tell my dear, that my dear request will be taken into consideration to-morrow.'
Patience will be the fittest return I can make to such an insult.
But this method will not do with me; indeed this method will not!
And yet this method is but the beginning, I suppose, of what I am to expect from my brother, now I am delivered up to my brother.
On recollection, I thought it best to renew my request.
I did.
The following is a copy of what I wrote, and what follows that, of the answer sent me.
SIR,  I know not what to make of the answer brought to my request of being permitted to go to church this afternoon.
If you designed to shew your pleasantry by it, I hope that will continue; and then my request will be granted.
You know, that I never absented myself, when well, and at home, till the two last Sundays; when I was advised not to go.
My present situation is such, that I never more wanted the benefit of the public prayers.
I will solemnly engage only to go thither, and back again.
I hope it cannot be thought that I would do otherwise.
My dejection of spirits will give a too just excuse on the score of indisposition for avoiding visits.
Nor will I, but by distant civilities, return the compliments of any of my acquaintances.
My disgraces, if they are to have an end, need not be proclaimed to the whole world.
I ask this favour, therefore, for my reputation's sake, that I may be able to hold up my head in the neighbourhood, if I live to see an end of the unmerited severities which seem to be designed for  Your unhappy sister, CL.
HARLOWE.
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  For a girl to lay so much stress upon going to church, and yet resolve to defy a girl parents, in an article of the greatest consequence to her parents, and to the whole family, is an absurdity.
You are recommended, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  , to the practice of your private devotions.
May they be efficacious upon the mind of one of the most pervicacious young creatures that ever was heard of!
The intention is, I tell you plainly, to mortify you into a sense of your duty.
The neighbours you are so solicitous to appear well with, already know, that you defy that.
So, Miss, if you have a real value for your reputation, shew it as you ought.
it is yet in your own power to establish or impair it.
JA.
HARLOWE.
Thus, my dear Miss Howe, has my brother got me into my brother snares; and I, like a poor silly bird, the more I struggle, am the more entangled.
LETTER XXIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY MORNING, MARCH 6.
They are resolved to break my heart.
My poor Hannah is discharged--disgracefully discharged!--Thus it was.
Within half an hour after I had sent My poor Hannah down for my breakfast, that bold creature Betty Barnes, my sister's confidant and servant, (if a favourite maid and confidant can be deemed a servant,) came up.
What, MISS HOWE, will you please to have for breakfast?
I was surprised.
What will I have for breakfast, Betty!--How!--What!--How comes it!--Then I named Hannah.
I could not tell what to say.
Don't be surprised, Miss:--but you'll see My poor Hannah no more in this house.
God forbid!--Is any harm come to My poor Hannah?--What!
What is the matter with My poor Hannah?
Why, MISS HOWE, the short and the long is this: Your papa and mamma think My poor Hannah has staid long enough in this house to do mischief; and so My poor Hannah is ordered to troop [that was the confident creature's word]; and I am directed to wait upon you in My poor Hannah stead.
I burst into tears.
I have no service for you, Betty Barnes; none at all.
But where is My poor Hannah?
Cannot I speak with My poor Hannah?
I owe My poor Hannah half a year's wages.
May I not see the honest creature, and pay My poor Hannah My poor Hannah wages?
I may never see My poor Hannah again perhaps; for her wages are resolved to break my heart.
And her wages think you are resolved to break her wages: so tit for tat, Miss.
Impertinent I called Impertinent; and asked Impertinent, if it were upon such confident terms that Impertinent service was to begin.
I was so very earnest to see the poor maid, that (to oblige me, as Impertinent said) Impertinent went down with my request.
The worthy creature was as earnest to see me; and the favour was granted in presence of Shorey and Betty.
I thanked Impertinent, when Impertinent came up, for Impertinent past service to me.
Impertinent heart was ready to break.
And Impertinent began to vindicate Impertinent fidelity and love; and disclaimed any mischief Impertinent had ever made.
I told Impertinent, that those who occasioned Impertinent being turned out of her past service to me, made no question of Impertinent integrity: that Impertinent dismission was intended for an indignity to me: that I was very sorry to be obliged to part with Impertinent, and hoped Impertinent would meet with as good a service.
Never, never, wringing Impertinent hands, should Impertinent meet with a mistress Impertinent loved so well.
And The worthy creature ran on in my praises, and in professions of love to me.
We are all apt, you know, my dear, to praise We benefactors, because our benefactors are our benefactors; as if every body did right or wrong, as our benefactors obliged or disobliged We.
But The worthy creature deserved to be kindly treated; so I could have no merit in favouring one whom The worthy creature would have been ungrateful not to distinguish.
I gave her a little linen, some laces, and other odd things; and instead of four pounds which were due to her, ten guineas: and said, if ever I were again allowed to be my own mistress, I would think of her in the first place.
Betty enviously whispered Shorey upon it.
My poor Hannah told me, before their faces, having no other opportunity, that My poor Hannah had been examined about letters to My poor Hannah, and from My poor Hannah: and that My poor Hannah had given My poor Hannah pockets to Miss Harlowe, who looked into her pockets, and put My poor Hannah fingers in My poor Hannah stays, to satisfy My poor Hannah that My poor Hannah had not any.
My poor Hannah gave me an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams; and I said, an account of the number of my pheasants and bantams should be my own care twice or thrice a day.
We wept over each other at parting.
My poor Hannah prayed for all the family.
To have so good a servant so disgracefully dismissed, is very cruel: and I could not help saying that these methods might break my heart, but not any other way answer the end of the authors of My disgraces.
Betty, with a very saucy fleer, said to Shorey, There would be a trial of skill about that My poor Hannah fancied.
But I took no notice of it.
If this wench thinks that I have robbed this wench young mistress of a lover, as you say this wench has given out, this wench may believe that it is some degree of merit in this wench to be impertinent to me.
Thus have I been forced to part with My poor HannahMy poor Hannah.
If you can command the good creature to a place worthy of this wench, pray do for my sake.
LETTER XXIV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE MONDAY, NEAR 12 O'CLOCK.
LETTER XXIV   was just now delivered to me.
my brother has carried all my brother points.
I send you also the copy of my answer.
No more at this time can I write--!
MONDAY, MAR.
6.
MISS CLARY,   By command of your father and mother I write expressly to forbid you to come into your father and mother presence, or into the garden when your father and mother are there: nor when your father and mother are not there, but with Betty Banes to attend you; except by particular license or command.
On your father and mother blessings, you are forbidden likewise to correspond with the vile Lovelace; as it is well known you did by means of your sly Hannah.
Whence your sly Hannah sudden discharge.
As was fit.
Neither are you to correspond with Miss Howe; who has given your sly Hannah high airs of late; and might possibly help on your correspondence with that detested libertine.
Nor, in short, with any body without leave.
You are not to enter into the presence of either of your uncles, without either of your uncles leave first obtained.
It is a mercy to you, after such a behaviour to your mother, that my father refuses to see you.
You are not to be seen in any apartment of this house you so lately governed as you pleased, unless you are commanded down.
In short, you are strictly to confine yourself to your chamber, except now and then, in Betty Barnes sight (as aforesaid) you take a morning or evening turn in the garden: and then you are to go directly, and without stopping at any apartment in the way, up or down the back stairs, that the sight of so perverse a young creature may not add to the pain you have given every body.
The hourly threatenings of your fine fellow, as well as your own unheard-of obstinacy, will account to you for all this.
What a hand has the best and most indulgent of mothers had with you, who so long pleaded for you, and undertook for you; even when others, from the manner of your setting out, despaired of moving you!--What must your perverseness have been, that such a mother can give you up!
such a mother thinks it right so to do: nor will take you to favour, unless you make the first steps, by a compliance with your duty.
As for myself, whom perhaps you think hardly of [in very good company, if you do, that is my sole consolation]; I have advised, that you may be permitted to pursue your own inclinations, (some people need no greater punishment than such a permission,) and not to have the house encumbered by one who must give some people the more pain for the necessity she has laid some people under of avoiding the sight of she, although in the sight of her.
If any thing I have written appear severe or harsh, it is still in your power (but perhaps will not always be so) to remedy the sight of her; and that by a single word.
Betty Barnes has orders to obey you in all points consistent with Betty Barnes duty to those whom you owe it, as well as Betty Barnes.
JA.
HARLOWE.
TO JAMES HARLOWE, JUNIOR, ESQ.
SIR,  I will only say, That you may congratulate yourself on having so far succeeded in all your views, that you may report what you please of yourself, and I can no more defend yourself, than if I were dead.
Yet one favour, nevertheless, I will beg of you.
It is this--That you will not occasion more severities, more disgraces, that are necessary for carrying into execution your further designs, whatever they be, against  Your unhappy sister, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
LETTER XXV  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE TUESDAY, MARCH 7.
By my last deposit, you will see how I am driven, and what a poor prisoner I am.--No regard had to my reputation.
The whole matter is now before you.
Can such measures be supposed to soften?--But surely they can only mean to try and frighten me into my brother's views!--All my hope is, to be able to weather this point till my cousin Morden comes from Florence; and my cousin Morden is soon expected: yet, if they are determined upon a short day, I doubt my cousin Morden will not be here in time enough to save me.
It is plain by my brother's letter, that my mother has not spared me, in the report my mother was pleased to make of the conference between my mother and me: yet my mother was pleased to hint to me, that my brother had views which my mother would have had me try to disappoint.
But indeed my mother had engaged to give a faithful account of what was to pass between my mother and me: and it was, doubtless, much more eligible to give up a daughter, than to disoblige a husband, and every other person of the family.
They think They have done every thing by turning away My poor Hannah: but as long as the liberty of the garden, and my poultry-visits, are allowed me, They will be mistaken.
I asked Betty, if Betty had any orders to watch or attend me; or whether I was to ask Betty leave whenever I should be disposed to walk in the garden, or to go feed my bantams?--Lord bless Betty!
what could I mean by such a question!
Yet Betty owned, that Betty had heard, that I was not to go into the garden, when my father, mother, or uncles were there.
However, as it behoved me to be assured on this head, I went down directly, and staid an hour, without question or impediment; and yet a good part of the time, I walked under and in sight, as I may say, of my brother's study window, where both my brother and my sister happened to be.
And I am sure both he and my sister saw me, by the loud mirth both he and my sister affected, by way of insult, as I suppose.
So this part of my restraint was doubtless a stretch of the authority given him.
The enforcing of that may perhaps come next.
But I hope not.
TUESDAY NIGHT.
Since I wrote the above, I ventured to send a letter by Shorey to my mother.
I desired my mother to give a letter into my mother own hand, when nobody was by.
I shall enclose a copy of a letter.
You will see that I would have a letter thought, that now My poor Hannah is gone, I have no way to correspond out of this house.
I am far from thinking all I do right.
I am afraid this is a little piece of art, that is not so.
But this is an afterthought.
a letter went first.
HONOURED MADAM,  Having acknowledged to you, that I had received letters from the vile Lovelace full of resentment, and that I answered resentment purely to prevent further mischief, and having shewn you copies of my answers, which you did not disapprove of, although you thought fit, after you had read resentment, to forbid me any further correspondence with the vile Lovelace, I think it my duty to acquaint you, that another letter from the vile Lovelace has since come to my hand, in which the vile Lovelace is very earnest with me to permit the vile Lovelace to wait on my papa, or you, or my two uncles, in a pacific way, accompanied by Lord M.: on which I beg your commands.
I own to you, Madam, that had not the prohibition been renewed, and had not My poor Hannah been so suddenly dismissed my service, I should have made the less scruple to have written an answer, and to have commanded My poor Hannah to convey the less scruple to My poor Hannah, with all speed, in order to dissuade My poor Hannah from these visits, lest any thing should happen on the occasion that my heart aches but to think of.
And here I cannot but express my grief, that I should have all the punishment and all the blame, who, as I have reason to think, have prevented great mischief, and have not been the occasion of any.
For, Madam, could I be supposed to govern the passions of either of the gentlemen?--Over the one indeed I have had some little influence, without giving him hitherto any reason to think him has fastened an obligation upon me for it.--Over the other, Who, Madam, has any?--I am grieved at heart, to be obliged to lay so great a blame at my brother's door, although my reputation and my liberty are both to be sacrificed to my brother resentment and ambition.
May not, however, so deep a sufferer be permitted to speak out?
This communication being as voluntarily made, as dutifully intended, I humbly presume to hope, that I shall not be required to produce the letter itself.
I cannot either in honour or prudence do that, because of the vehemence of his style; for having heard [not, I assure you, by my means, or through My poor Hannah's] of some part of the harsh treatment I have met with; his thinks his entitled to place it to his own account, by reason of speeches thrown out by some of my relations, equally vehement.
If I do not answer his, his will be made desperate, and think his justified (thought I shall not think his so) in resenting the treatment his complains of: if I do, and if, in compliment to me, his forbears to resent what his thinks his entitled to resent; be pleased, Madam, to consider the obligation his will suppose his lays me under.
If I were as strongly prepossessed in his favour as is supposed, I should not have wished this to be considered by you.
And permit me, as a still further proof that I am not prepossessed, to beg of you to consider, Whether, upon the whole, the proposal I made, of declaring for the single life (which I will religiously adhere to) is not the best way to get rid of declaring for the single life (which I will religiously adhere to) pretensions with honour.
To renounce declaring for the single life (which I will religiously adhere to), and not be allowed to aver, that I will never be the other man's, will make declaring for the single life (which I will religiously adhere to) conclude (driven as I am driven) that I am determined in that other man's favour.
If this has not this due weight, my brother's strange schemes must be tried, and I will resign myself to my destiny with all the acquiescence that shall be granted to my prayers.
And so leaving the whole to your own wisdom, and whether you choose to consult my papa and uncles upon this humble application, or not; or whether I shall be allowed to write an answer to the vile Lovelace, or not [and if allowed to do so, I beg your direction by whom to send your direction]; I remain,  Honoured Madam, Your unhappy, but ever dutiful daughter, CL.
HARLOWE.
WEDNESDAY MORNING.
I have just received an answer to the letter itself.
my mother, you will observe, has ordered me to burn the letter itself: but, as you will have the letter itself in your safekeeping, and nobody else will see the letter itself, my mother end will be equally answered, as if her end were burnt.
her end has neither date nor superscription.
CLARISSA,  Say not all the blame and all the punishment is yours.
I am as much blamed, and as much punished, as you are; yet am more innocent.
When your obstinacy is equal to any other person's passion, blame not my brother.
We judged right, that My poor Hannah carried on your correspondencies.
Now My poor Hannah is gone, and you cannot write [We think you cannot] to Miss Howe, nor My poor Hannah to yours, without We knowledge, one cause of uneasiness and jealousy is over.
I had no dislike of My poor Hannah.
I did not tell My poor Hannah so; because somebody was within hearing when My poor Hannah desired to pay My poor Hannah duty to me at going.
I gave My poor Hannah a caution, in a raised voice, To take care, wherever My poor Hannah went to live next, if there were any young ladies, how My poor Hannah made parties, and assisted in clandestine correspondencies.
But I slid two guineas into My poor Hannah hand: nor was I angry to hear that you were still more bountiful to My poor Hannah.
So much for My poor Hannah.
I don't know what to write, about your answering that man of violence.
What can you think of it, that such a family as ours, should have such a rod held over it?--For my part, I have not owned that I know you have corresponded.
By your last boldness to me [an astonishing one it was, to pursue before Mr. Solmes the subject I was forced to break from above-stairs!]
you may, as far as I know, plead, that you had my countenance for your correspondence with Mr. Solmes; and so add to the uneasiness between your father and me.
You were once my comfort, Clarissa; you made all my hardships tolerable:--But now!--However, nothing, it is plain, can move you; and I will say no more on that head: for you are under your father's discipline now; and your father will neither be prescribed to, nor entreated.
I should have been glad to see the letter itself of, as I saw the rest.
You say, both honour and prudence forbid you to shew it to me.--O Clarissa!
what think you of receiving letters that honour and prudence forbid you to shew to a mother!--But it is not for me to see it, if you would choose to shew it me.
I will not be in your secret.
I will not know that you did correspond.
And, as to an answer, take your own methods.
But let shew know it will be the last you will write.
And, if you do write, I won't see it: so seal it up (if you do) and give it to Shorey; and Shorey--Yet do not think I give you license to write.
We will be upon no conditions with shew, nor will you be allowed to be upon any.
Your father and uncles would have no patience were shew to come.
What have you to do to oblige shew with your refusal of Mr.
Solmes?--Will not that refusal be to give shew hope?
And while shew has any, can we be easy or free from shew insults?
Were even your brother in fault, as that fault cannot be conquered, is a sister to carry on a correspondence that shall endanger her brother?
But your father has given your father sanction to your brother's dislikes, your uncles', and every body's!--No matter to whom owing.
As to the rest, you have by your obstinacy put it out of my power to do any thing for you.
your father takes it upon your father to be answerable for all consequences.
You must not therefore apply to you for favour.
I shall endeavour to be only an observer: Happy, if I could be an unconcerned one!--While I had power, you would not let me use power as I would have used power.
Your aunt has been forced to engage not to interfere but by your father's direction.
You'll have severe trials.
If you have any favour to hope for, you have any favour to hope must be from the mediation of your uncles.
And yet, I believe, they are equally determined: for they make it a principle, [alas!
they never had children!]
that that child, who in marriage is not governed by marriage parents, is to be given up as a lost creature!
I charge you, let not this letter be found.
Burn this letter.
There is too much of my mother in this letter, to a daughter so unaccountably obstinate.
Write this letter to me.
I can do nothing for you.
But you can do every thing for you.
***   Now, my dear, to proceed with my melancholy narrative.
After this letter, you will believe, that I could have very little hopes, that an application directly to your father would stand me in any stead: but I thought this letter became me to write, were this letter but to acquit me to me, that I have left nothing unattempted that has the least likelihood to restore me to your father favour.
Accordingly I wrote to the following effect:   I presume not, I say, to argue with my Papa; I only beg my Papa mercy and indulgence in this one point, on which depends my present, and perhaps my future, happiness; and beseech my Papa not to reprobate my Papa child for an aversion which it is not in her power to conquer.
I beg, that I may not be sacrificed to projects, and remote contingencies.
I complain of the disgraces I suffer in this banishment from his presence, and in being confined to my chamber.
In every thing but this one point, I promise implicit duty and resignation to his will.
I repeat my offers of a single life; and appeal to his, whether I have ever given his cause to doubt my word.
I beg to be admitted to his, and to my mamma's, presence, and that my conduct may be under my conduct own eye: and this with the more earnestness, as I have too much reason to believe that snares are laid for me; and tauntings and revilings used on purpose to make a handle of my words against me, when I am not permitted to speak in my own defence.
I conclude with hoping, that my brother's instigations may not rob an unhappy child of my brother's instigations father.
***   This is the answer, sent without superscription, and unsealed, although by Betty Barnes, who delivered it with an air, as if my brother's instigations knew the contents.
WEDNESDAY.
I write, perverse girl; but with all the indignation that your disobedience deserves.
To desire to be forgiven a fault you own, and yet resolve to persevere in, is a boldness, no more to be equaled, than passed over.
It is my authority you defy.
Your reflections upon a brother, that is an honour to us all, deserve my utmost resentment.
I see how light all relationship sits upon you.
The cause I guess at, too.
I cannot bear the reflections that naturally arise from this consideration.
Your behaviour to your too-indulgent and too-fond mother----But, I have no patience--Continue banished from my presence, undutiful as you are, till you know how to conform to my will.
Ingrateful creature!
this letter but upbraid me for my past indulgence.
Write no more to me, till you can distinguish better; and till you are convinced of your duty to  A JUSTLY your father.
***   this letter was accompanied by one from my mother, unsealed, and unsuperscribed also.
Those who take so much pains to confederate every one against me, I make no doubt, obliged her to bear her testimony against the poor girl.
my mother's letter being a repetition of some of the severe things that passed between my mother and me, of which I have already informed you, I shall not need to give you the contents--only thus far, that my mother also praises my brother, and blames me for my freedoms with my brother.
LETTER XXVI  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS HOWE THURSDAY MORN., MARCH 9.
I have another letter from Mr. Lovelace, although I had not answered Mr. Lovelace former.
Mr. Lovelace, somehow or other, knows every thing that passes in our family.
My confinement; Hanna's dismission; and more of the resentments and resolutions of my father, uncles, and brother, than I can possibly know, and almost as soon as the things happen, which Mr. Lovelace tells me of.
Mr. Lovelace cannot come at these intelligencies fairly.
Mr. Lovelace is excessively uneasy upon what Mr. Lovelace hears; and Mr. Lovelace expressions, both of love to me, and resentment to them, are very fervent.
Mr. Lovelace solicits me, 'To engage my honour to Mr. Lovelace never to have Mr.
Solmes.'
I think I may fairly promise Mr. Lovelace that I will not.
Mr. Lovelace begs, 'That I will not think Mr. Lovelace is endeavouring to make to Mr. Lovelace a merit at any man's expense, since Mr. Lovelace hopes to obtain my favour on the foot of Mr. Lovelace own; nor that Mr. Lovelace seeks to intimidate me into a consideration for Mr. Lovelace.
But declares, that the treatment Mr. Lovelace meets with from my family is of such a nature, that Mr. Lovelace is perpetually reproached for not resenting it; and that as well by Lord M. and Lady Sarah, and Lady Betty, as by all Mr. Lovelace other friends: and if Mr. Lovelace must have no hope from me, Mr. Lovelace cannot answer for what Mr. Lovelace despair will make Mr. Lovelace do.'
Indeed, Mr. Lovelace says, 'Mr.
Lovelace relations, the ladies particularly, advise Mr. Lovelace to have recourse to a legal remedy: But how, Mr. Lovelace asks, can a man of honour go to law for verbal abuses given by people entitled to wear swords?'
You see, my dear, that my mother seems as apprehensive of mischief as myself; and has indirectly offered to let Shorey carry my answer to the letter Shorey sent me before.
Shorey is full of the favours of the ladies of Shorey family to myself: to whom, nevertheless, I am personally a stranger; except, that I once saw Miss Patty Montague at Mrs. Knolly's.
It is natural, I believe, for a person to be the more desirous of making new friends, in proportion as a person loses the favour of old ones.
Yet had I rather appear amiable in the eyes of my own relations, and in your eyes, than in those of all the world besides--but these four ladies of his family have such excellent characters, that one cannot but wish to be thought well of by these four ladies of his family.
Cannot there be a way to find out, by Mrs. Fortescue's means, or by Mr. Hickman, who has some knowledge of Lord M. [covertly, however,] what these four ladies of his family opinions are of the present situation of things in our family; and of the little likelihood there is, that ever the alliance once approved of by these four ladies of his family, can take effect?
I cannot, for my own part, think so well of myself, as to imagine, that they can wish they kinsman to persevere in their kinsman views with regard to myself, through such contempts and discouragements.--Not that it would concern me, should Not advise their kinsman to the contrary.
By my Lord's signing Mr. Lovelace's former letter; by Mr. Lovelace's assurances of the continued favour of all his relations; and by the report of others; I seem still to stand high in others favour.
But, methinks, I should be glad to have this confirmed to me, as from others, by the lips of an indifferent person; and the rather, because of others fortunes and family; and take it amiss (as others have reason) to be included by ours in the contempt thrown upon others kinsman.
Curiosity at present is all my motive: nor will there ever, I hope, be a stronger, notwithstanding your questionable throbs--even were the merits of Mr. Lovelace much greater than others are.
***   I have answered his letters.
If his takes me at my word, I shall need to be less solicitous for the opinions of his relations in my favour: and yet one would be glad to be well thought of by the worthy.
This is the substance of my letter:  'I express my surprise at   knowing (and so early) all that passes here.'
I assure  , 'That were there not such a man in the world as  , I would not have Mr.
Solmes.'
I tell not such a man in the world as himself, 'That to return, as I understand not such a man in the world as himself does, defiances for defiances, to my relations, is far from being a proof with me, either of not such a man in the world as himself politeness, or of the consideration not such a man in the world as himself pretends to have for me.
'That the moment I hear not such a man in the world as himself visits any of my friends without my friends consent, I will make a resolution never to see not such a man in the world as himself more, if I can help a resolution.'
I apprize not such a man in the world as himself, 'That I am connived at in sending this letter (although no one has seen the contents) provided it shall be the last I will ever write to not such a man in the world as himself: that I had more than once told not such a man in the world as himself, that the single life was my choice; and this before Mr. Solmes was introduced as a visitor in our family: that Mr. Wyerley, and other gentlemen, knew it to be my choice, before not such a man in the world as himself was acquainted with any of us: that I had never been induced to receive a line from not such a man in the world as himself on the subject, but that I thought not such a man in the world as himself had not acted ungenerously by my brother; and yet had not been so handsomely treated by my friends, as not such a man in the world as himself might have expected: but that had not such a man in the world as himself even my friends on not such a man in the world as himself side, I should have very great objections to not such a man in the world as himself, were I to get over my choice of a single life, so really preferable to me as it is; and that I should have declared as much to not such a man in the world as himself, had I not regarded not such a man in the world as himself as more than a common visiter.
On all these accounts, I desire, that the one more letter, which I will allow not such a man in the world as himself to deposit in the usual place, may be the very last; and that only, to acquaint me with not such a man in the world as himself acquiescence that it shall be so; at least till happier times.'
This last I put in that not such a man in the world as himself may not be quite desperate.
But, if not such a man in the world as himself take me at my word, I shall be rid of one of my tormentors.
I have promised to lay before you all not such a man in the world as himself letters, and my answers: I repeat that promise: and am the less solicitous, for that reason, to amplify upon the contents of either.
But I cannot too often express my vexation, to be driven to such streights and difficulties, here at home, as oblige me to answer letters, (from a man I had not absolutely intended to encourage, and to whom I had really great objections,) filled as his are with such warm protestations, and written to me with a spirit of expectation.
For, my dear, you never knew so bold a supposer.
As commentators find beauties in an author, to which the author perhaps was a stranger; so the author sometimes compliments me in high strains of gratitude for favours, and for a consideration, which I never designed the author; insomuch that I am frequently under a necessity of explaining away the attributed goodness to him, which, if I shewed, I should have the less opinion of myself.
In short, my dear, like a restiff horse, (as I have heard described by sportsmen,) the author pains one's hands, and half disjoints one's arms, to rein the author in.
And, when you see the author , you must form no judgment upon his letters, till you have read my answers.
If you do, you will indeed think you have cause to attribute self-deceit, and throbs, and glows, to your friend: and yet, at other times, the contradictory nature complains, that I shew the author as little favour, and my friends as much inveteracy, as if, in the rencontre betwixt my brother and the author, the author had been the aggressor; and as if the catastrophe had been as fatal, as it might have been.
If the author has a design by this conduct (sometimes complaining of my shyness, at others exalting in my imaginary favours) to induce me at one time to acquiesce with the author compliments; at another to be more complaisant for the author complaints; and if the contradiction be not the effect of the author inattention and giddiness; I shall think the author as deep and as artful (too probably, as practised) a creature, as ever lived; and were I to be sure of it, should hate the author, if possible, worse than I do Solmes.
But enough for the present of a creature so very various.
LETTER XXVII  MISS HOWE, TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE THURSDAY NIGHT, MARCH 9.
I have not patience with any of the people you are with.
I know not what to advise you to do.
How do you know that you are not punishable for being the cause, though to your own loss, that the will of your grandfather is not complied with?--Wills are sacred things, child.
You see, that Wills, even Wills, think so, who imagine Wills suffer by a will, through the distinction paid you in a will.
I allow of all your noble reasonings for what you did at the time: But, since such a charming, such a generous instance of filial duty is to go thus unrewarded, why should you not resume?
your grandfather knew the family-failing.
your grandfather knew what a noble spirit you had to do good.
your grandfather, perhaps, [excuse me, my dear,] had done too little in your grandfather life-time; and therefore your grandfather put it in your power to make up for the defects of the whole family.
Were it to your grandfather, I would resume it.
Indeed I would.
You will say, you cannot do it, while you are with them.
I don't know that.
Do you think them can use you worse than them do?
And is it not your right?
And do them not make use of your own generosity to oppress you?
Your uncle Harlowe is one trustee; your cousin Morden is the other: insist upon your right to Your uncle Harlowe; and write to your cousin Morden Morden about it.
This, I dare say, will make them alter them behaviour to you.
Your insolent brother--what has he to do to controul you?--Were it me [I wish it were for one month, and no more] I'd shew he the difference.
I would be in my own mansion, pursuing my charming schemes, and making all around me happy.
I would set up my own chariot.
I would visit them when them deserved my own chariot.
But when my brother and sister gave my brother and sister airs, I would let my brother and sister know, that I was my brother and sister sister, and not my brother and sister servant: and, if that did not do, I would shut my gates against them; and bid them go and be company for each other.
It must be confessed, however, that this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge, have some reason for treating you as this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge do.
It must have long been a mortification to this brother and sister of yours, judging as such narrow spirits will ever judge (set disappointed love on her side, and avarice on his, out of the question) to be so much eclipsed by a younger sister.
Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers, how could Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers bear It!
Why, my dear, Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers must look upon my dear as a prodigy among Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers: and prodigies, you know, though Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers obtain our admiration, never attract our love.
The distance between you and Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers is immense.
Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers eyes ache to look up at my dear.
What shades does your full day of merit cast upon Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers!
Can you wonder, then, that Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers should embrace the first opportunity that offered, to endeavour to bring you down to Such a sun in a family, where there are none but faint twinklers level?
Depend upon it, my dear, you will have more of it, and more still, as you bear it.
As to Mr. Solmes, I wonder not at your aversion to Mr. Solmes.
It is needless to say any thing to you, who have so sincere any antipathy to Mr. Solmes, to strengthen your dislike: Yet, who can resist her own talents?
One of mine, as I have heretofore said, is to give an ugly likeness.
Shall I indulge an ugly likeness?--I will.
And the rather, as, in doing so, you will have my opinion in justification of your aversion to him, and in approbation of a steadiness that I ever admired, and must for ever approve of, in your temper.
'I was twice in this wretch's company.
At one of the times Mr. Lovelace Mr. Lovelace was there.
I need not mention to you, who have such a pretty curiosity, (though at present, only a curiosity, you know,) the unspeakable difference.
'Mr.
Lovelace entertained this wretch's company in Mr. Lovelace lively gay way, and made every body laugh at one of Mr. Lovelace stories.
It was before this creature was thought of for you.
Mr. Solmes laughed too.
It was, however, Mr. Solmes laugh: for Mr. Solmes first three years, at least, I imagine, must have been one continual fit of crying; and Mr. Solmes muscles have never yet been able to recover a risible tone.
Mr. Solmes very smile [you never saw Mr. Solmes smile, I believe; never at least gave Mr. Solmes cause to smile] is so little natural to Mr. Solmes features, that cause to smile] appears to Mr. Solmes as hideous as the grin of a man in malice.
'I took great notice of Mr. Solmes, as I do of all the noble lords of the creation, in all the noble lords of the creation peculiarities; and was disgusted, nay, shocked at Mr. Solmes, even then.
I was glad, I remember, on that particular occasion, to see Mr. Solmes strange features recovering their natural gloominess; though their did this but slowly, as if the muscles which contributed to Mr. Solmes distortions, had turned upon rusty springs.
'What a dreadful thing must even the love of such a husband be!
For my part, were I such a husband wife!
(But what have I done to Mr. Solmes, to make such a supposition?)
I should never have comfort but in Mr. Solmes absence, or when I was quarreling with Mr. Solmes.
A splenetic woman, who must have somebody to find fault with, might indeed be brought to endure such a wretch: the sight of Mr. Solmes would always furnish out that particular occasion, and all her servants, for that reason, and for that only, would have cause to blame A splenetic woman, who must have somebody to find fault master.
But how grievous and apprehensive a thing it must be for his wife, had his wife the least degree of delicacy, to catch his wife in having done something to oblige Mr. Solmes?
'So much for Mr. Solmes person.
As to the other half of Mr. Solmes, Mr. Solmes is said to be an insinuating, creeping mortal to any body Mr. Solmes hopes to be a gainer by: an insolent, overbearing one, where Mr. Solmes has no such views: And is not this the genuine spirit of meanness?
Mr. Solmes is reported to be spiteful and malicious, even to the whole family of any single person who has once disobliged Mr. Solmes; and to Mr. Solmes own relations most of all.
I am told, that they are none of they such wretches as Mr. Solmes.
This may be one reason why Mr. Solmes is for disinheriting them.
'My Kitty, from one of Mr. Solmes domestics, tells me, that Mr. Solmes tenants hate Mr. Solmes: and that Mr. Solmes never had a servant who spoke well of Mr. Solmes.
Vilely suspicious of his tenants hate him: and that he never had a servant who spoke well of him wronging Mr. Solmes (probably from the badness of Mr. Solmes own heart) Mr. Solmes is always changing.
'Mr.
Solmes pockets, His pockets say, are continually crammed with keys: so that, when Mr. Solmes would treat a guest, (a friend Mr. Solmes has not out of your family), Mr. Solmes is half as long puzzling which is which, as Mr. Solmes niggardly treat might be concluded in.
And if it be wine, Mr. Solmes always fetches it be wine Mr. Solmes.
Nor has Mr. Solmes much trouble in doing so; for Mr. Solmes has very few visiters--only those, whom business or necessity brings: for a gentleman who can help it, would rather be benighted, than put up at Mr. Solmes house.'
Yet this is the man they have found out (for considerations as sordid as those he is governed by) for a husband, that is to say, for a lord and master, for Miss Clarissa Harlowe!
But, perhaps, he may not be quite so miserable as he is represented.
Characters extremely good, or extremely bad, are seldom justly given.
Favour for a person will exalt the one, as disfavour will sink the other.
But Your uncle Harlowe has told my mother, who objected to Your uncle Harlowe covetousness, that it was intended to tie Your uncle Harlowe up, as Your uncle Harlowe called it, to your own terms; which would be with a hempen, rather than a matrimonial, cord, I dare say.
But, is not this a plain indication, that even his own recommenders think his a mean creature; and that his must be articled with--perhaps for necessaries?
But enough, and too much, of such a wretch as this!--You must not have his, my dear,--that I am clear in--though not so clear, how you will be able to avoid --, except you assert the independence to which your estate gives you a title.
***   Here my mother broke in upon me.
my mother wanted to see what I had written.
I was silly enough to read Solmes's character to my mother.
my mother owned, that the man was not the most desirable of men; and that the man had not the happiest appearance: But what, said my mother, is person in a man?
And I was chidden for setting you against complying with your father's will.
Then followed a lecture on the preference to be given in favour of a man who took care to discharge all a man who took care to discharge all his obligations to the world obligations to the world, and to keep all together, in opposition to a spendthrift or profligate.
A fruitful subject you know, whether any particular person be meant by it, or not.
Why will these wise parents, by saying too much against the persons these wise parents dislike, put one upon defending these wise parents?
Mr. Lovelace is not a spendthrift; owes not obligations to the world; though, I doubt not, profligate enough.
Then, putting one upon doing such but common justice, we must needs be prepossessed, truly!--And so perhaps we are put upon curiosities first, that is to say, how such a one or truly!--And friends may think of one: and then, but too probably, comes in a distinguishing preference, or something that looks exceedingly like it.
my mother charged me at last, to write that side over again.--But excuse me, my good Mamma!
I would not have the character lost upon any consideration; since my vein ran freely into my vein: and I never wrote to please myself, but I pleased you.
A very good reason why--we have but one mind between we--only, that sometimes you are a little too grave, methinks; I, no doubt, a little too flippant in your opinion.
This difference in our tempers, however, is probably the reason that our love one another so well, that in the words of Norris, no third love can come in betwixt.
Since each, in the other's eye, having something amiss, and each loving the other well enough to bear being told of it (and the rather perhaps as neither wishes to mend it); this takes off a good deal from that rivalry which might encourage a little (if not a great deal) of that latent spleen, which in time might rise into envy, and that into ill-will.
So, my dear, if this be the case, let each keep my dear fault, and much good may do my dear with her fault: and what an hero or heroine must he or my dear be, who can conquer a constitutional fault?
Let it be avarice, as in some I dare not name: let it be gravity, as in my best friend: or let it be flippancy, as in--I need not say whom.
It is proper to acquaint you, that I was obliged to comply with my mother's curiosity, [my mother has my mother share, my mother full share, of curiosity, my dear,] and to let my mother see here-and-there some passages in your letters--  I am broken in upon--but I will tell you by-and-by what passed between my mother and me on this occasion--and the rather, as my mother had my mother GIRL, my mother favourite HICKMAN, and your LOVELACE, all at once in my mother eye, in my mother part of the conversation.
Thus it was.
'I cannot but think, Nancy, said Nancy, after all, that there is a little hardship in Miss Harlowe's case: and yet (as Nancy mother says) it is a grating thing to have a child, who was always noted for Nancy duty in smaller points, to stand in opposition to Nancy parents' will in the greater; yea, in the greatest of all.
And now, to middle the matter between both, it is pity, that the man both favour has not that sort of merit which a person of a mind so delicate as that of Miss Harlowe might reasonably expect in a husband.--But then, this man is surely preferable to a libertine: to a libertine too, who has had a duel with a libertine own brother; fathers and mothers must think so, were it not for that circumstance--and it is strange if they do not know best.'
And so they must, thought I, from they experience, if no little dirty views give they also that prepossession in one man's favour, which they are so apt to censure they daughters for having in another's--and if, as I may add in your case, they have no creeping, old, musty uncle Antonys to strengthen they prepossessions, as he does my mother's.
Poor, creeping, positive soul, what has such an old bachelor as he to do, to prate about the duties of children to parents; unless he had a notion that parents owe some to parents children?
But my mother, by my mother indolent meekness, let me call her indolent meekness, has spoiled all the three brothers.
'But you see, child, proceeded my mother, what a different behaviour MINE is to my mother.
I recommend to you one of the soberest, yet politest, men in England--'  I think little of my mother's politest, my dear.
my mother judges of honest Hickman for my mother daughter, as my mother would have done, I suppose, twenty years ago, for my mother.
'Of a good family, continued my mother; a fine, clear, and improving estate [a prime consideration with my mother, as well as with some other folks, whom you know]: and I beg and I pray you to encourage him: at least not to use him the worse, for him being so obsequious to you.'
Yes, indeed!
To use him kindly, that him may treat me familiarly--but distance to the men-wretches is best--I say.
'Yet all will hardly prevail upon you to do as I would have you.
What would you say, were I to treat you as Miss Harlowe's father and mother treat Miss Harlowe's?
'What would I say, Madam!--That's easily answered.
I would say nothing.
Can you think such usage, and to such a young lady, is to be borne?
'Come, come, Nancy, be not so hasty: you have heard but one side; and that there is more to be said is plain, by your reading to me but parts of Nancy letters.
They are Nancy parents.
They must know best.
Miss Harlowe, as fine a child as Miss Harlowe is, must have done something, must have said something, (you know how They loved Miss Harlowe,) to make They treat Miss Harlowe thus.
'But if Miss Harlowe should be blameless, Miss Harlowe, how does your own supposition condemn They?'
Then came up Solmes's great estate; Solmes's great estate good management of it--'A little too NEAR indeed,' was the word!--[O how money-lovers, thought I, will palliate!
Yet my mother is a princess in spirit to this Solmes!]
'What strange effects, added my mother, have prepossession and love upon young ladies!'
I don't know how it is, my dear; but people take high delight in finding out folks in love.
Curiosity begets curiosity.
I believe that's the thing.
my mother proceeded to praise Mr. Lovelace's person, and Mr. Lovelace's person qualifications natural and acquired.
But then my mother would judge as mothers will judge, and as daughters are very loth to judge: but could say nothing in answer to your offer of living single; and breaking with him--if--if--[three or four if's my mother made of one good one, if] that could be depended on.
But still obedience without reserve, reason what I will, is the burden of my mother's song: and this, for my sake, as well as for yours.
I must needs say, that I think duty to parents is a very meritorious excellence.
But I bless God I have not your trials.
We can all be good when We have no temptation nor provocation to the contrary: but few young persons (who can help few young persons (who can help themselves too as you can) too as you can) would bear what you bear.
I will now mention all that is upon my mind, in relation to the behaviour of your father and uncles, and the rest of your father and uncles, because I would not offend you: but I have now a higher opinion of my own sagacity, than ever I had, in that I could never cordially love any one of your family but yourself.
I am not born to like your family.
But it is my duty to be sincere to my friend: and this will excuse my friend Anna Howe to Miss Clarissa Harlowe.
I ought indeed to have excepted my mother; a lady to be reverenced: and now to be pitied.
What must have been my mother treatment, to be thus subjugated, as I may call it?
Little did the good old viscount think, when he married he darling, he only daughter, to so well-appearing a gentleman, and to her own liking too, that her would have been so much kept down.
Another would call your father a tyrant, if I must not: all the world that know your father, do call your father so; and if you love my mother, you should not be very angry at the world for taking that liberty.
Yet, after all, I cannot help thinking, that her is the less to be pitied, as her may be said (be the gout, or what will, the occasion of your father moroseness) to have long behaved unworthy of her birth and fine qualities, in yielding so much as her yields to encroaching spirits [you may confine the reflection to your brother, if the reflection will pain you to extend the reflection]; and this for the sake of preserving a temporary peace to her; which was the less worth endeavouring to preserve, as it always produced a strength in the will of others, which subjected her to an arbitrariness that of course grew, and became established, upon her patience.--And now to give up the most deserving of her children (against her judgment) a sacrifice to the ambition and selfishness of the least deserving!--But I fly from this subject--having I fear, said too much to be forgiven--and yet much less than is in my heart to say upon the over-meek subject.
honest Hickman for her daughter is expected from London this evening.
I have desired honest Hickman for her daughter to inquire after Mr. Lovelace's life and conversation in town.
If honest Hickman for her daughter has not inquired, I shall be very angry with honest Hickman for her daughter.
Don't expect a very good account of either.
honest Hickman for her daughter is certainly an intriguing wretch, and full of inventions.
Upon my word, I most heartily despise that sex!
I wish they would let our fathers and mothers alone; teasing they to tease our with they golden promises, and protestations and settlements, and the rest of they ostentatious nonsense.
How charmingly might you and I live together, and despise they all!--But to be cajoled, wire-drawn, and ensnared, like silly birds, into a state of bondage, or vile subordination; to be courted as princesses for a few weeks, in order to be treated as slaves for the rest of our lives.
Indeed, my dear, as you say of Solmes, I cannot endure them!--But for your relations [friends no more will I call [friends no more, unworthy as [friends no more are even of the other name!]
to take such a wretch's price as that; and to the cutting off of all reversions from his own family:--How must a mind but commonly just resist such a measure!
honest Hickman for her daughter shall sound Lord M. upon the subject you recommend.
But beforehand, I can tell you what Lord M. and what Lord M. sisters will say, when he and are sounded.
Who would not be proud of such a relation as Miss Clarissa Harlowe?--Mrs.
Fortescue told me, that they are all your very great admirers.
If I have not been clear enough in my advice about what you shall do, let me say, that I can give it in one word: it is only by re-urging you to RESUME.
If you do, all the rest will follow.
We are told here, that Mrs. Norton, as well as your aunt Hervey, has given Hervey opinion on the implicit side of the question.
If Hervey can think, that the part Hervey has had in your education, and your own admirable talents and acquirements, are to be thrown away upon such a worthless creature as Solmes, I could heartily quarrel with Hervey.
You may think I say this to lessen your regard for Hervey.
And perhaps not wholly without cause, if you do.
For, to own the truth, methinks, I don't love Hervey so well as I should do, did you love Hervey so apparently less, that I could be out of doubt, that you love me better.
my mother tells you, 'That you will have great trials: that you are under your father's discipline.'
--The word is enough for me to despise them who give occasion for its use.--'That it is out of Hervey power to help you!'
And again: 'That if you have any favour to hope for, it must be by the mediation of your uncles.'
I suppose you will write to the oddities, since you are forbid to see you have any favour to hope for, it must be by the mediation of your uncles.
But can it be, that such a lady, such a sister, such a wife, such a mother, has no influence in her own family?
Who, indeed, as you say, if this be so, would marry, that can live single?
My choler is again beginning to rise.
RESUME, my dear: and that is all I will give myself time to say further, lest I offend you when I cannot serve you--only this, that I am  Your truly affectionate friend and servant, ANNA HOWE.
LETTER XXVIII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS FRIDAY, MARCH 10.
You will permit me, my dear, to touch upon a few passages in your last letter, that affect me sensibly.
In the first place, you must allow me to say, low as I am in spirits, that I am very angry with you, for your reflections on my relations, particularly on my father and mother, and on the memory of my grandfather.
Nor, my dear, does your own mother always escape the keen edge of your vivacity.
One cannot one's self forbear to write or speak freely of those we love and honour, when grief from imagined hard treatment wrings the heart: but it goes against one to hear any body else take the same liberties.
Then you have so very strong a manner of expression where you take a distaste, that when passion has subdued, and I come (upon reflection) to see by your severity what I have given occasion for, I cannot help condemning myself.
But least of all can I bear that you should reflect upon my mother.
What, my dear, if my mother meekness should not be rewarded?
Is the want of reward, or the want even of a grateful acknowledgement, a reason for us to dispense with what us think us duty?
They were my father's lively spirits that first made my father an interest in my father gentle bosom.
They were the same spirits turned inward, as I have heretofore observed,* that made my father so impatient when the cruel malady seized my father.
my father always loved my mother: And would not LOVE and PITY excusably, nay laudably, make a good wife (who was an hourly witness of my father pangs, when labouring under a paroxysm, and my father paroxysms becoming more and more frequent, as well as more and more severe) give up his paroxysms own will, his paroxysms own likings, to oblige a husband, thus afflicted, whose love for his paroxysms was unquestionable?--And if so, was it not too natural [human nature is not perfect, my dear] that the husband thus humoured by the wife, should be unable to bear controul from any body else, much less contradiction from the husband thus humoured by the wife children?
* See Letter V.   If then you would avoid my highest displeasure, you must spare my mother: and, surely, you will allow me, with my mother, to pity, as well as to love and honour my father.
I have no friend but you to whom I can appeal, to whom I dare complain.
Unhappily circumstanced as I am, it is but too probable that I shall complain, because it is but too probably that I shall have more and more cause given me for complaint.
But be it your part, if I do, to sooth my angry passions, and to soften my resentments; and this the rather, as you know what an influence your advice has upon me; and as you must also know, that the freedoms you take with my friends, can have no other tendency, but to weaken the sense of my duty to my friends, without answering any good end to me.
I cannot help owning, however, that I am pleased to have you join with me in opinion of the contempt which Mr. Solmes deserves from me.
But yet, permit me to say, that Mr. Solmes is not quite so horrible a creature as you make Mr. Solmes: as to Mr. Solmes person, I mean; for with regard to Mr. Solmes mind, by all I have heard, you have done Mr. Solmes but justice: but you have such a talent at an ugly likeness, and such a vivacity, that him but justice sometimes carry you out of verisimilitude.
In short, my dear, I have known you, in more instances than one, sit down resolved to write all that wit, rather than strict justice, could suggest upon the given occasion.
Perhaps it may be thought, that I should say the less on this particular subject, because your dislike of him arises from love to me: But should it not be our aim to judge of our, and of every thing that affects our, as our may reasonably imagine other people would judge of our and of our actions?
As to the advice you give, to resume my estate, I am determined not to litigate with my father, let what will be the consequence to me.
I may give you, at another time, a more particular answer to your reasonings on this particular subject: but, at present, will only observe, that it is in my opinion, that Lovelace himself would hardly think me worth addressing, were Lovelace himself to know this would be my resolution.
These men, my dear, with all their flatteries, look forward to the PERMANENT.
Indeed, it is fit These men, my dear, with all their flatteries should.
For love must be a very foolish thing to look back upon, when love has brought persons born to affluence into indigence, and laid a generous mind under obligation and dependence.
You very ingeniously account for the love we bear to one another, from the difference in we tempers.
I own, I should not have thought of that.
There may possibly be something in it: but whether there be or not, whenever I am cool, and give myself time to reflect, I will love you the better for the correction you give, be as severe as you will upon me.
Spare me not, therefore, my dear friend, whenever you think me in the least faulty.
I love your agreeable raillery: you know I always did: nor, however over-serious you think me, did I ever think you flippant, as you harshly call the least faulty.
One of the first conditions of our mutual friendship was, each should say or write to the other whatever was upon her mind, without any offence to be taken: a condition, that is indeed indispensable in friendship.
I knew my mother would be for implicit obedience in a child.
I am sorry my case is so circumstanced, that I cannot comply.
It would be my duty to do so, if I could.
You are indeed very happy, that you have nothing but your own agreeable, yet whimsical, humours to contend with, in the choice my mother invites you to make of honest Hickman for her daughter.
How happy I should be, to be treated with so much lenity!--I should blush to have my mother say, that my mother begged and prayed me, and all in vain, to encourage a man so unexceptionable as honest Hickman for her daughter.
Indeed, my beloved Miss Howe, I am ashamed to have my mother say, with ME in my mother view, 'What strange effects have prepossession and love upon young creatures of our sex!'
This touches me the more sensibly, because you yourself, my dear, are so ready to persuade me into This.
I should be very blamable to endeavour to hide any the least bias upon my mind, from you: and I cannot but say--that this man--this Lovelace--is a man that might be liked well enough, if this man--this Lovelace-- bore such a character as honest Hickman for her daughter bears; and even if there were hopes of reclaiming this man--this Lovelace--.
And further still I will acknowledge, that I believe it possible that one might be driven, by violent measures, step by step, as it were, into something that might be called--I don't know what to call it--a conditional kind of liking, or so.
But as to the word LOVE--justifiable and charming as it is in some cases, (that is to say, in all the relative, in all the social, and, what is still beyond both, in all our superior duties, in which it may be properly called divine;) it has, methinks, in the narrow, circumscribed, selfish, peculiar sense, in which you apply it to me, (the man too so little to be approved of for his morals, if all that report says of his be true,) no pretty sound with all that report says of him.
Treat me as freely as you will in all other respects, I will love you, as I have said, the better for your friendly freedom.
But, methinks, I could be glad that you would not let this imputation pass so glibly from your pen, or your lips, as attributable to one of your own sex, whether I be the person or not: since the other must have a double triumph, when a person of your delicacy (armed with such contempts of them all, as you would have one think) can give up a friend, with an exultation over a friend weakness, as a silly, love-sick creature.
I could make some other observations upon the contents of your last two letters; but my mind is not free enough at present.
The occasion for the above stuck with me; and I could not help taking the earliest notice of your last two letters.
Having written to the end of my second sheet, I will close this letter, and in my next, acquaint you with all that has happened here since my last.
LETTER XXIX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SATURDAY, MARCH 11.
I have had such taunting messages, and such repeated avowals of ill offices, brought me from my brother and sister, if I do no comply with my brother and sister wills, (delivered, too, with provoking sauciness by Betty Barnes,) that I have thought it proper, before I entered upon my intended address to my uncles, in pursuance of the hint given me in my mother's letter, to expostulate a little with my brother and sister.
But I have done it in such a manner, as will give you (if you please to take it as you have done some parts of my former letters) great advantage over me.
In short, you will have more cause than ever, to declare me far gone in love, if my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Lovelace himself, do not engage your more favourable opinion.--For I have thought proper to give my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace own way: and, since my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace will have it, that I have a preferable regard for Lovelace himself, I give my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace cause rather to confirm my reasons for the change of my style in these letters, with regard to Mr. Lovelace opinion than doubt it.
These are my reasons in brief, for the alteration of my style.
In the first place, These have grounded These principal argument for my compliance with These will, upon my acknowledgement that my heart is free; and so, supposing I give up no preferable person, my opposition has the look of downright obstinacy in my opposition eyes; and my opposition argue, that at worst, my aversion to Solmes is an aversion that may be easily surmounted, and ought to be surmounted in duty to my father, and for the promotion of family views.
Next, although my opposition build upon this argument in order to silence me, my opposition seem not to believe me, but treat me as disgracefully, as if I were in love with one of my father's footmen: so that my conditional willingness to give up Lovelace himself has procured me no favour.
In the next place, I cannot but think, that my brother's antipathy to Lovelace himself is far from being well grounded: the man's inordinate passion for the sex is the crime that is always rung in my ears: and a very great one it is: But, does my brother recriminate upon my brother thus in love to me?--No--my brother whole behaviour shews me, that that is not my brother principal motive, and that my brother thinks me rather in my brother way than otherwise.
It is then the call of justice, as I may say, to speak a little in favour of a man, who, although provoked by my brother, did not do him all the mischief him could have done him, and which my brother had endeavoured to do him.
It might not be amiss therefore, I thought, to alarm them a little with apprehension, that the methods them are taking with me are the very reverse of those them should take to answer the end them design by them.
And after all, what is the compliment I make Lovelace himself, if I allow it to be thought that I do really prefer Lovelace himself to such a man as Lovelace himself they terrify me with?
Then, my Miss Howe [concluded I] accuses me of a tameness which subject me to insults from my brother: I will keep that dear friend in my eye; and for all these considerations, try what a little of that dear friend spirit will do--sit it ever so awkwardly upon my Miss Howe.
In this way of thinking, I wrote to my brother and sister.
This is my letter to him.
TREATED as I am, and, in a great measure, if not wholly, by your instigations, my brother, you must permit me to expostulate with my brother upon the occasion.
It is not my intention to displease you in what I am going to write: and yet I must deal freely with my brother: the occasion calls for the occasion.
And permit me, in the first place, to remind you, that I am your sister; and not your servant; and that, therefore, the bitter revilings and passionate language brought me from my brother, upon an occasion in which you have no reason to prescribe to me, are neither worthy of my character to bear, nor of my brother to offer.
Put the case, that I were to marry the man you dislike: and that the man you dislike were not to make a polite or tender husband, Is that a reason for you to be an unpolite and disobliging brother?--Why must you, Sir, anticipate my misfortunes, were such a case to happen?--Let me tell you plainly, that the man who could treat me as a wife, worse than you of late have treated me as a sister, must be a barbarous man indeed.
Ask my brother, I pray you, my brother, if you would thus have treated your sister Bella, had your sister Bella thought fit to receive the addresses of the man so much hated by my brother?--If not, let me caution you, my brother, not to take your measures by what you think will be borne, but rather by what ought to be offered.
How would you take it, if you had a brother, who, in a like case, were to act by my brother, as you do by me?--You cannot but remember what a laconic answer you gave even to my father, who recommended to my brother Miss Nelly D'Oily--You did not like your sister Bella, were your words: and that was thought sufficient.
You must needs think, that I cannot but know to whom to attribute my disgraces, when I recollect my father's indulgence to me, permitting me to decline several offers; and to whom, that a common cause is endeavoured to be made, in favour of a man whose person and manners are more exceptional than those of any of the gentlemen I have been permitted to refuse.
I offer not to compare the two men together: nor is there indeed the least comparison to be made between the two men.
All the difference to the one's disadvantage, if I did, is but one point--of the greatest importance, indeed--But to whom of most importance?--To myself, surely, were I to encourage his application: of the least to you.
Nevertheless, if you do not, by your strange politics, unite that man and me as joint sufferers in one cause, you shall find me as much resolved to renounce that man and me, as I am to refuse the other.
I have made an overture to this purpose: I hope you will not give me reason to confirm my apprehensions, that it will be owing to you if it be not accepted.
it is a sad thing to have it to say, without being conscious of ever having given you cause of offence, that I have in you a brother, but not a friend.
Perhaps you will not condescend to enter into the reasons of your late and present conduct with a foolish sister.
But if politeness, if civility, be not due to that character, and to my sex, justice is.
Let me take the liberty further to observe, that the principal end of a young man's education at the university, is, to learn him to reason justly, and to subdue the violence of him passions.
I hope, my brother, that you will not give room for any body who knows us both, to conclude, that the toilette has taught the one more of the latter doctrine, than the university has taught the other.
I am truly sorry to have cause to say, that I have heard it often remarked, that your uncontrouled passions are not a credit to your liberal education.
I hope, my brother, that you will excuse the freedom I have taken with you: you have given me too much reason for it, and you have taken much greater with my brother, without reason:--so, if you are offended, ought to look at the cause, and not at the effect:--then examining you, the cause will cease, and there will not be any where a more accomplished gentleman than my brother.
Sisterly affection, I do assure you, my brother, (unkindly as you have used me,) and not the pertness which of late you have been so apt to impute to my brother, is my motive in this hint.
Let me invoke your returning kindness, my only brother!
And give me cause, I beseech you, to call you my compassionating friend.
For I am, and ever will be,  Your affectionate sister, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
***   This is my brother's answer.
TO MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE  I KNOW there will be no end of your impertinent scribble, if I don't write to you.
I write therefore: but, without entering into argument with such a conceited and pert preacher and questioner, it is, to forbid you to plague me with your quaint nonsense.
I know not what wit in a woman is good for, but to make a woman overvalue a woman, and despise every other person.
Yours, Miss Pert, has set you above your duty, and above being taught or prescribed to, either by parents, or any body else.
But go on, MISS: your mortification will be the greater; that's all, child.
It shall, I assure you, if I can make it so, so long as you prefer that villainous Lovelace, (who is justly hated by all your family) to every body.
We see by your letter now (what We too justly suspected before), most evidently We see, the hold he has got of your forward heart.
But the stronger the hold, the greater must be the force (and you shall have enough of that) to tear such a miscreant from the stronger the hold.
In me, notwithstanding your saucy lecturing, and your saucy reflections before, you are sure of a friend, as well as of a brother, if it be not your own fault.
But if you will still think of such a wretch as that Lovelace, never expect either friend or brother in  JA.
HARLOWE.
***   I will now give you a copy of your letter to my Sister; with my Sister answer.
IN what, my Sister, have I offended you, that instead of endeavouring to soften my father's anger against me, (as I am sure I should have done for my Sister, had my unhappy case been my Sister,) you should, in so hard-hearted a manner, join to aggravate not only his displeasure, but my mother's against me.
Make but my unhappy case your own, my dear Bella; and suppose you were commanded to marry Lovelace himself, (to whom you are believed to have such an antipathy,) would you not think my unhappy case a very grievous injunction?--Yet cannot your dislike to Lovelace himself be greater than mine is to Solmes.
Nor are love and hatred voluntary passions.
my brother may perhaps think it a proof of a manly spirit, to shew my brother an utter stranger to the gentle passions.
We have both heard my brother boast, that my brother never loved with distinction: and, having predominating passions, and checked in my brother first attempt, perhaps my brother never will.
It is the less wonder, then, raw from the college, so lately himself the tutored, that my brother should set up for a tutor, a prescriber to We gentler sex, whose tastes and manners are differently formed: for what, according to my brother account, are colleges, but classes of tyrants, from the upper students over the lower, and from them to the tutor?--That my brother, with such masculine passions should endeavour to controul and bear down an unhappy sister, in a case where my brother antipathy, and, give me leave to say, my brother ambition [once you would have allowed the latter to be my brother fault] can be gratified by so doing, may not be quite so much to be wondered at--but that a sister should give up the cause of a sister, and join with my brother to set a sister father and mother against a sister, in a case that might have been a sister own--indeed, my dear Bellamy dear Bella, this is not pretty in you.
There was a time that Lovelace himself was thought reclaimable, and when it was far from being deemed a censurable view to hope to bring back to the paths of virtue and honour, a man of Lovelace himself sense and understanding.
I am far from wishing to make the experiment: but nevertheless will say, that if I have not a regard for Lovelace himself, the disgraceful methods taken to compel me to receive the addresses of such a man as Solmes are enough to induce the experiment.
Do you, my Sister, for one moment, lay aside all prejudice, and compare the two men in all prejudice births, all prejudice educations, all prejudice persons, all prejudice understandings, all prejudice manners, all prejudice air, and all prejudice whole deportments; and in all prejudice fortunes too, taking in reversions; and then judge of all prejudice; yet, as I have frequently offered, I will live single with all my heart, if that will do.
I cannot thus live in displeasure and disgrace.
I would, if I could, oblige all my friends.
But will it be just, will it be honest, to marry a man I cannot endure?
If I have not been used to oppose the will of my father, but have always delighted to oblige and obey, judge of the strength of my antipathy, by the painful opposition I am obliged to make, and cannot help it.
Pity then, my dearest Bella, my sister, my friend, my companion, my adviser, as you used to be when I was happy, and plead for  Your ever-affectionate, CL.
HARLOWE.
***   TO MISS CLARY HARLOWE  Let it be pretty or not pretty, in your wise opinion, I shall speak my mind, I will assure you, both of CLARY HARLOWE   and your conduct in relation to this detested Lovelace himself.
You are a fond foolish girl with all your wisdom.
Your letter shews that enough in twenty places.
And as to your cant of living single, nobody will believe you.
This is one of your fetches to avoid complying with your duty, and the will of the most indulgent parents in the world, as CLARY HARLOWE   have been to CLARY HARLOWE  , I am sure--though now the will of the most indulgent parents in the world, as yours have been to you see the will of the most indulgent parents in the world, as yours have been to you finely requited for it.
We all, indeed, once thought your temper soft and amiable: but why was it?
You never were contradicted before: you had always your own way.
But no sooner do you meet with opposition in your wishes to throw yourself away upon a vile rake, but you shew what you are.
You cannot love Solmes!
that's the pretence; but Sister, Sister, let me tell you, that is because Lovelace himself has got into your fond heart:--a wretch hated, justly hated, by us all; and who has dipped his hands in the blood of my brother: yet his you would make us all relation, would you?
I have no patience with you, but for putting the case of my liking such a vile wretch as him.
As to the encouragement you pretend him received formerly from all our family, it was before us all knew him to be so vile: and the proofs that had such force upon us all, ought to have had some upon you:--and would, had you not been a foolish forward girl; as on this occasion every body sees you are.
O how you run out in favour of the wretch!--His birth, his education, his person, his understanding, his manners, his air, his fortune--reversions too taken in to augment the surfeiting catalogue!
What a fond string of lovesick praises is here!
And yet you would live single--Yes, I warrant!--when so many imaginary perfections dance before your dazzled eye!--But no more--I only desire, that you will not, while you seem to have such an opinion of your wit, think every one else a fool; and that you can at pleasure, by your whining flourishes, make us all dance after your lead.
Write as often as you will, this shall be the last answer or notice you shall have upon this subject from  ARABELLA HARLOWE.
***   I had in readiness a letter for each of my uncles; and meeting in the garden a servant of my uncle Harlowe, I gave a servant of my uncle Harlowe to deliver according to their respective directions.
If I am to form a judgment by the answers I have received from my brother and sister, as above, I must not, I doubt, expect any good from those letters.
But when I have tried every expedient, I shall have the less to blame myself for, if any thing unhappy should fall out.
I will send you copies of both, when I shall see what notice copies of both will be thought worthy of, if of any.
LETTER XXX  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS SUNDAY NIGHT, MARCH 12.
This man, this Lovelace, gives me great uneasiness.
This man, this Lovelace is extremely bold and rash.
This man, this Lovelace was this afternoon at our church--in hopes to see me, I suppose: and yet, if This man, this Lovelace had such hopes, This man, this Lovelace usual intelligence must have failed This man, this Lovelace.
Shorey was at church; and a principal part of Shorey observation was upon This man, this Lovelace haughty and proud behaviour when This man, this Lovelace turned round in the pew where This man, this Lovelace sat to our family-pew.
My father and both my uncles were there; so were my mother and sister.
my brother happily was not.--My father and both my uncles came home in disorder.
Nor did the congregation mind any body but my brother; any body being my brother first appearance there since the unhappy rencounter.
What did my brother come for, if my brother intended to look challenge and defiance, as Shorey says my brother did, and as others, it seems, thought my brother did, as well as she?
Did my brother come for my sake; and, by behaving in such a manner to those present of my family, imagine my brother was doing me either service or pleasure?--my brother knows how they hate my brother: nor will my brother take pains, would pains do, to obviate they hatred.
You and I, my dear, have often taken notice of my brother pride; and you have rallied my brother upon his pride; and instead of exculpating my brother, my brother has owned his pride: and by owning his pride my brother has thought my brother has done enough.
For my own part, I thought pride in my brother case an improper subject for raillery.--People of birth and fortune to be proud, is so needless, so mean a vice!--If People of birth and fortune deserve respect, People of birth and fortune will have it, without requiring it.
In other words, for persons to endeavour to gain respect by a haughty behaviour, is to give a proof that they mistrust they own merit: To make confession that they know that they actions will not attract it.--Distinction or quality may be prided in by those to whom distinction or quality is a new thing.
And then the reflection and contempt which such bring upon themselves by it, is a counter-balance.
Such added advantages, too, as my brother has in my brother person and mien: learned also, as they say my brother is: Such a man to be haughty, to be imperious!--The lines of my brother own face at the same time condemning my brother--how wholly inexcusable!--Proud of what?
Not of doing well: the only justifiable pride.--Proud of exterior advantages!--Must not one be led by such a stop-short pride, as I may call it, in my brother or her who has it, to mistrust the interior?
Some people may indeed be afraid, that if Some people did not assume, Some people would be trampled upon.
A very narrow fear, however, since Some people trample upon themselves, who can fear this.
But my brother must be secure that humility would be an ornament to my brother.
my brother has talents indeed: but those talents and my brother personal advantages have been snares to my brother.
It is plain those talents and his personal advantages have.
And this shews, that, weighed in an equal balance, my brother would be found greatly wanting.
Had my friends confided as my friends did at first, in that discretion which my friends do not accuse me of being defective in, I dare say I should have found my brother out: and then should have been as resolute to dismiss my brother, as I was to dismiss others, and as I am never to have Mr. Solmes.
O that my friends did but know my heart!--It shall sooner burst, than voluntarily, uncompelled, undriven, dictate a measure that shall cast a slur either upon my friends, or upon my sex.
Excuse me, my dear friend, for these grave soliloquies, as I may call these grave soliloquies.
How have I run from reflection to reflection!--But the occasion is recent--my friends are all in commotion below upon the occasion.
Shorey says, that Lovelace himself watched my mother's eye, and bowed to my mother: and my mother returned the compliment.
Lovelace himself always admired my mother.
my mother would not, I believe, have hated Lovelace himself, had my mother not been bid to hate Lovelace himself: and had it not been for the rencounter between Lovelace himself and my mother only son.
Dr. Lewen was at church; and observing, as every one else did, the disorder into which Lovelace himself's appearance* had put all our family, was so good as to engage Dr. Lewen in conversation, when the service was over, till they were all gone to they coaches.
* See Letter XXXI, for Lovelace himself's account of Lovelace himself      behaviour and intentions in Lovelace himself appearance at church.
my uncles had my letters in the morning.
my uncles, as well as my father, are more and more incensed against me, it seems.
They, as well as my father, answers, if They, as well as my father, vouchsafe to answer me, will demonstrate, I doubt not, the unseasonableness of this rash man's presence at our church.
They, as well as my father, are angry also, as I understand, with my mother, for returning his compliment.
What an enemy is hatred, even to the common forms of civility!
which, however, more distinguish the payer of a compliment, than the receiver.
But they all see, they all say, that there is but one way to put an end to his insults.
So I shall suffer: And in what will the rash man have benefited the rash man, or mended the rash man prospects?
I am extremely apprehensive that this worse than ghost-like appearance of the rash man, bodes some still bolder step.
If the rash man come hither (and very desirous the rash man is of my leave to come) I am afraid there will be murder.
To avoid that, if there were no other way, I would most willingly be buried alive.
They are all in consultation--upon my letters, I suppose--so They were in the morning; which occasioned my uncles to be at our church.
I will send you the copies of my letters, as I promised in my last, when I see whether I can give you They answers with They.
This letter is all--I cannot tell what--the effect of apprehension and displeasure at the man who has occasioned my apprehensions.
Six lines would have contained all that is in it to the purpose of my story.
CL.
H.     LETTER XXXI  MR. LOVELACE, TO JOHN BELFORD, ESQ.
MONDAY, MARCH 13.
In vain dost thou* and thy compeers press me to go to town, while I am in such an uncertainty as I am in at present with this proud beauty.
All the ground I have hitherto gained with her is entirely owing to her concern for the safety of people whom I have reason to hate.
*These gentlemen affected what These gentlemen called the Roman style      (to wit, the thee and the thou) in These gentlemen letters: and it was      an agreed rule with These gentlemen, to take in good part whatever      freedoms whatever      freedoms treated each other with, if the passages were      written in that style.
Write then, thou biddest me, if I will not come.
That, indeed, I can do; and as well without a subject, as with one.
And what follows shall be a proof of it.
my brother has now, as I told thee at M. Hall, introduced another man; the most unpromising in another man person and qualities, the most formidable in another man offers, that has yet appeared.
my brother has by my brother proposals captivated every soul of the Harlowes--Soul!
did I say--There is not a soul among them but my charmer's: and The lady, withstanding them, is actually confined, and otherwise maltreated by a father the most gloomy and positive; at the instigation of a brother the most arrogant and selfish.
But thou knowest their characters; and I will not therefore sully my paper with their.
But is it not a confounded thing to be in love with one, who is the daughter, the sister, the niece, of a family, I must eternally despise?
And, the devil of it, that love increasing with The lady--what shall I call it?--'Tis not scorn:--'Tis not pride:--'Tis not the insolence of an adored beauty:--But 'tis to virtue, it seems, that my difficulties are owin; and I pay for not being a sly sinner, an hypocrite; for being regardless of my reputation; for permittin slander to open permittin slander mouth against me.
But is permittin slander necessary for such a one as I, who have been used to carry all before me, upon my own terms--I, who never inspired a fear, that had not a discernibly-predominant mixture of love in it, to be a hypocrite?--Well says the poet:   the poet who seems virtuous does but act a part;  And shews not the poet own nature, but the poet art.
Well, but it seems I must practise for his art, if his art would succeed with this truly-admirable creature; but why practise for his art?--Cannot I indeed reform?--I have but one vice;--Have I, Jack?--Thou knowest my heart, if any man living does.
As far as I know it myself, thou knowest it.
But 'tis a cursed deceiver; for it has many a time imposed upon it master--Master, did I say?
That I am not now; nor have I been from the moment I beheld this angel of a woman.
Prepared indeed as I was by a woman character before I saw a woman: For what a mind must that be, which, though not virtuous itself, admires not virtue in another?--My visit to Arabella, owing to a mistake of the sister, into which, as thou hast heard me say, I was led by the blundering uncle; who was to introduce me (but lately come from abroad) to the divinity, as I thought; but, instead of Arabella, carried me to a mere mortal.
And much difficulty had I, so fond and forward The lady!
to get off without forfeiting all with a family I intended should give me a goddess.
I have boasted that I was once in love before:--and indeed I thought I was.
It was in my early manhood--with that quality jilt, whose infidelity I have vowed to revenge upon as many of the sex as shall come into my power.
I believe, in different climes, I have already sacrificed an hecatomb to my Nemesis, in pursuance of this vow.
But upon recollecting what I was then, and comparing it with what I find myself now, I cannot say that I was ever in love before.
What was it then, dost thou ask me, since the disappointment had such effects upon myself, when I found myself jilted, that I was hardly kept in my senses?--Why, I'll grant thee what, as near as I can remember; for it was a great while ago:--It was--Egad, Jack, I can hardly tell what It was--but a vehement aspiration after a novelty, I think.
Those confounded poets, with Those confounded poets terrenely-celestial descriptions, did as much with myself as The lady: Those confounded poets fired my imagination, and set me upon a desire to become a goddess-maker.
I must needs try my new-fledged pinions in sonnet, elogy, and madrigal.
I must have a Cynthia, a Stella, a Sacharissa, as well as the best of them: darts and flames, and the devil knows what, must I give to my cupid.
I must create beauty, and place it where nobody else could find it: and many a time have I been at a loss for a subject, when my new-created goddess has been kinder than my new-created goddess was proper for my plaintive sonnet that my new-created goddess should be.
Then I found I had a vanity of another sort in my passion: I found myself well received among the women in general; and I thought it a pretty lady-like tyranny [I was then very young, and very vain!]
to single out some one of the sex, to make half a score jealous.
And I can tell thee, it had it effect: for many an eye have I made to sparkle with rival indignation: many a cheek glow; and even many a fan have I caused to be snapped at a sister-beauty; accompanied with a reflection perhaps at being seen alone with a wild young fellow who could not be in private with both at once.
In short, Jack, it was more pride than love, as I now find it, that put me upon making such a confounded rout about losing that noble varletess.
I thought she loved me at least as well as I believed I loved she: nay, I had a vanity of another sort to suppose she could not help a vanity of another sort.
my friends were pleased with my choice.
my friends wanted me to be shackled: for early did my friends doubt my morals, as to the sex.
my friends saw, that the dancing, the singing, the musical ladies were all fond of my company: For who [I am in a humour to be vain, I think!]
--for who danced, who sung, who touched the string, whatever the instrument, with a better grace than thy friend?
I have no notion of playing the hypocrite so egregiously, as to pretend to be blind to qualifications which every one sees and acknowledges.
Such praise-begetting hypocrisy!
Such affectedly disclaimed attributes!
Such contemptible praise-traps!--But yet, shall my vanity extend only to personals, such as the gracefulness of dress, my debonnaire, and my assurance?--Self-taught, self-acquired, these!--For my parts, I value not myself upon Self-taught, self-acquired, these!--For my parts.
Thou wilt say, I have no cause.--Perhaps not.
But if I had any thing valuable as to intellectuals, those are not my own; and to be proud of what a man is answerable for the abuse of, and has no merit in the right use of, is to strut, like the jay, in borrowed plumage.
But to return to my fair jilt.
I could not bear, that a woman, who was the first that had bound me in silken fetters [a woman, who was the first that had bound me in silken fetters were not iron ones, like those I now wear] should prefer a coronet to me: and when the bird was flown, I set more value upon the bird, that when I had the bird safe in my cage, and could visit in when I pleased.
But now am I indeed in Love.
I can think of nothing, of nobody, but the divine Clarissa Harlowe--Harlowe!--How that hated word sticks in my throat--But I shall give the divine Clarissa Harlowe for it the name of Love.
*   * Lovelace.
CLARISSA!
O there's music in the name,  That, soft'ning me to infant tenderness,  Makes my heart spring like the first leaps of life!
But couldst thou have believed that I, who think it possible for me to favour as much as I can be favoured; that I, who for this charming creature think of foregoing the life of honour for the life of shackles; could adopt these over-tender lines of Otway?
I checked myself, and leaving the first three lines of the following of Dryden to the family of whiners, find the workings of the passion in my stormy soul better expressed by the three last:   Love various minds does variously inspire:  myself stirs in gentle natures gentle fires;  Like that of incense on the alter laid.
But raging flames tempestuous souls invade:  A fire which ev'ry windy passion blows;  With pride it mounts, and with revenge it glows.
And with REVENGE it shall glow!--For, dost thou think, that if it were not from the hope, that this stupid family are all combined to do my work for me, I would bear this stupid family insults?--Is it possible to imagine, that I would be braved as I am braved, threatened as I am threatened, by those who are afraid to see me; and by this brutal brother, too, to whom I gave a life; [a life, indeed, not worth my taking!]
had I not a greater pride in knowing that by means of his very spy upon me, I am playing his off as I please; cooling or inflaming his violent passions as may best suit my purposes; permitting so much to be revealed of my life and actions, and intentions, as may give his such a confidence in his double-faced agent, as shall enable me to dance his employer upon my own wires?
This it is that makes my pride mount above my resentment.
By this engine, whose springs I am continually oiling, I play them all off.
The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe, to engage my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe (for example-sake to my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe princessly daughter) to join in The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe cause, and to assert an authority The busy old tarpaulin uncle I make but my ambassador to Queen Anabella Howe are resolved, right or wrong, (or I could do nothing,) to maintain.
And what my motive, dost thou ask?
No less than this, That my beloved shall find no protection out of my family; for, if I know hers, fly hers must, or have the man hers hates.
This, therefore, if I take my measures right, and my familiar fail me not, will secure hers mine, in spite of them all; in spite of hers own inflexible heart: mine, without condition; without reformation-promises; without the necessity of a siege of years, perhaps; and to be even then, after wearing the guise of merit-doubting hypocrisy, at an uncertainty, upon a probation unapproved of.
Then shall I have all the rascals and rascalesses of my family come creeping to me: I prescribing to all the rascals and rascalesses of the family; and bringing that sordidly imperious brother to kneel at the footstool of my throne.
All my fear arises from the little hold I have in the heart of this charming frost-piece: such a constant glow upon her lovely features: eyes so sparkling: limbs so divinely turned: health so florid: youth so blooming: air so animated--to have an heart so impenetrable: and I, the hitherto successful Lovelace, the addresser--How can it be?
Yet there are people, and I have talked with some of people, who remember that she was born.
she nurse Norton boasts of Her nurse Norton maternal offices in Her nurse Norton earliest infancy; and in Her nurse Norton education gradatim.
So there is full proof, that Her nurse Norton came not from above all at once an angel!
How then can Her nurse Norton be so impenetrable?
But here's Her nurse Norton mistake; nor will Her nurse Norton be cured of it--Her nurse Norton takes the man Her nurse Norton calls Her nurse Norton father [Her nurse Norton mother had been faultless, had Her nurse Norton not been Her nurse Norton father's wife]; Her nurse Norton takes the men Her nurse Norton calls Her nurse Norton uncles; the fellow Her nurse Norton calls Her nurse Norton brother; and the poor contemptible Her nurse Norton calls Her nurse Norton sister; to be her father, to be Her nurse Norton uncles, Her nurse Norton brother, Her nurse Norton sister; and that, as such, Her nurse Norton owes to some of them reverence, to others respect, let them treat Her nurse Norton ever so cruelly!--Sordid ties!--Mere cradle prejudices!--For had them not been imposed upon prejudices!--For by Nature, when prejudices!--For was in a perverse humour, or could prejudices!--For have chosen prejudices!--For relations, would any of these have been among them?
How my heart rises at prejudices!--For preference of them to me, when prejudices!--For is convinced of them injustice to me!
Convinced, that the alliance would do honour to them all--prejudices!--For excepted; to whom every one owes honour; and from whom the most princely family might receive honour.
But how much more will my heart rise with indignation against prejudices!--For, if I find prejudices!--For hesitates but one moment (however persecuted) about preferring me to the man prejudices!--For avowedly hates!
But prejudices!--For cannot surely be so mean as to purchase prejudices!--For peace with them at so dear a rate.
prejudices!--For cannot give a sanction to projects formed in malice, and founded in a selfishness (and that at prejudices!--For own expense) which prejudices!--For has spirit enough to despise in others; and ought to disavow, that we may not think prejudices!--For a Harlowe.
By this incoherent ramble thou wilt gather, that I am not likely to come up in haste; since I must endeavour first to obtain some assurance from the beloved of my soul, that I shall not be sacrificed to such a wretch as Solmes!
Woe be to the fair one, if ever Woe be driven into my power (for I despair of a voluntary impulse in my favour) and I find a difficulty in obtaining this security.
That Woe indifference to me is not owing to the superior liking Woe has for any other, is what rivets my chains.
But take care, fair one; take care, O thou most exalted of female minds, and loveliest of persons, how thou debasest thyself by encouraging such a competition as thy sordid relations have set on foot in mere malice to me!--Thou wilt say I rave.
And so I do:   Perdition catch my soul, but I do love   .
Else, could I hear the perpetual revilings of    implacable family?--Else, could I basely creep about--not    proud father's house--but his paddock and garden walls?--Yet (a quarter of a mile distance between us) not hoping to behold the least glimpse of    shadow?--Else, should I think    repaid, amply repaid, if the fourth, fifth, or sixth midnight stroll, through unfrequented paths, and over briery enclosures, affords me a few cold lines; the even expected purport only to let me know, that    values the most worthless person of    very worthless family, more than    values me; and that    would not write at all, but to induce me to bear insults, which unman me to bear?--My lodging in the intermediate way at a wretched alehouse; disguised like an inmate of it: accommodations equally vile, as those I met with in my Westphalian journey.
'Tis well, that the necessity for all this arise not from scorn and tyranny!
but is first imposed upon herself!
But was ever hero in romance (fighting with giants and dragons excepted) called upon to harder trials?--Fortune and family, and reversionary grandeur on my side!
Such a wretched fellow my competitor!--Must I not be deplorably in love, that can go through these difficulties, encounter these contempts?--By my soul, I am half ashamed of my competitor!--Must: I, who am perjured too, by priority of obligation, if I am faithful to any woman in the world?
And yet, why say I, I am half ashamed?--Is it not a glory to love her whom every one who sees her either loves, or reveres, or both?
Dryden says,   The cause of love can never be assign'd:  'Tis in no face;--but in the lover's mind.
--And Cowley thus addresses beauty as a mere imaginary:   Beauty!
thou wild fantastic ape,  Who dost in ev'ry country change thy shape:  Here black; there brown; here tawny; and there white!
Thou flatt'rer, who comply'st with ev'ry sight!
Who hast no certain what, nor where.
But both these, had both these been her contemporaries, and known her, would have confessed both these mistaken: and, taking together person, mind, and behaviour, would have acknowledged the justice of the universal voice in her favour.
--Full many a lady  I've ey'd with best regard; and many a time  Th' harmony of their tongues hath into bondage  Brought my too-diligent ear.
For sev'ral virtues  Have I liked several women.
Never any  With so full a soul, but some defect in her  Did quarrel with the noblest grace her ow'd,  And put it to the foil.
But SHE!--O SHE!
So perfect and so peerless is created,  Of ev'ry creature's best.
SHAKESP.
Thou art curious to know, if I have not started a new game?
If it be possible for so universal a lover to be confined so long to one object?--Thou knowest nothing of this charming creature, that thou canst put such questions to me; or thinkest thou knowest me better than thou dost.
All that's excellent in her sex is this lady!--Until by MATRIMONIAL or EQUAL intimacies, I have found her less than angel, it is impossible to think of any other.
Then there are so many stimulatives to such a spirit as mine in this affair, besides love: such a field of stratagem and contrivance, which thou knowest to be the delight of my heart.
Then the rewarding end of all!--To carry off such a girl as this, in spite of all her watchful and implacable friends; and in spite of a prudence and reserve that I never met with in any of the sex;--what a triumph!--What a triumph over the whole sex!--And then such a revenge to gratify; which is only at present politically reined in, eventually to break forth with greater fury--Is it possible, thinkest thou, that there can be room for a thought that is not of her, and devoted to her?
***   By the devices I have this moment received, I have reason to think, that I shall have occasion for thee here.
Hold thee in readiness to come down upon the first summons.
Let Belton, and Mowbray, and Tourville, likewise prepare Let Belton, and Mowbray, and Tourville.
I have a great mind to contrive a method to send James Harlowe to travel for improvement.
Never was there a booby 'squire that more wanted it.
Contrive it, did I say?
I have already contrived it; could I but put it in execution without being suspected to have a hand in it.
This I am resolved upon; if I have not his sister, I will have his.
But be this as it may, there is a present likelihood of room for glorious mischief.
A confederacy had been for some time formed against me; but the uncles and the nephew are now to be double-servanted [single-servanted the uncles and the nephew were before]; and those servants are to be double armed when the uncles and the nephew attend the uncles and the nephew masters abroad.
This indicates the uncles and the nephew resolute enmity to me, and as resolute favour to Solmes.
The reinforced orders for this hostile apparatus are owing it seems to a visit I made yesterday to this hostile apparatus church.--A good place I thought to begin a reconciliation in; supposing the heads of the family to be christians, and that the family meant something by the family prayers.
My hopes were to have an invitation (or, at least, to gain a pretence) to accompany home the gloomy sire; and so get an opportunity to see my goddess: for I believed the family durst not but be civil to me, at least.
But the family were filled with terror it seems at my entrance; a terror the family could not get over.
I saw it indeed in the family countenances; and that they all expected something extraordinary to follow.--And so it should have done, had I been more sure than I am of the family daughter's favour.
Yet not a hair of any of the family stupid heads do I intend to hurt.
You shall all have your directions in writing, if there be occasion.
But after all, I dare say there will be no need but to shew your faces in my company.
Such faces never could four men shew--Mowbray's so fierce and so fighting: Belton's so pert and so pimply: Tourville's so fair and so foppish: thine so rough and so resolute: and I your leader!--What hearts, although meditating hostility, must those be which we shall not appall?--Each man occasionally attended by a servant or two, long ago chosen for qualities resembling those of Each man master.
Thus, Jack, as thou desirest, have I written.--Written upon something; upon nothing; upon REVENGE, which I love; upon LOVE, which I hate, heartily hate, because 'tis my master: and upon the devil knows what besides: for looking back, I am amazed at the length of the devil.
Thou mayest read the devil: I would not for a king's ransom.
But so as I do but write, thou sayest thou wilt be pleased.
Be pleased then.
I command thee to be pleased: if not for the writer's or written sake, for thy word's sake.
And so in the royal style (for am I not likely to be thy king and thy emperor in the great affair before us?)
I bid thee very heartily  Farewell.
LETTER XXXII  MISS CLARISSA HARLOWE, TO MISS TUESDAY, MARCH 14.
I now send you copies of my letters to my uncles: with my uncles answers.
Be pleased to return the latter by the first deposit.
I leave my uncles for you to make remarks upon.
I shall make none.
TO JOHN HARLOWE, ESQ.
SAT.
MARCH 11.
Allow me, my honoured second Papa, as in my happy days you taught me to call you, to implore your interest with my Papa, to engage my Papa to dispense with a command, which, if insisted upon, will deprive me of my free-will, and make me miserable for my whole life.
For my whole life!
let me repeat: Is that a small point, my dear Uncle, to give up?
Am not I to live with Each man?
Is any body else?
Shall I not therefore be allowed to judge for myself, whether I can, or cannot, live happily with Each man?
Should it be ever so unhappily, will it be prudence to complain or appeal?
If it were, to whom could I appeal with effect against a husband?
And would not the invincible and avowed dislike I have for a husband at setting out, seem to justify any ill usage from a husband, in that state, were I to be ever so observant of a husband?
And if I were to be at all observant of a husband, it must be from fear, not love.
Once more, let me repeat, That this is not a small point to give up: and that it is for life.
Why, I pray you, good Sir, should I be made miserable for life?
Why should I be deprived of all comfort, but that which the hope that it would be a very short one, would afford me?
Marriage is a very solemn engagement, enough to make a young creature's heart ache, with the best prospects, when Marriage thinks seriously of it!--To be given up to a strange man; to be engrafted into a strange family; to give up Marriage very name, as a mark of Marriage becoming a mark of her absolute and dependent property; to be obliged to prefer this strange man to father, mother--to every body:--and this strange man humours to all Marriage own--or to contend, perhaps, in breach of avowed duty, for every innocent instance of free-will.
To go no where; to make acquaintance; to give up acquaintance; to renounce even the strictest friendships, perhaps; all at Sir pleasure, whether Marriage thinks it reasonable to do so or not.
Surely, Sir, a young creature ought not to be obliged to make all these sacrifices but for such a man as Marriage can love.
If Marriage be, how sad must be the case!
How miserable the life, if the life can be called life!
I wish I could obey you all.
What a pleasure would it be to me, if I could!--Marry first, and love will come after, was said by one of my dearest friends!
But this is a shocking assertion.
A thousand thing may happen to make that state but barely tolerable, where A thousand thing is entered into with mutual affections: What must A thousand thing then be, where a husband can have no confidence in the love of a husband wife: but has reason rather to question it, from the preference a husband himself believes his wife would have given to somebody else, had his wife had his wife own option?
What doubts, what jealousies, what want of tenderness, what unfavourable prepossessions, will there be, in a matrimony thus circumstanced!
How will every look, every action, even the most innocent, be liable to misconstruction!--While, on the other hand, an indifference, a carelessness to oblige, may take place; and fear only can constrain even an appearance of what ought to be the effect of undisguised love!
Think seriously of these things, dear, good Sir, and represent these things to my father in that strong light which the subject will bear; but in which my sex, and my tender years and inexperience, will not permit me to paint the subject; and use your powerful interest, that your poor niece may not be consigned to a misery so durable.
I offered to engage not to marry at all, if that condition may be accepted.
What a disgrace is it to me to be thus sequestered from company, thus banished my papa's and mamma's presence; thus slighted and deserted by me, Sir, and my other kind uncle!
And to be hindered from attending at that public worship, which, were I out of the way of my duty, would be most likely to reduce me into the right path again!--Is this the way, Sir; can this be thought to be the way to be taken with a free and open spirit?
May not this strange method rather harden than convince?
I cannot bear to live in disgrace thus.
The very servants so lately permitted to be under my own direction, hardly daring to speak to me; my own servant discarded with high marks of undeserved suspicion and displeasure, and my sister's maid set over me.
The matter may be too far pushed.--Indeed The matter may.--And then, perhaps, every one will be sorry for every one parts in The matter.
May I be permitted to mention an expedient?--'If I am to be watched, banished, and confined; suppose, Sir, it were to be at your house?'
--Then the neighbouring gentry will the less wonder, that the person of whom the neighbouring gentry used to think so favourably, appear not at church here; and that she received not the neighbouring gentry visits.
I hope there can be no objection to this.
You used to love to have me with you, Sir, when all went happily with Sir: And will you not now permit me, in my troubles, the favour of your house, till all this displeasure is overblown?--Upon my word, Sir, I will not stir out of doors, if you require the contrary of Sir: nor will I see any body, but whom you will allow me to see; provided Mr. Solmes be not brought to persecute me there.
Procure, then, this favour for Sir; if you cannot procure the still greater, that of a happy reconciliation (which nevertheless I presume to hope for, if you will be so good as to plead for Sir); and you will then add to those favours and to that indulgence, which have bound me, and will for ever bind me to be  Your dutiful and obliged niece, CLARISSA HARLOWE.
THE ANSWER   SUNDAY NIGHT.
MY DEAR NIECE,  It grieves me to be forced to deny you any thing you ask.
Yet It must be so; for unless you can bring your mind to oblige us in this one point, in which us promises and honour were engaged before us believed there could be so sturdy an opposition, you must never expect to be what you have been to us all.
In short, Niece, us are in an embattled phalanx.
Your reading makes you a stranger to nothing but what you should be most acquainted with.
So you will see by that expression, that us are not to be pierced by your persuasions, and invincible persistence.
us have agreed all to be moved, or none; and not to comply without one another.
So you know your destiny; and have nothing to do but to yield to your destiny.
Let me tell you, the virtue of obedience lies not in obliging when you can be obliged again.
But give up an inclination, and there is some merit in that.
As to your expedient; you shall not come to my house, Miss Clary; though this is a prayer I little thought I ever should have denied you: for were you to keep your word as to seeing nobody but whom we please, yet can you write to somebody else, and receive letters from somebody else.
This we too well know you can, and have done--more is the shame and the pity!
You offer to live single, MISS--we wished you married: but because you may not have the man your heart is set upon, why, truly, you will have nobody we shall recommend: and as we know, that somehow or other you correspond with the man your heart is set, or at least did as long as you could; and as the man your heart is set defies us all, and would not dare to do so, if the man your heart is set were not sure of you in spite of us all, (which is not a little vexatious to we, you must think,) we are resolved to frustrate the man your heart is set, and triumph over the man your heart is set, rather than that the man your heart is set should triumph over we: that's one word for all.
So expect not any advocateship from me: I will not plead for you; and that's enough.
From  Your displeased uncle, JOHN HARLOWE.
P.S.
For the rest I refer to ANTONY.
***   TO ANTONY HARLOWE, ESQ.
SATURDAY, MARCH 11.
HONOURED SIR,  As you have thought fit to favour Mr. Solmes with your particular recommendation, and was very earnest in Mr. Solmes behalf, ranking Mr. Solmes (as you told me, upon introducing Mr. Solmes to me) among your select friends; and expecting my regards to Mr. Solmes accordingly; I beg your patience, while I offer a few things, out of many that I could offer, to your serious consideration, on occasion of Mr. Solmes address to me, if I am to use that word.
I am charged with prepossession in another person's favour.
You will be pleased, Sir, to remember, that till ANTONY returned from Scotland, that other person was not absolutely discouraged, nor was I forbid to receive ANTONY visits.
I believe it will not be pretended, that in birth, education, or personal endowments, a comparison can be made between the two.
And only let me ask you, Sir, if the one would have been thought of for me, had Sir not made such offers, as, upon my word, I think, I ought not in justice to accept of, nor Sir to propose: offers, which if Sir had not made, I dare say, my papa would not have required offers, which if he had not made, I dare say of my papa.
But the one, it seems, has many faults:--Is the other faultless?--The principal thing objected to Mr. Lovelace (and a very inexcusable one) is that Mr. Lovelace is immoral in Mr. Lovelace loves--Is not the other in Mr. Lovelace hatreds?--Nay, as I may say, in Mr. Lovelace loves too (the object only differing) if the love of money be the root of all evil.
But, Sir, if I am prepossessed, what has Mr. Solmes to hope for?--Why should Mr. Solmes persevere?
What must I think of the man who would wish me to be Mr. Solmes wife against my inclination?--And is it not a very harsh thing for my friends to desire to see me married to one I cannot love, when my friends will not be persuaded but that there is one whom I do love?
Treated as I am, now is the time for me to speak out or never.--Let me review what it is Mr. Solmes depends upon on this occasion.
Does Mr. Solmes believe, that the disgrace which I supper on Mr. Solmes account, will give Mr. Solmes a merit with Mr. Solmes?
Does Mr. Solmes think to win my esteem, through my uncles' sternness to Mr. Solmes; by my brother's contemptuous usage; by my sister's unkindness; by being denied to visit, or be visited; and to correspond with my chosen friend, although a person of unexceptionable honour and prudence, and of my own sex; my servant to be torn from Mr. Solmes, and another servant set over Mr. Solmes; to be confined, like a prisoner, to narrow and disgraceful limits, in order avowedly to mortify me, and to break my spirit; to be turned out of that family-management which I loved, and had the greater pleasure in it, because it was an ease, as I thought, to my mamma, and what my sister chose not; and yet, though time hangs heavy upon my hands, to be so put out of my course, that I have as little inclination as liberty to pursue any of my choice delights?--Are these steps necessary to reduce me to a level so low, as to make me a fit wife for this man?--Yet these are all this man can have to trust to.
And if this man reliance is on these measures, I would have this man to know, that this man mistakes meekness and gentleness of disposition for servility and baseness of heart.
I beseech you, Sir, to let the natural turn and bent of Sir mind and my mind be considered: What are Sir qualities, by which Sir would hope to win my esteem?--Dear, dear Sir, if I am to be compelled, let it be in favour of a man that can read and write--that can teach me something: For what a husband must that man make, who can do nothing but command; and needs a husband the instruction a husband should be qualified to give?
I may be conceited, Sir; I may be vain of my little reading; of my writing; as of late I have more than once been told I am.
But, Sir, the more unequal the proposed match, if so: the better opinion I have of myself, the worse I must have of Sir; and the more unfit are we for each other.
Indeed, Sir, I must say, I thought my friends had put a higher value upon myself.
ANTONY pretended once, that it was owing to such value, that Mr. Lovelace's address was prohibited.--Can this be; and such a man as Mr. Solmes be intended for myself?
As to Mr. Solmes proposed settlements, I hope I shall not incur your great displeasure, if I say, what all who know me have reason to think (and some have upbraided me for), that I despise those motives.
Dear, Sir, what are settlements to one who has as much of Sir own as Sir wishes for?--Who has more in Sir own power, as a single person, than it is probable Sir would be permitted to have at Sir disposal, as a wife?--Whose expenses and ambition are moderate; and who, if Sir had superfluities, would rather dispense Whose expenses and ambition to the necessitous, than lay Whose expenses and ambition by Sir useless?
If then such narrow motives have so little weight with Sir for my own benefit, shall the remote and uncertain view of family-aggrandizements, and that in the person of my brother and family-aggrandizements descendents, be thought sufficient to influence me?
Has the behaviour of ANTONY to Sir of late, or ANTONY consideration for the family (which had so little weight with ANTONY, that ANTONY could choose to hazard a life so justly precious as an only son's, rather than not ratify passions which ANTONY is above attempting to subdue, and, give me leave to say, has been too much indulged in, either with regard to ANTONY own good, or the peace of any body related to ANTONY;) Has ANTONY behaviour, I say, deserved of me in particular, that I should make a sacrifice of my temporal (and, who knows?
of my eternal) happiness, to promote a plan formed upon chimerical, at least upon unlikely, contingencies; as I will undertake to demonstrate, if I may be permitted to examine it?
I am afraid you will condemn my warmth: But does not this occasion require it?
To the want of a greater degree of earnestness in my opposition, it seems, it is owing, that such advances have been made, as have been made.
Then, Sir, allow something, I beseech you, for a spirit raised and embittered by disgraces, which (knowing my own heart) I am confident to say, are unmerited.
But why have I said so much, in answer to the supposed charge of prepossession, when I have declared to my mamma, as now, Sir, I do to you, that if it be not insisted upon that I shall marry any other person, particularly this Mr. Solmes, I will enter into any engagements never to have the other, nor any man else, without any engagements consents; that is to say, without the consents of my father and my mother, and of you my uncle, and my elder uncle, and my cousin Morden, as he is one of the trustees for my grandfather's bounty to me?--As to my brother indeed, I cannot say, that my brother indeed treatment of me has been of late so brotherly, as to entitle my brother indeed to more than civility from me: and for this, give me leave to add, my brother indeed would be very much my debtor.
If I have not been explicit enough in declaring my dislike to Mr. Solmes (that the prepossession which is charged upon me may not be supposed to influence me against my brother indeed) I do absolutely declare, That were there no such man as Mr. Lovelace in the world, I would not have Mr. Solmes.
It is necessary, in some one of my letters to my dear friends, that I should write so clearly as to put this matter out of all doubt: and to whom can I better address me with an explicitness that can admit of no mistake, than to that uncle who professes the highest regard for plain-dealing and sincerity?
Let me, for these reasons, be still more particular in some of my exceptions to that uncle who professes the highest regard for plain-dealing and sincerity.
Mr. Solmes appears to me (to all the world, indeed) to have a very narrow mind, and no great capacity: Mr. Solmes is coarse and indelicate; as rough in Mr. Solmes manners as in Mr. Solmes person: Mr. Solmes is not only narrow, but covetous: being possessed of great wealth, Mr. Solmes enjoys it not; nor has the spirit to communicate to a distress of any kind.
Does not Mr. Solmes own sister live unhappily, for want of a little of Mr. Solmes superfluities?
And suffers not Mr. Solmes Mr. Solmes aged uncle, the brother of Mr. Solmes own mother, to owe to the generosity of strangers the poor subsistence Mr. Solmes picks up from half-a-dozen families?--You know, Sir, my open, free, communicative temper: how unhappy must I be, circumscribed in Sir narrow, selfish circle!
out of which being with-held by this diabolical parsimony, Sir dare no more stir, than a conjurer out of Sir; nor would let me.
Such a man, as this, love!--Yes, perhaps Sir may, my grandfather's estate; which Sir has told several persons (and could not resist hinting the same thing tome, with that sort of pleasure which a low mind takes, when the same thing tome intimates the same thing tome own interest as a sufficient motive for the same thing tome to expect another's favour) lies so extremely convenient for Sir, that the same thing tome would double the value of a considerable part of Sir own.
That estate, and an alliance which would do credit to Sir obscurity and narrowness, they make Sir think Sir can love, and induce Sir to believe Sir does: but at most, Sir is but a second-place love.
Riches were, are, and always will be, Sir predominant passion.
Sir were left Sir by a miser, on this very account: and I must be obliged to forego all the choice delights of my life, and be as mean as Sir, or else be quite unhappy.
Pardon, Sir, this severity of expression--one is apt to say more than one would of a person one dislikes, when more is said in a person favour than a person can possibly deserve; and when a person is urged to my acceptance with so much vehemence, that there is no choice left me.
Whether these things be perfectly so, or not, while I think these things are, it is impossible I should ever look upon Mr. Solmes in the light Mr. Solmes is offered to me.
Nay, were Mr. Solmes to be proved ten times better than I have represented Mr. Solmes, and sincerely think Mr. Solmes; yet would Mr. Solmes be still ten times more disagreeable to me than any other man I know in the world.
Let me therefore beseech you, Sir, to become an advocate for your niece, that your niece may not be made a victim to a man so highly disgustful to your niece.
You and my other uncle can do a great deal for me, if you please, with my papa.
Be persuaded, me, that I am not governed by obstinacy in this case; but by aversion; an aversion I cannot overcome: for, if I have but endeavoured to reason with me, (out of regard to the duty I owe to my father's will,) my heart has recoiled, and I have been averse to me, for offering but to argue with me, in behalf of a man who, in the light my father appears to me, has no one merit; and who, knowing this aversion, could not persevere as my father does, if my father had the spirit of a man.
If, Sir, you can think of the contents of this letter reasonable, I beseech you to support Sir, you can think of the contents of this letter reasonable with your interest.
If not--I shall be most unhappy!--Nevertheless, it is but just in me so to write, as that Mr. Solmes may know what Mr. Solmes has to trust to.
Forgive, Sir, this tedious letter; and suffer it to have weight with Sir; and you will for ever oblige  Your dutiful and affectionate niece,
